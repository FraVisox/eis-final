The prime minister announced a review of the contract to build the Somerset reactor in July, amid concerns about the costs and the potential security impact of Chinese involvement. May and Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, are thought to be hoping to persuade the contractors involved – the French utility company EDF and the Chinese state-backed firm CGN – to renegotiate the contract that specifies a generous minimum price for the electricity the project will generate. The National Audit Office warned in July that Hinkley Point C could cost energy consumers £30bn in top-up payments because of falling wholesale electricity prices. Under the terms of the subsidy scheme, the British consumer would compensate EDF for lower wholesale electricity prices over Hinley’s 35-year lifetime, an arrangement that has appeared increasingly poor value as energy costs have plummeted with the declining oil price. George Osborne, who was sacked as chancellor by May in one of her first acts as prime minister, had been determined to press ahead with Hinkley as part of his attempt to create a “golden decade” of relations with Beijing. But May’s joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, had previously expressed doubts about the security implications of allowing China to be involved in such a key piece of national infrastructure and Clark is said by Whitehall insiders to have raised concerns about whether the deal represented value for money. Downing Street sources insisted on Wednesday that no formal decision had been made, but May’s spokesperson has said an announcement would come in September. Thursday is the last possible day for a statement to parliament before the House of Commons goes into recess so that MPs can attend the autumn party conferences. Since the summer, No 10 has sought assurances about the security risks of Hinkley and examined the idea of separating the project from a second reactor at Bradwell, in Essex, which the Chinese hope to build independently. Clark told the House of Commons on Tuesday: “We are looking at all components of the deal and will make our decision before the end of the month,” adding that the government saw “new nuclear” as “an important part of a diverse energy mix that gives resilience to UK consumers”. Hinkley would be the first new nuclear reactor built in Britain in two decades. The shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, said he would welcome a decision to give Hinkley the go-ahead, saying: “If the secretary of state has now managed to reduce the cost to British bill payers, in line with my suggestions, I promise not to gloat. I will simply say well done for sticking up for the consumer. “But in return, the government must stop the dithering. Their delay has put at risk £18bn of investment and jeopardised 25,000 skilled jobs in the nuclear industry, which are essential for the UK’s balanced energy portfolio.” However, environmentalists are likely to condemn the decision. The Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: “Instead of investing in this eye-wateringly expensive white elephant, the government should be doing all it can to support offshore wind, energy efficiency and innovative new technologies such as energy storage.” May has come under pressure from the Chinese government to approve the project, with Beijing’s ambassador to London warning that it could affect diplomatic relations between the two countries. Beijing was incensed by suggestions that UK ministers were unhappy about the national security implications of giving a Chinese company access to Britain’s national energy infrastructure. In a prominent opinion piece published in the state-run China Daily newspaper before May’s arrival for the G20 summit, China’s ambassador to London urged her to make “wise strategic choices” over Britain’s future relationship with Beijing. Senior military and intelligence figures had warned that plans to give China a big stake in Britain’s nuclear power industry posed a threat to national security. Critics have said the US would never allow China to work inside its national infrastructure, giving it the opportunity to sabotage energy supplies. The proposed scheme in Somerset to build two reactors capable of providing 7% of Britain’s total electricity needs has been hit by continual delays due to concerns inside EDF about the financial burden to the already heavily indebted energy company. The nominal cost of construction is £18bn, according to EDF. Beijing only agreed to fund 30% of the project on condition it would be allowed to showcase its nuclear prowess by building a Chinese-designed reactor at Bradwell in Essex. Beijing was therefore incensed by suggestions May might approve Hinkley but reserve judgment on Bradwell. The Chinese were brought on board as part of Osborne’s effort to forge closer ties with Beijing but also because of doubts about EDF’s ability to carry out the project. Hinkley is scheduled for completion by 2025, but many regard that timetable as unrealistic because reactors of the same design being built by EDF in Finland and France are running years behind schedule."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/are-the-two-mexican-earthquakes-connected-and-are-more-on-the-way","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T07:57:40Z","webTitle":"Are the two Mexican earthquakes connected – and are more on the way?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/are-the-two-mexican-earthquakes-connected-and-are-more-on-the-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/are-the-two-mexican-earthquakes-connected-and-are-more-on-the-way","fields":{"headline":"Are the two Mexican earthquakes connected – and are more on the way?","bodyText":"Mexico has been hit by its second deadly earthquake in less than two weeks. Are the two seismic events in Mexico related, and could they indicate more tremors are on the way? Two days after the second earthquake in Mexico, large quakes struck the Pacific island of Vanuatu and off the north-east coast of Japan. Both Mexican quakes occurred on the Cocos tectonic plate, which runs along the western coast of Mexico, and is sliding beneath the neighbouring North American tectonic plate to the north-east at a rate of about three inches per year. The 7.1 magnitude quake, which struck shortly after 1pm local time on Tuesday, occurred 120km south-east of Mexico City. This came just 11 days after a magnitude 8.1 quake off the coast of southern Mexico. In each case, the tremors originated from within the Cocos plate, deep beneath the surface, rather than being caused by friction at the interface. Tuesday’s quake occurred at 50km depth and the earlier quake was even deeper, at 70km. As the Cocos plate is forced downwards, it deforms – causing the structure to kink and crumple. But this process is not smooth and incremental. Instead, stress builds up inside the plate over months or years until a threshold is reached and it is suddenly released in a giant tremor. “What happened yesterday was most likely a tearing motion in the subducting Cocos plate,” says Prof David Rothery of the Open University. A similar mechanism is thought to be responsible for the earlier recent quake, but seismologists do not think that one led to the other. Stephen Hicks, of the University of Southampton, said: “It’s quite a long way for them to be directly linked. It might have slightly increased the stress, but if it did it’s a tiny amount and the fault must have been close to rupturing anyway.” Experts have dismissed the possibility of any causal relationship between the Mexico quakes and those in other locations along the seismically active Pacific “ring of fire”. A 6.4 magnitude quake struck Vanuatu’s Erromango island early on Thursday local time, but caused no damage, according to the US Geological Survey and local authorities. Hours earlier, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake was recorded 283 kilometres off the coast of north-east Japan, the same region that was devastated by a tsunami following a 9.0 magnitude quake in March 2011. The disaster killed more than 18,500 people and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. But Hongfeng Yang, an assistant professor in the Earth System Sciences Programme at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the fact that this week’s three big quakes had all occurred within such a short timeframe was a coincidence. “They are really far away from each other so that physical mechanisms to link them together are weak,” Yang told the Guardian. “There is a chance, however, to trigger distant earthquakes by seismic waves generated by prior earthquakes located far away. But the likelihood of that triggering earthquakes larger than magnitude 5 is nearly zero.” Mexico City is particularly vulnerable because it sits on an ancient lake bed that is filled with deep layers of sediment, which can magnify the shaking. “Once the seismic wave enters that bowl, it reverberates around,” said Hicks. “It behaves like a bowl of jelly.” Unlike some natural disasters, scientists have yet to devise a reliable way to predict when earthquakes will occur. However, planning for the worst can hugely reduce the devastation caused and death toll of future quakes. The most recent quakes in Mexico will, once again, raise questions about whether the appropriate building codes were adhered to. “The Enrique Rébsamen elementary school where many children died looks like a modern building, and ought to have had inbuilt earthquake resilience,” said Rothery. “Had it been properly constructed it should not have collapsed, and I expect questions will be asked”. • This article was amended on 21 September 2017. An earlier version said the 7.1 magnitude quake hit shortly after 6pm local time. This has been corrected to 1pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/blog/2018/jan/11/will-we-be-ready-to-put-a-human-footprint-on-mars-in-15-years","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T06:30:13Z","webTitle":"Will we be ready to put a human footprint on Mars in 15 years?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/jan/11/will-we-be-ready-to-put-a-human-footprint-on-mars-in-15-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2018/jan/11/will-we-be-ready-to-put-a-human-footprint-on-mars-in-15-years","fields":{"headline":"Will we be ready to put a human footprint on Mars in 15 years?","bodyText":"If you ever wanted to visit Mars, 2018 would be a really great time to go. In July this year, the Earth and Mars will come closer than at any other point in the last 15 years. They will be in perihelic opposition, meaning Mars will reach the nearest point in its elliptical orbit while the Earth simultaneously passes directly between Mars and the sun. Separated by 35m miles – immense by Earthly standards, modest on the scale of interplanetary travel – one could, in theory, make the one-way journey in a little over 200 days (compared to 250 days when the planets are further apart). Unfortunately, we are not ready to send humans to Mars in 2018. Dennis Tito’s Inspiration Mars project at one time chose 2018 as the year to send a married couple on a “fly-by” around Mars, but the challenges proved too great and the mission was cancelled. We have made tremendous strides over recent years with rovers and robots. But there is much we still need to understand about getting people to Mars safely and affordably. Yet the clock keeps ticking. In 15 years’ time, when the Earth and Mars will once again be tantalisingly close, Nasa intends to land its first manned mission on Mars. SpaceX has an even more ambitious target date of 2024. So the question is: will we be ready? If we are going to put a human footprint on Mars in the next 15 years, we will need to address three big challenges: rockets, restlessness and radiation. Here is a brief summary of the issues, and the plans for this year and beyond to mitigate them. Rockets What’s the issue? Getting humans to Mars is expensive. With current technologies, a return mission could cost anywhere between $100B-$500bn. Is that with or without an in-flight meal? Even if you skip the peanuts, the only way to truly bring these costs down and change the economics of Mars is to build reusable rockets. Is that possible? SpaceX’s Elon Musk believes so. They have already demonstrated the launch and landing of the Falcon 9. And this year, they are planning the first test flight of the Falcon Heavy. If successful, this will be a critical step towards demonstrating SpaceX’s ability to send spacecraft beyond Earth’s orbit. And what comes next? SpaceX eventually plans to replace its current fleet with a single one-size-fits-all rocket, called the BFR, capable of carrying 100 people and a payload of 150,000kg. I’m guessing B is for Big, R is for Rocket, F is for...? You figure it out. The critical thing to know is that the BFR’s parts would be mostly reusable, thus dramatically reducing costs. Sounds great. When do we leave? Two BFR cargo missions are planned for 2022, followed by a further two cargo and two crew missions as early as 2024. So, do you think we will we be ready in 15 years? Yes almost certainly. SpaceX’s timelines may slip. But based on Musk’s track record, things are looking good. Restlessness What’s the issue? The journey to Mars will be very boring. That was never an issue on Star Trek. How come? Long periods with no stimulation, staring into the black vastness of space, can lead to depression and attention deficits. OK but they are astronauts. They can deal with this, right? You’re right. Astronauts go through intensive psychological tests. But no mission in history has posed the boredom challenges of a Mars mission. So what do we do about this? There’s a lot we can learn on Earth. One example is the Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) project which has been running for the last five years. It places groups of “astronauts” for up to eight months in isolation on the side of a volcano. The goal is to mimic the conditions of life on Mars and in doing do better understand the psychological effects. And what have we learned? One of the best ways to deal with boredom is keeping busy. During the simulations in Hawaii, the participants’ schedules were packed with work from sundown to sunrise. Later this year, another group will take part and we will learn even more. All work and no play ... Elon Musk believes that for people to actually want to go to Mars, the journey has to be fun. That is why plans for the BFR crew compartments include zero-gravity games, movies, lecture halls, cabins, and a restaurant, Musk believes passengers “are going to have a great time!” So, will we be ready in 15 years? There will be no way to truly know until we do it. But there are positive signs. Radiation What’s the issue? Dangerous cosmic and solar radiation that can cause impaired vision, dementia and cancer. Should I pack the SPF50? Beyond the protection of the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field, that won’t help. A one way trip to Mars would expose you to more than 15 times an annual radiation limit for a worker in a nuclear power plant. What would it take to protect astronauts? There are options for shielding, such as a thicker hulls or water-jacketing. But these could still easily be penetrated by any high-powered rays. And I bet shielding is not cheap. Correct. Shielding increases mass, which increases fuel consumption, which increases the cost of any mission. So how do we deal with it? Over the next ten years the priority will be research. Data from the International Space Station, The Mars Science Laboratory and even Voyager 1 is already helping us paint a more detailed picture of ‘space weather’ which will allow better planning and timing of missions. Is there anything happening in 2018? In May, Nasa will be launching the long-anticipated Mars InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) spacecraft. Landing in late November, its primary mission will be to understand seismic activity on Mars, but the lander’s onboard magnetometer will also examine the behaviour of radiation from the solar wind on the surface of Mars. And what about longer term? Ultimately, the best solution may be to just get to Mars faster - and in doing so minimise exposure time - but this would mean faster rockets. So, will we be ready in 15 years? Uncertain. Radiation arguably represents our greatest threat. Clearly, the challenges in sending humans to Mars are immense. But so too are the opportunities, and I remain optimistic that we will see a human footprint on Mars in the next 15 years.

Emmanuel Macron told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We back Hinkley Point project, it’s very important for France, it’s very important for the nuclear sector and [state-owned utility company] EDF. “Now we have to finalise the work, and especially the technical and industrial work, very closely with EDF, with the British government, to be in a situation to sign in the coming week or month.” Pressed on whether he thought the deal would go ahead, Macron added: “That’s my view, and that’s our perspective, because I think it’s very important for our commitment to nuclear energy.” Earlier this month, the French energy minister, Ségolène Royal, said that a postponement of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project was still under discussion. Macron’s views also appeared at odds with the message that EDF unions took after meeting him last week, when he reportedly said he had not yet decided whether to go ahead with the nuclear plant and that a final investment decision would be taken by early May. The project was announced in October 2013 but a final investment decision has been delayed as EDF struggles to find partners and financing. Chinese utility CGN signed up for a one-third stake last October, leaving EDF to fund the rest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jul/18/readers-panel-us-voters-react-to-trumps-conference-with-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-18T14:42:24Z","webTitle":"'Nothing short of treason': US voters on the Trump-Putin summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/18/readers-panel-us-voters-react-to-trumps-conference-with-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jul/18/readers-panel-us-voters-react-to-trumps-conference-with-putin","fields":{"headline":"'Nothing short of treason': US voters on the Trump-Putin summit","bodyText":"We asked US voters to tell us how they viewed Monday’s meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Hundreds got in touch to share their views. Many voiced their concerns about Trump’s undermining of the FBI and the US intelligence services, which he later retracted. Others reacted more positively to the meeting and felt that improving relations with Russia would help global stability. Here are a range of your views. ‘A real American president would be worried’ Mary, 53, writer, Ohio “Trump betrayed his oath of office by full-throatedly endorsing Putin’s denial of meddling over US intelligence services’ unanimous agreement that Russia did interfere in our elections. Trump has consistently refused to call out Russia or Putin on anything. He has advocated for Russia while attacking our allies. I find that suspect, to say the least, and I am embarrassed and worried about the future of my country. I feel Putin has inordinate amounts of influence over Trump. Trump has expressed a near-idolatry of Putin since before the election, and it has only gotten worse. A real American president would be worried about election interference, but Trump consistently brushes it aside as if it were no more than a persistent wasp. Our system of checks and balances is not working. The GOP must recognize that Donald Trump is not a leader to be trusted. This is no longer politics as usual. It is well past time for the GOP to put country before party.” ‘I thought he could go no lower’ Kevin, 62, retired US army, Sacramento “As a US army veteran of the cold war, I view his statements as giving ‘aid and comfort’ to Putin. After two years of hearing his daily lies and reading his ego-driven Twitter posts; of seeing the harm he is doing to the long-term health of the country; and of seeing him repeatedly turn on our friends and treat enemies of freedom as ‘friends’ I thought he could go no lower. But watching him stand by Putin and attack our intel community, FBI, and basically say Putin is to be believed is nothing short of treason. It is important that the US has talks, has fair trade, and works with the Russian government on many fronts but never at the expense of our values or the expense of our allies. (There is much we, the Russians, and others should be working on together – global warming, reducing the threat of nukes, terrorism, etc.) On a personal level, my girlfriend is Russian, and I would love our nations to get along so she and I can visit family and friends without the politics and actions of either nation clouding the waters.” ‘It’s important to have a good relationship with Russia’ James, 49, government employee, Mexico “I think it was a great job on Trump’s part. The fear-mongering on Russia has reached a ridiculous level in the US and would not be possible if the American public were more educated and aware when it came to history, world events and foreign policy. We meddle in elections, too, and have actually overthrown many governments outright. The only reason to vilify Russia is to energize the military-industrial complex and for impractical liberal and pro-LGBT ideology that most Americans don’t buy into. It’s very important to have a good relationship with Russia because they they are a Christian nation and can serve as a counterweight to the nihilist secularism in the west.” ‘I do not agree with the US increasing tension with Russia’ Ricky, 48, security worker, British Columbia “Isis was a very large threat and Russia for some reason had to take the lead on that fight because unfortunately the US cut back. I do not agree with the US and Nato increasing tension with Russia militarily, economically yes, but not militarily at this stage. The increased tension Obama had with Putin put the whole world in danger. I don’t believe Putin has undue influence over Trump; two very large players have to jockey for position and it’s not about making the media happy to be adverse to a world leader just to look good for that days optics.” ‘Trump is profoundly unprepared’ Carl, 37, nuclear engineer, Albuquerque “The Helsinki summit with Putin, and the Singapore summit with North Korea’s Kim, have made it clear that Trump is profoundly unprepared, unqualified, and unmotivated to represent US interests, and his personality defects are a gaping national security breach that is being exploited by adversaries. It is extremely important that Russia and the United States cooperate on nuclear weapons issues in order to prevent re-emergence of an arms race, reduce fissile material inventories, maintain confidence in existing bilateral treaties relating to weapons development and testing, and strengthen the backbone of the NPT among emerging nuclear powers throughout the world. The US-Russia relationship in this area must be based on mutual respect, and concrete and verifiable commitments. A ‘good relationship’ is not defined by personal chemistry between Trump and Putin.” ‘The focus should have been on larger issues’ Jack, 21, college student, Philadelphia “I thought, at first, that a meeting would be constructive. There are a lot of unresolved issues between the US and Russia that could very easily boil over into something greater. We both have troops who are fighting in close proximity to another in Syria, and we’re both financing and supporting opposite sides of a war in Ukraine. As the headlines came out though, I was (unsurprisingly) disappointed in how the meeting went. The focus should have been on larger issues between each country, but instead they talked about the Russia investigation again, and glossed over everything else that was important. I feel like there is a difference between a ‘good’ relationship and a ‘civil’ relationship. While I don’t want to see our president talking about the Russian president like they were college roommates, I would like to see the US and Russia get along on a broader level. There should be open channels of communication and mutual understandings between one another, but not this open sense of fraternity that Trump is shooting for.” ‘He has been tougher on Russia than any other president’ Diane, 57, customer service rep, Texas “I think the mass hysteria is laughable. He [Trump] has his reasons for not publicly calling out Putin. He is trying to work with this adversary for the better good of our country. He always puts our country first. He is not a seasoned politician so he doesn’t always state things in the right way. My question would be where are his communication team? They could have conveyed how he could state his case maybe in a better way. Maybe he just doesn’t listen to them? He has been tougher on Russia then any other president, especially Obama. Look at his actions not his words. It is very important that Trump has a good relationship with Russia. Same with Kim Jong-un. It is false outrage on the left. They just do not want him to succeed” ‘It made me feel like vomiting in my sleeve’ John, 69, former chair of a Republican congressional district committee, western Michigan “I’m very disturbed – both by the summit (the secrecy of the meeting, and the press conference following), and the way some members of my party reacted, and how the rightwing media in the USA covered it. The USA has fewer than 5% of the inhabitants of the planet. At the end of December, 1986, our share of gross global production was 30.06%. At the end of December 2016, it was 24.55%. In 30 years, this represents a serious decline in our “place” as the world’s dominant country. We need to get along with our natural friends – the liberal democracies of the world, not those who are our real foes. The idea that Trump would call the European Union a foe, and would cotton-up to dictators such as Putin and Kim make me feel like vomiting in my sleeve.” ‘I haven’t trusted our intelligence agencies since 2003’ Ryan, 33, medical student, Missouri “I think the meeting went well. It is important for our leader to build bridges with other nations and de-escalate warmongering rhetoric that serves to create the pretext to serious, potentially deadly, conflict. I haven’t trusted our intelligence agencies since 2003 when they lied to the world about Iraq and more importantly to the American people in order to manipulate us into supporting military intervention in the Middle East. My generation, friends and family, fought and died for a cause based on lies generated by the intelligence agencies and the MSM [mainstream media]. It’s rather important to build and maintain good relationships with Russia, China, France, India, Pakistan and every other nuclear power. Not only because they are nuclear powers but because the alternative increases the probability of disastrous consequences. Returning to the cold war atmosphere post-world war two would be an alternative that serves only those who benefit from military conflict and escalation.” ‘The American system is in danger’ James, 71, emeritus professor, Washington D.C “It is important that the relationship between Russia and America be good enough to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. How much better it can be beyond that is hard to say because the next most urgent priority is to guarantee that Russian efforts to disrupt democratic institutions all over the world be thwarted. The real problem is that the Republican party, in its entirety, was hijacked in 2016 by rightwing extremists of the most vile kind, and the American constitutional system of government is now in more danger than it has been since the outbreak of the civil war. Looking at the situation more philosophically, Marx got it wrong and Karl Polanyi got it right. When the middle class gets squeezed and the lower class gets exploited by gratuitous excesses of laissez-faire capitalism, they are far less likely to stage a socialist revolution than to turn to a fascist demagogue like Trump or Putin.” ‘One of very few potentially good things Trump has done’ Hendrik, 69, economist, Massachussetts “I think the meeting is one of the very few potentially good things Trump has done. The push to restart some kind of cold war needs to be strongly resisted, and that implies talking to and engaging Russia. I in no way support Trump, and I do not trust anything he says, but I do find it amazing how the anti-Trump hysteria has led progressives in the US to take the side of the usual warmongers, imperialists, and pro-military politicians. Especially worrisome is the sudden praise and embrace by Trump critics of agencies like the CIA and FBI, which actively interfere in every political system around the globe and have always lied to us as a matter of course. The collective hysteria and stupidity of American society is clearly on display. How will we ever deal with any complex issues in such an immature political environment?” ‘Blatant disrespect for American institutions’ Leslie, 24, law graduate, New York “On one hand, I was not surprised; in fact, I expected the press conference to be full of praise for Putin, taunts about ‘FAKE NEWS,’ and rebukes of US intelligence. However, the mere thought of not being alarmed when these expectations were proven right is in itself worrying. More importantly, it is concerning that the din of condemnation for Mr Trump and his comments on the world stage is not deafening. Some Congressional Republicans have criticized Trump; some have merely said that Russia is not an ally; others are silent. The end result is a mix of exasperation that Mr Trump is as inept as I had believed, of abject disappointment that one half of Congress will give him free reign, and of anger that this type of performance is not only tolerable but even allowed to have progressed to this level of blatant disrespect for American institutions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/mar/25/belgium-steps-up-security-at-nuclear-sites-in-wake-of-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-25T14:13:32Z","webTitle":"Belgium steps up security at nuclear sites in wake of attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/25/belgium-steps-up-security-at-nuclear-sites-in-wake-of-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/mar/25/belgium-steps-up-security-at-nuclear-sites-in-wake-of-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Belgium steps up security at nuclear sites in wake of attacks","bodyText":"Belgian authorities have stepped up security at nuclear sites but safety officials said there was no concrete element to suggest a specific threat against the country’s reactors or plants. Secret video footage of a senior Belgian nuclear official was found in November at the home of a Belgian man, Mohamed Bakkali, suspected to be part of the logistics network for November’s Paris attacks that killed 130 people. The 10-hour video, shot by a hidden camera in a bush, showed a senior nuclear official coming and going out of his home in the Flanders region. Belgian investigators have not said whether the video suggested any specific threat to an individual or to a nuclear site. The inquiry is ongoing. Bakkali has been in prison since his arrest in November and investigators are looking at whether he had links to the Bakraoui brothers who blew themselves up in this week’s suicide-bomb attacks on a Brussels airport and metro station which killed 31 people. “There is no element today that suggests a concrete threat to nuclear sites,” a spokesman for Belgium’s Federal Agency for Nuclear Control told the Guardian. He said safety precautions had been put in place in recent months because “we can’t ignore the terrorist threat”. Four access passes authorising people to enter Belgian nuclear sites were revoked from workers with access to the Tihange nuclear power station in Huy last week. But this was before the 22 March attacks on Brussels airport and metro, and was part of a routine and ongoing monitoring of staff, not linked to the terrorist threat, the agency said. After Tuesday’s attacks, the nation was put on high alert. All non-essential staff were sent home from nuclear plants at Tihange and Doel and military presence was increased at the sites. Earlier this month, the government had deployed 140 soldiers to guard nuclear sites. About 60% of Belgium’s electricity comes from seven reactors at Tihange and Doel plants. Doel, in eastern Flanders, is situated in the most densely populated area of any power station in Europe. Since last year’s attacks on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket in Paris, increased security measures have been in place around nuclear sites Belgium and France. In France, where nuclear protection had been stepped up after the 9/11 attacks in the US, more than 80% of electricity is generated by the country’s 58 nuclear reactors – the world’s highest ratio. About 630,000 people in France are thought to living within six-miles of a nuclear site. Increased safety procedures in Belgium include system controls, screening who has access to the site, and strengthening the security in and around the site. Belgian police are continuing to investigate a mysterious case of sabotage at part of the Doel power station in 2014. No explanation for the sabotage has yet been put forward. In 2014, Belgian media reported that Ilyas Boughalab, 26, who was tried in absentia for his part in a “jihadi” recruitment network in Antwerp, had worked for three years as a technician for a sub-contractor with access to some areas the Doel nuclear plant. He died in Syria after leaving in 2012."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2019/apr/16/federal-election-2019-tax-health-labor-liberal-coalition-morrison-shorten-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-16T08:11:18Z","webTitle":"Election 2019: Peter Dutton apologises to Labor rival in radio face-off – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/apr/16/federal-election-2019-tax-health-labor-liberal-coalition-morrison-shorten-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2019/apr/16/federal-election-2019-tax-health-labor-liberal-coalition-morrison-shorten-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Election 2019: Peter Dutton apologises to Labor rival in radio face-off – as it happened","bodyText":"Bill Shorten is on his way to Perth, while Scott Morrison is still in Victoria, as far as we can tell. So with the campaigns powering down for the day, we might too. We would imagine that after two full days in Victoria, the Liberal campaign will be headed somewhere new tomorrow, but who knows. This whole campaign has the feeling of revving in second gear, while the parties wait for the holiday period to be over and for people to start paying attention again. That’ll be after Anzac Day, so you’ve got quite a few more days of this weird stop start pace. It’s the campaign equivalent of Wet n Wild’s Calypso Beach attraction, which involves sitting in a tube and floating around in circles, getting occasionally tipped over by teenagers who are racing each other to nowhere. Or maybe that’s just my Gold Coast showing. Either way, tomorrow will be more of the same. Labor will most likely have more on health. In the state campaigns, they like to do it in weeks. So health week. Followed by infrastructure/climate/insert policy here week. You get the idea. So far, this campaign seems to be following that same pattern. They’ll also, no doubt, have more to say on the Grattan Institute analysis on the government’s tax plan, which Morrison has already rejected as “absolute rubbish”. On the government side, I think we can expect to hear a lot more about Shorten’s answer to the superannuation policy. He neglected to mention Labor’s plan, and Labor says that’s because the policy has stood for so long, he was responding to whether there were any more changes coming. Just don’t expect anything new, is what I’m saying. I’ll be back tomorrow, reading, watching and listening to everything so you don’t have to. And also because that’s my job and I need to pay my bills. A big thank you to everyone who contributed today, and to all of you for following along with us. We’ll be back tomorrow morning. In the meantime, take care of you. Ali France responded to Peter Dutton’s accusation about her in that answer: I’ll quote Michelle Obama: when they go low, you go high. But I have never said that I am ashamed to be Australian. I shared an article, in which somebody in New York wrote an article talking about their experience. I didn’t say I was ashamed to be Australian, I have represented Australia twice in sport, I’ve won three gold medals. When I have stood on that podium, singing the national anthem, I couldn’t be prouder. I am a really proud Australian and I think it’s really, really unfair to be saying that, but anyway. The debate between Peter Dutton and Ali France finishes with a question about Larissa Waters’ comments on The Bad Show overnight during an exchange with James McGrath: As long as you share our values – and one of our values is its inclusivity, and we’re colour blind when it comes to the colour of your own skin … And I’m sure the Greens and I hope Labor would agree with that.” “I’m not sure Peter Dutton would,” Waters retorted. “I beg your pardon. Are you serious?” McGrath said. Dutton: When you have a look at the comments, it wasn’t just me, it was the whole government, that was her point. So why doesn’t she like me and why doesn’t she believe that to be the case? Because of our border protection policies. Now, Ali has said before she is ashamed to be an Australian because of the border protection policies and that’s been deleted from the Twitter account. But that’s the reality and that’s the reality. So I’m not going to step back and say that we are going to change our border protection policies, because I think they have been in our country’s best interests. We have got every child out of detention, we’ve closed 19 detention centres and I don’t get the calls of a night-time, where 1,200 children and women and men drowned at sea. So I take deep offence at what she said, I think it was a publicity stunt, which is why I hate drawing attention to it. But the reality is, that why has she said this? Ask her to substantiate it, and why is she allowed to say it frankly, on a program on the ABC, the national broadcaster, and can get away with such an unsubstantiated claim, I think is quite wrong. If you haven’t seen Christopher Knaus’s story: A Liberal MP handed a $1.5m novelty cheque to a local sports club while the deputy prime minister was privately warning it not to spend the money because it was yet to go through due diligence and final approval. Late last month, Liberal MP Jason Wood handed over a $1.5m cheque to the Berwick Football and Netball Club in his marginal seat of La Trobe, snapping photos with happy children and staff and posting the news to Facebook, writing “Delivered $1.5m.” The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, wrote to the club about the same time to congratulate them and confirm the funding commitment of “up to $1.5m”. But he also warned them not to spend the money or begin any work. The letter, obtained by Guardian Australia, said this was because the grant was contingent on “final due diligence” and final agreement. “Whilst this letter confirms the commitment to your project, funding of $1.5 million is contingent upon the execution of a Deed of Agreement,” McCormack wrote. “I recommend that you do not enter into financial commitments or begin work on the project until such time a Deed of Agreement has been signed with the Australian government.” For those wanting a visual of this debate: The two duke it out over the Schrodinger’s cat health fight. Health funding has gone up – yes, Peter Dutton is right. Health funding has not gone up by as much as was originally promised – yes, Ali France is right. Peter Dutton said he felt he needed to have a go at the leadership because he did not want Bill Shorten to be prime minister, but believes Scott Morrison is doing “a great job”. Asked about GetUp – which has a very high-profile campaign in the area, amounting to ‘anyone but Dutton’ – Ali France says she has not had any contact with the advocacy group and will not owe them anything. I’ve had no contact with GetUp. I have been out for more than 12 months on the ground. We have a huge number of volunteers, that has been building over those 12 months. We have put a huge effort into this seat, it is actually going to be a hard slog, Mr Dutton has held the seat for 18 years, and I think it is going to be a huge effort. Peter Dutton: I apologised for it the other day, I apologise to Ali for it now. Obviously I said at the time that I had spoke to a number of constituents, they raised issues with me in relation to it, I was conveying that. I could have done it in a more sensitive way. I made a mistake. We all make mistakes. I apologised and I repeat it again today. Ali France: Thank you for your apology. I don’t want to go back too much into the issue but I guess what I do want to say on behalf of the many hundreds of thousands of people with a disability in Australia, I just want to say to them, your disability is not an excuse, it is our reality. We don’t want pity, we don’t want special treatment. What we do expect, in particular from leaders, is that they have an understanding, an understanding that we may do things differently in our world and that is OK. The second thing is this contest should be about ideas. It is not really about me, or my story, it is not about my opponent, it is about the people of Dickson, it is about their stories, it is about listening to them. The ABC Brisbane radio debate between Ali France and Peter Dutton has kicked off. The first question is on the comments Dutton made about France using her disability “as an excuse” to not move into the electorate. Dutton says he apologised. On the other issue bubbling along today – Tony Abbott and his comments that he would lead the party again (but only in an uncontested ballot) – Arthur Sinodinos says: My advice to Tony, which is the same advice I give all of my colleagues which is: We’ve got an election to win. Let’s focus on winning the election and worry about what happens afterwards. Of course, if we win the election, under our rules now, our new rules, Scott Morrison will be our prime minister for three years. PK: But if you don’t, does Tony Abbott become the opposition leader? AS: Well, I’m not contemplating a loss but what I’m saying is the focus now should be on winning the election rather than – Lynton Crosby once gave me a piece of advice: Do your current job as best as you can and the future will take care of itself. PK: I want to be clear. Would you support drafting Tony Abbott to be leader ever again? AS: That’s a hypothetical question. PK: Not really, it could happen. AS: What I support is Tony Abbott and all of our members doing their best to get elected so we get a Liberal government. PK: So you might support Tony Abbott in the future if he wanted to come back? AS: I’m not going to support anybody except Scott Morrison becoming prime minister again after the next election. Karvelas brings up that Scott Morrison referred to Bill Shorten as “a liar”, which she describes as “a pretty extreme word”. PK: Do you think that’s a fair way to run a campaign, to use language like that? Arthur Sinodinos: Well, I think a lot of us will see it by the experience of the last election where the mediscare was allowed to get legs and that was something which was a gross misrepresentation and very misleading characterisation of some proposals that the Coalition had around some back-office part ofMedicare being outsourced in some way. That was then, somehow, conflated with Medicare being privatised, an outrageous proposition. And yet Bill Shorten was happy to run with this day in, day out. That’s the sort of thing that gets people, on my side of politics, very angry, when they see something so blatantly misrepresented. PK: But we are in a current campaign. The government has spent days trying to dispute Labor’s plan on cancer care. Is that an own goal? Have you raised Labor’s cancer care program which is popular among voters? I know this because some of your own colleagues have told me so. AS: We owe the voters the obligation, when something is raised, to respond and to give a view. What we’ve said in relation to the cancer proposals which have been raised is we believe there’s quite a bit of overlap, as I alluded to before, with what we’re doing and, where there’s a gap, we’d be prepared to look at it. If that’s playing on Labor’s territory, we’re engaging them on our territory, on the economy, on national security, on tax. In a similar vein, Sinodinos is asked about Labor’s pathology announcement: I haven’t seen what they’ve said and I have to analyse it. Bulk billing rates in many of these areas are quite high, something like 99% for some of the tests. Let’s look at the facts and, of course, the white heat of a campaign is often the worst time to be looking at the facts of these things. But the fact of the matter is what is good is that both sides of politics are talking about big increases in health spending at a time when, as you alluded to before, we do have challenges coming up, including the ageing of the population and so many of the healthcare costs that we incur are often in the later stages of life. Sinodinos has had first-hand experience with cancer, so Karvelas asks him about Labor’s policy to cover out-of-pocket costs: Well, my experience was, at the beginning, when I had to have a number of scans, I had some out-of-pocket costs because of that. But once I was diagnosed, I was admitted to St Vincent’s – I had private health insurance but treated as a public patient and I had all of that treatment done on that basis and the subsequent scans and everything else, I had to pay obviously for medicines but, because of the PBS, I was paying the subsidised amounts rather than the full amounts. So I was very fortunate that we’ve got such a first-class public hospital system, that so much of my treatment was covered by Medicare. Now I understand people talk about out-of-pocket costs. They do exist. They exist not only in cancer, they exist with a number of other major categories of disease and chronic conditions that we have and what is, I think, important also is to have equality of treatment and, while it’s important the focus that is put on cancer, it’s important to remember there are other maladies which require attention. What the government is seeking to do is not only put more resources into cancer treatment, diagnostics and medicines but also doing more to promote the treatment and diagnosis and pharmaceuticals associated with other conditions. When it comes to Scott Morrison’s insistence that the leadership spill is a “bubble issue”, Arthur Sinodinos says: If there are voters still concerned about that, and that’s a priority for them, that may well influence their vote. But what I’m getting feedback on, in places like Wentworth, for example, is people who may have been upset that Malcolm Turnbull was removed last August are now sort of focused more on the choice ahead of them and that this is playing potentially to Dave Sharma’s advantage. Patricia, let’s wait and see. Arthur Sinodinos is next up on ABC TV with Patricia Karvelas. On the prime minister’s call that there will be no Notre Dame fund: Well, I think the prime minister’s made it pretty clear the government itself won’t be setting up a fund but, of course, Australians are encouraged to contribute if they wish to such a fund. This is a bit different to something like the tsunami that hit the Asian region in the early 2000s where, you know, massive damage, a lot of people in an area where incomes aren’t necessarily high. We are talking here about, obviously, a spiritual, cultural and artistic icon but in a first-world country like France. I think the prime minister was indicating that, certainly while people can contribute, it’s not something that would be a priority of the government. Here is the exchange on superannuation Bill Shorten had today: Journalist: Can you rule out no new or increased taxes on superannuation? BS: We have no plans to increase taxes on superannuation. J: That’s different from ruling it out though. BS: We have no plans to introduce any new taxes on superannuation. J: So will you rule it out? BS: Sure. On the Notre Dame fund (which Josh Frydenberg supported, but Scott Morrison ruled out), Jim Chalmers: I don’t think it’s an either or. We’ve been very strong in our support for farmers in regional Queensland who have done it tough in the last little while. Bill Shorten has agreed with not just, it was Malcolm Turnbull, but also Josh Frydenberg who thought Australia could make a modest contribution in the aftermath of this pretty heartbreaking fire in Paris at Notre Dame, but I think it does say something more broadly. The fact that the treasurer and the prime minister can’t get on the same page on something as simple as this really is another indication of the chaos that has consumed the Liberal party in the last six years, the type of chaos Australians are sick of. They are sick of the splits in the senior government ranks, sick of fights between Turnbull and Dutton and Morrison and Abbott and others. They want a government which is on the same page. They wanted a united and stable team and that’s Labor. But what would Labor do? It remains to be seen. We have said we are up for a conversation with the government on what a modest and responsible contribution may look like. It’s the start of the conversation, not the end of it. I don’t accept it’s a choice between that and doing something meaningful for our farmers, which we’ve supported all along. There are choices in the budget more broadly. I’ve outlined them a moment ago, between more investment in health or bigger tax cuts for the top end of town, but I don’t think, fundamentally, we have to choose between a modest contribution to a fund as outlined by Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg today and doing the right thing by farmers. And on whether the pathology policy is filling a gap, given the government says there is a high rate of coverage, Jim Chalmers says: The industry is under a lot pressure, Patricia, and we don’t want people to have to choose between paying more or going without. We think this is a responsible measure, a bulk billing incentive to make sure that we can keep people getting access to the tests that they need, to keep an eye on their diagnosis and that’s why we’ve made the announcement we’ve made today but it is part of a far broader suite of health announcements we’ve been making and health investments we want to make to try to start to undo the damage done by Scott Morrison to our health system. On Labor’s negative gearing policy being taken down, Jim Chalmers says it’s for an update. Patricia Karvelas asks if that is to take in to account any underestimation of the impact of the policy, or new dwellings takeup: Obviously if everything is updated, Patricia, then the costings for negative gearing will be updated. Not necessarily to take into account what you’re referring to but to take into account all of the changes in the economic parameters. That’s what I’m trying to tell you. Every policy gets updated. The Parliamentary Budget Office has relied on their own consultations, their own costings with the bureau of stats, the RBA and others to come up with that costing. So I don’t accept that there has been some kind of error made in the costing. It will be updated like all of our policies. It will be released well before the election and people will know how much it will cost. Meanwhile, in Dickson: Jim Chalmers, who is playing the role of one of Labor’s campaign spokespeople this election, is asked by Patricia Karvelas about what Bill Shorten meant when he said Labor had no plans to introduce any more changes to super, given Labor does have a policy to change super: Well, I didn’t see Bill Shorten’s press conference but I’ve heard him answer this question before and we’ve got superannuation policies on the table. We’re asked from time to time whether we have any additional policies in the works that we might announce during the election campaign. We don’t. That, as I understand it, was the question that Bill was answering. The Labor campaign is leaving Adelaide – for Perth. Greg Hunt has released his official response to Labor’s pathology announcement in a statement: Bill Shorten’s attempt to scare people about pathology ignores the facts: 99% of people seeking a pathology test from their GP are covered by Medicare and bulk billed Pathology funding has increased by more than $572 million since the Coalition was first elected It will grow to over $3.4 billion in 2021-22 The government invested $2.95 billion in Medicare benefits for approximately 145 million pathology services last year alone, an 8.5% increase These funding boosts mean patients will pay less for pathology services Pathology bulk billing rates for out of hospital services have increased from 97.7% under the Coalition to 99.3% last financial year and continue to grow, up to 99.4% in the first half of this year. This is perhaps his silliest scare campaign yet. Did Sarah Henderson’s office call Liberal party members to invite them to the seniors’ forum this morning? This morning’s seniors’ forum was an open invitation. We had flyers and posters all over Drysdale and the North Bellarine. It’s in stark contrast to the Labor party, which is in hiding when it comes to older Australians. We’ve seen from the retiree tax that the Labor party has deserted older Australians – that was very evident today – and I’m incredibly proud to be standing up for older Australians in Corangamite. (That’s not a no.) Scott Morrison steps in, when a journalist makes the point that a lot of the room seemed to be Liberal party members: Well, there’s nothing wrong with that, you know...! It’s actually legal to be a Liberal member in this country and vote for the Liberal party. It was great to see some of them there. Does Scott Morrison think he is popular in Victoria, given he has spent two days campaigning there? There will be two choices after May 18 – there’s myself and Bill Shorten. Both of our parties have changed our rules, not before time, but we both have. And those rules mean that whoever you elect as prime minister on May 18 they will be your prime minister for the next three years. So if you vote for Bill Shorten, you’ll get Bill Shorten. And if you vote for me, and the Liberal and National parties, you will get me to serve you as your prime minister for the next three years, and to pursue the stronger economy that guarantees rely on for essential services. On whether Sam Dastyari has any connection to Labor’s pathology announcement: Well, this would seem to be the suggestion today - that Sam Dastyari was on Bill Shorten’s campaign bus at the last election and the suggestion now is he’s on Bill Shorten’s gravy train when it comes to this latest announcement. Let’s just see what happens there, I suppose. I mean, I have no knowledge of that. But it’s something for Bill Shorten to explain - from the campaign bus to the gravy train - that’s quite a passage for Sam Dastyari. But, you know, if anyone was gonna be able to do it, I suspect it was him.” On the Notre Dame fund: Well, there’ll be more than enough opportunities, I would have thought, if that’s what people want to do. But I’m not going to mandate it from anybody...! I’m sure that France is a very prosperous nation and I’m sure they’ll be able to cover that. There’s already been a massive donation made today by a very significant French philanthropist. Look, I’m focused on, you know, supporting Australian farmers in drought – Australian farmers and graziers and pastoralists up in north Queensland. They’re the ones, frankly, who desperately need our help at the moment. That’s where I’m focusing my attention. There are those – there’s a fondness for those of us who have had the great privilege and opportunity to be there – as I was saying this morning on social media, Jenny and I were there almost 30 years ago when we’d been married only a couple of years, and it was a very special memory for us, so it was upsetting to see that today. But I’m sure that President Macron and the Catholic church are able to deal with this and, if individual Australians want to do something, well, it’s a free country – they can do whatever they like. Q: Josh Frydenberg and Bill Shorten have, to my understanding, backed creating a government fund for Notre Dame. Morrison: We’re not making a government fund. On the Grattan Institute analysis of the government’s tax plan: That’s complete rubbish. It’s absolute, complete rubbish. On Labor’s pathology announcement, will the Liberals match it? Is he worried about a new Mediscare campaign? Scott Morrison: Bill Shorten lies. He lies. He lies all the time. I mean, Bill Shorten wanted people to believe that you could go to a public hospital for cancer treatment and that it wasn’t covered. He knows 99% of the pathology services that are provided out of hospital – 99% of them were provided out of Medicare. But he wants to suggest to people that there are services not available that are actually there. Now, I know there’s out-of-pocket expenses that are involved in cancer treatment. No one ever said there wasn’t. But I think to suggest to people that are suffering with cancer that somehow there aren’t cost-free services available in public hospitals, or that there are other tests that are referred by your doctor and not covered by Medicare – I think that’s very misleading. And in its worst case, it’s actually quite cruel. Our health system – both at a state level and its federal support – is very significant. And we will continue to provide that. If you don’t have a strong economy, though – this is Bill’s problem – every time he’s spending money, he’s taxing you more. That’s what’s happening all the time. Every time he’s spending money, he’s spending your money. Cause he’s having to increase taxes – taxes that he can’t even remember that he is now proposing. Back on the Sharrouf children, Scott Morrison says: I made it very clear that no Australian would be put at risk in terms of going into what is a very dangerous part of the world, and that is the clear instructions that have been provided to officials. Khaled Sharrouf was a murderous terrorist. He was a despicable individual. The fact that he actually put his children in that environment is unthinkable as a parent. This is a very special brand of evil that he lived. No one’s unhappy to see the back of him, I’ve got to say. But when it comes to the children – well, obviously we’ll deal with each and every case on its merits but, in every single case, we will be putting the security of Australians at the top of the list. There are processes to be followed, and there’s still a long way to go on these things, and we’ll deal with each case – every individual child – on its merits, and follow the proper process. Back on superannuation, Scott Morrison says he is fine with the system now, because he has “dealt” with the fairness issues: Because I’ve looked at this issue really closely. I dealt with it as a treasurer. It’s done. It’s settled. That’s why I can say – probably more than anyone else who’s had experience in this area in policy and government – there is no need to increase taxes on superannuation. We want people to invest in superannuation with confidence. So I can give Australians that guarantee. I have the background to be able to absolutely give that commitment, because I know what’s involved, we’ve dealt with the fairness issues – that’s settled, and there is no reason why Bill Shorten, for example, should be saying to tradies who work for themselves – why should they pay higher contribution taxes than people who work for an employer? Why should people who are coming back from having children and are looking to catch up on their contributions pay higher rates of tax or be unable to invest in their superannuation when they’ve had time out of work? Why should older Australians who are working when they’re over the age of 65 – or even not working over the age of 65, and they want to put more money into their superannuation – why should they be denied that? These are all the higher taxes that Bill Shorten is putting on superannuation and moving the goalposts on people as they both prepare for their retirement and they live in their retirement. And that’s why you can’t trust him. He has put so much tax – he’s seeking to put so much tax – on the Australian economy, he’s now started to forget how much tax he’s put on, particularly on superannuation, and as we’ve seen with negative gearing, he’s trying to erase the record of the additional taxes he wants to put on housing and on capital gains tax. I mean, it’s supposed to be fair – $387 billion is a lot of tax to try and get your head around. Clearly, he can’t get his head around it. If he can’t explain it, why would you vote for him? On Gladys Liu, Scott Morrison says: I was very pleased to be with Gladys yesterday to launch her campaign. Gladys has led an amazing Australian life. Gladys came to this country in the mid-80s, studied, became an Australian citizen, she’s a speech pathologist, she’s raised a family here, built businesses and worked with her community. As she said at the time when she was campaigning for the previous Liberal candidate, and now current member in Chisholm, she was simply saying that these were the views of that community. Q: Do you think she’s phobic? SM: No. On Tony Abbott’s leadership ambitions (he’ll take up the mantle again, if the leadership is thrown open, but not in a contested ballot, he said), Scott Morrison says: I think Tony was responding to a question that was very hypothetical. Is this visit to restore confidence? Scott Morrison: It’s about giving Australians, as they prepare for their retirement, certainty, because Bill Shorten’s shifting the goalposts on them. They’re very angry at Bill Shorten, and Chris Bowen is the one that says, “If you don’t like Labor’s retirement package, don’t vote Labor.” It’s very good advice. Bill Shorten was saying that these retirees – these pensioners that are affected – those who will benefit from the franked dividend credits scheme – they say it’s a gift. They say they haven’t paid tax. I mean, Bill Shorten is treating older Australians with complete disrespect, as if they live off his largesse if he were to become prime minister. I don’t see it that way. I see them as having worked hard, paid taxes all their life, having set themselves up to be in a position to live through their retirement, and we should allow them to do that and not treat them with the disrespect of putting the government’s hand in their wallets. Because that’s what Bill Shorten’s going to do. On whether nuclear power is an option: Well, I’m yet to see any proposal that has ever been considered that would stack up. Before you considered something like that, you’d need to see the feasibility of projects that potentially could. Scott Morrison on Bill Shorten not mentioning Labor’s super changes: I have no idea what Bill Shorten was talking about today when he says he won’t be putting increased taxes on superannuation. That’s his policy. There’s $34 billion worth of increased taxes on superannuation in his own policy. But I suppose, if you’ve already racked up $387 billion in higher taxes, he must have forgotten that he’d already – that includes $34 billion of taxes alone on superannuation. When, I suppose, when the number gets that high, he’s either lying about it today or he’s just forgotten the last person he hit with higher taxes. And so that’s why he can’t be trusted on these issues. He’s taxing the economy so much not even he can keep count of all the taxes that he’s putting on the Australian economy. Scott Morrison is holding his media conference in Torquay, with Sarah Henderson, and is repeating that there will be no added, or higher taxes on a government he leads “never ever”. On the superannuation question, when Bill Shorten said Labor had no plans to introduce any new taxes, he also didn’t mention that Labor’s superannuation policy is already out there (and has been for a year). Labor plans to cut non-concessional contributions from $100,000 a year, to $75,000. It also wants to reduce the threshold where you pay a tax surcharge (currently at $250,000) of 30%, to $200,000. The Labor camp says Shorten meant there were no more plans for any other changes to superannuation, beyond the policy it already has out. Both campaigns appear to be at rest at the moment. You would imagine though, that Scott Morrison, after two days in Victoria, would be looking to move on. I imagine the Labor campaign will be headed on the road soon as well, having made its Boothby point. This is at least the second game of pool. Michael McCormack was also asked about Gladys Liu. He doesn’t answer with ‘dams’ this time, but it’s close: Oh look, candidates often say things. Look, the fact is, we’re talking about the economy. We’re talking about the things that matter most to Australians and that is their retirees savings. That is, their negative geared investments. That is the jobs for them and their children in the future, building better roads, getting the inland rail happening. They’re the sorts of things that Australians want us to talk about. Candidates should focus on that. That’s the important thing. That’s what the people are pulling me up in the street and talking to me about. They’re not talking to me about what some candidate in another state might happen or not to say. ...Well, you know, she’s made those comments. Unfortunate as they are. Look, fact is, candidates make these statements during campaign trails. They’re long-time… you know, the fact is, the important thing and the real important issues for people, every day, ordinary Australians sitting around their breakfast table right at the moment is how are they going to pay their next bill? How are they going to make ends meet? They’ll make ends meet under a Liberal Nationals government. They’re going to be battling under a Labor government. For the record, she made the comments in 2016, then said it was “fake news”, then said she was taken out of context. Michael McCormack was asked on ABC Mid North Coast this morning about the government’s “$100bn” infrastructure spend. As Gabrielle Chan reported during budget time, just $42bn is to be spent in the next four years (a not tiny sum) with the rest over 10 years – or the “never never” as its known (because it is impossible to predict what the budget might look like that far out. It’s the same as the bulk of the government’s tax plan comes in, and where Labor plans on reinstating 50/50 hospital funding, for that matter as well). McCormack: No, that’s usually the way and particularly at the last budget, the one before this one, we had $75 billion worth of spending. That’s a record amount and we’re actually rolling that out right now and additionally, now we’ve got $100 billion. Well of course, you can’t spend all that money at once. Now Labor knows that. And certainly when it comes to rolling out infrastructure, it’s ongoing. There’s witches hats, there’s high-vis vests, there’s excavators, whether it’s a capital city, whether it’s regional, country, coastal, remote Australia, there’s work being done. For those who missed the audio earlier, on the Gladys Liu story, (given she had previously dismissed it as “fake news”) you can hear some of it here: On his comments on the weekend that people claiming more than $3,000 for accountants fees were a “loophole” and a “rort”, Bill Shorten says: I think our CPAs are excellent. Love accountants. There was the usual propaganda from News Limited that we are against the professions. We are not! Really, in this country, can we afford to be giving away millions of dollars of tax subsidy to people for the cost of minimising their tax already? We are talking about the taxes which nurses and tradies paid to Canberra. I would rather spend that on the best schools in the world, the best Tafe, the best healthcare system. It is a matter of priority. Am I surprised a vested interest whose business model relies on tax subsidies isn’t happy if we are going to reform it? No, I get why they might not like it. We have to ask ourselves in this country, are we just a country who wants to maintain tax subsidies and loopholes for the big end of town, or a country who wants to invest in our people? At the end of the day, we are not changing the ability of accountants to do work for their customers. We are just saying that perhaps once you are paying over $3,000 a year to an accountant you shouldn’t be able to deduct that off your tax. It is not how it has been characterised in News Limited and I expect to see more of these campaigns about Labor. And some point we have to put ordinary people at the top of the pile. The Sam Dastyari issue comes up again – Shorten is asked whether it is appropriate that Dastyari’s employer will make “a motza” out of this policy. Bill Shorten: First of all, Mr Dastyari is no longer a senator. He paid a pretty big price, I think, for mistakes he made. I’m not about to get... he’s got a right to a life after politics, as I think all political people do. But I just got to go to this issue of pathology. Is the government really arguing that we shouldn’t be investing more in pathology? Is the government arguing we shouldn’t put downward pressure on the cost of pathology so we can make sure we maintain the bulk billing system? If they are arguing that then they are more out of touch than I originally thought. Can Labor commit to not raising taxes on superannuation (or putting in new ones)? Yeah, we have no plans to increase taxes on superannuation. “No plans” are the key words there. Bill Shorten was just asked whether he consulted Sam Dastyari about Labor’s pathology policy. A quick search of the lobbyist register shows Dastyari is registered with the Strategic Counsel, which has a range of pharmaceutical, aged care and healthcare clients: Shorten replied: “I haven’t. And indeed, this pathology announcement stands on its own two feet.” Guardian Australia has contacted Dastyari for comment. Catherine King steps in to answer a question on whether or not the money will just go to the pathology companies’ bottom line: We know that because pathologists are telling us that. Because of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government freeze on rebates, they are at breaking point. We knew when we were in government we wanted to keep bulk billing, why we introduced bulk billing incentives and this government tried to get rid of them. This will be a new Medicare item we work with pathologies on, that will preserve the rates of bulk billing for pathology. It’s too important for us to not to. We know that 100% of cancers are reliant on pathology for diagnosis. We’re keeping the bulk billing rate high for pathology. Have Bill Shorten or any of his colleagues spoken to Sam Dastyari, about the pathology policy? I haven’t. And indeed, this pathology announcement stands on its own two feet. When you think about it, and I will get Catherine to supplement the answer, pathology makes sick people well. It has that potential. A check of the lobbyist’s register reveals this: On Labor’s living wage policy: Well over one million people are award-dependent. They’re the people I’m talking about. If you improve the living wage, if you improve the minimum wage to a living wage, we want to see that flow through to the people still reliant on the award system. That number is bigger than 100,000 people. But I get where the question is coming from. It’s really about this ongoing boast that Mr Morrison keeps saying about a strong economy. Let’s unpack what a Liberal strong economy is based upon. It’s based upon two principles, the first is keep wages as low as possible, and they’re proud of that, and keep making sure the profits go up and up. This government has an almost religious conviction that if you can make the richest people in Australia richer, the richest companies richer, eventually some of the crumbs will fall off the table. That’s the first leg of the principles of Mr Morrison’s strong economy, keep wages down. The second leg, and the Grattan Institute has blown the whistle on this today ... that they believe keeps the economy strong, cut services. Low wages and reduction in real services, that’s not the strong economy Australian needs. Labor, by contrast, believes in a strong economy built upon fairness and decency. We’re not going to stand by and watch Mr Morrison boast with a strategy where the rich get richer, the cost of living is squeezing millions of wage earners. Back on the Sharrouf children, Shorten won’t say whether he thinks people should be sent in to get them: “I will not start giving security advice.” On Notre Dame: I think all of us were shocked to see that image. Notre Dame is a global icon. I don’t know how many people here, but certainly I and millions of Australians over the years have backpacked or travelled to Paris, and one of those post card moments of any young Australian’s trip overseas is to go to Notre Dame. It’s an 800-year-old cathedral. It’s survived civil war and religious strife, German occupation. A lot of us were very saddened and shocked to see what happened today. Imagine if we saw the Opera House on fire. That’s essentially what we have seen in France. It belongs to the world. I like Mr Turnbull’s idea there should be some modest commitment to help rebuild, if that’s the case, that’s what friends are for. I would encourage Mr Morrison to take up... Mr Turnbull’s idea. Can Bill Shorten think of a reason why the Sharrouf children should not be allowed to return to Australia? None that I can think of. On the Sharrouf children, they shouldn’t be a political football. They have suffered. Their parents took them to a war zone, incredibly irresponsibly. Their parents took them into a regime of terrorism. These children shouldn’t be held responsible for what their parents did. Why did Labor remove its negative gearing policy from its website? We’re updating the documents. Let’s face it, if you want to talk about putting policies upfront, we’re doing that. We put our negative gearing policy out from the Sydney town hall in about February, March, of 2016. As new numbers come to light, we update them. If you want to look at the gold standard in terms of putting policies out there, I don’t think any of you can really look past Labor. But if you want to look at what is not in gold standard, have a look at this very important report the Grattan Institute has written today. I would encourage you all to read it. It has some real information there. What it shows is the Liberals’ economic model on display yet again. It shows for tax cuts on the never-never. They are planning, though, to cut up to $40 billion a year in secret cuts. The government will have to answer during the course of this campaign. What are the secret cuts you’re planning to promise an illusionary tax? Bill Shorten is in Adelaide, speaking on the $200m commitment for bulk-billing pathology (blood tests and the like), as part of Labor’s $2.3bn cancer plan. AAP was also at the senior’s forum Scott Morrison addressed. Other than footpaths, nuclear power and franking credits, the (very) friendly crowd also had this to say: Drysdale resident Elisabeth Anderson told AAP she wanted more information about other parties before deciding who to vote for on 18 May. ‘I was really impressed. He was very open and real. He was really listening to people,’ she said. Noni Bartlett is worried an elected Shorten government would introduce death duties. ‘I don’t think Labor have it on the agenda yet, but because of the pushing – as Morrison explained – that’s on the Greens agenda and on the ACTU agenda, I think it might happen,’ she said. Retired unionist Alan Guihenneuc was among a handful of volunteers handing out anti-government flyers outside the forum, criticising the government for inaction on aged care. ‘People I’ve been talking to, especially about aged care, they want change,’ he said of Corangamite. Julie Beattie took time out from her job to attend the forum. ‘We’re just little Drysdale, look at our town hall,’ she said. ‘It’s fantastic to have someone come into our region to understand our issues.’ Talking to Geelong radio Rock 95.5 FM, Scott Morrison went into a little more detail about his love of Game of Thrones. Well yeah, I watched that first episode last night. I mean Jon Snow has always been my favorite character and all that, but I thought it was a bit of a slow start last night for the first episode of the final series. But anyway I think it’s all a bit of fun, a bit of fantasy that people can sort of chill out and zone out while they watch it. We were watching it with the some of the media gallery that are on the bus with us, trailing us around. I haven’t watched Game of Thrones (don’t @ me, I have very limited time for TV and it just seemed like wayyyyyy too much of an investment) but I can’t imagine watching some of its scenes with the prime minister, no matter who it is, is any more comfortable than if your parents were in the room, if you know what I mean. While we wait for Bill Shorten’s first press conference, if you missed Murph’s latest podcast a few days ago, on the history of Shorten, have a listen here or subscribe to it on an app such as apple podcasts. Also, huzzah for being able to embed this stuff, thanks to the technical geniuses in the brains trust. (If it doesn’t work, it is absolutely my fault.) Sky News’s Annelise Nielsen said she asked participants of that senior’s forum how they found out about it, and learnt most discovered it through the local Liberal party branch. Right on schedule: The ads keep on keeping on. We’re not even a full week into the campaign yet. You may have seen the front page of the Daily Telegraph this morning. The response to it from Zali Steggall’s ex-husband and his wife came pretty swiftly. Just a reminder that enrolments to vote close on Thursday. You’ll find more information here. Again, the key words here are “taxable incomes”. That’s not their only earnings. That sound you hear is the Kristina Keneally tweet thread storm gathering. And yes, this is a timely reminder AAP has collated the major party responses on this: I think Australia should contribute to a restoration fund,” Bill Shorten told reporters in Melbourne. “Notre Dame doesn’t just belong to Paris or France, it belongs to the world. I think we, all of us who’ve enjoyed that architecture, that history, we too should perhaps rally around and help Paris and Notre Dame.” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had no doubt many Australians would want to chip in. “Absolutely, if money is going towards the restoration and Australians who want to contribute can, that is to be supported,” he told ABC TV. “Every Parisian will dig deep as well, no doubt. I don’t think there will be a shortage of funds for this to happen.” “Under pressure, who knows what deal Bill Shorten would do. Who knows what deal Bill Shorten might do. That’s why people don’t trust him. They’ve been watching him for five and a half years,” says Scott Morrison. Legs eleven – it’s death taxes! Section 44 will most likely continue to haunt us into the 46th Parliament. Who had nuclear power on their boomer bingo card? Cos knock at the door, you’ve got four. From Sky News’ Canberra bureau chief: Scott Morrison appears to playing ‘boomer bingo’ in this forum. So far he has name dropped Ita Buttrose, Macca from the ABC and footpaths (as well as superannuation). Any moment now, he’s going to mention the monte carlo. I can feel it. Scott Morrison taking questions from the crowd, again repeats the most obvious line of this election: You’ve got to focus on the future, and the choice at this election is between Bill Shorten as prime minister or myself as prime minister. Both of our parties have now changed our rules. That means that whoever you elect as prime minister at this election, that’s who you get for the next three years. Our rules have been changed. Our rules are now in fact stronger than what the Labor party’s rules are. They only need a 50% vote in their party room to change all their rules. We need a two-thirds vote in our room. I have never seen that happen in our party room. You vote for Bill Shorten at this election, you will get him and you will get his higher taxes and everything that follows from it. It is a clear choice that Australians have. I’m pleased that both parties have changed our rules to get rid of all of that nonsense. It is now a part of the past and now we look forward to the future. It is a real choice between who you want to lead this country. If you can’t manage money as Labor can’t, then you can’t run the country.” Scott Morrison is promising no new taxes on superannuation “not now, not ever” to the seniors’ forum in Corangamite. Scott Morrison is at a seniors’ forum, with Sarah Henderson. Just thinking (given how hard the Coalition is working to save Victorian seats) that this election is the first real chance Labor has had of clawing its way back, federally in Victoria, since the 1990s. It’s been a while since I studied political science, but I’m pretty sure the tram strike resulted in Bob Hawke losing about eight seats in Victoria – and really, Labor hasn’t managed to take them back. This election seems to represent that chance. Deakin, La Trobe, Corangamite, Chisholm and Dunkley are all on Labor’s hit list. On the road again In 2016, Gladys Liu also spoke to The Age about safe schools: Gladys Liu, the Liberal party’s communities engagement committee chairwoman for Victoria, said she believed the school program undermined “conservative” Chinese values. “We are concerned it will change society and the moral standard [of] the culture,” Ms Liu said. “It’s not only directly affecting students, but will affect the makeup and future of our society.” For those asking, the original story containing Gladys Liu’s comments, can be found here. It included this: If you ask how many Chinese people read mainstream news, the percentage is so, so low,” Gladys Liu says. “But the first thing they do in the morning is turn on the phone and go to WeChat straight away.” She says the campaign was run by volunteers like herself and centred on three issues: the Safe Schools controversy, same-sex marriage and economic management. “A lot of parents don’t agree with letting boys go into a girls’ toilet,” she says. “They strongly opposed the Safe Schools program. Cross-dressing and transgender – this is something they found difficult to accept. Chinese believe same-sex [marriage] is against normal practice. “Chinese people come to Australia because they want good things for the next generation, not to be destroyed – they use the word destroyed – [by] same-sex, transgender, intergender. All this rubbish.” Gladys Liu says refugees were also a key issue for Chinese voters. “If Labor is going to open the gate and let refugees in, that will affect people here and their lives here,” she says. But she denies that there was an orchestrated disinformation campaign. “If Labor policies are good, they can dominate WeChat,” she says. “But Chinese don’t like their policies.” I meant to mention this earlier, but forgot – the first leaders’ debate is set down for April 29, in Perth. Asked to put a dollar figure on the potential cuts to the growth of health funding, Danielle Wood said: It would still be growing, but 0.3% a year is a very low rate of growth, particularly for health.” What about the proportion of tax cuts that Labor has agreed with? Will they have the same impact? Under Labor’s plan, [it’s] much more modest, the government’s plan is $300bn over a decade, under what Labor has announced, and they have foreshadowed they may well cut taxes at some point in the future, the cost will be $70bn over 10 years. So it’s substantially less. Within the kind of envelope of the budget, it would be possible to run surpluses for the decade if they didn’t do any further tax cuts. And in conclusion, what is the institute’s view on the likelihood of the government reaching its surplus forecasts? I expect we would probably get there next year. Barring some kind of major economic shock, I think we’re on the right trajectory. But once you get beyond that, the spending growth numbers look really, really heroic. Once you got out to 2024-25, with the really big changes, I expect the budget to dip back into deficit at that time.” Speaking of the Grattan Institute analysis, Danielle Wood, one of the institute’s directors, just had a chat to the ABC: Under the government’s numbers, which say it’s going to be $300bn worth of tax cuts over the next decade, as well as running ever-growing budget surpluses, the only way those numbers stack up is if you have government payments falling as a share of the economy,” she said. “We see that in the budget papers. They’re forecasting that government spending as a share of the economy is going to fall from 24.9% today to 23.6% out in a decade’s time. “What that would mean is that spending could have to be about $40bn lower in a decade than if we had spending sit at the share of the economy where it is today and it has been effectively the last six years.” So have any areas been identified as potentially going to suffer? Woods: It’s partly lower interest costs. As you start to build surpluses, interest will come down. They expect welfare to come down because of high jobs growth. There’s a whole lot of other areas where they’re forecasting spending growth is going to come down. So health, for example, has grown 3% a year in real terms for the last four years. They’re forecasting that comes down to 0.3% a year, that would be historically unprecedented. So there’s a whole lot of spending areas that we can see in the budget papers where spending is expected to come down over the next four years, but we don’t have a good sense of exactly why that is. It doesn’t seem to be driven by any policies that we can see in the budget. ...That would be over the next four years. So certainly if we look – this is based on the forecast in the budget papers – spending growth in those areas is coming down in the budget. That would be over the next four years to come. Labor is running very hard with the Grattan Institute analysis of the government’s tax plan. Bill Shorten (shortly before he left Melbourne for SA): The whistle has been blown on the government’s secret cuts to spending in the Budget. This government is promising tax cuts in five years’ time for some people, but it’s doing it on the basis of $40bn worth of cuts. The secret’s out, this is a government with secret cuts to spending in its budget to fund its promises on the never-never, for tax cuts.” Josh Frydenberg has been working just as hard to call it rubbish: The prime minister was also asked about the Sharrouf children by the 5AA hosts. Scott Morrison: “Look, you’ve got to get the balance here. I mean Khaled Sharrouf was a terrorist. he declared war basically on Australia and what he did to his children and his wife did to their children is despicable, by taking them into that war zone. “Now of course we are not putting any Australians at risk in terms of going to these conflict zones, I don’t think people would expect us to do that. But we have been working quietly, behind the scenes, with the international Red Cross, we are taking each and every case on its merits, Australia’s national security always comes first. But I am very mindful that we are dealing with children here, so the officials who are involved here and working on these issues, are examining them closely and we are working closely with families, where families are affected back here in Australia. “...You just put your finger right on the issue here, and that is Australia’s national security interests always come first and there are a lot of hurdles to clear on this, and Australians can be absolutely satisfied that we will follow those processes extremely closely, but we are mindful of the fact that we are dealing with children. So what I am not doing, is getting drawn into any final decisions here, at this point. You just take this process one step at a time, we are dealing with human beings here, particularly children and we will be mindful of that, as we continue to deal with these very sensitive cases. “But as always, Australia’s safety must always come first.” Scott Morrison is talking to Adelaide radio 5AA before the Labor campaign rolls into town. He calls South Australia the “turnaround state”. Which is what he called Tasmania last week, so he adds “just like Tasmania” at the end of the sentence. The situation the Sharrouf children have found themselves in was also raised on Sunrise. Bill Shorten repeated his stance from last week – that the kids should be safe, but Australia should be led by its security agencies. (Which is very similar to Scott Morrison’s stance.) Well, I don’t hold the children responsible for the mistakes of their parents. You know I don’t know all the circumstances but I can understand why a grandmother wants to see her grandchildren safe at home,” Shorten said. “What I don’t understand is what on earth possessed the parents, one, to pursue this hateful ideology of the terrorist Isis organisation but dragging your kids into the middle of a war zone, no parent who loves their children would do that, would they? ... “Well, I think you’ve got to work on that [bringing them back in]. We’ve got to make the kids safe. It’s difficult. We’ll work with the security agencies but I don’t hold the kids responsible for the mistakes of their parents and I think that’s just the humane thing to do, isn’t it?” Speaking to Sunrise before heading off to South Australia, Bill Shorten responded to Josh Frydenberg’s claim that a Labor government under his plan would be the highest taxing government in Australian history: Well, first of all, we don’t accept that. This is the government who’s raised more taxes than anyone before us. And as our promises come out during the course of the election campaign, this government untruth will be exposed for what it is. But let’s be clear here: it’s all about choices in this election. This government wants to give tax cuts to the top end of town, this government wants to keep spending taxpayer money on subsidies to the lucky few. We want to make sure that we’ve got better hospitals and schools, that’s what we want to do with our scarce government resources, look after working- and middle-class families. AAP has succinctly summed up today’s tax battle for you. From their report: According to the government’s analysis, a worker earning $59,000 would be $542 a year better off while someone on $176,000 could pay $11,739 less in income tax by the middle of next decade. An early childhood worker would be better off by $943 a year under the Coalition’s plan than under Labor. Labor argues the Coalition’s plan is unfair because it means everyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000 will be on the same 30% tax rate by 2024-25. But Mr Frydenberg said that measure was aimed at reducing bracket creep – when inflation in wages pushes people into higher tax brackets – and thus benefit lower- and middle-income earners … The opposition has also called the Coalition’s tax plan “reckless”, saying the government can’t know what the economic conditions will be in mid-2025. “People will have to re-elect the Coalition two more times to see the tax cuts,” opposition finance spokesman Jim Chalmers told ABC TV. Mr Frydenberg wasn’t concerned about potential economic challenges ahead, saying budgets are designed to prepare for them. “That’s the whole purpose of a budget,” he told ABC Radio National. This issue is also going to plague Coalition MPs today, so they might want to come up with a better answer for it. Michael Rowland: Former prime minister Tony Abbott says he would be willing to be drafted back into the Liberal party leadership if the Coalition loses, do you ever see any circumstance where Tony Abbott will lead your party again? Josh Frydenberg: I know Tony Abbott has his hands full in his own seat and that is where his focus is and that is where it should be. We are focused – Scott Morrison, myself, Michael McCormack and the whole Coalition team – is focused on delivering more jobs, lower taxes, record funding on hospitals, schools and roads. That is a record we’re proud of. That is the record we will continue with. MR: Do you see any circumstances in which Tony Abbott will lead your party again? JF: I see Scott Morrison as the leader of our party today. Tomorrow ... MR: It is a simple question – yes or no will suffice. JF: As I said, you’re asking me about Tony Abbott. I am saying his focus is on his seat. MR: He is looking at the leadership as well. If he wins his seat firstly and if you’re in opposition, do you see any circumstance in which Tony Abbott will lead your party again? JF: What I say is Scott Morrison is providing strong leadership. Bill Shorten’s been the opposition leader for six years. It doesn’t matter who he is up against, he is not the preferred prime minister and the reason is people can see through his lies. They can see through his bad policies and, ultimately, it is the Coalition that will deliver a stronger economy, lower taxes and more jobs. Just as shocking as Jim Chalmers wanting to talk about the Grattan Institute report, which describes the Coalition’s tax plan as “heroic” without cuts, is Josh Frydenberg saying he believes the analysis to be wrong. He told ABC TV: We have shown we can bring the rate of spending growth down to the lowest rate of any government in 50 years and, at the same time, spend record amounts on hospitals, schools and roads, grow the economy so we are growing faster than any G7 country, except the United States, create more than 1.2m new jobs, legislate tax cuts for more than 10 million Australians and provide a pathway forward for long-term structural reform, a pathway that is rejected by Bill Shorten who has $387bn of higher taxes to impose on the Australian people. Josh Frydenberg is also on the ABC. He’s being asked about Gladys Liu’s comments by Michael Rowland: JF: It was our party, our government, the Coalition that has seen same-sex marriage become law. We are very proud of that fact. There is so many champions on our side, not least Warren Entsch and Tim Wilson and Trevor Evans and Trent Zimmerman and many others. We care deeply about these issues. I, like many of my colleagues, have spoken about this. Those comments were a few years ago but I thought you were going to ask me questions about Melissa Parke resigning in WA or Michael Daley’s comments. I am focused on the future. MR: Those comments were made in 2016. Chinese people come to Australia – this is Gladys Liu – “Because they want good things for the next generation not to be destroyed, they use the word destroyed by same sex, transgender, inter gender, all this rubbish, to them they are ridiculous rubbish.” JF: We strongly support equality and that is why we are able to preside over the same-sex marriage ... MR: Do you strongly condemn these comments, based on that? JF: Those comments don’t reflect my views or Scott Morrison or the party’s views. MR: They reflect the view of a Liberal candidate in a closely watched seat. What action will the party take? Melissa Parke was disendorsed by the Labor party. JF: The key point here was, as a party, we presided over the same-sex marriage debate when it became law. That is something we’re proud of. MR: Will you disendorse Gladys Liu? JF: I will not. MR: Why not? JF: I think she is a strong local candidate. The point is we, as a party, stand for tolerance, we, as a party and as a government have presided over the same-sex marriage debate which ended successfully. MR: How do you think LGBTI Voters in Chisholm will think about those remarks? JF: You would need to direct your questions towards them. Bill Shorten is on his way to Boothby, where Labor is hopeful of picking up Nicolle Flint’s marginal seat. Jim Chalmers just popped up on ABC. He was pretty keen to talk about the Australian Financial Review story on the Grattan Institute analysis of the Coalition’s tax plan. (Insert shocked face emoji here.) From the Fin’s report: The Morrison government would need to cut spending by about $40 billion a year by 2030 to afford its big personal income tax cuts and deliver on its budget surplus forecasts, new analysis by the Grattan Institute shows. Chalmers: Everyone earning up to $125,000 in the next term of parliament will be the same or better off under Labor’s tax plan. We have a plan to match the government to $125,000, and we have a plan for a better tax cut for 3.6 million Australians, who earn up to $45,000 a year. The difference between Liberal and Labor on tax, the Liberals will have to cut hospitals and schools to pay for their plan, we can implement our plan to prioritise low- and middle-income earners without cutting hospitals and schools. The Bad Show was just as much a train wreck as you would have expected. James McGrath and Larissa Waters sparred. From Lisa Martin’s report: The Liberal National party is a party for all Queenslanders regardless of where you come from and how long you’ve been here,” McGrath insisted. “As long as you share our values – and one of our values is it’s inclusivity, and we’re colour blind when it comes to the colour of your own skin … And I’m sure the Greens and I hope Labor would agree with that.” “I’m not sure Peter Dutton would,” Waters retorted. “I beg your pardon. Are you serious?” McGrath said. When Waters pointed to Dutton’s immigration detention policies to justify the racist claim, McGrath exploded in rage. “Where are your tears for those people who drowned at sea and were eaten by the sharks? Don’t come here with your crocodile tears talking to me about what Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison did. They made sure the borders of Australia were safe and secure,” McGrath bellowed. “I’ll ask you not to shout,” the host, Virginia Trioli, responded. Yup. A great contribution to political discourse. What a show. Tony Abbott says he stands ready to lead the Liberal party again – but he won’t stand in a contested ballot. Anne Davies reports Abbott was speaking to voters at the Manly Yacht Club overnight and said his leadership ambitions remained – under the right circumstances. From the report: I won’t go into a contested ballot,” Abbott said in answer to a question from the audience about whether he would seek the leadership again. “It will be up to the party room. If they want me they will need to invite me. But I am not expecting that,” he said. “I am not going to shoulder anyone aside for the top job, because for me it has never been about that,” he added. Labor and Bill Shorten will head to South Australia today. Shorten faces his own off-campaign issues. As reported by the Australian: Bill Shorten is under renewed pressure to haul anti-Israel Labor MPs into line as an outbreak of pro-Palestinian sentiment within the opposition threatens to disrupt his election campaign. West Australian Labor MPs Josh Wilson and Sue Lines were revealed to have attacked Israeli security forces and Australia’s own Jewish lobby at Labor Party events in recent months, days after Curtin candidate Melissa Parke quit over similar anti-Israel criticisms. Jewish leaders yesterday called on the Opposition Leader to enforce his support for Israel and stop a tide of pro-Palestinian support within Labor that has been bubbling in recent years. Shorten addressed some of this yesterday: First of all, the MPs, Mr Wilson and Senator Lines have reconfirmed again this morning that they support Labor party policy. For the sake of clarity, the Israeli ambassador representing the Israeli government said they could work with both sides of politics. Labor party policy is very clear, and all of my candidates and members have signed up to it – a two-state solution. Sorry, let me answer your questions. Our policy is very clear, we support a two-state solution – that is the right of Israel to exist behind safe and secure borders, and the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for statehood. But expect to hear more on that today, especially as the campaigns inch closer to WA. Back to the campaign and Scott Morrison will spend the morning in Victoria as the Liberals attempt to hold marginal electorates there. Morrison launched Gladys Liu’s campaign for Chisholm yesterday. Shortly afterwards, an interview she gave to the Guardian in 2016 surfaced. From Lisa Martin’s report: Liu ran an anti-Labor campaign on WeChat, the most popular Chinese-language social media network, ahead of the 2016 election and in the July 2016 report claimed credit for helping to get then Liberal MP Julia Banks elected to parliament … Liu told the Guardian the campaign on WeChat was run by volunteers like herself and centred on three issues: the Safe Schools controversy, same-sex marriage and economic management. In discussing the role of the campaign, Liu commented on how issues including same-sex marriage were received in the Chinese community and on WeChat – the article did not represent those comments as Liu’s personal views … “The Chinese people come to Australia because they want good education for their children, good environment, they want good things for their next generation, not to be destroyed – they use the word destroyed – by these sort of concepts of same-sex, transgender, intergender, crossgender and all this rubbish. To them this is just ridiculous rubbish,” Liu told the Guardian. Hong Kong-born Liu, a former speech pathologist who is now running as the Liberal candidate for Chisholm, has now dismissed the Guardian’s reporting as “fake” and “wrong” and told the Australian on Monday that she had been “misrepresented”. “I was asked about what I had heard from the Chinese community and I told the person who interviewed me what I heard. When it was reported, it became my words,” she said. The Guardian has released audio of the interview and stands by its reporting.” Of course there is always downtime on any campaign. It’s the fifith full day of campaigning, and if you feel like it already has a groundhog feel to it, well, I’m sorry. But there are 32 days to go. Last night’s episode of Four Corners is sure to raise questions about the Sharrouf children. Scott Morrison has previously said he will not risk Australian lives to bring them home, which is understandable, but the children are Australian citizens. Anyone who saw the reunion between the kids and their grandmother Karen Nettleton will know just how much emotion surrounds this case. Today both leaders are sure to face questions about just what Australia should do in this harrowing case. On the domestic front, the battle for the hearts and minds of voters when it comes to health continues. Labor has announced $200m for free pathology tests as it continues to drag the government into its preferred territory of Medicare, forcing the government to react to each of the opposition’s policies while continuing to fight off what it sees as a Mediscare 2.0 campaign. For its part the government is trying to keep the focus on tax, releasing calculations for a range of professions, including those considered traditional Labor voters, to back its claim that workers earning more than $40,000 will be better off in 2024-25 under the Coalition’s plan. Meanwhile, Labor is just gearing up with its own attack on Peter Dutton, taking every opportunity to remind Victorian voters that he was very almost prime minister. Dutton might be a boon for the Coalition in WA, but he’s the exact opposite in Victoria. So far, the fight for his own seat of Dickson is keeping Dutton fairly contained within his electorate’s boundaries, with the Liberals trying to work out how, if any way, they will use the home affairs minister in their campaign. But today the campaign will all be competing with the heartbreaking scenes of Notre Dame burning. We’ll keep you up to date with the blow by blow of the day, so keep checking back. If only to see if I am still standing. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/05/scrapping-hinkley-for-renewable-alternatives-will-save-tens-of-billions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-05T05:01:27Z","webTitle":"Scrapping Hinkley for renewable alternatives would save 'tens of billions'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/05/scrapping-hinkley-for-renewable-alternatives-will-save-tens-of-billions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/05/scrapping-hinkley-for-renewable-alternatives-will-save-tens-of-billions","fields":{"headline":"Scrapping Hinkley for renewable alternatives would save 'tens of billions'","bodyText":"Scrapping plans for new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset and building huge amounts of renewable power instead would save the UK tens of billions of pounds, according to an analysis that compares likely future costs. The Intergenerational Foundation thinktank calculated that Britain would pay up to £40bn less for renewable alternatives that would generate the equivalent power to Hinkley over the plant’s planned lifetime. A final investment decision by EDF on the nuclear power plant’s expansion is expected in May. The deal involves the government committing £92.50 per megawatt hour over 35 years for its electricity output, more than twice the current wholesale price. But a report published on Tuesday by the thinktank, which campaigns on fairness between generations, found that onshore windfarms would cost £31.2bn less than Hinkley, and solar photovoltaic power £39.9bn less over 35 years to build and run. The estimate is based on both the value of subsidies paid by the taxpayer for the electricity and the cost of building the infrastructure. The analysis is based on the government’s ‘contracts for difference’ subsidy levels for the technologies and projections by Bloomberg for how the cost of wind and solar power will fall in the future. Andrew Simms, one of the report’s co-authors, said: “The government’s current plans for new nuclear power will break spending records, and pass both high costs and large, unknown economic risks onto every UK child for generations to come. “But, readily available, cheaper, safer and quicker renewable energy options would help Britain live both within its economic and environmental means, while also protecting and providing for future generations.” The report says that at £24bn, Hinkley Point C would be the “most expensive building on Earth”, and argues that the new reactors would pass not just economic costs to future generations, but the burdens of nuclear waste and climate change because nuclear is not quick enough to build at scale to stave off dangerous global warming. “An over-reliance on new nuclear capacity is expensive, poor value, slow, insecure and an obstacle to better alternatives. Without a rethink we risk passing on a huge intergenerational economic burden in which known costs are high, and risks exist heavily on the downside,” the report’s authors said. Tom Burke, chairman of the environmental thinktank E3G and a former government adviser, said that while the report’s precise figures for costs were debatable, the broad thrust of its analysis was correct. “The government essentially is pushing this cost on to future generations. It’s a terrible thing to do to your kids. There are a lot of kids not born yet who will end up paying for this,” he said. Lower wholesale electricity prices in future would mean that because of the way the contracts for difference work – by topping up payments for electricity to a guaranteed amount, or ‘strike price’, currently well above the wholesale price – the true cost could be much higher. “Trying to get a 35-year projection of your electricity price correct would have been like asking Tony Benn as energy minister in Harold Wilson’s government what the electricity price would be in 2013,” said Burke. Renewable power has grown in the UK to the point where more electricity was generated from biomass, wind, hydro and solar power in 2015 than nuclear power stations. But it is unlikely the Intergenerational Foundation’s report will shift minds in government, which has cut subsidies for both solar and wind power while pressing ahead with the Hinkley project. The analysis assumes the level of subsidy for solar and wind under the contracts for difference subsidy regime would remain constant, though in reality this would likely decrease as more capacity was built. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesperson said: “Nuclear can provide continuous power, irrespective of whether the wind is blowing and the sun is shining. The industry will also create thousands of jobs and benefit companies in the supply chain, meaning financial security for working people and their families across the UK. “We don’t recognise the figures presented in the report for the Intergenerational Foundation. Hinkley Point C is a good deal for consumers and, once operational will provide 60 years of secure, reliable and low-carbon electricity for the cost of 35. This will help us to keep the lights on while meeting our emissions targets in the most cost-effective way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jun/23/hinkley-point-cancel-theresa-may-hs2","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-23T09:02:28Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point is a terrible deal.

May must show courage and cancel it\r\n\r\n","bodyText":"They haven’t gone away. The great spending dinosaurs of the political dark ages, back before June 2017, are still roaming the jungle. Theresa May’s first decision as prime minister, to approve the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station, is still crashing about Whitehall. Now the national audit office (NAO) has added its voice to those calling it a really bad deal. The project now has no independent supporters. Hinkley was a hangover from when Whitehall’s energy department took leave of its senses and approved anything that looked remotely “green”. It just passed the bill to the Treasury. The Treasury then passed the risk to Chinese investors and French contractors. The risk proved so great that these backers swiftly passed it back to the Treasury and future British taxpayers and energy users, in loan guarantees and sky-high prices. As the French contractors saw their costs soar and risks rise, the burden of these guarantees soared. The Chinese and French have made British consumers the equivalent of a gargantuan payday loan. The case for the project, says the NAO, was “marginal” and the deal “not value for money”. That is auditor-speak for crazy. In which case, why does the NAO speak up only now? Hinkley Point is one of a group of French mega-reactors that have yet to work anywhere, and have become a byword for cost overruns and delays. Like most such ventures, they are so big as to get enmeshed in ministerial machismo, foreign diplomacy, lobbying and politics. That is how really bad decisions get made. No one sees the wood for the trees, and the dinosaur crashes on. May should have cancelled Hinkley on day one. There are already cheaper and less risky nuclear alternatives on the horizon. She lacked the nerve. Now her ramshackle coalition needs to take tough decisions on spending if it is to honour its promise to ease austerity. It must help the police, prisons, housing, schools and mental health services, among others. May has at least shown flexibility in her Queen’s speech this week. Nothing would signal more clearly a change of heart than for her to clear the ground of the vanities and extravagances of the David Cameron years. The government should postpone its fantastically expensive high-speed rail project, and redirect the money to northern intercity links. It should call a halt to an ever more inflated Heathrow. There should be an embargo on London Crossrails, super-sewers and garden bridges. And May should wriggle out of Hinkley. Whatever the cancellation costs, it will be cheaper in the long run."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/04/europe-faces-253bn-nuclear-waste-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-04T17:05:59Z","webTitle":"Europe faces €253bn nuclear waste bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/04/europe-faces-253bn-nuclear-waste-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/04/europe-faces-253bn-nuclear-waste-bill","fields":{"headline":"Europe faces €253bn nuclear waste bill","bodyText":"Europe is facing a €253bn bill for nuclear waste management and plant decommissioning which outstrips available funds by €120bn, according to a major stock-take of the industry by the European commission. The sum breaks down into €123bn for the decommissioning of old reactors and €130bn for the management of spent fuel, radioactive waste and deep geological disposal processes. Of the EU’s 16 nuclear nations, only the UK had enough money ring-fenced to cover the coming financial crunch, according to the Nuclear Illustrative Programme of the Commission (Pinc), which covers trends to 2050. Greenpeace EU’s energy policy adviser Tara Connolly said: “The €120bn figure is a whopping shortfall but it’s not surprising given that there is still no workable solution for the nuclear waste problem. With the huge resources needed to keep nuclear power alive, Europe could make a lot of progress towards a 100% renewable energy system instead.” Some 90% of the continent’s nuclear plants are set to shut by 2050 – almost half within the next decade – and the paper sets out a daunting picture of the scale of the challenge facing nuclear power: up to €500bn will be needed to meet the cost of new plant builds and lifetime extensions, it says. By 2050, a 47% increase in the cost of additional capacity is foreseen, combined with a 20% reduction in nuclear’s contribution to Europe’s electricity mix. Mark Lynas, a pro-nuclear environmental campaigner said: “If that is the case, the EU will not meet its CO2 targets. It is simply not possible for the continent of Europe to run modern lifestyles in cities and industry using renewables. It really is a straightforward choice: either get over this anti-nuclear paranoia or throw the climate targets out of the window.” The EU’s climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete struck an upbeat note, arguing that the report showed that Europe had “learned the lessons” from the Fukushima disaster, with its first ever examination of the costs of the whole nuclear lifecycle, based on data provided by EU states. He said: “Together, we should be able to identify ways to cooperate across Europe to ensure that knowledge about the safest use of nuclear power plants is shared, rather than done separately by each regulator, and that the management of radioactive waste is secured financially by member states until its final disposal.” Under EU conventions, national governments are ultimately responsible for the disposal of spent fuel and radioactive waste management. But the Green party reacted angrily to what they saw as an EU exemption of private operators from bearing clean-up costs. The Green MEP Claude Turmes said: “It is the nuclear operators who are liable to pay for the waste, not the taxpayer, so how can Canete put out a statement like this, openly flouting the ‘polluter pays’ principle?” More broadly, anti-nuclear groups criticised what Turmes called a “deliberate manipulation downwards of costs” by EU governments. At present, nuclear reactors make up 27% of Europe’s energy capacity and produce less carbon over their lifetime than fossil fuels such as gas, coal or oil. But no solution has yet been found for the long-term storage of radioactive waste. The commission’s experts considered closed fuel recycling of plutonium and uranium in ‘fast breeder reactors’ so long-term and uncertain a prospect that they did not forecast possible scenarios for its becoming available this century. That leaves Europe with an increasingly haggard fleet of large scale reactors, whose average age is over 30 years. Mini-reactors have been touted as one potential alternative, securing £250m of funding from George Osborne as an innovative nuclear technology. The report paints a mixed picture of their prospects, welcoming their potential but noting that they will have higher relative unit costs, lower economies of scale and burdens from licensing requirements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/11/brighton-rampion-wind-farm-turbines-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"It’s true, wind turbines are monstrous.

But I have learned to love them","bodyText":"Over the last few months I have been watching with mixed feelings as the Rampion wind farm emerges like a great monster from the sea off Brighton beach. It has happened so quickly: one morning in the early summer a few small grey stumps appeared on the previously flat horizon. Only weeks later, the first turbines were up, instantly giving the familiar sea view a new, industrial edge. Since then more and more have appeared, row upon row of them. Though they are eight miles offshore, they dominate the view from the beach now, and create strange optical illusions; in some weathers they look close, and in others very far away. Occasionally, on a seemingly clear day, they inexplicably disappear from view. There is no getting around the fact that this is a major development that has changed the landscape of the area forever. Rampion is one of the biggest wind farms in the UK; there are 116 turbines out there, each with a tower 80 metres tall and weighing 200 tonnes, topped off with three 55-metre blades. The developer, E.On, predicts that the farm will generate its first electricity before the end of the year (the project is – remarkably, when you think about the kind of delays that afflict the construction of nuclear power stations – running ahead of schedule). When it is fully up and running, the turbines will provide enough energy to supply almost 347,000 homes, nearly half the households in Sussex. Clearly, to oppose such a project at this time of climate crisis would be the worst kind of nimbyism. Nevertheless, I have to admit there was a part of me that would have preferred it to be doing its excellent work somewhere where I didn’t have to look at it. Over the summer I mourned the glorious, uninterrupted horizons that used to beckon from the end of many of the streets in my neighbourhood. I can totally understand why communities across Britain have resisted wind farms. It’s not just about house prices (although, let’s be honest, that often comes into it). The landscape around us feels personal; it has a huge impact on us. The flat horizon was one of the things that drew me to Brighton, when the pressures of living in London got too much. When we moved here, I had recently had two babies, and money and housing worries had tightened around us like a belt. Some days, during those last few months in the capital, I felt I could hardly breathe. The day we moved here, I sat on the beach and gazed at the horizon, and just couldn’t believe my luck. It was August, and the sea and sky were bright blue. There was nothing but water and sky for as far as I could see. I could almost feel my pulse rate slowing, my lungs filling with air. There is nothing like a sea view for creating a sense of calm and freedom, and looking out over a wall of turbines just isn’t the same: “They fenced in the sea!” was one distraught comment on our local Facebook group. However, as time has passed an unexpected thing has happened. Not only have I become used to the wind farm; I’ve grown fond of it. Rampion may be a towering presence, but it is a positive one, a daily reminder that – as Trump rips up the Paris agreement and blocks the latest round of climate talks in Bonn – progress is being made, albeit too slowly, and that there are people out there finding solutions. What’s more, there are clear signs that offshore developments such as Rampion might form an important part of a greener future for the UK. “The government realised that they were facing significant resistance to onshore wind farms, so they provided generous support for offshore projects like Rampion, even though at the time it wasn’t the most cost effective option,” says Dr Florian Kern of Sussex University. Offshore wind is now cheaper to produce than new gas, and far cheaper than nuclear – effectively removing the cost obstacle that has held renewables back for so long. When I look at the turbines, I appreciate them as a landmark, a sign of hope, and a much more fitting tribute to the spirit of Brighton than the ugly, extravagant new i360 “tourist attraction”. Considering the scope of the development, it is remarkable that there was little resistance to it, while it benefited from strong support from the local Green MP, Caroline Lucas. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the loudest opposition has come from the Tory-leaning rural areas outside Brighton, where cable has been laid across the South Downs (the prime exhibit being the hostile short film recently made by Simon Konecki, who lives near East Grinstead with his wife, the pop star Adele). I’m happy and proud to be part of a city that is, for the most part, cheerfully willing to do its bit for a brighter future. In fact, I now can’t wait until those giant blades start turning.• Alice O’Keeffe is a freelance literary critic and journalist and former deputy editor of the Guardian’s Saturday Review section"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/may/03/idea-of-renewables-powering-uk-is-an-appalling-delusion-david-mackay","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-03T15:30:52Z","webTitle":"Idea of renewables powering UK is an 'appalling delusion' – David MacKay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/03/idea-of-renewables-powering-uk-is-an-appalling-delusion-david-mackay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/may/03/idea-of-renewables-powering-uk-is-an-appalling-delusion-david-mackay","fields":{"headline":"Idea of renewables powering UK is an 'appalling delusion' – David MacKay","bodyText":"The idea that renewable energy can power the UK is an “appalling delusion”, according to the final interview given by former chief scientific adviser, the late Professor Sir David MacKay. The sensible energy and climate change plan for the UK, MacKay said, was for the country to focus on nuclear power and carbon capture storage technology, which traps the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning. In that scenario, the amount of wind and solar the UK needed would be almost zero, he said. However, solar could be a very important power source in other countries, he said, where sunny summers coincided with a big demand for electricity for air conditioning. Prof MacKay also said electric cars are going to be a “massive hit” but said he was “very disappointed” by the lack of progress on CCS, after the government cancelled a pioneering £1bn programme at the last minute. Prof MacKay was a physicist at the University of Cambridge and served as chief scientific adviser to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) from 2009-2014. He had gained public prominence after writing a book, Sustainable Energy - without the Hot Air, which assessed the potential of energy technologies from physical principles. The interview with author Mark Lynas was given 11 days before his death from cancer on 14 April and released with the permission of his wife. Prof MacKay argued that solar, wind and biomass energy would require too much land, huge battery back-ups and cost too much to be a viable option for the UK. “There is this appalling delusion that people have that we can take this thing that is currently producing 1% of our electricity and we can just scale it up and if there is a slight issue of it not adding up, then we can just do energy efficiency,” he said. “Humanity really does needs to pay attention to arithmetic and the laws of physics – we need a plan that adds up.” Prof MacKay had previously avoided being drawn into the political debate about energy, but told Lynas: “I have always tried to avoid advocating particular solutions but maybe because time is getting thinner I should call a spade a spade.” The key for the UK, he said, was a zero-carbon solution that works in the winter, when energy demand is highest but sunshine is lowest and winds can drop for days at a time. “The sensible thing to do for a country like the UK, I think, is to focus on CCS, which the world needs anyway, and nuclear,” said Prof MacKay. The decision on a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point, which the government hopes will be the first of a new generation of plants, has been delayed until September. “Then if you ask what is the optimal amount of wind and solar to add in then the answer is going to be almost zero,” he said. “I love wind turbines – they are the cathedrals of the modern age – but they are a waste of money if you have a low carbon solution that gets you through the winter … because when the wind blows you are going to have to either turn them down or something else down that you have already paid for like nuclear or CCS.” Prof MacKay acknowledged this plan was based on his “political value judgements” but added: “The [British public] do seem to care quite a lot about the cost so we should be looking for a low carbon solution that is low cost. If they had different values, the way the Germans seem to be – ‘we don’t care what our energy prices are’ – then maybe you come up with a different attitude and say let’s have the country be filled with wind turbines and big storage facilities.” Prof Mackay said civil servants in Decc had assessed solar and found the numbers did not add up for the UK: “The only reason solar got on the table was democracy. The MPs wanted to have a solar feed-in-tariff. So in spite of the civil servants advising ministers, ‘no, we shouldn’t subsidise solar’, we ended up having this policy. There was very successful lobbying by the solar lobbyists as well. So now there’s this widespread belief that solar is a wonderful thing, even though … Britain is one of the darkest countries in the world.” But Prof MacKay said all energy plans had to be country specific and solar was a good option for hot, sunny nations: “Anywhere you have a correlation between solar and demand, it definitely looks solar is going to be a really, really good idea.” He added: “Society stops functioning if we don’t have a reliable electricity system going all the time and so for places like Las Vegas, for example, you are still going to need other technologies in that mix. I’d advise Las Vegas to get a nuke.” Prof MacKay stressed the importance of CCS, endorsing other analyses that indicate that the costs of tackling climate change are much higher without the technology. “The lack of progress is very disappointing,” he said, “I had really hoped the UK would be one of the leaders of the development of CCS technology for the world. All the models show CCS is an essential technology, if you want to make cost effective climate change pathways. Asked what technologies he was optimistic about, Prof MacKay singled out electric cars as very promising: “I think electric vehicles are going to be a massive hit, just as people went from cassette to modern iPods. That is going to be a very positive development.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/21/storm-doris-could-blow-away-labour-byelection-hopes-mps-fear-copeland-stoke","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-21T18:39:46Z","webTitle":"Storm Doris could blow away Labour byelection hopes, MPs fear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/21/storm-doris-could-blow-away-labour-byelection-hopes-mps-fear-copeland-stoke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/21/storm-doris-could-blow-away-labour-byelection-hopes-mps-fear-copeland-stoke","fields":{"headline":"Storm Doris could blow away Labour byelection hopes, MPs fear","bodyText":"Gale-force winds and heavy rain could have a dramatic effect on turnout in the Copeland and Stoke byelections, Labour sources have said, with some fearing any negative effect could hand victory to the Conservatives in Cumbria. The Met Office is predicting significant disruption with an amber warning issued for a large band of the country stretching from northern Wales to Norfolk, where gusts of up to 80mph are forecast on Thursday. Some Labour MPs said they were becoming increasingly concerned about the effects of Storm Doris on turnout in Copeland and Stoke and those that had visited the seats said the Tory campaigns in both were growing in confidence. “Turnout is going to be the problem for us. I think people on a cold day in February will think: ‘Oh, why should I bother?’” one Labour MP said. “The Tories were only a handful of votes behind Ukip and I think they could even win in Stoke. If you’re an anti-Labour voter, and they are the majority in Stoke, you could decide to vote Tory. It could happen with a low turnout.” On the doorstep in Copeland, where Labour has a slim 2,564 majority, there was little enthusiasm to turn out and vote even among loyal Labour voters, the MP said. “People are just not bothered about whether the seat stays Labour,” they said. “Jeremy is definitely a factor and his very late delivery of a guarantee on Moorside was too late. Given his past record on nuclear power and on Trident, just down the road, it makes it too much for people to believe. “There is a general sense of disillusionment, and the most frequent response is: ‘I don’t know who to vote for’ – and then it means people are far more likely to stay at home.” However, another Labour source said a low turnout did not necessarily mean there would be a Conservative victory in Cumbria. “The Tories need people to turn out just as much as we do,” the source said. “We have a very strong ground operation up there. It is genuinely impressive and disciplined considering the geography. The messaging is, simply, we are committed to nuclear power and focused on saving the maternity services.” Another Labour backbencher believed the party’s relentless focus on the NHS would see them clinch Copeland, saying: “I am getting the sense that the NHS has really punched through, as indeed it should. Campaign issues-wise, this is almost the perfect byelection for us.” The exact timing and course of Storm Doris remains uncertain, the Met Office said, but it is forecasting gale-force winds late on Thursday morning. The warning states: “There is potential for a short-lived core of very strong winds to develop. While some disruption is expected outside of this stronger swath of winds, the amber area looks most likely to see more significant disruption.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/21/edf-faces-1m-a-day-bill-to-keep-french-nuclear-reactor-offline","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-21T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"EDF faces £1m a day bill to keep French nuclear reactor offline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/21/edf-faces-1m-a-day-bill-to-keep-french-nuclear-reactor-offline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/21/edf-faces-1m-a-day-bill-to-keep-french-nuclear-reactor-offline","fields":{"headline":"EDF faces £1m a day bill to keep French nuclear reactor offline","bodyText":"The prolonged closure of a major French atomic reactor after an explosion this month probably costs EDF at least £1m a day, according to experts. The nuclear plant operator, which will spend £18bn building the UK’s first new nuclear power station in a generation, shut unit 1 at its Flamanville plant after a fire broke out in the turbine hall. The company initially estimated it would switch on the reactor within a week, but later pushed the date to the end of March. Work begins this week on replacing damaged equipment. The unexpectedly long closure adds to the financial pressure on EDF, which last week reported a 6.7% decline in core earnings to €16.4bn (£14bn) in 2016. Closures of its French nuclear plants last year, partly for safety checks, have already cost the 85% state-owned company an estimated €1.3bn. Prof Neil C Hyatt, head of nuclear materials chemistry at the University of Sheffield, said the lost revenue from the reactor closure in Normandy could be £1m per day. “Bringing a nuclear power plant back online after an unscheduled outage is a complex task and EDF will want to ensure that all parts of the system are working safely and effectively. A short delay to complete the necessary checks is to be expected, given that the outage was unplanned,” he said. Another expert said the cost of closure could be up to £1.8m per day, depending on energy market prices, and questioned why there was a delay. “It took operator EDF almost a week to progressively correct the original outage estimate from one day to 50 days. EDF has provided no information as to why the outage time went from a few days to seven weeks,” said Mycle Schneider, a nuclear energy consultant based in Paris. The 1.3GW reactor at Flamanville is one of a dozen of EDF’s French nuclear fleet currently offline, which the company said was usual for this time of the year. It did not say why the restart date for the reactor had been revised four times, or why it had jumped from a few days to more than six weeks. John Large, a nuclear consultant who has advised the UK government, said initial reports that the fire was in a ventilator suggested the offline reactor would be back online within a week or two. Replacing such parts should be relatively straightforward, he said. He added that the plant’s continued closure would also add to headaches at the French grid operator RTE, which warned of power cuts at the start of winter due to nuclear outages. “The continuing impact on the grid is likely to be significant, especially if a cold snap develops,” Large said. A second reactor at the plant is still supplying electricity to the French grid. EDF said: “Work on recommissioning the affected equipment has started this week and should last several weeks, with reconnection to the grid planned for the end of March.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-nuclear-row-xi-jinping-china-uk-relations-g20-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-03T09:58:09Z","webTitle":"Hinkley row could overshadow May's G20 meeting with Xi Jinping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-nuclear-row-xi-jinping-china-uk-relations-g20-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-nuclear-row-xi-jinping-china-uk-relations-g20-summit","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May could face Hinkley Point C nuclear row at G20 meeting with Xi Jinping","bodyText":"Theresa May could face a diplomatic row with China at the G20 summit as she arrives for her first meeting with Xi Jinping, without having approved Beijing’s involvement in UK nuclear projects. The prime minister is set to meet the Chinese president on Monday after the summit in Hangzhou, where she will also have a press conference with the US president, Barack Obama, and hold a meeting with the Russian president, Vladmir Putin, on Sunday. It is May’s biggest outing to date on the world stage, but her visit threatens to be overshadowed by the lack of a decision on whether to proceed with the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, apparently caused by security concerns over Chinese involvement in Britain’s nuclear industry. She is travelling to China on Saturday. The £18bn project was due to be approved for construction by French company EDF, with a £6bn investment from China, before May placed the project under review in July. A UK official downplayed the importance of Hinkley Point as an issue at the G20 summit, insisting that the bilateral meeting with Xi was about a much broader set of topics. “They will talk about a range of issues,” the official said. “We have set out the government’s approach to Hinkley, which is that we are currently considering all the component parts. We have said we will make a decision this month. That remains the plan. I do not expect one in the next few days. I don’t think our Chinese or French partners are expecting one in the next few days.” Chinese officials have given a series of veiled warnings in recent weeks that Britain halting their investment in UK nuclear would be seen as a snub and a sign that a golden era of relations between the two countries had lost some of its sheen. Hinkley Point was raised last week when Lucy Neville-Rolfe, the energy minister, made a low-profile trip to China connected with her second brief of intellectual property. However, UK government sources insisted that Lady Neville-Rolfe would have only reiterated the official position on Hinkley that Britain is considering all the component parts of the project. There has been speculation that May could be happy to allow China to proceed with its Hinkley investment, but does not want Beijing to be involved in building a plant at Bradwell, Essex, or helping develop one at Sizewell, Suffolk. This suggestion is not understood to have gone down well in Beijing, which could abandon plans for the entire nuclear sector if the UK demands to decouple Hinkley from the other two projects, in which China would have a more active involvement. On Friday night, the Financial Times reported that a senior figure at EDF has said the Treasury or another investor may have to step in to save the deal, although the company denied that this was the official position. It is understood that executives from EDF met Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, on Thursday to press the case for Hinkley to be built. Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy secretary, said: “I don’t think [May’s] going to allow the Chinese to do Sizewell and Bradwell. I think she would be happy to have them involved in the financing of Hinkley, but I think informal soundings with the Chinese have come back and said: ‘Don’t even think about offering us that. Do you think we are interested in this for the return on a poxy £6bn? We are a Chinese state company and what we’re really interested in is being able to build 2.5 nuclear reactors in the most stringent regulatory regime in the world’. “They are so angry about this and apoplectic about what she is proposing. I think we will see a very clear slapdown from president Xi and an end of the golden era that was supposed to start last year.” Gardiner said May had a tricky decision to make over Hinkley, given that it was a bad value deal, but trade with China is crucial as Britain negotiates its departure from the EU. “The point is that we should be investing in our own future infrastructure. We have an opportunity to do it at the lowest possible cost. I believe that if she does ditch the Chinese deal, at least have the common sense for the Treasury to put in the money ourselves if she believes that project needs to be delivered,” he said. The prevarication over Hinkley threatens to undermine May’s message at the summit that the UK intends to be “open for business ... [and] will continue to be a strong and dependable partner [after the Brexit vote]”. Other topics to be discussed at the summit include global growth, counter-terrorism and international free trade. May is expected to stress that militants must be prevented from gaining a foothold in sub-Saharan Africa, away from territory in Syria, Iraq and Libya. The prime minister, who turned down an invitation for her husband, Philip, to attend the summit, is expecting to take the opportunity to have face-to-face encounters with other world leaders in bilateral meetings and “brush bys”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/apr/26/edf-executives-called-mps-explain-hinkley-point-delay","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-26T14:07:07Z","webTitle":"EDF executives called back by MPs to explain Hinkley Point delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/26/edf-executives-called-mps-explain-hinkley-point-delay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/apr/26/edf-executives-called-mps-explain-hinkley-point-delay","fields":{"headline":"EDF executives called back by MPs to explain Hinkley Point delay","bodyText":"EDF executives have been called back to parliament to explain why they have further delayed making an investment decision on a planned £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. MPs on the energy and climate change committee want to hear from EDF chiefs after the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, said the final decision could be delayed until September – four months later than expected. Angus MacNeil, the chair of the committee, said: “When EDF appeared before us in March, company bosses were insisting that a decision would be made in May. At that hearing, we said that we would call them back in if that timetable slipped again and that’s what we are doing now.” The committee said it expected the hearing to take place in late May. “If Hinkley does not go ahead, it could have huge implications for our future energy security and efforts to cut climate-changing emissions. We will therefore be watching progress on this closely. If we have to see EDF back here in September as well, we will,” MacNeil said. Macron told a French newspaper that various prerequisites would have to be met before EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, could go ahead with building two reactors at Hinkley Point C. An improvement in EDF’s financial position and consultation with French trade unions were among the conditions needing to be satisfied in order for the project to go ahead, he said. “The final investment decision could be confirmed next September,” Macron added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/11/uk-green-energy-expensive-not-any-more-from-now-on-its-cheap","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T11:38:12Z","webTitle":"UK green energy expensive?

Not any more. From now on it's cheap","bodyText":"The persistent myth that green energy is expensive has been shredded by the revelation that windfarms will be built around Britain’s coast far more cheaply than new nuclear reactors. New power stations in the UK today are usually only built with the certainty provided by subsidies paid through energy bills, so the record low guaranteed price awarded to the developers of three new mega offshore windfarms today is, first and foremost, welcome news for consumers. It is also good for the economy post-Brexit, for the foreign-owned developers behind the multibillion-pound projects, and the increasingly UK-based supply chain that supports them, such as Siemens’ £310m wind turbine factory in Hull. But there is no mistaking the fact that the low prices, labelled “astonishing”, “exceptional” and “astounding”, are terrible news for nuclear proponents. Ministers last year awarded French state-owned EDF £92.50 per megawatt hour of power generated by two new reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The price is nearly twice that of wholesale power and is goldplated by being inflation-linked and written in stone for 35 years. EDF said this week that future nuclear plants, such as the new one it wants to build at Sizewell in Suffolk, would be cheaper than Hinkley. But even the most vociferous nuclear supporters think that Sizewell C and a Japanese-backed bid to build new reactors at Wylfa in Wales would not come in below £80 per MWh, compared with the £57.50 per MWh over 15 years for new offshore windfarms. Ironically for the party that champions free market economics, the Conservatives’ commitment to a fleet of new nuclear power plants is being challenged by competition. Windfarm developers have to compete against one another in a reverse auction, ensuring the government gets the cheapest price for the low carbon power it needs. The price this time crashed so much that only £176m-a-year of the £240m subsidy pot set aside by officials will be needed. The timescales and monolithic nature of nuclear projects means it would be hard, albeit not impossible, for the government to run a competitive process for them. Playing EDF off against consortiums such as Horizon, which is behind Wylfa, is not really an option. Of course, wind power is variable, unlike the steady power provided by nuclear, so there are costs to the energy system of integrating all those new turbines. But experts say those costs are relatively negligible, especially if coupled with flexible and smart technologies such as batteries, which the government is backing with hundreds of millions of pounds. So large-scale renewable power built in the next decade will be inarguably much cheaper than nuclear. But it’s not just about cost – offshore windfarms can be built quicker, too. Their modular nature means they can be built in stages, and offshore wind generally has a good track record of being built on time in the UK. The projects that won subsidies this week should be operational by 2023. By comparison, Hinkley Point C is officially slated to be operational by 2025 but EDF admitted earlier this year that it could run 15 months over schedule. And the track record of plants being built with Hinkley’s reactor design is infamous: Olkiluoto in Finland is a decade behind schedule; the other, at Flamanville in France, is six years late. The price awarded to offshore windfarms is also even lower than new gas power plants, but this week’s auction is unlikely to spell the death of gas, which can be built much more cheaply and quickly than nuclear. Witness the German utility Uniper publicly mulling over the idea of taking apart its gas power stations in Germany and rebuilding them in the UK. But today could be, as the trade group RenewableUK puts it, a “gamechanger” for ministers in charge of setting energy policy. With a major government review of the cost of energy due out in October, there are calls for Theresa May to at the very least commit to further support for offshore wind and, more radically, to drop plans for new nuclear. It’s become clear which way the wind is blowing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/mar/20/secret-hinkley-point-documents-set-for-hearing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-20T16:09:13Z","webTitle":"Row over 'secret' Hinkley Point documents set to reach tribunal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/20/secret-hinkley-point-documents-set-for-hearing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/mar/20/secret-hinkley-point-documents-set-for-hearing","fields":{"headline":"Row over 'secret' Hinkley Point documents set to reach tribunal","bodyText":"An 18-month battle to discover the true cost to consumers of building the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors is to come to a climax in London. The information commissioner has been blocking freedom of information requests to publish subsidy documents held by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. However, it has finally agreed to hold an oral hearing on the issue. The decision comes just days before EDF’s chief executive in Britain, Vincent de Rivaz, faces a grilling from MPs about the £18bn cost of Hinkley, which is underwritten through subsidies and customer bills. EDF is yet to make a final decision on whether to go ahead with the project and MPs have said there are “serious questions” to answer about Hinkley’s viability. EDF’s finance director quit over concerns about Hinkley’s impact on the already heavily indebted company. However, David Cameron and François Hollande have strongly backed the project as “a pillar of the bilateral relationship” and “a key aspect of Britain’s energy policy”. The government has agreed to pay £92.50 a megawatt hour for Hinkley’s electricity, double the wholesale price when the deal was reached. Greenpeace and Request Initiative, a Freedom of Information Act specialist, has been trying since 2014 to obtain the contents of seven documents that are understood to contain further details about the subsidies for Hinkley. They were submitted to the European commission as justification for the need to provide state aid, which is generally against competition rules. Greenpeace said it was extraordinary that theinformation commissioner had been supporting DECC’s wish to keep vital information away from the public. The environmental group now hopes progress can be made at an Information Tribunal hearing expected to take place in London in May. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, said: “Bizarrely, the Information Commissioner and DECC are hell bent on keeping the evidence showing Hinkley is a good idea for Britain a secret. The reports we have been trying to see for 18 months illustrate the assumptions that DECC used to decide that Hinkley is the best bet to power Britain in the future. “We think it’s hard to think of any reason it should be kept secret unless the evidence shows that Hinkley isn’t such a good idea. The argument it has to remain a secret because it would damage the government’s negotiations is now over because the negotiations have finished. “Today’s school leavers will be paying for Hinkley until they’re about to draw their pensions, the government should tell future generations what they are paying for and why.” The information in the documents was largely prepared for ministers by advisers such as KPMG, Poyry and Oxera, with modelling work and scenario planning by DECC itself. The preliminary view of the bureaucrats in Brussels was that the measures constituted unlawful financial support, but the final decision reversed this and gave the UK government the green light. Greenpeace asked for access to the documents ands then launched a freedom of information request for them to be handed over, which was opposed by DECC. The information commissioner initially agreed to withhold the documents on the grounds that “the reports contain and discuss matters of a sensitive commercial nature and the information was provided to DECC in the expectation that it would be treated as confidential”. It also accepted that the disclosure of the information would “disadvantage the government in the context of future negotiations with other (nuclear plant) developers”. The commissioner said there is a strong public interest in disclosing the contents of the documents. but said this was overridden by the other considerations around commercial sensitivity. But despite this, it has accepted that an oral hearing is “appropriate” in this case. The information commissioner said he had no further comments to make ahead of the hearing but DECC justified its commitment to keeping the documents under wraps. A spokesperson for the department said: “The decision to withhold these documents is due to commercial sensitivity in accordance with exceptions set out in the Environmental Information Regulations. “The information commissioner supported this decision and we appreciate that this is now is the subject of a live appeal and we can’t comment any further whilst the appeal process is ongoing.” EDF itself has always argued that it is totally committed to transparency, saying this would separate the nuclear industry from the secrecy that characterised it in the past. Last September de Rivaz said: “At EDF Energy, transparency is at the heart of everything we do. It is our responsibility, as the custodians of Britain’s nuclear fleet, to be transparent, open and receptive to questions. “We are approaching the Final Investment Decision for our new nuclear project Hinkley Point C. As we do, scrutiny has naturally increased. Just as we embrace transparency, we welcome scrutiny. We relish challenge based on facts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/may/26/riot-police-crack-down-on-paris-protests-against-labour-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-26T17:45:42Z","webTitle":"Riot police crack down on Paris protests against labour reforms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/riot-police-crack-down-on-paris-protests-against-labour-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/may/26/riot-police-crack-down-on-paris-protests-against-labour-reforms","fields":{"headline":"Riot police crack down on Paris protests against labour reforms","bodyText":"Riot police arrested 16 people and fired teargas in violent clashes with protesters marching in Paris as striking workers continued to blockade refineries and nuclear power stations in an escalating stand-off over labour reforms. Tens of thousands of people marched across France in protest against François Hollande’s planned labour bill, which aims to make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers and was forced through parliament without a vote this month following more than ten weeks of protests. Police fired teargas at about 100 people on the edge of a protest march through Paris. Several masked people charged shop windows, smashing them, and cars were damaged near the route of the march. There were skirmishes at Place de la Nation as riot officers cordoned off protesters, some of whom complained of heavy-handed policing. In Caen in Normandy, the website Normandie Actu filmed what it called a case of police violence as an officer appeared to repeatedly kick a demonstrator on the ground. The police described the incident as legitimate defence. Police estimated between 18,000 and 19,000 people took to the streets in Paris, an increase on the last national demonstration day against the labour reforms. Unions put the figure at 100,000. Street marches took place in towns and cities across France, including Toulouse, Bordeaux and Nantes. Striking French workers continued to disrupt oil refineries and nuclear power stations, halted some air traffic and trains and prevented almost all national newspapers from printing in the growing industrial action. Union activists blocked roads and bridges in northern France while some train drivers and air traffic controllers joined the action. With just two weeks to go before France hosts around 2 million visitors at the showpiece Euro 2016 football tournament, the government is under increasing pressure to find an end to the dispute and stage some kind of climbdown. More disruption is expected next week and unions have called for rolling strikes on the Paris Metro to start on the day of the opening Euro 2016 football match on 10 June. But the government vowed to stand firm and refused to abandon its reforms. The prime minister, Manuel Valls, insisted the law would not be withdrawn, but said it might still be possible to make “changes” or “improvements”. He told the Senate: “You cannot blockade a country, you cannot attack the economic interests of France in this way,” branding the CGT union “irresponsible”. He brushed aside signs that some in the ruling Socialist party were buckling, such as the finance minister Michel Sapin, who suggested the most contested part of the legislation could be rewritten – namely a contentious clause that gives individual companies more of a free hand in setting working conditions. Hollande has framed the labour reforms as a crucial loosening of France’s famously rigid labour protections, cutting red-tape and slightly tweaking some of the more cumbersome rules that deter employers from hiring. This would, he argued, make France more competitive and tackle stubborn mass unemployment that tops 10% of the workforce. But after more than two months of street demonstrations against the labour changes, the hardline CGT union has radically intensified its strategy and is now trying to choke-off the nation’s fuel supply to force Hollande to abandon the reforms it sees as a betrayal of workers’ rights. Members of the CGT union continued to insist they wanted the reforms scrapped entirely, not merely modified. “It’s inadmissible,” Arnaud Pacot of the CGT union in the Aube region of eastern France told BFM TV from a nuclear plant being blocked by activists. A third of petrol stations across France were empty or dangerously low on fuel after several days of blockades at refineries. The government has started using its strategic fuel reserves and forcing depots to reopen, but supplies are still limited and purchases are being rationed. Five of the country’s eight refineries are still either halted or operating at reduced capacity. Many motorists were still in long queues around petrol stations across France. Companies ranging from gardeners and hauliers to florists trying to deliver flowers for French Mother’s Day this weekend complained about the impact on business. The CGT said all but three of France’s 19 nuclear power stations had voted to stop work in a country that gets 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. RTE, the body overseeing the national power network, said the stoppages had not had an immediate effect on the electricity supply, but “if it worsens, it will have an impact on the management of the network”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2017/apr/25/guardian-weekly-letters-28-april","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-25T12:59:06Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 28 April 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/apr/25/guardian-weekly-letters-28-april","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/apr/25/guardian-weekly-letters-28-april","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 28 April 2017","bodyText":"The real cost of bombing The use of one of the US military’s largest non-nuclear explosive devices – the Moab – to kill jihadis in Afghanistan is baffling in more than just military and economic terms (21 April). What is consistently overlooked, besides the effect on the natural world, is that the dropping of the bomb also involved the destruction of the vast resources – human, material and financial – that were utilised in its development and manufacture. This has an economic cost that is disregarded by conventional economics. The American corporations were paid, the US government recorded the production as a positive contribution to GDP and the country got richer, right? Wrong. The effort expended to create this destructive force can also be argued to have destroyed previously existing wealth in the form of resources that could have been used for beneficial purposes. Geoff Naylor Winchester, UK McGuinness’s legacy The piece on the future of Ireland after Martin McGuinness (14 April) paints a picture that is not shared by all those from Northern Ireland. To refer to him as “a hero” and “a towering figure in Irish history” presents an idealised perspective in denial of his past as a terrorist and key figure in the IRA. Brexit has crystallised questions about the future of Northern Ireland: whether the province will stay in the UK or consider becoming part of a united Ireland. Yet it is presumptuous to ponder these issues when the political future in Northern Ireland has yet to be decided. Talks on resurrecting a power-sharing government may fail, raising the possibility of another election in Northern Ireland or even direct rule from Westminster. Whatever the outcome, it is hoped that it will be in the best interests of Northern Ireland. Una Williamson Bexley, NSW, Australia • Lisa O’Carroll is right to advance the view that Martin McGuinness’s concentration on “the things that join us in a common humanity” is the way forward at a time of “extraordinary upheaval in Northern Ireland”. Certainly that approach aligns with the thinking of the Martin McGuinness I met in Adelaide in December 2000. He was here on a largely unheralded visit as Northern Ireland’s education minister in the new power sharing arrangement to draw attention to the progress being made in the implementation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. This was minister of education McGuinness – not the McGuinness of the bombs and bullets: a prime example of someone who was yesterday’s terrorist and today’s statesman. McGuinness showed strong empathy for the young people of Northern Ireland and the need to repair the damage done to them by the conflict. These young people, he said, “want to lead a normal life … in a society where there [aren’t] soldiers and military vehicles driving about all over the place – where there [isn’t] death on the streets.” Let’s hope his legacy can carry the day at a time when peace in Northern Ireland does indeed remain fragile. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia The importance of protest In her article Protest and Persist (7 April), Rebecca Solnit quotes LA Kaufman’s claim that the first significant action against nuclear power occurred in 1976. In the early 1960s the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PGE) proposed building a nuclear power station on Bodega Head, about 65km north of San Francisco. PGE had already dug the hole for the core of the reactor before a group of protesters, led by Joe Neilands and the Sierra Club, got wind of the proposal. They mounted a protest that led to PGE abandoning the plan. Geologists who examined the excavation on Bodega Head at the behest of the protesters reported that the San Andreas fault ran through it. Tony Warren Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Celebrating Easter Peter Ormerod’s justifiable rant (14 April) about the absurdity of chocolate Easter eggs overlooked the Easter bunny. In Australia we celebrate of all things the fertility and fecundity of our worst-ever vertebrate pest. Twenty-four wild rabbits were brought to Victoria in 1859. By the turn of the century about 2 billion ravaged the countryside despite massive episodes of shooting, trapping, poisoning, fumigating, warren ripping, corralling and netting fences. Only the myxoma virus in 1950 ended the rabbit plagues. Several Australian chocolate manufacturers now celebrate the Easter bilby, a native burrower, rather than the rabbit. Some materially support bilby conservation and rabbit control while others treat it solely as a marketing opportunity. Cute as it is, the bilby will never be domesticated and has little to do with Easter. But if can come to symbolise a rebirth of nature after man’s foolishness, then it could be a very good thing.

Just yesterday it emerged that hundreds of fake Twitter accounts believed to be linked to the Kremlin had been used to influence British politics. The pattern is too uniform and widespread to be an accident. So what’s going on? Russian leaders have taken a cool look at the world and decided that they have nothing to lose. In their eyes, the west has consistently sought to humble Russia. In June, Vladimir Putin described the economic sanctions in place since the Crimean annexation of 2014 as merely the latest phase in the west’s aggressive activity, going back to the Soviet decades and even to the days of the tsars. Trouble, he declared, comes in a rush whenever “Russia has begun to stand on its own feet”. He is not the only one to think this way. His close associates voice still more rancid variations on Russian victimhood. Sergei Naryshkin, director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, argues that the sanctions are not only punitive but illegal. Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev accuses the west of taking control of Chechnya in the 1990s and having the ultimate ambition of breaking up the Russian Federation. These madhouse ideas are born out of resentment at Russia’s tumble down the slopes from superpowerdom. Less unhinged are the complaints about how the Nato countries behaved in the years of Russian frailty. Russian ministers continually dwell on the west’s aerial bombardment of Belgrade in 1999 and its subsequent recognition of the breakaway state of Kosovo. Russia accepts that it is no longer a world power but asks, if the Americans can meddle violently in European affairs, why can’t the Russians? Except that Putin never admits to meddling. When Donald Trump asked him at last week’s Asian summit whether his agencies had interfered in the American presidential election, Putin sulkily denied the charge. He is like a schoolboy moaning that all the teachers are against him. Having gone through KGB training, Putin knows how to tell a barefaced lie, and Trump refuses to act the grumpy headmaster. It is doubtful that the Russian authorities in 2016 genuinely banked on getting Trump elected. But the disruption and discrediting of American politics were definite objectives. The Russians succeeded too well for their own good. The role they played in helping Trump’s ascent to power was so sensational that members of both Republican and Democratic parties have found common cause in looking for signs of treachery by Vladimir’s best friend Donald. Although the American campaign might have been a foray too far, the offensives in Europe have achieved much that the Kremlin desired. In 2014 Russian finance made a friend of Viktor Orbán in Hungary with a generous long-term loan to build a nuclear power station. Orbán stood by Putin’s side in Moscow to celebrate the contract, and Putin could take satisfaction from the success in weaning a European leader off the breast of EU unity. Putin already counted Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi among his boon companions, a friendship interrupted only by the Italian premier’s fall from grace in 2013. But prime ministers are not the Russian’s only quarries. The aim of dissolving Europe’s already shaky concord was pursued this year by assisting Marine Le Pen’s presidential bid after French banks refused to lend their money to the Front National. Le Pen didn’t win. But her loud protests against both the EU and its treatment of Russia would have made any financial assistance by the Kremlin worthwhile. Stories have grown in credibility that Russian funding also helped the Brexit side in the 2016 UK referendum. Though the May government has ignored Labour MP Ben Bradshaw’s demand for a public inquiry, Theresa May’s speech at London’s Guildhall this Monday included a general rebuke about Russia’s persistent political meddling. If recent Russian opinion polls are anything to go by, Putin will gain from being censured by foreigners. There’s a directness about him that many Russians revere. What he has, he intends to hold, and that includes Crimea. What he hasn’t got, however, is a vibrant economy. His long years in the highest offices of states have been wasted on armaments and wars, instead of being devoted to achieving the overdue diversification of the Russian economy. Putin has come to view world politics as a zero-sum contest. He delights in seeing the EU crippled by internal disagreements. He takes equal pleasure in what he claims to be the unity of Russian public life. Rejecting international criticism of his authoritarianism, he depicts the Russian people as content with the benefits he has brought them. With or without Brexit, he is probing weak spots in Europe on the basic principle of making them weaker. He no longer makes a secret of what he is up to. A month ago he talked openly about the need for “creative destruction” as his prerequisite for the building of a new world order. Destroying the links that bind and strengthen Europe’s many nations individually and collectively is the Kremlin’s tried-and-tested strategy. The Russian leadership seeks to do what it accuses the Americans of wanting to do in Russia. The west has yet to show it has a plan to counteract the solvents that the Russians have injected into its democratic processes. • Robert Service is working on an account of Russian politics since 2012.

Just about the only person in his administration who believes abrogating the agreement isn’t dangerously foolish is Trump himself. But he promised his loyal base, Fox News and Steve Bannon, he would dump the accord. How can Trump keep his base happy, assuage his fragile ego and not blow up the world? Until yesterday, Trump seemed to be hemmed in and contained by the unofficial “Committee to Save America”. As the Senate foreign relations chairman, Bob Corker, said: “Secretary [Rex] Tillerson, Secretary [James] Mattis and Chief of Staff [John] Kelly are those people who help separate our country from chaos.” In congressional testimony last month, Mattis and General Joseph Dunford Jr, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, reaffirmed their qualified support for the Iran deal. Our entire national security apparatus, including Kelly, agree Iran is in basic compliance and the deal is working. The actual scientific, objective monitoring of the Iran deal is done by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency. Their inspectors constantly examine information transmitted around the clock by surveillance cameras, online monitors and fiber-optic seals on nuclear equipment. It’s the most intensive and technologically advanced inspection regime in history. Seven times, IAEA has certified that Iran is meeting its obligations. All the signatories to the pact, including China and Russia, are relatively satisfied with the progress that has been made. While the deal only slows Iran’s progress to becoming a nuclear power, none of our allies or any of the signatories are willing to re-open the agreement. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said last month he would not renegotiate. Failure by the United States to keep our word would play directly into the hands of Iranian hardliners who have always hated any cooperation with the west, and would love to be able to brandish a nuclear bomb. Almost everyone agrees that Trump’s radical thinking is simply unthinkable. Trump has loudly and repeatedly condemned the deal as an embarrassment to America and has sworn to kill it. “Believe me.” He has Bannon and Breitbart howling on his heels, along with most of the rabid rightwing noise machine. To make matters worse, he’s still facing a backlash from his base on “repeal and replace”, the Daca (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) deal with Democrats, and his “wealthfare” tax plan. Just as important to Trump, the Iran deal was one of Obama’s crowning achievements, and Trump just despises Obama. Because the former president made sport of him in public, Trump’s narcissism demands he take every opportunity to revenge himself by obliterating every possible Obama accomplishment. What to do? A peculiar pattern of Trumpian behavior is emerging. First, his fragile ego forbids him to ever take responsibility for anything. Ever. Second, because he craves the adulation of his base, he will to shift blame or throw any and all supporters and allies under the bus. So, just like the Obamacare “repeal and replace” fiasco, or the DACA deal, or his tax reform plan, Trump dodges the ball. He throws the hot potato to Congress, throws up his hands, walks away and points fingers. When he decertifies the deal, Congress will have 90 days to consider his action and decide whether to re-impose sanctions. They must introduce, debate and pass legislation on the sanctions or his decertification means exactly nothing. Right now, there seems to be no appetite in Congress to touch the Iran deal. Still, there will be pressure on Congress to make a few cosmetic changes, just to save face. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas has proposed new stipulations for US participation, including eliminating “sunset clauses”, which allow some Iranian nuclear activities to resume after several years, as well as tougher inspections and additional restrictions on Iran’s missile programs. None of which are acceptable to Iran, and would probably destroy whatever limited diplomatic and economic re-engagement has been achieved. But neither Corker nor majority leader Mitch McConnell say they are ready to move any sanctions bills, and neither are Democratic leaders in either body. Facing a legislative calendar already crowded with must-pass bills, and mid-term elections on the horizon, it’s hard to see how Congress could act on sanctions even if they wanted to. So for Trump, it’s like having your cake and eating it too. He gets to tell his base he’s trying to kill the plan, but the “deep state” and Congress are standing in the way. It’s brilliant. Voila! The Iran deal holds. The world avoids armageddon and Trump can blame Congress. His base stays happy with him and angry at the “deep state”. Dissatisfaction with the institutions of government continues to fester. And Trump skips merrily along. This feels a lot more like dodgeball than leadership.

In a French television interview on Thursday, she was asked whether Hinkley Point would be postponed. “It’s still under discussion,” Royal replied. “There’s an agreement between France and Britain, so things should go ahead. But the trade unions are right to ask for the stakes to be re-examined.” Asked if she was in favour of a postponement, Royal ducked the question and said she would not make rash comments. However, the minister added that while she did not want to “decisively throw the project into question just like that”, there should be “further proof” that the £18bn venture was “well-founded” and would not affect investment in renewable energy. EDF, the energy company controlled by the French government, has still not made a firm commitment to build the new nuclear power station. Its board is expected to make a final decision on the project at its next meeting on 11 May. Last week an EDF board member called for Hinkley Point C to be postponed, in the latest sign of discord at the top of the French energy company over the troubled project. Christian Taxil, an employee director, said a raft of changes to the Somerset reactor scheme agreed over the past three years significantly raised the risk for EDF. The dissent follows weeks of behind the scenes bickering and the resignation last month of EDF finance director, Thomas Piquemal, despite continual promises from EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Lévy that the controversial project will go ahead. EDF has been hit by falling power prices, cost overruns on other projects, and demands to upgrade French nuclear reactors to make them safer. Its Paris-listed shares are down by almost 60% over the past 12 months. The company is being compelled by the French government to buy the reactors division of Areva, which is also state-controlled. Areva’s European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) technology is slated to be used at Hinkley Point. However, the first power station to use it – which is being built in Finland – is running nine years behind schedule due to problems and cost overruns. The problems had left Areva virtually bankrupt after four years of losses. Concerns about the EPR technology has also delayed EDF’s construction of another EPR reactor at Flamanville, on France’s west coast. Its budget has gone from €3bn to €10.5bn and it is running six years late. Building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley has been heavily backed by the UK government in order to keep the lights on in Britain. The last of the UK’s coal-fired power stations will be closed in 2025. Simon Taylor, a specialist in nuclear financing and a lecturer at Cambridge University, said last month that the Hinkley project appeared to be “poor value for money” and it would be best if the French government abandoned it. “It would preserve the rest of the nuclear options in the UK, as it would not cast any doubt on the UK’s underlying commitment,” he said. “But if the UK cancels the project it could jeopardise all the other projects in the pipeline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/12/uk-climate-change-masterplan-grownups-finally-won-clean-growth-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T12:32:53Z","webTitle":"UK climate change masterplan – the grownups have finally won","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-climate-change-masterplan-grownups-finally-won-clean-growth-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-climate-change-masterplan-grownups-finally-won-clean-growth-strategy","fields":{"headline":"UK climate change masterplan – the grownups have finally won","bodyText":"The grownups have finally won and everyone in the UK, from those in cold homes to those on polluted streets and in flooded towns, will benefit. The most important aspect of the UK government’s new clean growth strategy is its unequivocal statement that tackling climate change and a prosperous economy are one and the same thing. This has been clear to many for some time, including Philip Hammond, if not his predecessor George Osborne. There is no long-term, high-carbon economic strategy because the impacts of unchecked climate change destroy economies, as Lord Nicholas Stern puts it. But the Conservative party has long been swinging between the green dream and fossil-fuelled fantasies. David Cameron went from pledging the “greenest government ever” to dismissing the “green crap” in three years. Recent years have seen one green policy shredded after another, destroying confidence among the businesses we need to deliver a low-carbon economy. The new strategy published on Thursday signals a new, if belated, beginning. It is the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel age: it is highly notable that the government plan omits any mention of fracking, having previously been its cheerleader. The government had to produce this plan under its own climate laws to explain how it will get on track to meet the nation’s legally binding carbon targets in 2030 and beyond. But ministers have rightly made a virtue of the plan’s necessity. The proposals themselves are ambitious but lack concrete suggestions in many areas. However, ambition always precedes action and there are plenty of groups, not least the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, who will hold ministers to account. If the government’s efforts to cut emissions from buildings have been slow, it is now taking seriously the need to address energy efficiency. Energy that isn’t used – negawatts – are by far the cheapest way to cut both emissions and energy bills. But as the vast failure of the green deal showed, efficiency is hard to make happen and it is here where firm plans are most urgently needed. Along with heating, transport also needs urgent action – emissions here have been rising. There is plenty in the new plan to harness the surging market for electric vehicles, though little of it is new. Ministers have also once again failed to explain how expanding aviation with Heathrow’s third runway fits with its climate change plan. Electric cars will need clean power and the UK’s electricity grid is already greening fast – coal power has fallen from 40% to 2% in the last five years. The new plan rightly builds on the UK’s success in dramatically driving down the cost of offshore wind power, yet it all but ignores an even cheaper source – onshore wind. It seems that even the conviction that the green economy is the UK’s future is not enough to face down the rural Tory-voting minority who continue to tilt at windmills. Solar power also seems destined to suffer the same fate. Despite looking these gift horses in the mouth, and ignoring tidal power, the plan promises yet more cash for those with their snouts in the nuclear trough. The hyper-expensive Hinkley Point farce has not dulled the appetite for more new nuclear power and it intends to plough by far the biggest sum of its innovation funding into the one energy technology where costs are always rising. But the biggest worry is the very limited support for carbon capture and storage, the technology that takes emissions from fossil fuels and buries them under the ground. CCS is seen as absolutely vital by the Committee on Climate Change, the National Audit Office and the UN’s climate science panel and the UK’s emptying North Sea fields are perfectly placed carbon reservoirs. But CCS gets only about a quarter of the investment of nuclear and just a tenth of the £1bn promised in the plan so abruptly canned by Osborne in 2015. Trees are natural carbon stores and the new plan pledges to “establish a new network of forests in England, including new woodland on farmland”, which offers a tantalising glimpse of the radical change to farm subsidies that may follow Brexit. But there is no mention of the reduction in meat consumption deemed essential in beating global warming by scientists. However, while many of the details are missing, the clean growth strategy marks an important and vital step forward for the UK. As the prime minister Theresa May says in the plan’s foreword: “Clean growth is not an option, but a duty we owe to the next generation. Success in this mission will improve our quality of life and increase our economic prosperity.” The strategy is now crystal clear – it is time to deliver."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jan/16/labour-mps-press-jeremy-corbyn-for-clearer-stance-on-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-16T20:25:03Z","webTitle":"Labour MPs press Jeremy Corbyn for clearer stance on Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/labour-mps-press-jeremy-corbyn-for-clearer-stance-on-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jan/16/labour-mps-press-jeremy-corbyn-for-clearer-stance-on-europe","fields":{"headline":"Labour MPs press Jeremy Corbyn for clearer stance on Europe","bodyText":"Labour MPs have called on Jeremy Corbyn to adopt a clearer stance on the single market and free movement in Europe before Theresa May’s speech on Brexit. At a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday, MPs voiced fears that the party was being let down by its communication strategy, a week after Corbyn said Labour was not wedded to the principle of free movement. Corbyn told the MPs the party would have a clear message in response to the prime minister’s speech, saying Labour would fight any attempt to make the UK “a bargain basement economy off the coast of Europe”. At the weekend the chancellor, Philip Hammond, suggested the UK could “change our economic model” to a low-tax, low-regulation system if the EU refused the UK any access to the single market. Corbyn told the meeting this was a dangerous and reckless approach and May and the government were pushing towards the exact kind of Brexit Britain that most people did not want, a spokesman said. The Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw was one of those who called for clarity on the party’s position on the single market. May is expected to say on Tuesday that the UK will not seek any new relationship that means the country is “half-in, half-out”. One Labour MP said concerns had been raised at the meeting about messaging, including the row after prime minister’s questions when a Corbyn spokesman appeared to cast doubt on the leader’s support for a Nato troop presence in Estonia. Another MP described the packed meeting, attending by both MPs and peers, as “subdued rather than combative” towards Corbyn. “We were asking for clear messages on immigration, Europe and other various spur of the moment policies.” Corbyn made clear that the party had softened its position on nuclear power, after meeting Labour members in Copeland, Cumbria, on Sunday where one of the key industries is the Sellafield nuclear power plant. The party is facing two tough byelections, in Copeland and Stoke-on-Trent. Corbyn announced that the veteran Labour MP Jack Dromey would run the campaign in Stoke Central. Corbyn’s spokesman said the leader was confident the party could hold both seats. “In both constituencies we will make the case for a completely different kind of economic policy in the country that will benefit those areas, after the Conservative strategy has failed to deliver,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/13/rise-of-electric-car-solves-little-if-driven-by-fossil-fuels-warns-windfarm-boss","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-13T16:39:07Z","webTitle":"Rise of electric car solves little if driven by fossil fuels, warns windfarm boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/13/rise-of-electric-car-solves-little-if-driven-by-fossil-fuels-warns-windfarm-boss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/13/rise-of-electric-car-solves-little-if-driven-by-fossil-fuels-warns-windfarm-boss","fields":{"headline":"Rise of electric car solves little if driven by fossil fuels, warns windfarm boss","bodyText":"The rise of electric cars will be a pyrrhic victory for the environment if they are powered by fossil fuels instead of renewables, according to the UK boss of the world’s biggest offshore windfarm developer. Matthew Wright, the new managing director of Dong Energy UK, said the cost of windfarms at sea had fallen so much that the big issue facing the industry was no longer levels of subsidies but how they integrated with the National Grid and emerging technologies. “The challenge is that having reached this tipping point in terms of its cost competitiveness, how do we integrate more offshore wind into the the modern energy system?” he said. “How do we combine it with the rise of electric vehicles, the rise of storage and batteries, smart technology? It’s becoming a different phase [for the sector].” The cost of offshore wind power fell by nearly a third between 2012 and 2016 (pdf), and the windfarms now generate 5% of the UK’s electricity (pdf), compared with 8% for onshore ones. It is the only large-scale form of renewable energy still supported by the government. Wright, the former chief executive of Southern Water, took over the UK arm of the Danish state-owned Dong in June, shortly after the company sold off its remaining oil and gas business for £1bn to Ineos. Dong announced last week that its operating profits were up by 74% in the second quarter of the year on the back of new windfarms. The company has invested £6bn in the UK, with a further £6bn planned by 2020. Although Dong will not confirm so publicly, it may be among the offshore wind developers bidding for part of a £290m-a-year pot of government subsidies – known as contracts for difference – which are paid for through household energy bills. The auction results are due in early September. Some in the industry have already predicted that windfarms, due to be built early next decade, will come in cheaper than the deal for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station of £92.50 per Mwh, about twice the wholesale price of electricity. The government’s pledge to ban new petrol and diesel car sales from 2040 was welcome because it would create extra demand for power, he said, but it would be a “bit odd” if vehicles were powered by a fossil fuel such as coal. “It would be somewhat of a pyrrhic victory at that point, reducing NOx emissions in cities [from diesel engines] for increasing CO2 elsewhere [from a conventional power station]. The fit between renewable energy and electric is a natural fit,” he said. More electric cars and large-scale storage facilities would help with the variable nature of wind power too, he said, though he said the importance of its intermittency was “overplayed”. The company is planning to add a sizeable, 2MW battery to its offshore windfarm at Burbo Bank in Liverpool Bay, to provide services to National Grid, similar to one already being built by Sweden’s Vattenfall at a Welsh onshore windfarm. Wright said that the potential for offshore wind was huge, citing a recent report that found there was enough wind resource for it to power 75% of all the UK’s households. He urged governments around the North Sea, including Britain, to help ensure future projects are more strategically sited, to make best use of the power. “The wind is blowing somewhere in the North Sea 75-80% of the time, therefore if you think a little harder about where to site projects, you can get closer to baseload [continuous power, as provided by atomic reactors] from offshore wind than many people think,” said Wright."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/21/carillion-must-hope-real-answers-dont-usually-get-them","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"We must hope for real answers about Carillion.

We don’t usually get them","bodyText":"The collapse of Carillion, the building and outsourcing company, throws up so many questions about the state of UK business and government services it is difficult to know where to begin. Lifting the lid on Carillion’s strategic plans, it is clear that the company’s board mistook tactical nous for strategy. Not that there was much common sense in taking a building company and morphing it into a conglomerate that tries to meld together the management of prisons, hospitals and schools as if they were all the same. Worse, the board chased contracts without appearing to assess the risks. The suspicion must be that the directors needed to get cash in to service existing contracts that were going awry. Underbidding for contracts seems to have become necessary to bring money in at an accelerated rate. This is an age-old problem of robbing Peter (the cash from the newly acquired contract) to fund Paul (a troubled existing contract that is suffering cost overruns the provider must cover). It must be hoped that the Insolvency Service report into the firm’s collapse is a no-holds-barred examination that exposes all these tactics and their effect on Carillion’s finances. It should be a lesson to other businesses that underbidding for disparate contracts may give the business a lift with a temporary injection of cash, but stores up huge problems for the future. Last September, the chief executive brought in to clean up the mess left by his predecessor said in the half-yearly report: “Our objective is to be a lower-risk, lower-cost, higher-quality business generating sustainable cash-backed earnings.” Unfortunately he was too late and the ship was already sinking. Which brings us to the auditors who verify company accounts and supposedly provide a bulwark against the kinds of financial mismanagement that Carillion’s board have been accused of. Carillion was so large and sprawling that it employed three of the four main auditing firms – KPMG, EY and Deloitte – to check on its finances. That left only PwC to take on the job of investigating the collapse for the Insolvency Service. Except that PwC recently advised the Carillion pension fund trustees about the impact of the firm going bust on the £2bn final salary scheme they oversee. As the pension scheme is a prime creditor of the company, PwC has become another conflicted participant in the insolvency. Hopefully the Insolvency Service navigates the conflicts and uses its considerable powers to conduct a thorough investigation of how Carillion was managed. But few people will hold their breath. It was the Insolvency Service that examined the entrails of HBOS following the bank’s collapse in 2008. HBOS was, along with Royal Bank of Scotland, offering loans on wafer-thin margins to almost anyone who wanted one. This boosted short-term profits and director’s bonuses. It also made the company vulnerable to the slightest ill wind blowing through the industry. However, to everyone’s dismay, the Insolvency Service’s verdict, four years after the event, was that there was “insufficient evidence” to prosecute. The government must also take its share of the blame as Carillion’s prime customer. Labour has rightly called into question the appetite for outsourcing public services and, in particular, partnership deals, whether under the banner of the private finance initiative (PFI) or other forms of “risk-sharing” collaboration that have tended to privatise the profits and socialise the risks. There are better ways to run public services. But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party must address the concern, dating back 40 years, that public sector managers are in no fit state to manage large, complex infrastructure projects or even some basic services. A sea-change in how public sector managers are trained and how Whitehall departments are run needs to happen before these schemes can be brought back “in-house” without repeating the same mistakes Carillion has made. Black Friday was a success, but retailers are blue about winter There was good news and bad for high street retailers in the official figures for December. The bad news was that, after poor figures for December, 2017 was the worst year for retail since 2013. Last year, shops struggled against the headwinds of rising inflation and the debilitating and constant uncertainty which was brought about by the government’s Brexit negotiations. December itself was down 1.5% on the previous month, confirming what most of the shop owners have already indicated was a Christmas sales period they would much prefer to forget. The good news, as every Brexiter will emphasise, is that the situation wasn’t even worse. Sales growth in 2017 was still up 1.9% on the previous year, which is a better performance than many economic forecasters dared predict. Setting aside the “it wasn’t so bad” argument and the obvious counterpoint that consumers have yet to feel the full impact of leaving the European Union, there was another possible bright spot for retailers, and that was the movement of sales to November as a result of Black Friday. Now a yearly shopping discounting event, Black Friday has helped spread the load of Christmas spending. For that, retailers ought to be grateful. Such are the fireworks around the day itself that even the clothing retailer Next, so often a discounting refusenik, joined in. It’s as if a rent-free marketplace had been invented to which the world’s most voracious consumers turned up. It might seem like a version of retail hell, where the only way to seal a deal is to lop 50% off the price, but in terms of bringing shops and consumers together, it is retail heaven. That said, it is an event conducted mostly online and only adds to the pain felt by the traditional high street. Finance aside, renewables will be nuclear’s real foe in the future The new chief executive of EDF Energy admitted last week that it had been a “monstrous job” drumming up the backing for the UK’s first new nuclear power station in decades. The next nuclear plants will need to be built for a much cheaper, subsidised price of power than the generous one awarded to EDF’s Hinkley Point C, Whitehall has warned. So those who undertake construction will need every possible weapon at their disposal to defeat their biggest enemy: financing. Public finance is the magic sword that some think could slay the Godzilla-sized challenge facing Japanese firm Hitachi, which wants to build a plant on the island of Anglesey. Japanese press reports recently put the capital cost of the project at £19.5bn, with more than £14bn to come from loans from the UK and Japanese governments. The rationale for Tokyo is clear. The big question is why the UK would want to shoulder the risk of such a huge scheme. The idea of taxpayers taking on any of the construction risk of building new nuclear plants has been political anathema for years. It has become a government mantra that the subsidy cost promised to EDF is justified because the public is not bearing the risks of building Hinkley. EDF’s chief executive confirmed last week he was also talking to the government about how to finance a second plant, at Sizewell in Suffolk. But EDF said public finance was not a prerequisite for £16bn Sizewell C, and it is courting institutional investors.

There are nine countries that possess nuclear weapons. Five of these (the US, Russia, the UK, France and China) are members of the official owners club, who made their weapons early and had them legitimised in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) signed in 1968, the key piece of international law governing nuclear weapons possession. NPT has arguably been quite successful. In the 1960s it was widely anticipated that dozens of countries would get the bomb, as it appeared to be the fast track to clout and status on the world stage. But so far there have only been four rogue nuclear weapons states who ignored the NPT and made their own bombs. In order of acquisition, they are Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea. Has any country ever given up its nuclear weapons? More countries have given up nuclear weapons programmes than have kept them, coming to believe they were more of a liability than an asset for national security. The apartheid regime in South Africa secretly built six warheads, but dismantled the bombs and abandoned the whole programme in 1989 just before the system gave way to democracy. Even Sweden had an advanced and ambitious plan based on heavy water reactors to build up to a hundred warheads, but gave up the project in the 1960s, preferring to spend defence funds on fighter planes. The military juntas in both Argentina and Brazil pursued covert weapons programmes, although they stopped short of making a bomb, and the two countries gave up their programmes in the early nineties and joined the NPT. Taiwan and South Korea began developing plutonium production programmes in the late sixties and early seventies before the US persuaded them to halt in the mid-seventies and rely on Washington for security. Japan is generally considered to have a “bomb in the basement”, in that it has all the materials and know-how to build a warhead quickly if it decided to follow that path and leave the NPT. At present that course seems unlikely. Three successor countries to the Soviet Union – Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus – inherited nuclear weapons in 1991, and all three agreed to surrender them, in Ukraine’s case in return for sovereignty guarantees from Russia that ultimately proved worthless. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein dismantled his rudimentary nuclear weapons programme after the first Gulf war in 1991, and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi handed over his nuclear weapons beginner’s set to the US in 2003. Their ultimate fate offers little incentive for future despots to give up their atomic dreams. How do you make a bomb? It is pretty difficult to make a nuclear weapon. If it was not we most likely would no longer be here. And it is difficult on two levels: making the fissile material and then constructing a device that will detonate it. Material is fissile when the nucleus of an atom can be split by a neutron that has broken free of another atom, producing large amounts of energy and more neutrons. When those free neutrons go on to split the nuclei of other atoms, there is a chain reaction, causing a nuclear explosion. Uranium and plutonium are used for nuclear weapons, but only specific atomic configurations, or isotopes, of those elements are fissile. The fissile isotopes used in nuclear warheads are U-235 and Pu-239. The numbers refer to their atomic weights. The biggest single challenge in making a nuclear warhead is producing enough of these isotopes from the elements found in nature. Following the uranium path to the bomb requires converting refined uranium into a gas and then spinning it at very high speed in centrifuges to separate out the U-235, which makes up less than 1% of naturally occurring uranium. This has to be done repeatedly through “cascades” of centrifuges. Low-enriched uranium, used in civilian nuclear power, is usually 3%-4% U-235. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. Building enough centrifuges, and getting them to spin fast enough in unison, is the greatest technical challenge along the uranium route. Plutonium Pu-239 is produced in significant quantities by extracting it from irradiated uranium fuel that has been through a reactor. Because it is more fissile, less plutonium is required for a weapon. A sophisticated modern warhead requires as little as 2kg of plutonium, or at least three times that much uranium. Once you have enough fissile material, you have to make it go bang. And to achieve that you have to force the atoms close enough together to trigger a chain reaction. There are two ways of doing this, and therefore two basic bomb designs. The most rudimentary is the gun-type warhead, which involves firing one chunk of fissile material into another at high speed with conventional explosives. The Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima was a gun-type device using 64kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU). A more sophisticated bomb type, which requires less fissile material and allows the use of plutonium (which does not work in a gun-type warhead) is the implosion device, in which a sphere of HEU or plutonium is surrounded by explosives rigged to go off at exactly the same time to violently compress the core. The Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki was an implosion device with about 6kg of plutonium. What is a hydrogen bomb? Hydrogen bomb is the colloquial term for a thermonuclear weapon, a second-generation bomb design with vastly more explosive power than a simple fission warhead. It is a two-stage device – a primary fission bomb which detonates and compresses a secondary bomb filled with two heavy isotopes of hydrogen: deuterium and tritium (hence the name hydrogen bomb). They undergo a process of nuclear fusion, forcing the nuclei of atoms together and multiplying exponentially the amount of energy released by the device. All strategic weapons in modern arsenals are now thermonuclear, or hydrogen, bombs. Whatever happened to nuclear disarmament? The bargain at the heart of the NPT was that member states without nuclear weapons agreed not to acquire them, as long as the states with weapons reduced their obscenely large arsenals, capable of destroying the planet many times over. That has indeed happened, to an extent – at first as the result of arms control agreements, and then the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the end of the cold war. From a peak of 70,000 nuclear weapons in the world at the height of the cold war, in 1985, there are now about 14,000, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), still enough to end life on the planet. Then and now, the overwhelming majority (93% in 2018) of these warheads belong to the US and Russia, with between 6,000 and 7,000 apiece, although only about a quarter of those arsenals are deployed and ready for use. The rest are in reserve stockpiles or in the process of being retired and dismantled. Of the second-tier nuclear weapons powers, again according to FAS estimates, France has 300 warheads, China 270, the UK 215, Pakistan 130-40, India 120-30, Israel 80, and North Korea between 10 and 20. The last successful arms control agreement, the New Start treaty, was signed by Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, limiting the US and Russia to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads each. The hope at the time was that the two nuclear superpowers would pursue a follow-on treaty and at one point Obama suggested he might reduce the US arsenal unilaterally by another third. But that did not happen. What are the chances of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of a terrorist group? The terrorist nuclear weapon is one of the scariest scenarios the world faces. Unlike states, such groups cannot be deterred from using a weapon as the perpetrator could be very hard to identify in the wake of a blast, difficult to find, and ready to accept death as the price of inflicting devastating damage. Terrorist groups would not need expensive missiles to deliver their warheads. They could be sailed into a port in a shipping container or across land borders in the back of a truck. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US spent substantial resources on dismantling many of its weapons and production facilities as well as ensuring that its many nuclear scientists had alternative employment so as not to be tempted to sell their wares and expertise to the highest bidder. But serious concerns about nuclear weapons security remain. Pakistan in particular is a source of anxiety as its military and intelligence services have radicalised elements within them, with links to terror groups. There are also fears that a cash-strapped or vengeful North Korea could sell one of its warheads for the right price. A more recent emerging threat is that a rogue group could hack into a nuclear power’s command and control computers, triggering a launch, or into an early warning system, giving the impression an enemy attack is imminent. How likely is accidental nuclear war? As the years have passed since the cold war, it has become increasingly clear that we had several lucky escapes from nuclear weapons use during that era as the result of miscalculation or technical glitches. For example, in 1979, when a US watch officer left training tapes in the early warning system when he finished his shift, those in the incoming shift saw their screens light up with the tracks of multiple incoming Soviet missiles. It was only good judgment of the duty officers that avoided a nuclear alert. In such situations, if the glitch is not identified lower down the chain of command and passed upwards as a seemingly genuine alert, a national leader has only a few minutes to decide whether to launch his or her country’s missiles before the apparent incoming salvo destroys them. Nearly three decades after the cold war, the US and Russia still keep hundreds of missiles on hair-trigger alert, ready to launch within minutes, in anticipation of just an occasion. In the US system, there is no institutional check or barrier to the president launching those missiles once he has identified himself to the Pentagon war room using his nuclear codes. What next? Arms control will be on the agenda when Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump meet in Helsinki on Monday. One option is that the two presidents could extend the New Start treaty by another five years, as allowed for in the agreement. The biggest barrier is Trump’s distaste for any arrangement inherited from Obama. It is more likely he would argue for a more ambitious arms control agreement he could put his own name to. But Putin will be hard to convince, without the US scaling back its missile defence system, and that is unlikely at the moment. The threat of a conflict with North Korea has receded somewhat since the Singapore summit, but it is increasingly clear that Pyongyang has no intention of disarming any time soon. The big question is what will Trump do once that becomes apparent to him. The chances of a nuclear standoff with Iran, meanwhile, are rising. In May, Trump walked out of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran, which curbed Iranian nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. The US is now piling on sanctions and telling the world to stop buying Iranian oil. Sooner or later it is possible, likely even, that the Iranian government will stop abiding by the agreement and start stepping up its uranium enrichment and other activities. That is likely to raise tensions in the Gulf dramatically and make other regional players rethink whether to acquire nuclear weapons themselves. Taking all these developments into consideration, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has decided to set its “doomsday clock” to two minutes to midnight, the closest to catastrophe it has been since 1953. Nuclear weapons in popular culture The darkest day of the cold war produced some timeless comedy, from the classic movie of accidental apocalypse, Dr Strangelove, to the songs of the mathematician, musician and comedian, Tom Lehrer, with titles like So Long Mom (A song for WWIII), and in the UK, the civil defence sketch by Beyond the Fringe. There are much darker works in the canon. On the Beach, in 1959, was the first major post-apocalyptic movie, in which survivors gather in Australia, the last continent left habitable. The Day After, in 1983, is even blacker. It starts with a nuclear blast obliterating a column of cars stuck on a highway as panicked people rush to try to evade the attack spreads. More recent films, since the cold war, have dwelt on the threat of a single nuclear weapon detonated by terrorists or deranged geniuses or both. They include Broken Arrow (1996), The Peacemaker (1997) and The Sum of All Fears (2002), in which – because there is just one bomb involved – the detonation is no longer treated as an exctinction-level event. In that, art is following reality. The use of a nuclear weapon is now more likely than any time since the worst days of the cold war, but the probability of humanity being wiped out entirely by nuclear war is, for the time being, diminished."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/11/tories-copeland-byelection-boost-sellafield-union-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-11T18:04:32Z","webTitle":"Copeland byelection boost for Tories as Sellafield union rules out strike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/11/tories-copeland-byelection-boost-sellafield-union-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/11/tories-copeland-byelection-boost-sellafield-union-strike","fields":{"headline":"Copeland byelection boost for Tories as Sellafield union rules out strike","bodyText":"The Conservatives’ campaign in Copeland, the byelection described as “Theresa May’s to lose”, has received a big boost after the largest trade union representing workers at the Sellafield nuclear power station said it would not strike before voters go to the polls on 23 February. The Conservatives’ plans to fight the election – triggered by the resignation of Labour MP Jamie Reed – on a pro-nuclear platform were thrown into jeopardy in December, when union leaders said “serious industrial unrest” by the 10,000 workers could not be ruled out amid a dispute over government plans to downgrade the final-salary pension scheme for employees of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which runs Sellafield. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said last month that the plans were “daylight robbery” and admitted that he was “not optimistic” that strike action could be avoided. But after a series of productive talks with ministers, Prospect, the union that represents more than 5,000 Sellafield workers and a majority of all workers on site, has said it will not take industrial action before voters go to the polls in the West Cumbrian constituency. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been repeatedly attacked by Conservative campaigners over his ambiguous stance on the nuclear industry, which supports tens of thousands of jobs locally. Activists had hoped the prospect of the government downgrading employees’ final-salary pension scheme would, at least in part, neutralise Tory attacks. Labour has admitted that it is facing an “incredibly tight” battle in the constituency, where its candidate, a St John ambulance driver and former hospital doctor Gillian Troughton, is defending a 2,564 majority over the Conservatives. The poll will take place on the same day as the byelection in Stoke-on-Trent Central, a strongly pro-leave seat where Labour is facing a concerted challenge from the Ukip leader Paul Nuttall. Dai Hudd, Prospect’s deputy general secretary, said that industrial action had been averted only in the short-term. “There is no doubting the strength of feeling amongst Prospect members at Sellafield and other nuclear sites,” he said. “They were given guarantees about pensions and these were even enshrined in legislation. We will exhaust all opportunities to discuss improvements to the proposals. However, we will not hesitate to ballot for industrial action if government seeks to impose any changes that are not acceptable to members.” The other unions representing Sellafield workers, the GMB, Unite and Aslef, have not yet confirmed whether they will move to take industrial action before the by-election. However, a source close to the negotiations said they believed they were unlikely to do so. The unions are to host a special hustings for nuclear workers and their families on Wednesday and a spokesperson said the pension dispute would be high on the agenda. “Candidates must be ready to answer vitally important questions on their – and their party’s – view, on nuclear power,” they said. “The candidates will also know that the government is threatening pension cuts for 16,000 nuclear workers throughout the country, which could have an impact on this byelection.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/23/uk-likely-to-end-up-with-canadian-style-deal-warns-michel-barnier","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T08:30:10Z","webTitle":"Brexit: UK likely to end up with Canadian-style deal, warns Barnier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/23/uk-likely-to-end-up-with-canadian-style-deal-warns-michel-barnier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/23/uk-likely-to-end-up-with-canadian-style-deal-warns-michel-barnier","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: UK likely to end up with Canadian-style deal, warns Barnier","bodyText":"The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that Britain can expect a trade deal little better than the one the EU struck with Canada – and even that would take years to negotiate, despite Theresa May’s claims to the contrary over Britain’s future after Brexit. Barnier said he could envision a short transition period being agreed between the EU and the UK before March 2019 to ease the UK’s exit from the bloc, but it would require the British government accepting the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. A future trade deal, however, would have to be negotiated over “several years” and “will be very different” from the status quo, Barnier told a group of European newspapers. “If we reach an agreement on the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom, such a [transition] period, both short and framed, is possible,” he said. “To my mind, it makes sense that it covers the financial period, so until 2020. It would leave us more time to prepare for the future relationship. “But I insist on one point: such a period would be possible only if it is framed by the maintenance of all of the regulatory architecture and European supervision, including jurisdictional. It would maintain the economic status quo and all obligations of the UK.” “From the moment the UK told us that it wants out of the single market and the customs union, we will have to work on a model that is closer to the agreement signed with Canada. “The single market is a set of rules and standards and is a shared jurisdiction. Its integrity is non-negotiable, as is the autonomy of decisions of the 27. Either you’re in or you’re out.” The deal struck between the EU and Canada, known as the the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), lifts 98% of tariffs on imports between the two parties, and was a significant move towards freer trade. It does not, however, significantly reduce non-tariff barriers for trade and traditional rules-of-origin regulations would apply for the UK’s exports to the EU, under such a deal. If the non-EU import content of a UK export was too high, for example, there would be a loss of duty-free access for particular sensitive industrial goods, notably cars. A lack of regulatory harmonisation for medicines, automobiles and aircraft equipment would also require products being checked at the border. A deal similar to CETA would furthermore offer little to the UK’s vital financial services sector post-Brexit, when businesses located in the City will lose their automatic right to offer their services across the EU. Barnier said of the negotiations over the future that they would be highly complex and would take many years before they could be put to the national parliaments for ratification. He said: “The two phases are difficult. The second will be very different and will last several years. It is truly unique because instead of promoting regulatory convergence, it will aim to frame a difference. It will involve risks, including about its political ratification, making all the more necessary transparency around these topics.” Barnier’s comments appeared to contradict the prime minister’s claims in the House of Commons on Monday that the details of a future trade deal would be settled before the UK left the bloc. May has insisted this will be necessary to allow the implementation in changes to customs controls, for example, in the two years directly after March 2019. The prime minister had suggested in her Florence speech in September that a deal between the UK and the EU would be far more advanced than that struck with Canada, claiming that such a deal “compared with what exists between Britain and the EU today would represent such a restriction on our mutual market access that it would benefit neither of our economies”. May added in her speech in Italy: “Not only that, it would start from the false premise that there is no pre-existing regulatory relationship between us. And precedent suggests that it could take years to negotiate. We can do so much better than this.” However, Barnier appeared to offer the British government little hope of such an advance on the Canadian deal being possible, although he acknowledged his team was working on the details of an exit treaty. He said: “The strategic interest of our continent is to partner with this very large country with a permanent seat on the United Nations security council. But this is not a reason to undermine the single market.” Of a no-deal scenario, Barnier said: “We do not want it at all, but we do not exclude any option. Such a scenario would cause us problems, and much larger [ones] in the UK.“I will give you some examples. In London, to leave the Euratom treaty without an agreement would mean immediate problems for the import of nuclear material, whether for nuclear power plants or hospitals. “That would mean leaving the single European sky agreement, and no longer being able to mutually recognise pilot qualifications or get take off or landing clearance. And what would happen to the food products imported into the United Kingdom? There would immediately be customs controls, perhaps taxes. That’s why I want a deal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/09/green-party-co-leader-to-call-on-conservatives-to-sack-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T23:01:03Z","webTitle":"Green party co-leader to call on Conservatives to sack Boris Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/09/green-party-co-leader-to-call-on-conservatives-to-sack-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/09/green-party-co-leader-to-call-on-conservatives-to-sack-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Green party co-leader to call on Conservatives to sack Boris Johnson","bodyText":"The Green party co-leader Jonathan Bartley will claim that Boris Johnson’s undiplomatic language about Libya, Barack Obama and people living in the Congo amounts to no more than old-fashioned bigotry. He will use a flagship speech to his party’s conference in Harrogate on Monday to claim the Conservative party is “led by a zombie prime minister” and “rotten to its core”. But Bartley, who runs the party alongside Caroline Lucas, will save his biggest attack for the foreign secretary, whom he will describe as a “poison” at the core of the Conservative movement. “In many ways he is a joke. But then you listen to what he’s actually saying. Let’s not pretend that Boris Johnson’s comments about dead bodies in Libya was an aberration. It wasn’t,” Bartley is expected to say. “This is the man who calls Barack Obama ‘part Kenyan’ with ‘ancestral dislike’ of the UK. Who describes people from the Congo as having ‘watermelon smiles’. Calls Commonwealth citizens ‘flag-waving piccaninnies’.” Bartley will also refer to Johnson using a column in the Telegraph to cast doubt on climate change, and controversial comments about “Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing”. Referring finally to the controversy when Johnson was editor of the Spectator and the magazine suggested Liverpudlians were wallowing in their “victim status” after the Hillsborough tragedy, Bartley will say: “This is not new bigotry. It’s old. It’s unacceptable. And it’s time the Conservative party took collective responsibility for this human wrecking ball and kicked him out of the cabinet.” Bartley will also use the speech to try to grasp back credit for the Greens for policies that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party has taken hold of, resulting in a successful boost with the electorate. “Where we lead, others follow. Our London assembly members forced a living wage. Our MEPs stood up for refugees when others stood back. And in parliament, we have consistently kept climate change on the agenda. “And you know what? I believe we will be the most influential party in 21st-century politics.” However, Bartley knows the Greens have a fight on their hands to re-establish their relevance after losing voters to Labour at the last election. The party slipped backwards in the June poll, gaining just 1.6% of the vote, compared with 3.8% in 2015. The Greens also made no inroads in target seats such as Bristol West and Norwich South, where the incumbent Labour MPs increased their majorities and the Green candidates lost vote share. Bartley will say that it was his party that was standing “against the establishment consensus that austerity was necessary” after the financial crash seven years ago, long before Corbyn placed the issue at the core of the Labour message. “We warned that the system was unsustainable. And then there was the financial crisis. In 2010 we were told by the Tories, by Labour, by the Lib Dems that austerity was the only answer. We said no. And we kept saying no. We joined UK Uncut on the streets. We marched to Downing Street. We bravely dared to be different. And seven years later, the agenda has changed.” He will also claim that the Green party changed minds on fracking and had triggered a debate on the universal basic income. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme before his speech, Bartley defended the Greens’ decision to stand aside in a series of seats in June’s election to assist Labour or Lib Dem candidates, saying it was “a very bold thing to do”. He said: “We’ve seen a profound change in British politics as a result of what happened. “Many commentators suggest that if we hadn’t stood aside, if local parties hadn’t made those decisions, we wouldn’t have the hung parliament now, we wouldn’t have seen the change of agenda that we’re seeing from the government. A profound impact – I think it was worth it.” But he stressed that there was “a whole lot of difference between us and Labour” on policy, citing the Greens’ opposition to new nuclear power stations, Trident, and support for free movement of people, a shorter working week and the universal basic income. “There is a huge agenda which Labour are not taking on board,” he said. The issue of Brexit is also likely to be widely discussed at the conference, after Molly Scott Cato MEP reaffirmed the party’s commitment to a “ratification referendum” as a means of reversing the referendum vote. She told delegates that promising such a vote could help “bring an end to this damaging and dangerous chapter in our country’s history”, as she called on the room to “stop Brexit!” The Greens argue that it is not undemocratic to ask for a further vote. “We are asking for more democracy, not less. We are asking for a democratic choice between two real, possible futures at the end of the Brexit negotiations: the deal, or remaining a member of the EU,” added Scott Cato."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/aug/29/forget-profit-love-fun-innovation-parkrun","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-29T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Forget profit.

It’s love and fun that drive innovations like Parkrun","bodyText":"Every Saturday morning at 9am sharp a little bit of anarchy breaks out across the country. This being Britain, it happens, naturally enough, in our parks. Not that it’s billed as such. It’s meant to be a 5km run, which is why at Richmond Park in south-west London this morning the grass is carpeted with well over 400 people in sports gear. But it has none of the intensity you’d expect at a track or even on a gym treadmill. One woman tugs balloons, to celebrate her 100th run; others prepare to push baby buggies or keep pace with their dogs. Although supported by the charity Parkrun, this and the 559 other events across the UK set to start in a few minutes are entirely self-organised. What they share is an ethos. Parkruns are free to all, and all are treated equally. No hierarchy intrudes between the hares and the tortoises, the old-timers and the debs. Members volunteer to mark the course or keep time or to aid stragglers. So early this morning, as the weekend still brims with promise, on these hectares of parkland owned by the Queen, a little anarchist world briefly comes into focus. One devoid of government nagging or corporate profiteering, but reliant instead on mutual aid and human kindness. “It is the new church,” says Karen Weir, who started the Richmond parkrun in 2006. The former City management consultant would give up 10 hours a week just to ensure Saturdays went smoothly for everyone else. “The idea of the community has broken down. People don’t go to church any more. But here, you come together with a load of people – and you feel embedded in the local area.” Even though he’s not running today, Gary Wimbledon is here to meet friends. When the 41-year-old first came with his brother, Steve, back in 2011, he’d never even run for a bus because, being partially blind, he explained: “I’d fall over.” That first go was grindingly hard, but then came the finish line: “Never before have I had people cheering me on. And they were cheering my name! Just thinking about it, I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.” When he started, Wimbledon carried an extra 60 kilos. Running in Richmond Park helped sort that out, and his depression. A few years into the new pastime he got married – and celebrated with a group parkrun on his wedding day. Now he’s heading for his third marathon. It’s almost nine, and a man hops on to a tree stump to brief us. He welcomes first-timers, and we applaud the volunteers and whoop a husband and wife about to start their joint 250th run. Then it is announced that a regular, Fred Croft, died of cancer the previous Tuesday. Taking the stump, his son tells the crowd that Fred had always loved running in this park, “the varying seasons, the views, the deer”. Most of all, he “talked about parkrun as his family”. James quotes from a race report his dad wrote of the very course we are to run – a fragment from the Old English poem The Battle of Maldon: “Our spirits must be firmer, our hearts stronger / And our courage greater as our strength diminishes.” Heads bow, before the shout goes up: “Let’s run!” Here to break me in for my first parkrun is the man who started it all. By October 2004, Paul Sinton-Hewitt was “in a bad way”. Sacked from his marketing job, he’d also suffered a training injury that ended any hopes of doing a marathon. Isolated and low, his response was “to give something back”: to organise a weekly run around the local park in nearby Teddington, where he would time friends’ runs, before they all had a fry-up. He bought a bag of steel tokens from Halfords, stamped them with numbers and after each race would sit in a Caffè Nero, typing up the results. That was fine at first, when only 13 runners would pitch up. But no one else was putting on a regular free 5k run, and as numbers grew friends would fret. Sinton-Hewitt had no permission from the park, no insurance: he was heading for a mishap of Wile E Coyote proportions. Both “altruistic” and “a complete bugger”, Sinton-Hewitt justified every breach by pointing to the spirit of the races. Free and fun, what harm were they doing? Only now it was no longer diehards running, but mothers with kids – and they were clamouring for runs to be put on in other parks. He had both a big success and a stonking headache. Never an elite runner, Sinton-Hewitt had by accident become a world-class innovator. Today Parkrun is the largest running event on the planet, with more than 1,600 events. The London Marathon may attract the wacky costumes and the BBC scheduling, but last April not many more than 40,000 people finished it – and that was a record. In one good weekend, Parkrun’s adult and junior events pull in more than 235,000 participants around the world; within five years that’s expected to hit a million. Innovation is one of the most overused words in business, drizzled across both gold and bullshit. When Subway announced a couple of weeks ago that market research would help it to – gasp! – tweak its menu, it said: “Global innovation is key to driving our brand forward, and we are disrupting the way we’ve traditionally managed the process.” When Sports Direct featured this summer in a list of international shopping chains, it rushed out a press release highlighting the “top five list of global innovative retailers”, with quotes from somebody called the “head of elevation”. That Marks &amp; Spencer cauliflower steak? You just know that some ideas meeting at head office signed it off using the i-word. For the right, innovation is a private sector virtue – one that you and I must encourage by paying a lot of money. Last tax year, businesses claimed tax relief on research and development worth £3bn, according to estimates from Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs. That is more than Britain spends each year on prisons, and big companies do not even have to pay corporation tax to qualify. Then there are the special handouts, such as the £5m George Osborne hoped to collar for AstraZeneca’s Alderley Park research centre in Cheshire, just a few months before the pharmaceutical giant closed it down. Others argue that it’s the government that enables radical innovation. Think of space programmes and arms manufacturing, or look at your smartphone in which, as the economist Mariana Mazzucato observes, all the smartest bits were first developed in US government labs. Where both left and right agree is that innovation is about lab coats and metal-bashing, Silicon Valley and science. In other words, it looks nothing like my slight and softly spoken running partner, who is even now encouraging the two women behind us to overtake. In those early years, Sinton-Hewitt had to write his own software, get permission from park officials who’d never heard of such a thing, devise an entire ethos for this movement he’d started. “I wanted to disrupt things, I wanted to take on all the people making so much money out of running.” In his more lucid moments, Elon Musk might say something similar – except, unlike other innovators, Sinton-Hewitt wasn’t seeking profit, or on a government payroll. Parkrun started in the same year as Facebook, and Sinton-Hewitt could by now be sitting on a mountain of money to rival Mark Zuckerberg’s. But he has what the organisation’s chief executive, Nick Pearson, describes as “the strongest moral code of anybody I’ve ever come across”. When I ask where that comes from, Sinton-Hewitt pauses and coughs that it’s a long story. Born in Zimbabwe, but raised in South Africa, he was put in a home at five after his parents split. He was tiny – “until I was about 16 I weighed only 60lb” – and was beaten and bullied by the other boys. They hanged him from his neck, slashed him from ear to ear, and threw darts at his back. “You were never allowed to show emotion” – so at first he appeared calm and driven, but in 1995, a few years after coming to Britain, he had a breakdown. It is from those experiences that he traces the ethic that underpins Parkrun: “I treat everyone as I would treat myself; give everyone the right to do what they want.” The status we give people like Musk and James Dyson has long historical roots. We might trace them back to 1911, and a book written by an Austrian economist sometimes called “the prophet of innovation”. Joseph Schumpeter was just 28 when he published The Theory of Economic Development, but its arguments are made with bone-rattling certainty. When it came to how innovation happens, he saw a hierarchy: “It is … the producer who as a rule initiates economic change, and consumers are educated by him if necessary; they are, as it were, taught to want new things.” A century later, innovation no longer inevitably rolls downhill, nor does change always come from the centre. If you want to read up on a subject right now, you’ll probably go to the fifth most visited website in the world, Wikipedia. It has just 300 staff and contractors but tens of thousands of unpaid users who write and edit its pages. By comparison, Yahoo! – the sixth most popular website – still has 8,600 full-time staff. If you want to get rid of your old table or cot, you might advertise it on your local Freecycle board. The world’s largest nonprofit recycling network, Freecycle has 5,000 gifting groups with 9.4 million members in 110 countries, including the Palestinian Authority. The global HQ for this vast operation is in Tucscon, Arizona, and has a grand total of two employees, including the chief executive. (They share the office with two other nonprofits, and if you ring, the CEO has to go outside so as not to disturb anyone.) They rely on 2,000 or so moderators, who run their boards for their communities for free. And if you fancy jogging 5km next Saturday, you might go on a parkrun, whose core organisation is just 23 people working on an island in the Thames, in an office reached by walking through a boat yard. The only reason those runs happen is because of the 1.1m hours given by Karen Weir and other volunteers around the world over the past 12 months – work that won’t show up in the GDP data because no money changes hands. “I know what it means to have targets and to sell. I get all that,” says Sinton-Hewitt. “But there is another economy here. An economy of helping people be the best they can be, to change their lives and to grow as individuals.” Wikipedia and Parkrun are both examples of “people’s innovation”, according to Steve Flowers at the University of Kent’s business school. They’re driven by users rather than producers, by volunteers rather than professionals; they’re horizontal rather than hierarchical, and they’re not primarily about making money. What drives these citizen innovators isn’t pay, but purpose: to have fun, gain work experience or just help others. This is an inversion of how we have come to think of work – it is more the gentle anarchism that you see in your local park every Saturday. Flowers sees examples of this spirit everywhere, from open-source software to the reviews posted on TripAdvisor to the way games-maker Valve encourages users to modify its software. “It’s the invisible industrial revolution,” he says. “It’s hiding in plain sight, and once you see it, it totally changes the way you look at innovation today.” People’s innovation may even be bigger than the formal innovation economy. At Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Eric von Hippel carried out surveys in six developed countries, from the UK and US to South Korea and Finland. He found a total of 24.4 million “consumer innovators”, doing everything from modifying their coats to carry their babies securely, to establishing a GPS system to recover lost house keys. The UK has the single largest proportion of consumer innovators: more than 6% of all adults, or nearly 3 million people. In his book Postcapitalism, Paul Mason writes with persuasive urgency about how this bottom-up economics could topple our existing order. Yet in the shorter run it may not challenge capitalism, but sit alongside it. You wouldn’t want a bunch of enthusiasts to design your local nuclear power station – but you might welcome their thoughts on how to reform social care reform. At Sheffield University, Richard Jones points out that drug companies have spent tens of billions over decades on a cure for Alzheimer’s. The success rate so far has been zero. “For at least the next decade or two, practical advances to mitigate the condition are as likely to come from the informal innovation of patients and their carers and we ought to be doing much more to support that.” Just as Gary Wimbledon promised, we are greeted with cheers at the finishing line. Sinton-Hewitt kindly refrains from letting on how much harm I have done to his run record. The number one thing sceptics ask him about parkrun is “Where’s the trick?”. “They think it’s too good to be true, but right from the beginning I decided this was going to be a beautiful, pure enterprise. There would never be a trick.” • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist and senior economics commentator • This article was amended on 29 August 2018.

A survey by the Energy Institute, the professional body for the energy sector, has found that four fifths of its members believe the UK is currently on track to miss the 2030 goal. “The mood among our members is that energy policy is on pause and ministers need to hit the play button,” said Louise Kingham, chief executive of the Energy Institute. Among the list of stalled government decisions are the fate of a multimillion-pound competition to build mini nuclear power plants and whether to strike a subsidy deal for a pioneering tidal lagoon at Swansea. A flagship plan on how to meet the UK’s 2030 target of cutting emissions by 57% compared to 1990 levels, originally expected last year, is now “long overdue,” Kingham added. Jim Skea, the president of the institute, said of the delayed Clean Power Plan: “If we’re going to keep on track [with binding carbon targets] there is an urgent need to get that published.” The departure of energy minister Nick Hurd is seen as a blow to the plan, designed to set out how the government will tackle the huge shortfall in carbon cuts identified by its advisers. The group’s annual Energy Barometer report said Brexit was a new and “material concern” for further uncertainty. However, perception of risks from energy policy was slightly reduced from last year, when industry was suffering the fallout from the flurry of changes after the Conservatives took power in 2015, cutting renewables, carbon capture and energy efficiency programmes. The government’s decision to quit an EU nuclear cooperation treaty, Euratom, was seen as overwhelmingly negative for new nuclear projects including Hinkley Point C in Somerset. Nearly four fifths of Energy Institute members thought it would also negatively impact the UK supply chain. Post Brexit, the professionals largely want to keep EU energy and climate laws, such as the energy efficiency and renewable energy directives, the survey found. However, more wanted to scrap or abandon state aid rules than retain them. The group’s members oppose an energy price cap which many thought would hurt investment. But they favoured stronger action on energy efficiency – such as better building standards – as the best way to meet carbon targets and restore trust in the industry. The institute’s leaders also highlighted the need to begin decarbonising heat for homes and business. They said the government had been slow to look at alternatives to natural gas, because alternatives such as hydrogen or electrification were seen as harder than ways for cutting emissions from power, such as windfarms. As a result, the group’s members thought the contribution from gas for heating would only decline modestly by 2030. “It’s this gap on things like energy efficiency and a heat policy – that’s the real thing that will hold back investment and grow the uncertainty,” said Skea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jan/07/labour-nuclear-test-copeland-byelection-cumbria","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-07T22:00:00Z","webTitle":"Copeland by-election: Labour faces its nuclear test in the energy coast’s safe seat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/07/labour-nuclear-test-copeland-byelection-cumbria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jan/07/labour-nuclear-test-copeland-byelection-cumbria","fields":{"headline":"Copeland by-election: Labour faces its nuclear test in the energy coast’s safe seat","bodyText":"In the port of Whitehaven, a homemade banner affixed to an industrial garage confronts those arriving by train: “Save services at West Cumberland Hospital. Do not arrive D.o.A at Carlisle.” The local hospital risks losing its major trauma and maternity units – with ambulances facing a 40-mile journey in unpredictable rural traffic. Just about every shop window in Whitehaven and beyond bears a poster urging action. For the Labour party, which trails dismally in national polls, a row involving the crisis-torn NHS should be a gift, especially before a crucial byelection in the area. But right now the party cannot buy a break. The sprawling Copeland constituency, in which Whitehaven sits, is part of Britain’s self-styled “energy coast” – home to Sellafield and the proposed site of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at Moorside. Nuclear energy is the area’s major employer and, as the Conservative party have been quick to underline, Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn is no fan of nuclear power. The nuclear question could be crucial in determining a contest that Labour can scarcely afford to lose. The byelection, for which no date has yet been set, has been prompted by the resignation of local MP Jamie Reed, who has gone to work for Sellafield. The loss of a formerly safe Labour seat would deepen fears that – after being all but wiped off the map in Scotland – the party is on the verge of some kind of implosion in the north of England. Copeland has already shunned Labour once, ignoring the party line and voting to leave the EU by a margin of 62%. The Tories, who squeezed Labour’s majority to just 2,564 in 2015, have not held this seat since 1935; a victory in Copeland would make them the first government to make a byelection gain since 1982. As well as the NHS, Labour also hopes to fight on local issues such as Copeland’s woeful road and rail infrastructure – the 40-mile journey to Carlisle takes an hour and 10 minutes in two-carriage diesel trains – and the impact of austerity on public services. But Tory mailshots to thousands of homes already warn of threats to jobs at Sellafield while Ukip will appeal to local concerns on immigration. Copeland’s mayor, plain-speaking independent Mike Starkie, says the area is in desperate need of fresh thinking from central government – and that a new approach to immigration that prioritises skilled workers could be the answer. “The general perception here would be that people in Westminster don’t care about places like this,” said Starkie, who voted for Brexit. “We’ve got to be able to attract bright people from all over. Somebody from Poland shouldn’t get an advantage over a better-qualified Brazilian just because they’re from Poland. Immigration is good for any country. But first and foremost we’ve got to think of this area’s needs. If you could find me 200 specialist consultants who could go into the hospital tomorrow, the whole community would welcome them with open arms. But we need professional people.” The nuclear industry in Copeland employs 10,000 people directly and supports thousands more jobs in the supply chain. “If Sellafield shut tomorrow – which it can’t – we might as well lock the gates on the town,” says Starkie. Labour must convince locals that their leader doesn’t want this to happen. The problem, says Whitehaven councillor Christine Wharrier, is that “people assume Corbyn is anti-nuclear everything. There is a distrust there. They know he’s anti-nuclear weapons, so regardless of what he says about nuclear power – and he never has said he’s anti-nuclear power – it’s easy for the Tories.” “Employment at Sellafield is not at risk in any way whatsoever – it’s a decommissioning plant and those jobs will be secure for half a century,” she said. “But the Tories are playing to people’s fears. We saw the same with Brexit. People want to look after themselves and their families – and that means they’ll sometimes accept myths as fact.” Other Labour campaigners echo her concerns. “You’d be hard-pressed to find an elected Labour person in Copeland who doesn’t have a link to the nuclear industry,” said Whitehaven councillor Bill Kirkbride. “We’d have no economy otherwise. But the general view on the doorstep regarding the leader is an issue without a doubt. If they bring up the issue of Jeremy’s attitude to nuclear, we have to tell them he doesn’t write party policy. He’s entitled to his private thoughts like any MP and councillor.” Down the coast in Seascale – the windswept village that is home to Sellafield – Corbyn looms large in Tory councillor David Moore’s sights. “Labour will campaign on the NHS because they’re desperate to stay away from nuclear. Jamie Reed resigned from the shadow cabinet on the grounds of nuclear when he was elected first time around. So even the current Labour MP doesn’t trust Corbyn on nuclear. Why should local people?” The early favourite for the Labour candidacy, charity worker Rachel Holliday, whose candidacy was announced last Friday, has moved quickly to try to to defuse the issue. “The West Cumbrian men and women in our nuclear industry should be considered heroes,” she said. “While, as a mum, I ultimately want my kids to live in a world without nuclear weapons, it’s vital we protect the tens and thousands of high-skilled jobs, livelihoods and communities that are reliant on it.” Back in Whitehaven, Starkie – who says the campaign should not be fought on single issues – says a Tory win could precipitate an early general election and the beginning of the end for Corbyn. He was not surprised by Reed’s departure. The outgoing MP’s young children, six-hour commute and well-documented antipathy to Corbyn, combined with imminent boundary changes (Cumbria will lose one of its six MPs) meant it was a case of when, not if. His party now faces a fight for its life in a seat that, until recently, it would have never expected to lose. “I don’t think people feel betrayed by Jamie – he was a popular, local lad,” said one councillor. “But it has left a gap. It has left a gap that we could’ve done without.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/30/edf-board-member-hinkley-point-c-project-postponed","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-30T14:41:33Z","webTitle":"EDF board member calls for Hinkley Point C project to be postponed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/edf-board-member-hinkley-point-c-project-postponed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/30/edf-board-member-hinkley-point-c-project-postponed","fields":{"headline":"EDF board member calls for Hinkley Point C project to be postponed","bodyText":"An EDF board member has called for the £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station to be postponed, in the latest sign of discord at the top of the French energy company over the troubled project. Christian Taxil said a raft of changes to the Somerset reactor scheme agreed over the past three years significantly raised the risk for EDF, while a promise to commission the plant within 72 months of concrete being poured was “not credible”. Taxil, the first EDF board member to go public with his concerns, added: “Today I can only say that the conditions do not exist for me to give a positive opinion if such a project was submitted to me.” The blow from the employee director, who is sponsored by the CFE-CGC trade union, came after the publication in the Financial Times on Wednesday (£) of an advice note from senior engineers saying that the plant should be redesigned and the 2025 start date put back to 2027. The dissent follows weeks of behind the scenes bickering and the resignation of the finance director, Thomas Piquemal, despite continual promises from the chief executive of EDF, Jean-Bernard Lévy, that the controversial project will go ahead. A final investment decision has yet to be taken but Vincent de Rivaz, the head of EDF Energy, the UK arm of the business, said he was working on a target date set by French ministers of mid-May. EDF dismissed the latest rows, saying that it was well known that the unions, who only hold six out of the 18 places on the board, are opposed to Hinkley, while the criticism from the engineers was contained in a paper that was not taken to the board. “The date for the first operation of Hinkley Point C has not changed. It will be 2025,” the company, which is 85% owned by the state, said. It later went on to angrily dismiss “unfounded rumours and fantasy information” in the media. EDF is in the middle of negotiations with the French government over further funding, having been financially hurt by falling power prices, cost overruns on other projects, and demands to upgrade French reactors to make them safer. All six union members on the EDF board are expected to vote against Hinkley when it finally comes to a vote. They believe that it is too expensive and a risk to the company’s future given the scale of the company’s debts. While some non-union board members have voiced doubts about the project in private, all are expected to vote with the management when – as expected – the board meets on 11 May to make a final decision on the project. Developing two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley has been heavily promoted by the UK chancellor, George Osborne, and other ministers as key to keeping the lights on in Britain. The last of the UK’s coal-fired power stations will be closed under government diktat in 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/13/is-it-safe-to-dump-fukushima-waste-into-the-sea","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-13T13:43:26Z","webTitle":"Is it safe to dump Fukushima waste into the sea? | Karl Mathiesen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/13/is-it-safe-to-dump-fukushima-waste-into-the-sea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/13/is-it-safe-to-dump-fukushima-waste-into-the-sea","fields":{"headline":"Is it safe to dump Fukushima waste into the sea?","bodyText":"More than 1,000 tanks brimming with irradiated water stand inland from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Each day 300 tonnes of water are pumped through Fukushima’s ruined reactors to keep them cool. As the water washes through the plant it collects a slew of radioactive particles. The company that owns the plant – The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) - has deployed filtration devices that have stripped very dangerous isotopes of strontium and caesium from the flow. But the water being stored in the tanks still contains tritium, an isotope of hydrogen with two neutrons. Tritium is a major by-product of nuclear reactions and is difficult and expensive to remove from water. Now, Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) has launched a campaign to convince a sceptical world that dumping up to 800,000 tonnes of contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean is a safe and responsible thing to do. NRA chairman Shunichi Tanaka has officially called on Tepco to work towards a release. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) last year also issued a call for a release to be considered and for Tepco to perform an assessment of the potential impacts. For its part, Tepco has said there are no current plans to release the water. But the Associated Press (AP) reported that company officials are saying in private that they may have no choice. According to Tanaka, Tritium is “so weak in its radioactivity it won’t penetrate plastic wrapping”. The substance can be harmful if ingested. According to AP, Tanaka had demonstrated the relatively tiny amount of tritium present in the combined Fukushima standing tanks – 57ml in total – by holding a small bottle half full of blue liquid in front of reporters. A more useful measure of the amount of tritium is its radioactivity, which is measured in becquerels. According to the NRA, the tanks at Fukushima contain 3.4 peta becquerels (PBq) of tritium. Despite the number of zeros in this measurement (there are 14), this is not a big number, said Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. To put it in context, the natural global accumulation of tritium is a relatively tiny 2,200 PBq. The isotope has a half life of 12.3 years and is only created naturally on Earth by a rare reaction between cosmic rays and the atmosphere. By far the largest source of tritium in our environment is the nuclear weapons testing programme of last century, which dumped a total of 186,000 PBq into the world’s oceans. Over time this has decayed to roughly 8,000 PBq. Another significant source of tritium are nuclear power stations, which have long dumped tritium-contaminated water into the ocean. “I would think more has been put into the Irish Sea [from the UK’s Sellafield plant] than would ever be released off Japan,” said Buesseler. So far, the Fukushima disaster has seen 0.1-0.5 PBq leaked or released into the Pacific. Even if all of the contaminated water were released into the ocean, it would not contain enough tritium to be detectable by the time it dispersed and reached the US west coast about four years later, said Simon Boxall, an oceanographer at the University of Southampton. “In the broad scale of things, if they do end up putting the material in the Pacific, it will have minimal effect on an ocean basin scale,” said Boxall. “In an ideal world, we wouldn’t be in this situation. But the question is, what is the safest way forward? In many ways this is a pragmatic solution.” But Boxall said there may be local effects – especially on the already heavily impacted fishing industry – as the contaminated water would take time to disperse. International maritime law prohibits the building of a pipeline to send the waste offshore. Therefore any release would need to be slow. Tepco did not respond to questions regarding the environmental impact study called for by the IAEA. Despite harbouring few prima facie fears about the 3.4PBq of tritium stored at Fukushima, Buesseler said the lack of transparency surrounding much of the post-tsunami decommissioning process made it impossible to be definitive about the safety of any course of action. “Until you get the hard data, it’s hard to say if it’s a good idea or not. I want to have independent confirmation of what’s in every tank, which isotopes, how much they want to release per day. You get more of ‘don’t worry, trust us’,” said Buesseler He notes that there have been minor differences between the official Tepco line that all leaks have stopped and Buesseler’s own measurements of very low levels of caesium and strontium still entering the ocean from the plant. “It’s easy to have conspiracy theories when no-one is independently assessing what is going on,” he said. The push for release will also be a blow to the hopes of US start-up Kurion, and their new parent company Veolia, which was awarded a $10m (£7m) grant from the Japanese government in 2014 to demonstrate that its tritium scrubbing technology could be scaled to meet the challenge of the Fukushima problem. The plan would create 90,000 tonnes of hydrogen gas, which Kurion said could be used to power vehicles. Neither Tepco, nor Kurion, responded to requests for cost estimates of implementing this technology at the site. Kurion’s website calls it “cost-effective” and has said it could have its demonstration plant running within 18 months. These costs are fundamental to the question of whether to release the material, because whatever they are, it is the price Japan seems unwilling to pay to fully clean up the lingering mess at Fukushima."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jun/30/did-merkel-trip-on-gay-marriage-vote-or-is-this-more-canny-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-30T18:27:53Z","webTitle":"Did Merkel trip on gay marriage vote, or was this more canny politics?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/30/did-merkel-trip-on-gay-marriage-vote-or-is-this-more-canny-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jun/30/did-merkel-trip-on-gay-marriage-vote-or-is-this-more-canny-politics","fields":{"headline":"Did Merkel trip on gay marriage vote, or was this more canny politics?","bodyText":"Sixteen years after the Netherlands became the first country in the world to pass legislation in favour of gay marriage, Germany has finally followed suit. The answer to why it took so long is that much of Germany remains conservative at heart. While Angela Merkel has helped create the impression of her country as a liberal democracy, aided by issues such as her refugee policy and the decision to dismantle the country’s nuclear power stations, in reality it is steeped in conservative values. The focus from abroad on Berlin as a tourist destination sometimes gives the impression that the whole country looks like the capital: a party town, a mecca for artists and gay people. But the reality is that large swaths of Germany are staunchly socially conservative. It has one of the widest gender pay gaps in Europe, and there are pockets of deep-seated racism. The country’s traditionalist nature is underscored by the fact that Merkel’s CDU has now been the leading party in a grand coalition for the past 12 years, and is likely to be re-elected in September for at least a further five. Public opinion may have moved behind same-sex marriage in recent years – 75% of those who responded to a recent poll said they supported marriage equality – but the ruling CDU has consistently blocked a vote in parliament on the issue. Even on Friday, some of the more conservative members of the CDU invoked the constitution in defending marriage as a union between a man and a woman. For liberals who hold Merkel up as something of a heroine, her no vote is a reminder that she still has a strong conservative base to play to, and that she remains true to her strict upbringing. Merkel has religious roots: her father was a protestant pastor seminary on the edge of the old market town of Templin in eastern Germany. Her personality, her views on Europe and her attitude to crisis could all be said to have been shaped by her upbringing under communism. She has said her first political memory was of the Berlin Wall being erected in August 1961, and recalled her mother weeping in church on 13 August while her father delivered his weekly sermon from the pulpit. On Friday, the SPD’s Johannes Kahrs accused Merkel of having “tripped, Schabowski-like” after appearing to trigger yesterday’s vote on same sex marriage. Günter Schabowski was an obscure East German functionary who in the autumn of 1989 delivered the erroneous message that the travel ban on the country’s citizens had been lifted and they could pass through any of its border crossings with immediate effect. With that, he mistakenly opened the Berlin Wall, and ensured his place in cold war history. Historians are just about in agreement that Schabowski, who died in 2015, really did slip up when he stumbled over the words of that infamous politburo memo. But 12 years into her chancellorship, it is hard to see Merkel as someone who would make such a clumsy mistake. Rather, it is much easier to view her as a canny operator who meant to trigger the gay marriage vote all along."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/23/the-guardian-view-on-uk-brexit-policy-this-time-the-lady-is-for-turning","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-23T18:05:04Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on UK Brexit policy: this time the lady is for turning | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/23/the-guardian-view-on-uk-brexit-policy-this-time-the-lady-is-for-turning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/23/the-guardian-view-on-uk-brexit-policy-this-time-the-lady-is-for-turning","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on UK Brexit policy: this time the lady is for turning","bodyText":"The orthodoxy says that few things are more humiliating for a leader than a U-turn. That’s especially true in the Conservative party, where the ghostly voice of Margaret Thatcher in 1980 – “You turn if you want to. The lady’s not for turning” – still echoes in the Central Office rafters. Sometimes, though, the orthodoxy is simply wrong. In some circumstances, a U-turn can be – and can even be publicly respected as – an act of common sense and even enlightenment. Mrs Thatcher might have survived longer if she had scrapped her delusional poll tax in 1989. Tony Blair’s reputation would be different if he had abandoned the Iraq invasion in the face of the public’s discontent. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s ratings grew stronger after the Fukushima incident persuaded her to phase out the nuclear power programme she had previously backed. Theresa May’s U-turn on Britain’s relationship with the European court of justice after Brexit is one that should be warmly welcomed. Be in no doubt that a U-turn is what it is. In the past the prime minister’s language on the ECJ has been absolutist and without nuance. She has pledged that “the authority of EU law in Britain will end”, that a return to ECJ jurisdiction is “not going to happen”, and that the laws “will be interpreted by judges not in Luxembourg but in courts across this country”. With the publication of the government’s latest policy paper, on post-Brexit dispute resolution, none of those assertions is now true. Instead the paper sets out a range of ways in which the ECJ and its rulings will continue to play some part in the rule of UK law after Brexit. These dispute resolution proposals are only presented as options. But Mrs May’s previous policy would have meant the hardest of Brexits. Total exclusion of the ECJ would have meant no possibility of a post-Brexit relationship with the EU single market or customs union, relationships that are profoundly in the interest of British jobs, companies and the British economy. The paper’s claim that leaving the EU will end the “direct jurisdiction” of the ECJ within the UK is a fig leaf to conceal the government’s larger retreat. The future relationship with the EU is now in play. This is a big change. It should be supported and developed. It was always utterly foolish to treat the ECJ as a red line in the Brexit process. The reality of any future relationship with the EU, in trade, individual rights, family law, crime, the environment and much else, is that it is not going to happen unless the ECJ is a stakeholder in its rule-making and rule enforcement. The only way in which exclusion of the ECJ would make sense is if foreign judges can never say anything about international codes that Britain should take into account. This is not the way British law has evolved and it is not the way that the rest of the world works either, especially in trade. Most trade is governed by multilateral codes, not the bilateral ones the Brexiters fantasise about. Multilateral agreements require multilateral disputes mechanisms, so any agreement with the EU requires its judges, the ECJ, to play a part. The UK government has now published six Brexit negotiation position papers. More are imminent. All are too cautious. None is bold enough to make the national interest explicit. But the momentum of all of them is towards compromise with the EU and away from unilateralism. All of them to some degree embody consensual aspirations towards the EU. All of them express a recognition that compromise, not defiance, is in the best interest of British jobs and living standards. None of them, as yet, proposes the logical outcome of this direction of travel, that Britain should remain in as close a relationship as possible with the EU after Brexit. But that is the direction of travel. The government is having a necessary encounter with reality. Supporters of liberal values and internationalism must redouble the pressure. This time the lady is for turning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/19/corbyn-allies-byelections-stoke-on-trent-copeland-challenge-leadership-diane-abbott","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T18:02:27Z","webTitle":"Corbyn allies insist byelections will not challenge his leadership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/19/corbyn-allies-byelections-stoke-on-trent-copeland-challenge-leadership-diane-abbott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/19/corbyn-allies-byelections-stoke-on-trent-copeland-challenge-leadership-diane-abbott","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn allies insist byelections will not challenge his leadership","bodyText":"Allies of Jeremy Corbyn have insisted his leadership will continue if Labour loses one or both byelections in Stoke-on-Trent and Copeland on Thursday. The party is optimistic of hanging on in both contests, triggered by the resignations of two sitting MPs, Tristram Hunt and Jamie Reed, to take up new jobs. However, the electoral battle is still thought to be close and unpredictable, particularly in the Cumbrian seat of Copeland, where the Conservatives have played on Corbyn’s historic opposition to nuclear power. There is more confidence among Labour activists about Stoke, given Ukip leader Paul Nuttall’s difficulties in the campaign, but defeat in either long-held seat is likely to prompt renewed questions about Labour’s ability to appeal to voters. Diane Abbott, one of Corbyn’s closest allies, said she was confident he would lead the party into the 2020 election, and there was no need for a succession plan. “These are difficult byelections, they’re going to be quite tight,” she told Sky’s Sophy Ridge. “We are hopeful of winning both of them but it’s really important that every Labour supporter comes out to vote. “And if we lose one or we lose both, I think the party will go forward. It has to go forward.” Asked whether there would be questions over Corbyn’s leadership if one or both seats are lost, she said: “No, no. I mean there are people who have been opposed to Jeremy from the very beginning, I’m not one of them and I think we have to move forward.” Speculation about Corbyn’s future in charge began anew after reports last week that Labour had conducted polling in the north of England about the appeal of Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner, considered two possible candidates to replace him. This was strongly dismissed by the Labour leadership, with Corbyn rejecting rumours that he was prepared to name a date to hand over to another candidate as “fake news”. At the same time, Labour MPs who oppose the leadership are showing very little enthusiasm for the idea of mounting another challenge this year, and prefer the idea of battling to stop allies of Corbyn changing the rules at party conference to make it easier for a leftwing successor to make it on to the ballot paper. One Labour MP, who has been a frequent critic of Corbyn, said MPs were continuing to refrain from public criticism because the leader would have to go on his own terms if he wanted to give up the job. “There is no appetite for another contest this year,” she said. “And besides, it’s not like we have an obvious candidate.” Sadiq Khan, the Labour London mayor, also dismissed the idea of replacing Corbyn if the byelection results are bad, as he was questioned about the results in an interview with ITV’s Peston on Sunday. “He’s won two leadership elections in the space of two years. I think that issue has been settled,” he said. Polling suggests that Labour is nationally in a difficult position, with support at its lowest level since Gordon Brown was prime minister in 2009, trailing the Conservatives by around 14 points. There is recognition among senior Labour figures that something must be done to reverse the situation, regardless of the byelection results. If the party lost in either seat, supporters of the leadership would be able to point to Tony Blair’s intervention on Friday suggesting Brexit could be blocked, despite Corbyn’s decision to whip his MPs in favour of article 50. On Saturday, the Labour leader described Blair’s speech as “unhelpful”, while a string of Labour MPs also questioned the timing of the comments in the week before the two byelections in strongly leave-voting seats. Scenarios Wins both A win in both seats would be hugely important for Corbyn, showing the continuing power of Labour as a brand in two seats where the party has been historically dominant. It would also be a reflection of Labour’s strong ground game and activist base, as well as the public’s unhappiness with the state of the NHS locally trumping any goodwill for the Conservatives over Brexit. On top of that, a win in Stoke would heavily diminish Ukip leader Paul Nuttall’s claims to be a threat to Labour in the north of England. Loses Copeland A loss in Copeland would be easier to explain, as the constituency is highly dependent on jobs in the nuclear industry, which Corbyn has historically opposed on principle. He has repeatedly said there is a place for nuclear power in the energy mix during the campaign, but that position contrasts with the Labour leader’s years of antipathy to nuclear power. That said, it would be a blow to the party to lose a seat it has held since its inception in 1983, with the Conservatives likely to seize on it as an example of Labour’s waning power in the north of England. Loses Stoke This would symbolically be a worse loss for Labour than Copeland, because it would hand Ukip its first elected MP who is not a defector. The loss of such a heavily leave-voting seat would also point to wider problems with the party’s mixed messages over Brexit, despite Corbyn’s decision to whip MPs in favour of voting for article 50. Labour aides would be able to point to Tony Blair’s intervention in favour of reversing Brexit as an unhelpful factor. But it would undoubtedly create serious worries in the party about its ability to appeal to working-class communities. Loses both This would be the nightmare scenario for Corbyn and raise questions about his ability to continue as leader, coupled with continuing poor national polling. However, neither his supporters nor critics have a viable candidate as a successor and there is little appetite within the parliamentary party for another leadership election. But there would undoubtedly be calls for a serious rethink of strategy and redoubled efforts to concentrate on the tactics needed to win elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2017/dec/10/attacks-on-mcdonnell-sign-tories-know-stance-on-borrowing-is-defunct-debt-reduction-invest","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T13:01:34Z","webTitle":"Attacks on McDonnell a sign Tories know stance on borrowing is defunct | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2017/dec/10/attacks-on-mcdonnell-sign-tories-know-stance-on-borrowing-is-defunct-debt-reduction-invest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2017/dec/10/attacks-on-mcdonnell-sign-tories-know-stance-on-borrowing-is-defunct-debt-reduction-invest","fields":{"headline":"Attacks on McDonnell a sign Tories know stance on borrowing is defunct","bodyText":"Rarely has a chancellor had to publish economic forecasts as downbeat as those in last month’s budget, but so far the political fallout has been minimal. Philip Hammond has had a good couple of weeks. That is partly explained by the focus on other matters, such as the investigation into Damian Green and, of course, Brexit. An added bonus for Hammond is that the post-budget attention has not been on him but on John McDonnell, his Labour shadow. McDonnell’s problems began on budget day when Andrew Neil asked him how much Britain was paying each year in debt interest. The shadow chancellor clearly did not know the answer - £48bn - and tried to wing it. In a subsequent interview, he bridled when questioned about how much Labour’s spending plans would add to the national debt - impossible to say - replying that was why his advisers had iPads. That was the cue for a concerted attack on McDonnell and his plan to borrow an additional £250bn over the next decade for investment in Britain’s infrastructure. There was much talk about leaving future generations with an intolerable debt burden, with the political subtext being that a man who could not give a straightforward answer to simple questions could not be trusted with the nation’s money. This was not the shadow chancellor’s finest hour. He came across as overconfident and underprepared. It is hard to imagine Gordon Brown not knowing how much the Major government was paying in debt interest back in the mid-1990s. That said though, McDonnell was right. Extra borrowing certainly means an increase in the national debt and higher debt interest payments in the short term, but that is not the real issue. Imagine the chief executive of a FTSE 100 company going on TV to announce that the company was planning to go to the City to finance a new plant. The interview would not centre on what the investment meant for the company’s debt interest payments. The chief executive would be asked about what it meant for jobs, earnings and profits. In the event that the chief executive was asked about the cost of the investment, they would give the same answer as McDonnell did, that at current rates of interest the investment would more than pay for itself, because otherwise we would not be doing it. Our debt interest payments will depend on what happens to interest rates and inflation, but our best judgment is that the investment will wash itself. Instead of obsessing about the red herring of debt interest payments, more attention should be paid to the things that do matter. Labour is planning to borrow to invest, not to cover day-to-day government spending, and that makes sense if the return on the investment is higher than the cost of financing the extra debt. Governments do not go bust, which means that they can borrow more cheaply than companies. Since the financial crisis of a decade ago, interest rates have been historically low and if he chose to do so, Hammond could borrow money at a cost of little more than 2%, below the current rate of inflation. All very well, McDonnell’s critics may say, but what happens if a chancellor’s public investment plans spook the markets and force up interest rates? In those circumstances, higher public investment will make private investment more expensive and so less attractive. This would certainly be a plausible argument were Britain at the height of a raging boom, but the chances of that any time soon look pretty remote. The financial markets currently think that 10-year bond yields - how much it costs the government to borrow for 10 year- will still only be just over 2% in 2027. As Michael Burke noted in Socialist Economic Bulletin, the returns on commercial investment are on average around 12%. “Any government, or business, which can borrow at such low interest rates for such high investment returns would be foolish to pass up this opportunity. It is reckless and extreme that the Tories have passed up this opportunity,” the Irish economist wrote. This raises a second issue, namely whether a future Labour government would get a commercial rate of return on its investment. That means choosing the right projects, which Labour says it would do after consultation with industry and expert bodies. The £10bn cost of a Crossrail for the north would unlock £85bn of additional economic growth, the party says, while electrification of the Great Western Railway would cost £750m but generate economic benefits two and a half times as big. Debt levels were high – albeit declining as a share of GDP – in the 1950s and 60s when governments borrowed money to build houses and the motorway network. They were right to do so. There were equally some real turkeys, most notably Concorde and nuclear power stations, and Whitehall is still a sucker for a vanity project. Witness HS2. The highest rates of return are often on unglamorous local projects, but they are available. The criticism aimed at McDonnell in the past couple of weeks is a sign that the government and its media allies are worried, as they should be because the last seven years are littered with mistakes, spurned opportunities and missed targets, all of which have resulted in austerity lasting for 15 years rather than five. It was reckless of George Osborne as chancellor to cut capital investment so deeply in 2010 in the belief that there would be a fillip to private-sector confidence from his tough approach to deficit reduction. The private sector investment boom never happened, growth slowed and the government missed all its deficit and debt targets. When the newly formed Office for Budget Responsibility made its first forecasts in the summer of 2010, it predicted that debt as a share of national income would peak in 2013-14 at just over 70% of GDP. With a bit of creative accounting, Hammond says the peak will now be in the current financial year, 2017-18, but at 86.5% of GDP. Interest payments on the debt are expected to run at just over £50bn a year for the next five years. As Lord Robert Skidelsky said in a recent House of Lords debate, since 2010 the government had made “liquidating the deficit and reducing the share of the national debt in GDP their top priority. No matter that they keep missing their targets, they return to them every year, but each time with a longer timeline.” Skidelsky added that it was the government’s obsession with deficit reduction that left them with no money to finance its new industrial strategy. “We could put it technically. What they have done is concentrated on reducing the numerator – the deficit – without considering its harmful effects on the denominator, which is the economy.” McDonnell is suggesting the opposite approach. Not before time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T09:03:55Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C in doubt after British government delays approval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C in doubt after British government delays approval","bodyText":"Britain’s first new nuclear power station for a generation is in fresh doubt after the government postponed a final decision on the £18bn project, despite the French energy company behind it voting to start work. The government said ministers would now conduct another review of the controversial Hinkley Point C project and announce its decision in the early autumn. The announcement surprised EDF, whose directors were preparing to sign contracts with the government on Friday. EDF’s UK chief executive, Vincent De Rivaz, was expected in Somerset on Friday morning alongside senior company officials to give interviews about the project. But following the government statement, it emerged that no interviews would take place. Officials from China General Nuclear (CGN), which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project, had also been expected to attend an event. Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said: “The UK needs a reliable and secure energy supply and the government believes that nuclear energy is an important part of the mix. “The government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.” The new nuclear power station would be Britain’s first since Sizewell B opened in 1995 and is considered vital in helping the country meet its energy requirements. However, Hinkley Point C could eventually cost British taxpayers almost £30bn in subsidies to EDF and its Chinese backer. The government strongly backed the project when David Cameron was prime minister, and EDF’s commitment was expected to be welcomed as a vote of confidence in the economy after the country voted to leave the EU. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, gave his backing to Hinkley Point C two weeks ago, saying: “We have to make sure the project goes ahead.” However, Theresa May’s government is understood to have agreed a new timetable with the French government for the project. A No 10 source said: “EDF made their announcement, and we have agreed a timetable with the French government, which means we will consider all the component parts of this project and make a decision in the early autumn.” Labour’s energy spokesperson said the Hinkley deal was in “absolute chaos” and accused the government of prevaricating. “The government has said for two years now that they didn’t need a plan B,” Barry Gardiner told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday. “And now at a day’s notice they cancel the final signing agreement that they told all the press and everybody that they were going to do.” However, Gardiner said Labour was in favour of changing the deal rather than scrapping it. He said the base price of £92.5 a megawatt-hour was too high and should be renegotiated and called for a root and branch review by the government. “I welcome the jobs and I welcome the 7% electricity this will produce for the nation,” he added. “We’re not against nuclear power in principle. Let me be absolutely clear, I speak as the shadow secretary of state for energy and climate change in Jeremy’s shadow cabinet and we are absolutely clear we are in favour of nuclear power as part of the energy mix we need. “But in 2025 we need that power because coal will no longer be producing, the government have said that, coal will be off the system. That means we need the base load nuclear would provide.” After a decade of debate about the controversial project, the board of EDF approved Hinkley Point C by 10 votes to seven, according to sources close to the company. The construction will create an estimated 25,000 jobs, with completion scheduled for 2025 and work potentially beginning next year. The two nuclear reactors at the plant will provide 7% of Britain’s electricity, enough power for 6 million homes. EDF said in a statement: “Hinkley Point C is a unique asset for French and British industries as it will benefit the whole of the nuclear sectors in both countries and will support employment at major companies and smaller enterprises in the industry.” There was another twist to the contentious project in the run-up to the meeting when an EDF director opposed to the nuclear plant resigned before the formal vote. Gérard Magnin said the project was “very risky” in his resignation letter to EDF’s chief executive. Magnin did not attend the board meeting in Paris on Thursday where EDF’s remaining 17 directors voted. His resignation follows that of EDF’s chief financial official, Thomas Piquemal, earlier this year, which was also linked to concerns about the cost of Hinkley Point C. Their resignations and the narrow margin in the vote highlights the divisions created by the project. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace, called Hinkley Point “terrible value for money” for British families but said it had become “too big to fail” for politicians. EDF is 85% owned by the French government. “Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money,” he said. “This is a bitter pill to swallow for hard-up people who have been told that the government is trying to keep bills down while dealing with energy security and lowering carbon emissions. “Today’s decision doesn’t prove the UK is open for business post Brexit. It just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians. “Theresa May now has a chance to stop this radioactive white elephant in its tracks. She should look at the evidence and see that this deal would be a monumental disaster for taxpayers and bill payers.” The National Audit Office has warned taxpayers could end up paying more than £30bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project. In a damning report, the NAO also said there could be potential liabilities for disposing of spent fuel and meeting claims in the event of a nuclear accident, meaning renewable energy sources may be a cheaper option. The government has agreed a “strike price” – a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point – of £92.50 a megawatt hour for 35 years. This is more than twice the cost of existing wholesale electricity prices. But there is also concern in France about the cost of the project. EDF has net debt of more than €37bn (£31bn) and unions representing the company’s workers in France are concerned that Hinkley Point could jeopardise its survival. The project will be part-funded by China after the China General Nuclear Power Corporation agreed to take a 33% stake in the project. Shareholders in EDF have also agreed to buy €4bn of new shares in the company to fund Hinkley Point C. However, similar projects in Finland and Flamanville, in France, are years behind schedule and significantly over budget. Areva, the French nuclear group that works with EDF, had to be rescued from bankruptcy by the French government because of the problems in the industry. In his resignation letter, Magnin wrote: “Let’s hope that Hinkley Point will not drag EDF into the same abyss as Areva.” Magnin has a background in alternative energies and is the founder of Energy Cities, an association designed to help local authorities move to newer forms of energy. The French government proposed him as a board member in 2014, which was seen as an attempt to encourage the company to invest more in renewable energy. Business leaders in Britain welcomed EDF’s announcement, saying that new investment in the country’s infrastructure is vital. Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the CBI, said: “The final green light for Hinkley Point is welcome news as now, more than ever, action is needed on key infrastructure projects which attract investment to the United Kingdom. “The project represents a significant milestone in the United Kingdom’s energy future. It will play a key role in further securing and decarbonising our energy supply, putting us on the right path to a sustainable energy mix. “We hope it will also help kickstart a new nuclear build programme, creating jobs for tens of thousands of people – not just in the local community but up and down the whole country.” Hinkley Point has already been beset by delays due to concerns about cost and safety. The government initially gave the green light for new nuclear power stations in Britain in 2006, claiming they would make a “significant contribution” to lowering carbon emissions as polluting coal power stations are phased out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/blog/2018/jan/05/the-theatre-company-putting-victorian-sci-fi-centre-stage-hg-wells-crystal-egg-live","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T19:04:07Z","webTitle":"The theatre company putting Victorian sci-fi centre stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/jan/05/the-theatre-company-putting-victorian-sci-fi-centre-stage-hg-wells-crystal-egg-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2018/jan/05/the-theatre-company-putting-victorian-sci-fi-centre-stage-hg-wells-crystal-egg-live","fields":{"headline":"The theatre company putting Victorian sci-fi centre stage","bodyText":"HG Wells hold a special place in the hearts of many sci-fi enthusiasts and scientists alike. Best known for his novels The War of the Worlds, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and The Invisible Man, Wells’s work is renowned for its prescience and has been revisited and adapted many times, so modern do some of his fears and preoccupations seem. The Crystal Egg is a short story written 1897. Set in a grimily familiar depiction of Victorian London, it is a disturbing piece combining an almost Dickensian family-run curiosity shop, a pleasing account of scientific method and altogether more eerie references to portals into other worlds and alien beings. As we look towards missions to Mars and search the skies for signs of life, Wells’s preoccupation with the red planet and contact, benign or otherwise, with alien intelligence seems very much to speak to our time. It seems fitting, therefore, that one London theatre company have decided to start the new year with an immersive theatre adaptation of Wells’s short story, The Crystal Egg Live. I asked the show’s producer, Mike Archer, and director, Elif Knight to talk me through their interest in Wells, the challenges of adaptation and how Victorian sci-fi sits alongside more contemporary fiction, film and television. What drew you to HG Wells in general and this story in particular? Mike Archer: I have been a fan of Wells’s work since I was a boy. I encountered The Crystal Egg in 2005 and was drawn to the idea of it extending the mythos of the invasion from Mars in The War of the Worlds. Recently, I started to feel the story had something to say about things that are happening in the world right now. When we went back to the story, myself and my partner Luisa Guerreiro thought about how we could use The Crystal Egg as an inspiration, and wanted to adapt it into an invasion story for the now. Elif Knight: I was aware of HG Wells as a very prescient writer of science fiction. The fact that he had predicted many of the inventions and developments of the 20th century – not least manned flight and the internet – demonstrated that his imagination was not just wide-ranging but also accurate. But the question arose: how to show what an extraordinary piece of work The Crystal Egg is? And when the producers offered me the Vaults as a location, I had my answer – to recreate for the audience the atmosphere of the late nineteenth century, so that they could get a sense of how astonishing Wells’s vision was at that time. Wells articulates many fears about science and the future of civilization in his works. What does this piece say about his time or ours? MA: I think the message that the story conveys has changed as our social attitudes have changed. Wells wrote The Crystal Egg at the height of the Victorian interest in the possibility of intelligent life on Mars, and this is what gives the story its scientific viewpoint. The alien world Wells portrays is credible and feels real, because he was able to logically specualte on the way life might develop on another world. It was a more optimistic outlook than he portrayed in The War of the Worlds so I feel he was portraying a wondrous and pleasing vision of the society he saw. By the time of the 1950s television adaptation, the ideas had changed to something menacing. The effects of the cold war and fear of things like nuclear power, imbues the story with something more menacing. The view point had shifted from “what are they watching?” to “why are they watching?” So when it came to constructing a narrative for our adaptation, we couldn’t ignore the fact that a lot of invasion today is undertaken in a more covert manner. Just look at what is happening in the US with the Russia investigation. EK: In a time where there was a good deal of credulity about unseen worlds, ghosts and other spirits, HG Wells was able to tap into people’s fears. He imagined an access route to Mars through a lump of crystal – in a way he preconceived the worm-hole theory of the universe where one can move from one time and place in the universe through portals in the space-time continuum. Technology is constantly changing, and whether it’s AI or augmented reality, it’s changing our everyday lives in a way many see as threatening, because we, the foot-soldiers of life, have no control. The play also taps into our paranoia about being watched by another entity; surveillance is a key theme and it creates the same feelings of uncertainty we experience today. Were there any particular challenges in staging the story? MA: Yes, several. The biggest for me, was how to honour the source material whilst making it engaging on a relatable level and feeling somewhat fresh. The book is very scientific in its vision, but that scientific vision alone doesn’t necessarily translate to a two hour show. I like sci-fi to feel real. For me the best kind is when you have a world that is recognisable and believable and sci-fi just so happens to be a part of it. I think that is where the semi-immersive nature of part of the show came from. Bringing the audience, themselves aliens in a foreign world, face-to-face with the creation of Wells. This means you have to have a believable world in which to play. We did a lot of research into the Seven Dials area, the context of the story’s creation and began to extrapolate it out. EK: That was a challenge : to re-create the slums of Victorian London in the Vaults. For example, with a small cast we had to create a busy market day in the London of 1897. But that is where things get interesting; that’s where I have used other media and interesting sonic and filmic devices to bring the area to life. Which sci-fibook, film or series has most influenced/impressed you and why? MA: Honestly, it would have to be The War of the Worlds. It had such a huge impact on my imagination as a child and, even now, I still read it with the same feeling of excitement and fear. I watched the Spielberg movie, and the thing that struck me was the utterly fearsome vision of a three-legged machine laying waste to humanity – it is such a striking vision. But I think a lot of sci-fi films in the 70’s and 80’s were genre-defining in their own right. I wanted to live in Blade Runner’s vision of LA, because it always felt so visceral and interesting – growing up within sight of the very vision that inspired the movie’s opening probably helped – but it brought a more grounded reality. They were exciting and they broke new ground. EF: Shows like Quantum Leap, Red Dwarf and The X-Files was very much part of my childhood. But I would say Twin Peaks, which mixes several genres including sci-fi, has influenced and impressed me the most. I love the way David Lynch creates worlds within worlds.

But in a letter released on Tuesday in reply to MPs on the energy and climate change select committee, which asked what contingency plans were in place if Hinkley is delayed or cancelled, she said: “While we have every confidence the deal will go ahead, we have arrangements in place to ensure that any potential delay or cancellation to the project does not pose a risk to security of supply for the UK. I am clear that keeping the lights on is non-negotiable.”She also said that delays to the troubled plant could risk the UK missing its targets to cut carbon emissions, and that alternatives could cost more but would not represent a “significant increase” in cost in the short term. The final decision by French-state owned company EDF to go ahead with Hinkley has been repeatedly delayed and the billion of pounds of state subsidies and the feasibility of the giant project have been widely criticised. Last week one of the UK’s major investors, Legal and General, called Hinkley “a total waste of money”. EDF, their Chinese partners and the UK and French governments have insisted Hinkley will be built, with French economy minister Emmanuel Macron saying on Sunday the project would go ahead. In Rudd’s letter, she says: “Macron has publicly provided assurances that ‘the decision must be agreed ahead of EDF’s shareholder meeting [12 May]’.” In March, EDF’s finance director resigned and its trade unions have warned the Hinkley project could severely damage the company. Rudd said that without Hinkley, energy security would come from the capacity market, where the government offers subsidised contracts for guaranteed electricity supply. The Institute for Public Policy Research has called the capacity market “unfit for purpose”. Rudd said there was also “detailed monitoring and governance arrangements to ensure we have sufficient intelligence and foresight on any issues that might delay construction further down the line, so that alternative capacity can be put in place.” She said alternative sources of supply “would be unlikely to present a significant increase” in energy bills for delays known about before 2021. But she also warned: “There is also a risk though that any delay could put at risk our decarbonisation targets - one of the key reasons the government is supporting Hinkley Point C in the first place.” A report from the government’s National Infrastructure Commission in March found that “smart power – principally built around three innovations, interconnection, storage, and demand flexibility – could save consumers up to £8bn a year by 2030, help the UK meet its 2050 carbon targets, and secure the UK’s energy supply for generations.” Angus MacNeil, chair of the energy and climate change committee, said: “[Rudd’s] letter shows the government has had to finally concede the need for a Plan B on Hinkley, although the detail is sketchy. New capacity must be brought online in a way that is compatible with our decarbonisation targets. That means limiting the role of fossil fuels and maximising the use of smarter low carbon options to meet demand.” The shadow energy and climate secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: “This letter is new evidence that ministers have lost control over the future of this project. We now need to see a detailed plan B that protects billpayers and ensures we achieve legally binding pollution goals.” Rudd was also asked by the select committee what liabilities taxpayers would face if the project was cancelled at this stage. She said: “At this stage, as no contracts have yet been signed, there are no liabilities which would fall to the UK taxpayer or consumer.” But she said, once the contracts are entered into, there were small risks of compensation payments if the project was cancelled, though these are “almost entirely within the control of the UK government”. In March, the Guardian reported that the Hinkley deal contains a “poison pill” which could leave taxpayers with a £22bn bill if a future UK government closed the plant before 2060. John Sauven, Greenpeace’s UK director said: “There is absolutely no reason that the UK could not meet our decarbonisation targets if the government dropped Hinkley and gave renewable energy businesses a fraction of political and financial support that nuclear and fossil fuel companies enjoy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/jul/31/bioweapons-cancer-moonshot-gene-editing","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-31T20:29:51Z","webTitle":"'There are things worse than death': can a cancer cure lead to brutal bioweapons?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/31/bioweapons-cancer-moonshot-gene-editing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/jul/31/bioweapons-cancer-moonshot-gene-editing","fields":{"headline":"'There are things worse than death': can a cancer cure lead to brutal bioweapons?","bodyText":"Splitting the atom brought humanity nuclear power and nuclear weapons. A cure for cancer could have the same potential for pushing humanity to new highs – or terrifying lows. According to John Sotos, the chief medical officer of Intel, the same technology that might someday allow us to defeat illness for good also poses the prospect of tailored diseases attacking individuals, families or even whole races and rewriting their genomes on the fly. Sotos made his remarks at the DEF CON hacking conference in Las Vegas, a place where hackers gather to share tips and tricks for how to break into almost anything with a circuit board. But during a weekend when attacks were demonstrated against wind farms, voting machines and almost every major smartphone in one fell swoop, Sotos’ nightmare scenario still stood out as plausible and terrifying. The Intel executive, best known for his work over six years as a consultant on the TV show House, argued that the eventual success of Joe Biden’s “cancer moonshot”, a US government-funded programme that’s aimed at finding vaccine-based treatments for cancer, would necessarily open up the potential for bioweapons of unimaginable destructive potential. “The reason you haven’t heard much about bioweapons is that they’ve been held back by a pretty severe limitation, which is the potential for blowback,” Sotos said. It is hard for any attacker to use weaponised diseases because they spread beyond their initial distribution range: destroy your neighbouring nation and you destroy your own as well. But, Sotos argued, “the cancer moonshot is going to really drive new technologies to manipulate DNA because cancer is a disease of DNA. [And] the same exquisite targeting that allows it to attack only your cancer cells also overcomes the blowback potential for bioweapons.” In other words: if you can build a treatment that can be restricted to attack only cells with the genetic flag for cancer, you can build a bioweapon that can be restricted to attack only individuals with a particular genetic flag revealing their ancestry, gender or family. The technology doesn’t exist yet, although a number of medical techniques such as Crispr – a genome-editing tool – show the potential of such biohacking. But Sotos argued that its eventual refinement “is inevitable. There are going to be thousands of people doing this sort of genetic manipulation down in the basements of hospitals.” But a plausible attack doesn’t just mean mass fatalities. “There’s some stuff worse than dying,” Sotos said. “And I call that hell.” What, for example, if groups spread their agenda in a very direct way, by literally rewriting DNA to make it impossible to live a life against their credo? Suppose militant vegans wanted to end meat eating: there’s a gene for that. Or imagine if radical misogynists wanted to force the veiling of all women: there’s a gene for sunlight intolerance, and the genetic functions of gender are already well-known. Or, he suggested, attacks could be done on an individual level: targeting public figures by stealing their genetic code, or targeting their whole family by sequencing the genes of someone who’s closely related. And the attacks could be subtler than what’s expected: Sotos cited genes for intractable diarrhea, massive weight gain, total baldness and “an intense fishy body odour”. But Sotos was suggesting a worst-case scenario, and other scientists criticised him for distracting from real problems in the present. “Creating noise &amp; sounding alarms this way isn’t helpful to saving lives,” tweeted DJ Patil, the former chief data scientist of the US Office of Science and Technology Policy. “The risk is really small. It’s really hard to mass produce these. The real risk we should be focusing on is drug resistant TB and pandemics.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/aug/11/nuclear-consultant-accused-espionage-china-us-szuhsiung-allen-ho","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T17:18:07Z","webTitle":"Who is the US engineer accused of nuclear espionage?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/nuclear-consultant-accused-espionage-china-us-szuhsiung-allen-ho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/aug/11/nuclear-consultant-accused-espionage-china-us-szuhsiung-allen-ho","fields":{"headline":"Who is the US engineer accused of nuclear espionage?","bodyText":"Dr Szuhsiung “Allen” Ho is, according to a motion filed by his lawyer, a 66-year-old American citizen who was born in Taiwan, educated in the US and lives in Wilmington, Delaware. In character statements submitted to a court in Tennessee, friends and neighbours described him as an honest and law abiding member of the community who loved the US and would eventually be exonerated of charges of nuclear espionage brought against him by the US government. Ho came to the US in 1973 to attend the University of California and married his wife Anne a year later. He received a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Illinois in 1980, and became a naturalised US citizen three years later. . The couple are childless, but Ho fathered a son outside the marriage in 2007. Neighbours said his wife had declared herself willing to help raise the child in the US. They are described as active members of the local Chinese American Community Centre in Wilmington, where Anne Ho is involved in running a women’s book club. The couple live in a large house in the town, which has sizeable Chinese community, but Ho spends much of his time in China working for his nuclear consulting business, Energy Technology International, which was set up in 1996. Prosecutors say he has two flats in China, one of his own and another for his son and the boy’s mother. Ho has worked as a consultant for China General Nuclear Power, which has a 33% stake in the UK’s £18bn Hinkley Point C project. Prosecutors allege that he enticed US nuclear experts at the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority energy corporation to pass sensitive information to Beijing by paying them bribes. They also allege that he failed to register with the Department of Justice as an agent of a foreign state and that he is paid by the Chinese government. Ho is charged with helping a foreign power produce nuclear material, a term that refers to enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear reactor fuel. His lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, said in court papers Ho had “no expertise or experience in the development or production of special nuclear material”. He said Ho was helping nuclear plants in China to run safely in order to avoid a Chernobyl-style disaster. Ho was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, in April and has been jailed pending trial. If found guilty he could face life in prison. Zeidenberg has requested bail, pointing out that Ho, 66, is “not a young man” and is “poorly equipped for dealing with the stress and potential dangers inherent in detention”. He said that at one facility where Ho was held, he had to be segregated from other inmates after they were heard discussing a plan to harm him. “It has been brutal for him in every way imaginable,” a friend of Ho’s said. Neighbours and family friends have provided statements praising his character, according to filings with the court intended to support his bail request, which will be heard on Tuesday. Gwen and David Chen, also of Wilmington, said Ho was a “bright, honest, warm, mild, likable [sic], and friendly man”, adding that the allegations “must be some misunderstanding”. Friend Amy Chien said he was a “man of filial piety” who always visited his family in Taiwan when he travelled to China and was “well liked and respected in his circle of friends”. Shirley and Evan Tseng said he spent a lot of time in China for work, but that he had “roots deeply planted in Delaware” and loved the US. “This is his home and his country, and he would never betray it,” they said. Ho’s sister-in-law, Donna En Ning Lee, said Ho “has not – nor will he ever – evade the law” and offered to put her house up as a bail bond. Zeidenberg said Ho was not a flight risk, had no criminal history or drug or alcohol problems, and was prepared to submit to house arrest with an ankle bracelet to monitor his movements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/28/japan-pm-shinzo-abe-election-challenge-tokyo-governor-yuriko-koike","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T08:38:31Z","webTitle":"Populist former ally aims to rip up Japanese PM's election plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/28/japan-pm-shinzo-abe-election-challenge-tokyo-governor-yuriko-koike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/28/japan-pm-shinzo-abe-election-challenge-tokyo-governor-yuriko-koike","fields":{"headline":"Populist former ally aims to rip up Japanese PM's election plans","bodyText":"Japan’s prime minister, Shinzō Abe, faces a serious challenge from an ally turned nemesis, as voters prepare to go to the polls next month in an election he has described as a verdict on his handling of the economy and North Korea. Abe dissolved the lower house of parliament on Thursday, with polls showing a new conservative party formed by the popular governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, making ground on his ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP). Koike’s Party of Hope, formed only a day earlier, has pledged to be a “tolerant, conservative reform party” that will challenge vested interests and respect diversity. Koike, a former news anchor who speaks English and Arabic, has cast herself as a conservative populist, determined to take on the political old guard, since she became Tokyo’s first female governor last year. “If at this time we don’t reset Japan, we won’t be able to sufficiently protect our international competitiveness and national security,” Koike said at her party’s official launch. Abe called the election – a year earlier than expected – in an attempt to exploit a weak and divided opposition and to secure a mandate for his spending plans and tough line against Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear programmes. Koike, who served as defence minister during Abe’s first term as prime minister a decade ago, has said she will not run in the election but will stay on as governor to oversee preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. But her decision to lead the new party, coupled with her positive media profile, could frustrate Abe’s plans by attracting conservative and undecided voters. Opinion polls showed the Party of Hope closing the gap on the ruling party, despite signs that Abe has emerged relatively unscathed from two summer scandals that dragged his support to the lowest levels since he became prime minister in late 2012. A survey by the Mainichi newspaper found 18% of respondents would vote for Hope compared with 29% for Abe’s party. Another poll by the Asahi newspaper put Koike’s party on 13% and the LDP on 32%. The Party of Hope’s emergence on the national political scene has thrown the main opposition party, the Democrats, into turmoil. Several Democrat MPs have defected to Koike’s party, while its leader, Seiji Maehara, is reportedly considering allowing Democrats to run as Hope candidates. While the LDP is expected to win, a strong challenge from the centre-right could cost it precious seats in the powerful lower house. The LDP and its junior coalition partner, Komeito, have the two-thirds majority in both houses Abe needs to push ahead with his plans to rewrite Japan’s pacifist constitution. Failure to retain his party’s supermajority would in effect end the prospects for constitutional reform – a project to which Abe has devoted his entire political career. Yoel Sano, head of global political and security risk at BMI Research in Tokyo, said Abe’s gamble could backfire if voters see the snap election as a grab for power. “The Japanese public may view it as a cynical and opportunistic move, especially given the severity of the North Korean crisis,” Sano said. Koike, who has long been tipped to become Japan’s first female prime minister, defied the LDP to successfully run for the Tokyo governorship last year. In July, the local forerunner to her party crushed the LDP in the Tokyo assembly elections, fuelling speculation that she would challenge the ruling party in national elections. Some analysts said Abe was unlikely to suffer the same fate as the British prime minister, Theresa May, who called a snap election in the spring only to see her Conservative party lose its majority in the House of Commons. “Unlike in Britain with Labour, there is no opposition worthy of the name in Japan,” said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. “The LDP is a giant among dwarves. It would take a major scandal to derail the Abe express. “He may not retain his supermajority but given the fractured and unprepared state of Japan’s opposition parties, it’s hard to see much risk to a commanding majority.” Abe and Koike are both business-friendly conservatives and hawkish on security, but they differ in two areas that could have a bearing on the election. While Abe is committed to a sales tax rise in 2019 he says is needed to fund spending on education and nursing care for the elderly, Koike has called for a freeze on the tax. Koike has also called for Japan to abandon nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima meltdown; Abe supports reactor restarts. “There’s not much daylight between Koike’s party and the LDP,” said Gerry Curtis, professor emeritus at Columbia University. “It’s a question of who can impress the voters as more competent. It’s competence and it’s character.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/07/donald-trump-dangerous-psychiatrist","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T00:05:07Z","webTitle":"Trump is now dangerous – that makes his mental health a matter of public interest | Bandy Lee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/donald-trump-dangerous-psychiatrist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/donald-trump-dangerous-psychiatrist","fields":{"headline":"Trump is now dangerous – that makes his mental health a matter of public interest","bodyText":"Eight months ago, a group of us put our concerns into a book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. It became an instant bestseller, depleting bookstores within days. We thus discovered that our endeavours resonated with the public. While we keep within the letter of the Goldwater rule – which prohibits psychiatrists from diagnosing public figures without a personal examination and without consent – there is still a lot that mental health professionals can tell before the public reaches awareness. These come from observations of a person’s patterns of responses, of media appearances over time, and from reports of those close to him. Indeed, we know far more about Trump in this regard than many, if not most, of our patients. Nevertheless, the personal health of a public figure is her private affair – until, that is, it becomes a threat to public health. To make a diagnosis one needs all the relevant information – including, I believe, a personal interview. But to assess dangerousness, one only needs enough information to raise alarms. It is about the situation rather than the person. The same person may not be a danger in a different situation, while a diagnosis stays with the person. It is Trump in the office of the presidency that poses a danger. Why? Past violence is the best predictor of future violence, and he has shown: verbal aggressiveness, boasting about sexual assaults, inciting violence in others, an attraction to violence and powerful weapons and the continual taunting of a hostile nation with nuclear power. Specific traits that are highly associated with violence include: impulsivity, recklessness, paranoia, a loose grip on reality with a poor understanding of consequences, rage reactions, a lack of empathy, belligerence towards others and a constant need to demonstrate power. There is another pattern by which he is dangerous. His cognitive function, or his ability to process knowledge and thoughts, has begun to be widely questioned. Many have noted a distinct decline in his outward ability to form complete sentences, to stay with a thought, to use complex words and not to make loose associations. This is dangerous because of the critical importance of decision-making capacity in the office that he holds. Cognitive decline can result from any number of causes – psychiatric, neurological, medical, or medication-induced – and therefore needs to be investigated. Likewise, we do not know whether psychiatric symptoms are due to a mental disorder, medication, or a physical condition, which only a thorough examination can reveal. A diagnosis in itself, as much as it helps define the course, prognosis, and treatment, is Trump’s private business, but what is our affair is whether the president and commander-in-chief has the capacity to function in his office. Mental illness, or even physical disability, does not necessarily impair a president from performing his function. Rather, questions about this capacity mobilised us to speak out about our concerns, with the intent to warn and to educate the public, so that we can help protect its own safety and wellbeing. Indeed, at no other time in US history has a group of mental health professionals been so collectively concerned about a sitting president’s dangerousness. This is not because he is an unusual person – many of his symptoms are very common – but it is highly unusual to find a person with such signs of danger in the office of presidency. For the US, it may be unprecedented; for parts of the world where this has happened before, the outcome has been uniformly devastating. Pathology does not feel right to the healthy. It repels, but it also exhausts and confuses. There is a reason why staying in close quarters with a person suffering from mental illness usually induces what is called a “shared psychosis”. Vulnerable or weakened individuals are more likely to succumb, and when their own mental health is compromised, they may develop an irresistible attraction to pathology. No matter the attraction, unlike healthy decisions that are life-affirming, choices that arise out of pathology lead to damage, destruction, and death. This is the definition of disease, and how we tell it apart from health. Politics require that we allow everyone an equal chance; medicine requires that we treat everyone equally in protecting them from disease. That is why a liberal health professional would not ignore signs of appendicitis in a patient just because he is a Republican. Similarly, health professionals would not call pancreatic cancer something else because it is afflicting the president. When signs of illness become apparent, it is natural for the physician to recommend an examination. But when the disorder goes so far as to affect an individual’s ability to perform her function, and in some cases risks harm to the public as a result, then the health professional has a duty to sound the alarm. The progress of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigations was worrisome to us for the effects it would have on the president’s stability. We predicted that Trump, who has shown marked signs of psychological fragility under ordinary circumstances, barely able to cope with basic criticism or unflattering news, would begin to unravel with the encroaching indictments. And if his mental stability suffered, then so would public safety and international security. Indeed, that is what began to unfold: Trump became more paranoid, espousing once again conspiracy theories that he had let go of for a while. He seemed further to lose his grip on reality by denying his own voice on the Access Hollywood tapes. Also, the sheer frequency of his tweets seemed to reflect an agitated state of mind, and his retweeting some violent anti-Muslim videos showed his tendency to resort to violence when under pressure. Trump views violence as a solution when he is stressed and desires to re-establish his power. Paranoia and overwhelming feelings of weakness and inadequacy make violence very attractive, and powerful weapons very tempting to use – all the more so for their power. His contest with the North Korean leader about the size of their nuclear buttons is an example of that and points to the possibility of great danger by virtue of the power of his position. It does not take a mental health professional to see that a person of Trump’s impairments, in the office of the presidency, is a danger to us all. What mental health experts can offer is affirmation that these signs are real, that they may be worse than the untrained person suspects, and that there are more productive ways of handling them than deflection or denial. Screening for risk of harm is a routine part of mental health practice, and there are steps that we follow when someone poses a risk of danger: containment, removal from access to weapons and an urgent evaluation. When danger is involved, it is an emergency, where an established patient-provider relationship is not necessary, nor is consent; our ethical code mandates that we treat the person as our patient. In medicine, mental impairment is considered as serious as physical impairment: it is just as debilitating, just as objectively observable and established just as reliably through standardised assessments. Mental health experts routinely perform capacity or fitness for duty examinations for courts and other legal bodies, and offer their recommendations. This is what we are calling for, urgently, in doing our part as medical professionals. The rest of the decision is up to the courts or, in this case, up to the body politic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/30/edf-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-on-track-engineers-reportedly-request-delay","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-30T08:58:31Z","webTitle":"EDF says Hinkley Point is on track as engineers reportedly call for delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/edf-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-on-track-engineers-reportedly-request-delay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/30/edf-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-on-track-engineers-reportedly-request-delay","fields":{"headline":"EDF says Hinkley Point is on track as engineers reportedly call for delay","bodyText":"EDF has insisted that its plans to complete the £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset by 2025 remain on track, despite reports that some of its engineers had called for a two-year delay and a redesign. It came as an EDF board member representing senior staff said in a letter to employees that he would vote against the controversial project. Christian Taxil, who represents the managers’ union CFE-CGC, is the first board member to go public with doubts about the project. The Financial Times reported that senior engineers at the French energy company had supported a wait of at least two years on the project because of its complexity and advocated a redesign of the reactor technology to make it smaller and cheaper to build. In an internal white paper sent to top executives and seen by the FT, the engineers argued that the “realistic service date was 2027”. But in a statement emailed to Reuters on Wednesday, EDF, which is the 85% owned by the French government, dismissed “unfounded rumours and fantasy information” in the media. “EDF denies these rumours [and] confirms that the start up date for the first reactor is fixed for 2025 and that no delay is envisaged,” the company said. Taxil said EDF should not launch the project now because of difficult power market conditions, technical problems with the two planned reactors and EDF’s weak financial position. He wrote in the letter to staff: “Today, conditions are not right for me to give a positive opinion if such a project were presented to me.” There are growing signs of opposition to the project within EDF, including the resignation of its finance director. The company’s chief executive, Jean-Bernard Lévy, has written to staff insisting that it needed more financial backing from the state and would not go ahead without this. The six union members on EDF’s 18-person board are expected to vote against Hinkley Point. They believe that it is too expensive and a risk to the company’s future; EDF is struggling with rising debts. While some non-union board members have voiced doubts about the project in private, all are expected to vote with the management when the board meets on 11 May to make a final decision on the project. A new nuclear reactor at Hinkley in Somerset has been heavily promoted by the chancellor, George Osborne, and other ministers as key to keeping the lights on in Britain.

In France, the Rance estuary plant has been operating since 1966. In Canada, in the Bay of Fundy, which has the highest tides in the world, the plant at Annapolis Royal has been operating since being opened by Prince Charles in 1984. However, the French have no firm plans for more such plants and the Canadians have abandoned them altogether. In Canada, a major consideration has been the devastating impact on fish stocks. It seems to me that the major objective of the proposal might be to extract taxpayer funding for no useful purpose, and the government needs to study the proposals very carefully to ensure we do not end up with a number of very large white elephants in the Severn estuary. Ian Brittain Owermoigne, Dorset • In 1981 a report on tidal power from the Severn estuary by Sir Hermann Bondi calculated that an inner barrage alone could have generated as much electricity (12.9 TWh a year) as a potential series of tidal lagoons. While this could have been up and running within 14 years of starting construction, additional lagoons would add baseload to this reliable supply, given the natural differences in the times of tides sweeping around the coast of Britain. Back then the Central Electricity Generating Board was wedded to nuclear power, when the projected cost per kWh was on a par with the Rance tidal power station in Brittany, and Électricité de France assumed it was twice as expensive as nuclear power, instead of turning out to be cheaper. The ecological impact was negligible; a reduced tidal range would still expose plenty of mudflats where wading birds could feed twice a day, and studies found that the biodiversity of the Rance estuary soon returned. David Nowell New Barnet, Hertfordshire • Your report on the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon proposals (10 January) does not mention that the output from such tidal lagoons drops to zero twice every 24 hours. This could be compensated if tidal generation were to be linked to CANDU-type nuclear reactors. The heavy water these reactors need could be generated by tidal power in periods of slack electricity demand. The reactors would provide power to the grid at the daily periods of zero tidal output and in general in accordance with grid requirements. If this route were to be taken, the economics of a full Severn barrage, with its maximum output some 25 times that of the Swansea Bay scheme, might well be worth reconsideration.

Arup found that the technology has become so cheap that developers could deliver turbines for a guaranteed price of power so low that it would be effectively subsidy-free in terms of the impact on household energy bills. France’s EDF was awarded a contract for difference – a top-up payment – of £92.50 per megawatt hour over 35 years for Hinkley’s power, or around twice the wholesale price of electricity. By contrast, Arup’s report found that windfarms could be delivered for a maximum of £50-55 per MWh across 15 years. ScottishPower, which commissioned the analysis, hopes to persuade the government to reconsider its stance on onshore windfarms, which the Conservatives effectively blocked in 2015 by banning them from competing for subsidies and imposing new planning hurdles. Keith Anderson, the firm’s chief operating officer, told the Guardian that onshore wind could help the UK meet its climate targets, was proven in terms of being easy to deliver, and was now “phenomenally competitive” on price. “If you want to control the cost of energy, and deliver energy to consumers and to businesses across the UK at the most competitive price, why would you not want to use this technology? This report demonstrates it’s at the leading edge of efficiency,” he said. The big six energy firm believes that with a cap on top-up payments so close to the wholesale price, onshore windfarms would be effectively subsidy-free – but the guaranteed price would be enough to de-risk projects and win the investment case for them. “What we are asking for is a mechanism that underpins the investment risk,” said Anderson. The group believes that any political sting for Tory MPs concerned about public opposition to turbines in English shires would be removed because such a low guaranteed price would see only the windiest sites coming in cheap enough – which means windfarms in Scotland. “You put these projects in the right place, you will get the correct level of resource out of them to keep the costs down and you will get public acceptance of people liking them,” Anderson said, citing the example of the company’s huge Whitelee windfarm near Glasgow. Dr Robert Gross, director of the centre for energy policy and technology at Imperial College, said: “Onshore wind has been coming in at remarkably low prices internationally, so a contract for difference price of around £50-60 per MWh looks perfectly feasible for a good location in the UK, one of the windiest countries in Europe. “Windfarms generally need fixed price contracts in order to secure finance, otherwise volatile electricity prices can make investing in wind risky.” The Conservative manifesto was seen by some in industry as softening the party’s stance on onshore wind, saying that it did not believe “more large-scale onshore wind power is right for England” but not mentioning Wales and Scotland, which have some of the best potential sites. The party also promised a review of the cost of energy which the Guardian revealed last week was likely to be led by the University of Oxford economist Dieter Helm, a critic of the cost of today’s renewable and nuclear power technologies. However, Anderson said he saw the report, due in October, as a good opportunity. “I would find it surprising if anybody else doing a costs review of the energy sector comes to a fundamentally different argument [to the Arup report],” he said. Leo Murray, of climate change charity 10:10, said: “It looks increasingly absurd that the Conservatives have effectively banned Britain’s cheapest source of new power.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/29/the-guardian-view-on-killer-robots-on-the-loose","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-29T18:40:43Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on killer robots: on the loose | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/the-guardian-view-on-killer-robots-on-the-loose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/the-guardian-view-on-killer-robots-on-the-loose","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on killer robots: on the loose","bodyText":"The first meeting of the UN-backed group of experts, intended to start work on getting a ban on lethal autonomous weapons, was supposed to wrap up at the end of last week. But only days before it was due to start it was cancelled: funding shortfalls were blamed. A lack of will feels the more likely explanation. Alarmed by the delay the day it was due to begin, more than 100 of those most closely involved in developing the artificial intelligence on which such weapons would rely, led by Tesla’s Elon Musk and Alphabet’s Mustafa Suleyman, wrote a public letter of bleak warning: killer robots amount to a third revolution in warfare, the sequel to gunpowder and nuclear weapons. They are right. The only thing more frightening than a machine that can’t decide for itself who to kill is one that can. But the technology is out there, within reach of scientists backed by billions of dollars poured into the development of AI by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, and certainly matched in other less transparent regimes. Some semi-autonomous weaponry is already available, like the border guarding system on the ceasefire line between North and South Korea. The process of what its critics, such as the campaigning group Article 36, call “bureaucratising” weapons, where targets are defined according to an explicit hierarchy, is under way. Scientific discovery and technological advance are never unmade; the history of asking states and their generals to abandon military advantage and behave morally, while not futile – there have been international laws of war for more than a century and in parts of the world for very much longer – has only limited success when applied to specific weapons, in certain times. For example, for the first half of the 20th century, the US banned unrestricted submarine warfare. It lasted less than 24 hours after Pearl Harbour. Yet the morality of merely distancing human involvement from conflict has been anxiously debated at least since the invention of cannon; after the Austrians sent up balloons laden with bombs with timed fuses against forces defending Venice in 1849 (the wind changed, to Austrian disadvantage) balloon bombing was outlawed at the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899. It was one of the earliest such bans, but like the later prohibition on the use of chemical weapons – a rare success for the League of Nations in the Geneva Protocol of 1925 – the ban was the easier to negotiate for never having battle-winning potential. In contrast, attempts at a universal prohibition on bombing from planes, which had been used against military targets since the early years of the 20th century, never made progress despite lip service being paid to the idea in the 1930s by both Stanley Baldwin and Hitler. And even when bans were in place, as there was against chemical weapons, the US used napalm in Korea and Vietnam before ratifying the beefed up UN biological weapons convention that outlaws production, stockpiling and use in 1975. In the early years of debate on the development of autonomous weapons, the Pentagon argued that technology must be servant not master of the soldier. Not any more. Yet the weight of public opinion – even when it is not a majority view – can stiffen governments against the demands of military expediency and strategic choice. CND protests from the Aldermaston marches of the 1950s to the Greenham Common peace camp in the 1980s played their part in building a climate that made arms control a diplomatic objective. But for all the progress in controlling nuclear weapons that has been made since the first test ban treaty was signed in 1963, no nuclear power has ever given up their capacity to launch a nuclear attack. But the fact of removing human intervention from the decision to kill raises the most profound questions – both of international law and ethics and, as the next issue of the International Institute of Strategic Studies journal Survival argues, wider issues of global peace and strategic stability. Campaigners believe that through the UN they can build a coalition, a platform for a sustained campaign to control autonomous weapons. They are heartened by the backing of scientists who know most intimately how AI could be developed, and maybe learn to develop itself. By exploiting the power of stigma, they have won campaigns against anti-personnel mines and cluster bombs. The global order is more fragile than at any time since 1945; a hard place to build consensus. But theirs is an argument that must be made."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/jun/30/fukushima-nuclear-crisis-tepco-criminal-trial-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-30T10:35:33Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear disaster: former Tepco executives go on trial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/30/fukushima-nuclear-crisis-tepco-criminal-trial-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jun/30/fukushima-nuclear-crisis-tepco-criminal-trial-japan","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear disaster: former Tepco executives go on trial","bodyText":"Three former executives with the operator of the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have pleaded not guilty to charges of professional negligence, in the only criminal action targeting officials since the triple meltdown more than six years ago. In the first hearing of the trial at Tokyo district court on Friday, Tsunehisa Katsumata, who was chairman of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) at the time of the disaster, and two other former executives argued they could not have foreseen a tsunami of the size that knocked out the plant’s backup cooling system, triggering a meltdown in three reactors. “I apologise for the tremendous trouble to the residents in the area and around the country because of the serious accident that caused the release of radioactive materials,” Katsumata said, bowing slightly. Prosecutors alleged that the 77-year-old, along with his co-defendants, Sakae Muto, 67, and Ichiro Takekuro, 71 – both former Tepco vice-presidents – had been shown data that anticipated a tsunami of more than 10 metres in height that could cause a power outage and other serious consequences. A report by a government panel said Tepco simulated the impact of a tsunami on the plant in 2008 and concluded that a wave of up to 15.7 metres (52 feet) could hit the plant if a magnitude-8.3 quake occurred off the coast of Fukushima. Executives at the company allegedly ignored the internal study. The three men – charged with professional negligence resulting in death and injury – have since retired from Tepco. The company, which faces a multibillion-dollar bill for decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi, is not a defendant in the trial. If convicted, the men face up to five years in prison or a penalty of up to 1m yen (£7,000). Although there are no records of anyone dying as a result of exposure to radiation from the plant, prosecutors alleged the executives were responsible for the deaths of 40 elderly people who were evacuated from a hospital near the plant. The Fukushima plant had a meltdown after the tsunami, triggered by a magnitude-9 earthquake, hit the plant on the afternoon of 11 March 2011. The tsunami killed almost 19,000 people along the north-east coast of Japan and forced more than 150,000 others living near the plant to flee radiation. Some of the evacuated neighbourhoods are still deemed too dangerous for former residents to return to. “They continued running the reactors without taking any measures whatsoever,” the prosecutor said. “If they had fulfilled their safety responsibilities, the accident would never have occurred.” Muto challenged the allegation by the prosecution that he and the other defendants failed to take sufficient preventative measures despite being aware of the risk of a powerful tsunami more than two years before the disaster. “When I recall that time, I still think it was impossible to anticipate an accident like that,” he said. “I believe I have no criminal responsibility over the accident.” Investigations into the accident have been highly critical of the lax safety culture at Tepco and poor oversight by industry regulators. Prosecutors considered the case twice, and dropped it both times, but a citizens’ judicial panel overrode their decision and indicted the former executives. Outside the court, Ruiko Muto, a Fukushima resident and head of the group of plaintiffs, said: “Since the accident, nobody has been held responsible nor has it been made clear why it happened. Many people have suffered badly in ways that changed their lives. We want these men to realise how many people are feeling sadness and anger.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/may/24/edf-no-deadline-set-for-final-decision-on-hinkley-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-24T13:26:20Z","webTitle":"No deadline set for final decision on Hinkley nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/edf-no-deadline-set-for-final-decision-on-hinkley-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/may/24/edf-no-deadline-set-for-final-decision-on-hinkley-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"No deadline set for final decision on Hinkley nuclear plant","bodyText":"The UK has set no deadline for the final go-ahead to the much-delayed Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, energy minister Andrea Leadsom told a committee of MPs on Tuesday. The head of the company aiming to build the new reactors, French state-owned EDF, told the same hearing he could not give a date for the decision nor confirm that it would start generating electricity in 2025, as previously pledged. If built, the £18bn plant would generate 7% of the UK’s electricity and is a central plank of the government’s energy policy. EDF originally promised UK customers they would be cooking their Christmas turkeys with power from Hinkley by 2017. But the schedule has repeatedly slipped, amid concerns over the cost and difficulty of the project, which has led to questions about how the UK would keep the lights on without Hinkley. MPs on the energy and climate change committee asked Leadsom if the government had set a time limit for the protracted process of getting EDF to make a final investment decision or whether the company had a “blank cheque” in terms of timing. “We want to see it as soon as possible, but we recognise it is a commercial decision,” she said. Leadsom said: “If it does not go ahead, we will not leave the UK consumer vulnerable to the lights going out. We will never leave ourselves as a country exposed to one particular project – but that doesn’t mean we don’t need it, it doesn’t mean we don’t want it, it doesn’t mean we are not committed to it.” The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, said in April that a failure to build Hinkley would not mean the lights going out but said it would risk increasing costs to billpayers and missing carbon targets. However, Leadsom told the committee: “We are absolutely keeping the lights on, we are absolutely focused on keeping the bills down and of course we will meet our legally binding climate change targets.” Leadsom, who is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, said earlier in May: “Being a member of the EU could scupper the [Hinkley] deal because of the state aid challenge from Austria.” However, she told the MPs on Tuesday she did not think Britain’s membership of the EU had any bearing on the Hinkley C project, saying the Austrian challenge had no merit and she had been incompletely quoted. The workers’ unions at EDF want the Hinkley project postponed by two to three years, fearing its high cost will damage the heavily indebted company, whose credit rating was recently cut by Moody’s. New nuclear plants being built by EDF in France and Finland are years behind schedule and billions over budget. But Vincent de Rivaz, EDF Energy chief executive, told MPs: “The money is there.” He explained why the final investment decision, most recently expected in May, had been pushed back again. He said a new package of measures from the French government to ensure the financial future of the company had been put in place and was now being consulted on with trade unions. Once this was completed, the board would decide on Hinkley, he said, although he stressed the opinion of the trade unions would be “advisory”. De Rivaz said he had already had a five-hour meeting with the unions which was a “very tense and very rich discussion”. De Rivaz would not give a date for the final decision, saying he did not want to pre-judge the consultation. Nor would he confirm that Hinkley would be generating electricity from 2025. “We understand the need for this to be the date,” he said. “At the time of the final investment decision, we will confirm the precise date of operation.” The Hinkley deal has been criticised for “colossal” costs by the French energy minister, and its finance director resigned over the issue, but President François Hollande has fully backed the project. France’s economy and industry minister, Emmanuel Macron, wrote to the committee of MPs on Monday and said: “The French authorities remain fully behind the [Hinkley] project. I can appreciate that a certain amount of impatience may be creeping in as the project is key for the UK’s energy and climate policy. It is also necessary, in the interest of all, that EDF follows due process before committing itself to an investment of this magnitude.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/may/25/china-nuclear-power-plants-expansion-he-zuoxiu","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T13:41:57Z","webTitle":"China warned over 'insane' plans for new nuclear power plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/china-nuclear-power-plants-expansion-he-zuoxiu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/may/25/china-nuclear-power-plants-expansion-he-zuoxiu","fields":{"headline":"China warned over 'insane' plans for new nuclear power plants","bodyText":"China’s plans for a rapid expansion of nuclear power plants are “insane” because the country is not investing enough in safety controls, a leading Chinese scientist has warned. Proposals to build plants inland, as China ends a moratorium on new generators imposed after the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, are particularly risky, the physicist He Zuoxiu said, because if there was an accident it could contaminate rivers that hundreds of millions of people rely on for water and taint groundwater supplies to vast swathes of important farmlands. China halted the approval of new reactors in 2011 in order to review its safety standards, but gave the go-ahead in March for two units, part of an attempt to surpass Japan’s nuclear-generating capacity by 2020 and become the world’s biggest user of nuclear power a decade later. Barack Obama recently announced plans to renew a nuclear cooperation deal with Beijing that would allow it to buy more US-designed reactors, and potentially pursue the technology to reprocess plutonium from spent fuel. The government is keen to expand nuclear generation as part of a wider effort to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and cut dependence on imported oil and gas. He, who worked on China’s nuclear weapons programme, said the planned rollout was going too fast to ensure it had the safety and monitoring expertise needed to avert an accident. “There are currently two voices on nuclear energy in China. One prioritises safety while the other prioritises development,” He told the Guardian in an interview at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He spoke of risks including “corruption, poor management abilities and decision-making capabilities”. He said: “They want to build 58 (gigawatts of nuclear generating capacity) by 2020 and eventually 120 to 200. This is insane.” He’s challenge to the nuclear plans is particularly powerful because of his scientific credentials and a long history of taking a pro-government stance on controversial issues, from the 1950s destruction of Beijing’s city walls to the crackdown in the 1990s on the religious group Falun Gong. He would like to see China stop its expansion once the plants that have been approved or are now under construction are finished, and then gain a few decades experience of running them safely before expanding again. Almost all the country’s working reactors started up after 2000. “China currently does not have enough experience to make sound judgments on whether there could be accidents,” he said. “The number of reactors and the amount of time they have been operating safely both matter. “The safety reviews after Fukushima found some problems, but only minor ones, and the final conclusion is that China’s nuclear power is safe. But the safety checks were carried out under the old standards and the standards themselves clearly need big improvements.” Chinese government officials argue that nuclear technology has improved since the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents, He said, but that ignores the role human error and flawed safety regimes played in both cases. The operator of Japan’s Fukushima plant has admitted that the company failed to take stronger disaster prevention measures ahead of the earthquake and tsunami, for fear of lawsuits and protests. “Japan has better technology and better management, and yet it couldn’t avoid an accident despite the fact that it tried very hard to learn from the US and USSR,” He said, adding that China’s nuclear monitor has sparser staffing than Japan’s, and offers low salaries that will not attract the best young scientists. China had considered and then rejected stronger standards, He said, because of the huge pressure for a rapid expansion and companies powerful enough to put corporate profits ahead of national security. “There were internal discussions on upgrading standards in the past four years, but doing so would require a lot more investment which would affect the competitiveness and profitability of nuclear power,” He said. “Nuclear energy costs are cheap because we lower our standards.” Rather than encouraging debate to expose weaknesses, the government tries to stamp it out, and in a country where challenging officials is risky, there is no mechanism to encourage or protect whistleblowers. He said: “At the moment, the ministry of environmental protection is considering a new watchdog. When they invited me over for a discussion, I told them: ‘Your safety watchdog is not independent. It listens to the national nuclear corporation and hence the scrutiny is fake’.” One of He’s biggest concerns is the proposal to meet the aggressive expansion plans by building nuclear plants inland. Three provinces have already chosen locations for plants and started preliminary work, and several more have been proposed. China is short of water, and areas with enough water to cool a plant in daily operations or an emergency are densely populated. He said: “They say they could build the plants in deserts, but the problem is there isn’t any water in the deserts.” If plants are built near cities and farmland, any accident would put millions of people at risk from immediate fallout and long-term contamination similar to the radioactive leaks at Fukushima. “If they build plants in places with a lot of water, the consequences of a nuclear leakage would be extremely grave,” He said. “I wouldn’t oppose it if they can guarantee it is 100% safe, but no one can guarantee this. “To be honest, as I’m already 88, it won’t affect me much whether or not nuclear plants are safe. But I am concerned about the welfare of our children and think we shouldn’t just evaluate the profitability of new projects.” Luna Lin contributed research"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/aug/09/north-korea-v-the-us-how-likely-is-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-09T08:18:00Z","webTitle":"North Korea v the US: how likely is war?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/09/north-korea-v-the-us-how-likely-is-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/aug/09/north-korea-v-the-us-how-likely-is-war","fields":{"headline":"North Korea v the US: how likely is war?","bodyText":"The war of words between the US and North Korea has escalated, with Donald Trump warning any threats would be met with “fire and fury” and Pyongyang promptly announcing it was “carefully examining” a plan to attack an American military base in the western Pacific. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have been running high since North Korea’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month and two nuclear bomb tests last year, which has lead to increased sanctions on the already isolated nation. But despite two unpredictable nuclear-armed leaders trading barbs, most observers believe the possibility of conflict remains remote, with the North Korean leadership using its nuclear program as a bargaining chip rather than an offensive weapon. Jean Lee, Wilson Center fellow, former AP Pyongyang bureau chief No one in the region, not even North Korea, wants another war. But Kim Jong-un is going to push it as far as he can to get what he wants: recognition from the United States that North Korea is a nuclear power, and legitimacy at home as a ruler who can defend his people against the big, bad US. In some ways, Trump’s threats play into the North Korean calculus: Kim Jong-un wants his people to believe that the United States continues to threaten the very existence of North Korea. That fearmongering brings the North Korean people together, and justifies the regime’s diversion of precious resources into building nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles. What I’m concerned about is a miscalculation or mishap that could force troops in the region to take military action. Remember, we had a military confrontation between South Korea and North Korea at a frontline Korean island in 2010 that killed several South Korean civilians. And with test launches of ballistic missiles straying into Japanese territorial waters, Japan may feel forced to act. Andrei Lankov, professor at Kookmin University, Seoul, and director of NK News We will be treated with fine examples of bellicose rhetoric by North Korean media. I’m just waiting for some colourful abusive description of President Trump, soon to be produced by the North Korean propagandists, and perhaps Trump will dispatch an aircraft carrier or two to cruise around the Korean peninsula. Once North Korea finishes development and deployment of a nuclear force capable of hitting the continental US, they might be ready to talk about a nuclear and missile freeze. The US should accept this option. There is a very little probability of conflict. But North Koreans are not interested in diplomacy: they want to get the ability to wipe out Chicago from the map first, and then they will be interested in diplomatic solutions. They will get such capability within a couple of years. The US president is employing both rhetoric and tactics which for decades have been used only by the North Korean side of the conflict. On the North Korean side, it is business as usual, of course: they repeat their promise to transform Seoul into the “sea of fire” every few years. Jiyoung Song, senior lecturer in Korean studies, University of Melbourne They will exchange some harsh words for a while and until Washington talks, secretly or publicly, with Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un will keep test-firing. There is no military solution to the North Korean problem. North Korea wants to be recognised as a legitimate nuclear state by the US and establish diplomatic relations with the US. Constantly reminding the world and especially the US of their nuclear and missile capabilities is part of their regime survival calculations. All options are on the table for Pyongyang, and North Korea did propose peace talks with the US a number of times to end the 1953 armistice and replace it with a peace treaty. What North Korea is also trying to do is to break the South Korea-US alliance and undermine the new South Korean president Moon Jae-in’s initiatives for improved inter-Korean relations. He’s proposed numerous talks with North Korea and Pyongyang has deliberately ignored Seoul’s good gestures. Kim Jong-un wants to talk directly with Trump, undermining Moon, but the US is reluctant to talk with North Korea unless Kim denuclearises or at least freezes its nuclear programmes. It’s wishful thinking that Kim will give up his nuclear power. Neither [Russian president Vladimir] Putin nor Xi [Jinping, the Chinese president] would want another war in the Korean peninsula, and Kim Jong-un has no friends in international relations. He developed a very dangerous weapon that’s threatening everyone, especially those in South Korea. If Trump doesn’t want Kim to further develop his nuclear ambition, he has to sit down and talk with Kim. Robert Kelly, associate professor, Pusan National University There are two ways to think about what Trump said. The optimistic way – if you’re a Trump supporter – is that he’s trying to be unpredictable. What this is really intended to do is pressure the Chinese, to signal to them that strategic patience is over. The less optimistic, and probably more accurate, reading is that this is Trump shooting his mouth off. There’s rhetoric on both sides – it’s like two bullies in the playground yelling at each other. The North Koreans are not going to offensively strike an American base or the American homeland unilaterally without any provocation – to do that would bring crushing American retaliation. The North Koreans aren’t stupid. Their nuclear weapons are intended for defence, not offence. The North Koreans are worried about what happened to Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein, they’re worried about the Americans leveraging change and they know that nuclear weapons are guaranteed to prevent that from happening. That’s what this is really all about. The Guam thing is another empty threat. But the North Koreans are not going to back down. They’ll continue with the missile testing and make sure that the warhead has been miniaturised. They also need to make sure that the vehicles don’t break up when they re-enter the atmosphere. In the meantime, they’ll respond to American bluster with their own bluster. We’re not used to unpredictability and anxiety coming from the American side of this relationship. That’s why people are so unnerved – we’re not used to Potus talking like this. John Delury, North Korea expert, Yonsei University, Seoul For all the bluster, there is no rational case for war and sanctions have proved their inefficacy. So, if we want any progress, we are left with diplomacy. The US message to Pyongyang should be: “We want you to prosper and maybe after you have prospered you’ll be able to let go of the nukes because you are feeling more confident and you are integrating into the region and you want to be like the rest of east Asia.” But some people don’t want progress. For example, if you are focused on non-proliferation, then there is a good argument that you just want to beat up North Korea every day and isolate them and keep them down so that every other country that is considering going nuclear says to themselves: “Well, I sure don’t want to be North Korea.” There is a rationale for that. The North Koreans love the verbal hostilities. They will do this ad nauseam. They are happy to do daily threat battles with the White House. That is actually quite wonderful for them. They like the attention and it all underlines their point that they are under siege by the Americans. But an outbreak of military conflict is not impossible. It is hard to get the balance. I do think there are real things to be concerned about. I think South Koreans are insufficiently concerned and not watching the situation enough. I think the South Korean government is being too quiet about this. Professor Andrew O’Neil, ballistic missile testing expert, Griffith University Much will depend on North Korea’s actions with respect to missile testing. If NK tests a nuclear device (they tested two in 2016) after two watershed ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] testing in July, this will be highly provocative and place intense pressure on the US and its allies, as well as China, to come up with additional measures to pressure Pyongyang. The problem here is that: a) security council sanctions haven’t worked in restraining North Korea; and b) there is no appetite for carrying out military strikes against North Korean WMD installations for fear of triggering a wide conflict in north-east Asia. President Trump’s “fire and fury” comments, however, could be a game-changer in the sense that he may feel compelled to use military force to uphold US credibility internationally. If he doesn’t act in the face of a major North Korean provocation, his own credibility will take a big hit, which may in itself move him closer to military action. The cycle historically has been that both sides have become more risk-averse as conflict becomes more likely. The possibility this time around is that Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump may have too much confidence in their capacity to manage a crisis and de-escalate before a spiral gains traction.It’s important to appreciate that Kim Jong-un’s domestic circumstances also play a role. Turnover at senior levels of the regime is frequent and brutal, and Kim’s position is not necessarily secure. He would be anxious about the potential for a Chinese-sponsored coup and his own power base. Standing up to the enemy that is the foundation for NK’s historical and contemporary threat narratives (ie the US) plays well with Kim’s domestic base and probably helps to reinforce his control over the regime, the military and the party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/may/28/construction-of-worlds-largest-dam-in-dr-congo-could-begin-within-months","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-28T08:00:29Z","webTitle":"Construction of world's largest dam in DR Congo could begin within months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/28/construction-of-worlds-largest-dam-in-dr-congo-could-begin-within-months","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/may/28/construction-of-worlds-largest-dam-in-dr-congo-could-begin-within-months","fields":{"headline":"Construction of world's largest dam in DR Congo could begin within months","bodyText":"The largest dam in the world is set to begin construction within months and could be generating electricity in under five years. But 35,000 people may have to be relocated and it could be built without any environmental or social impact surveys, say critics. The $14bn (£9.5bn) Inga 3 project, the first part of the mega-project, is being fast-tracked by the Democratic Republic of Congo government will span one channel of the vast river Congo at Inga Falls. It involves a large dam and a 4,800MW hydro-electric plant. But subsequent phases, together costing about $100bn, could eventually span the Congo river, the world’s second largest by volume. It is expected to have an electricity-generating capacity of nearly 40,000MW – nearly twice as much as the Three Gorges dam in China or 20 large nuclear power stations. But the long delayed project, whose backers claim it could provide about 40% of Africa’s electricity, may violate national law and international guidelines for the development of mega-dams, according to the California-based NGO International Rivers. Peter Bosshard, the NGO’s interim director, says those running the project are not concerned that 35,000 people may have to move in phase 1 and 25,000 people later, or that fish supplies from the river are likely to be greatly affected. In a filmed interview with International Rivers, the head of the Grand Inga Project Office, Bruno Kapandji, suggests that environmental and social impact surveys will not be completed before work starts, possibly in November. “It is a choice to make, people have no electricity. We set an objective – we have to produce energy,” Kapandji said. “There are a lot of studies to carry out, at least 18, and we favour some over others based on priority, and to allow us to ... develop a tender document that will be technically and financially acceptable.” Kapandji says that Inga 3 is the “only solution” to Congo DRC’s energy problem and would allow it to export electricity: “As Congolese we have no choice but to build Inga 3. And for the cities in Kinshasa, Bas-Congo and Katanga, Inga 3 is the only solution ... Today the price of commodities is falling and we need revenue. If we have a lot of energy to export, like Canada and Uruguay, we won’t have a problem”. Bosshard said: “Bruno Kapandji makes it clear that the government has no intention to carry out a social and environmental impact assessment for the huge project before construction starts. Developing Inga 3 without an EIA will violate national law, World Bank safeguard policies, and Chinese guidelines for overseas contractors.” “There has been a complete disregard for affected people and the environment. It is shocking that the world’s biggest hydropower scheme could go forward without an assessment of its social and environmental impacts and a resettlement action plan in place,” said Bosshard. The Congolese government is fast-tracking the construction to fulfil a legally binding contract signed with the South African government to supply 2,500MW of electricity from the Inga 3 by 2021. It is expected to choose a consortium of two of China’s largest dam builders by August, and hopes to start building by November. According to Kapandji, the Chinese consortium has said electricity could be generated within four to five years. A Spanish consortium has suggested Inga 3 would take six years to build. Big dams built in developing countries have forced many millions of people to relocate and caused immense environmental damage. But pressure from environment and development groups has forced countries and funders to commission impact surveys to assess and mitigate damage. In 2013 and 2014, the African Development Bank and the World Bank approved $141m in grants for the preparation of the $14bn project. An absence of environmental and social assessments could affect the financing of the project. The Chinese government has instructed its dam builders not to build any overseas projects without EIAs and both the China Three Gorges Corporation and Sinohydro, the members of the Chinese consortiums, have committed not to build any major dam projects without such assessments. “Building the Inga 3 Dam without thorough environmental due diligence would seriously undermine the efforts of Chinese companies to strengthen their environmental track record,” said Bosshard. At a meeting with civil society groups in April, Kapandji argued that early feasibility studies had found that the project would not have any negative impacts. • This article was amended on 30 May 2016 because the NGO International Rivers is based in California, not Washington as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/apr/21/beth-ditto-fire-track-of-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-21T13:00:16Z","webTitle":"Beth Ditto’s Fire: a sexy mega-thumper of a torch song","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/21/beth-ditto-fire-track-of-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/apr/21/beth-ditto-fire-track-of-week","fields":{"headline":"Beth Ditto’s Fire: a sexy mega-thumper of a torch song","bodyText":"TRACK OF THE WEEK Beth Ditto Fire Singe when you’re winning: the Gossip goddess declares her solo intentions with a very different kind of torch song: a sexy mega-thumper enhanced by mournful melodica toots.

But yesterday, the scientist Ben Goldacre alerted me to the practice of “screwdriving” – short-distance sex-toy hacking. It might sound far-fetched, but the bluetooth low energy (BLE) networking protocol that “smart” sex toys often use can be compromised relatively easily, as demonstrated by security consultant Alex Lomas, who wandered the streets of Berlin taking control of Lovense Hush buttplugs. I am a natural tech evangelist, but I fear I am fast becoming the voice of internet doom in my increasingly desperate attempts to make the government wake up to its threats as well as its opportunities. So I wonder if it is finally this, walk-by dildo hacking, that will make people sit up and take notice? Sex certainly gets people’s attention, and this is one area where the internet has form. In its early days, engineers joked that 3G stood for girls, gambling and gaming – as that was the only way business would make money out of the web (yes, tech jokes are rarely funny). Porn is still a huge driver of revenue across the web, and protecting children from porn has finally brought government and industry together to develop some basic regulation. So I have high hopes that sexual security might play a role in raising people’s awareness of the security risk of internet-connected devices. The internet was about connecting people. The “internet of things” is about connecting things. Everything – your fridge, your car, your home, your cuddly toy, your bus, your nuclear power station – and, yes, your sex toy. And it is happening now. Already, televisions and cars are sold as “internet-enabled”. Turning on the heating at home when you leave the office is increasingly common. And isn’t it cute to be able to buy a smart teddy bear that records your child’s first words and shares them with your family? I am an internet-of-things believer. I’ve studied it, lived it, effectively built bits of it, and I was the first MP to speak about it in the House of Commons in 2011. I believe that it has the potential to transform our lives more than anything since electricity. It can deliver huge economic, environmental and social benefits; from energy management to tracking endangered species. Every time I wait at a bus stop I look forward to the smart public transport system that could be enabled by the internet of things, with buses that stop when and where you want them to, but don’t stop if you’re not there, saving fuel, time and my patience. But we have to recognise that as more and more everyday objects become connected to the internet, the risk of a cyber-attack grows. Last year cyber criminals brought down Twitter, Spotify and Reddit by hacking domestic internet-of-things devices, including televisions and baby monitors. People’s homes weren’t actually the target – the hackers just used the devices to bombard websites with messages. But they could be next time. Sex toys are but one manifestation of what is an increasingly pervasive threat. Lomas was also able to hack his father’s BLE-enabled hearing aid to selectively alter his hearing and put voices in his father’s head. In February, a teenager hacked 150,000 printers to raise awareness of the dangers of leaving printers exposed online without a firewall. The US Food and Drug Administration recently recalled almost half a million pacemakers due to fears they were vulnerable to hacking in a way that could see their battery run down, or even deployed to alter their users’ heartbeat. Government regulation will probably ensure that the security of medical devices has improved. But when it comes to smart toasters, the incentives simply don’t exist. Security for internet-of-things devices doesn’t just need to be built in at the start, which takes time and money, it needs to be upgradable over time, as threats evolve and criminals fight back. With global supply chains competing mainly on cost, this is one problem the market cannot and will not solve on its own. Much more needs to be done. The government’s cyber-security strategy – such as it is – is targeted at security services, critical national infrastructure and big business. They are not looking at toasters, much less dildos. And yet at the same time, it is encouraging us to take up smart meters – opening up our homes to attack. I’ve repeatedly asked the government to ensure that households will not be left vulnerable to attacks, but I’ve only received poor and confused answers. It appears they have no sense of how to ready the country for the next wave of technological change that is breaking over us. We need ministers to set out how they intend to protect ordinary people’s cameras, gaming consoles and baby monitors from attacks in the future. Walk-by dildo hacking is the sexy end of the growing security risk posed by the internet of things. I only hope the government sees it coming. • Chi Onwurah is the Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2016/mar/28/indian-point-nuclear-plant-new-york-troubled-history","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-28T08:00:21Z","webTitle":"Indian Point nuclear plant reeks of troubled history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/indian-point-nuclear-plant-new-york-troubled-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/indian-point-nuclear-plant-new-york-troubled-history","fields":{"headline":"Indian Point nuclear plant reeks of troubled history","bodyText":"Outside the Westchester Diner in Peekskill, New York, about 40 miles from New York’s Central Park, a reactor dome crests the trees behind an overpass like a giant’s bald head. It’s one of two at Indian Point Energy Center, at the bank of the Hudson river in neighboring Buchanan, among the oldest nuclear power plants still in operation, and a monument to the energy industry’s resistance to years of work by concerned scientists, locals and state officials to close down a facility that only last month dumped a plume of radioactive waste into their groundwater. Indian Point’s two working reactors opened in the early 1970s and have had a lot of people worried for a long time. Five years ago the New York Times wondered if it was “America’s Fukushima” – the Japanese site of the world’s worst radiation crisis since Chernobyl. In February the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, called its operation “unacceptable” – he wants the plant closed. It’s easy to see the source of his concern. The population density around Indian Point is of more than 2,100 people per square mile, by far the greatest for any of the US’s 61 nuclear power plants. Many of those people live and work in the plant’s shadow with growing unease. In May 2015, an electrical transformer in the reactor called Unit 3 exploded, causing water to flood a room near the explosion where electrical distribution panels are housed and pouring 3,000 gallons of oil into the Hudson. The Union of Concerned Scientists classified the incident as a “near miss” in its annual review. Last year near misses occurred at eight nuclear facilities in the US. “Had the flooding not been discovered and stopped in time, the panels could have been submerged, plunging Unit 3 into a dangerous station blackout, in which all alternating current (AC) electricity is lost,” the report’s authors wrote. “A station blackout led to the meltdown of three nuclear reactor cores at Fukushima Dai-ichi in 2011.” In February, radiation levels at three monitoring wells around the plant spiked, in one spot by 65,000%. Patricia Kakridas, a spokeswoman for Entergy, said the source was likely “water which exited a temporary filtration system that was set up and dismantled in late January 2016” in preparation for refueling; the company said radioactive material won’t leach into drinking water. And in March, when the plant was being refueled, a breaker tripped and cut power in one of the reactors; when the diesel generators kicked in, they died while trying to restart the first electrical system. Fortunately a second backup worked. Because the plant is cooled in large part by water from the Hudson – up to 2.5bn gallons a day – it kills about 1 billion fish and other aquatic organisms a year. Incidents such as these are among the reasons Cuomo wants it closed, and Indian Point is now in a vulnerable position. The operating license for Indian Point 3 expired in December. The license for Indian Point 2 expired in 2013 (Indian Point 1 was decommissioned in 1974). Yet both remain active as the company pursues a license renewal and in the meantime Spectra, a pipeline company, is planning to add a gas pipeline that runs underneath the property to the two that have been there since the plant was built. Not everyone wants the plant to close; it’s one of Buchanan’s few employers. About 1,000 people work at the plant, without counting the related businesses nearby. The town’s population is 2,060 as of the 2013 census. Dennis Drogan, who worked at the plant from 2002 to 2003 and now owns the Bella Roma deli in the nearby village of Tarrytown, said Buchanan relies heavily on the plant and locals are stunned some of their neighbors want to shut down the place that supports their livelihood. He also said it’s safer than people say. “Getting into the property is very, very difficult,” he said. Drogan was an electrician at the facility in the time when post-9/11 counter-terrorism restrictions were being put into effect in the plant due to its proximity to New York City. “If you want to tighten a screw, you have to say why,” he said. Courtney Williams, a cancer researcher who lives in the area with her husband and little girl, puts it this way: “If you are looking at it really just with fresh eyes, you’re just like, ‘This is fucking insane, there’s a pipeline going through it and gas pipelines underneath it and it’s 40 years old and it’s right outside of New York and it’s leaking tritium [the radioactive hydrogen from February’s leak], this is insane! What are you doing!’ But if you’ve been working at the plant for 40 years, and you work there and your mom worked there, you’re just like, ‘Everyone’s comfortable with it here. Their families live nearby. They wouldn’t be doing anything that’s dangerous.’” In fact, Williams’s mother used to work at the plant as a nurse. But Williams says that having handled radioactive material in her scientific training – Yale and then a PhD in biochemistry Princeton – that feeling of safety is illusory. “It’s your sense of what is dangerous. There are snake-charmers and lion-tamers whose blood pressure doesn’t go up … Doesn’t mean it’s safe! It just means they’re acclimated to that level of risk.” Westchester, wooded, close-knit and old, is one of the original 12 counties of the province of New York, the British colony that became the Empire State. Its primary means of travel are the twisting, interlocking highways and the Metro North railway system that ends at Grand Central terminal in Manhattan. Evacuation plans for the numerous villages and towns in the 50-mile “peak injury” evacuation zone, to say nothing of most of the five boroughs, have been derided as “fantasy documents” by Northeastern University public police professor Daniel P Aldrich. Cuomo has waged an ongoing campaign against the plant’s continued operation, citing “unacceptable” failures, especially the leak of radioactive water in February, but to no avail. Reactors 2 and 3 remain open in part because of a regulatory quirk: There are so many complaints, called “contentions”, filed with its primary regulator, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), that Entergy is allowed to keep Indian Point running until it can respond to all the grievances as part of its relicensing process. Less than three weeks after the water leak, the NRC decided to honor Entergy’s request, made several years prior, that it be allowed to perform a comprehensive leak test every 15 years, rather than every 10. How long that will take is anyone’s guess. Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the NRC, said he could not say when (and if) a decision on the plant’s renewal would come. “I can’t give you a specific date,” he said. “Nobody would have anticipated it taking this long.” The NRC has never declined to renew an operating license. Sheehan said complaints about Indian Point were frequent, but they were also largely about undramatic issues. “Indian Point has had a number of issues, but they haven’t risen to the level of high safety significance,” Sheehan said. “I mean, fossil fuel plants have transformer fires.” Paul Gallay of Riverkeeper, an activist organization close to Buchanan in Ossining that is seeking to shut down the plant, blames much of the trouble on simply age. “Indian Point is just too old, there’s too much that cannot be replaced, there are too many components that have seen too much use.” But it continues to be used. Edwin Lyman, senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists’ global security program in Washington DC, blames the license-renewal process itself. “The process was designed to limit the scope that could be considered, specifically the ability of the public to intervene,” Lyman said. The process was changed in 1995, Lyman explained, so that all a nuclear plant must do to address a “contention”, or objection to a way the plant has been run, is demonstrate a plan to correct a specific problem. And some of the problems are longstanding and increasingly worrisome, notably the spent fuel pools – storage for the waste material, still radioactive, from the rods used to power the plant. “We have great concerns about onsite storage of spent fuel in the pools,” Lyman said. “There’s a real risk that if that water is let out fairly rapidly either through a seismic event or a terrorist attack, that the spent fuel could actually catch fire.” The fuel remains onsite at Indian Point, as it does at most nuclear power plants, and must be carefully maintained, for example it must be cooled for at least a decade before it can be sealed in concrete “dry casks”. Sheehan (and others) point out that moving it out of the state along Interstate 95 is impractical given the population density along the busy transport corridor. The plant has produced about 1,500 tons of waste and continues to produce more. At this point, the license renewal process for Indian Point is scheduled through at least September of 2016 but the legacy of Indian Point, whether it closes or no, has a half-life of far, far longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jan/13/trump-risks-war-with-beijing-us-blocks-access-south-china-sea-state-media","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-13T03:59:22Z","webTitle":"Trump risks 'war' with Beijing if US blocks access to South China Sea, state media warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/13/trump-risks-war-with-beijing-us-blocks-access-south-china-sea-state-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jan/13/trump-risks-war-with-beijing-us-blocks-access-south-china-sea-state-media","fields":{"headline":"Trump risks 'war' with Beijing if US blocks access to South China Sea, state media warns","bodyText":"The US risks a “large-scale war” with China if it attempts to blockade islands in the South China Sea, Chinese state media has said, adding that if recent statements become policy when Donald Trump takes over as president “the two sides had better prepare for a military clash”. China has controversially built fortifications and artificial islands across the South China Sea. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, said China’s “access to those islands … is not going to be allowed”. China claims nearly the entire area, with rival claims by five south-east Asian neighbours and Taiwan. Tillerson did not specify how the US would block access but experts agreed it could only be done by a significant show of military force. Tillerson likened China’s island building to “Russia’s taking of Crimea”. “Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories,” said an editorial in the Global Times, a Communist-party controlled newspaper. “China has enough determination and strength to make sure that his rabble rousing will not succeed … Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish.” Under Barack Obama the US remained neutral on sovereignty claims, not recognising any ownership, but often challenged China’s control of the area by sailing warships past islands in what it called freedom of navigation exercises. If that policy became more confrontational, including denying China access to islands it already controls, “it would set a course for devastating confrontation between China and the US”, declared the state-run China Daily. China’s official response was more tame. Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China-US relations were based on “non-confrontation, non-conflict, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation”. Both newspapers also dismissed recent statements by Trump and his team – taking a similar stance to the Chinese government, which is waiting for Trump to be sworn in before equating his words with policy. Tillerson’s remarks “are not worth taking seriously because they are a mish-mash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices and unrealistic political fantasies”, the China Daily wrote. “Should he act on them in the real world it would be disastrous.” There are signs, though, that Trump shares Tillerson’s views and they will be carried into the White House. In December, Trump made similar comments in an interview with Fox News, accusing Beijing of “building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing”. Peter Navarro, Trump’s pick to head the newly created national trade council, has been extremely hostile to China and encouraged the president-elect to pursue a “peace through strength” policy in the region. “Beijing has created some 3,000 acres of artificial islands in the South China Sea with very limited American response,” Navarro has previously written."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/apr/03/hinkley-point-china-incorporates-seven-london-based-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-03T12:25:51Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point: China incorporates seven London-based firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/03/hinkley-point-china-incorporates-seven-london-based-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/apr/03/hinkley-point-china-incorporates-seven-london-based-firms","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point: China incorporates seven London-based firms","bodyText":"Beijing’s growing confidence in its plans to help build new reactors at Hinkley in Somerset and Bradwell in Essex has been underlined by the recent incorporation of seven new Chinese nuclear-related firms in London. It appears, however, that an agreement between China and its partner EDF of France to develop the first new reactors in Britain for 20 years has still not been signed. Beijing’s creation of so many new businesses could further alarm those concerned at the degree of complexity surrounding the £18bn Hinkley scheme. Documents from Companies House show the recent listing of General Nuclear System Limited and Bradwell Power Holding Company alongside more opaque entities such as Libra International and Sagittarius International. All seven companies use the same Stratton Street address in Mayfair, west London used by the state-owned China General Nuclear Power Corporation. They also have the same director, Zhu Minhong, the public face of China’s nuclear power business in Britain. Zhu appeared with Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, before parliament’s energy and climate change committee 10 days ago, and stressed China’s optimism about building nuclear power plants in Britain. A spokesman for China General Nuclear Power Corporation, where Zhu is a general director for the UK, said he could not immediately explain why so many new UK-based businesses had been established or their exact purpose. The Chinese company announced at a highly publicised signing ceremony in London last October that it would be taking a one-third share in Hinkley Point C alongside EDF, and that it also planned to construct and operate its own locally designed reactors at Bradwell. Despite heads of agreement being signed off during the visit of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, EDF and China Nuclear had still not completed the final legal documents in February as the wider Hinkley go-ahead remained stalled while the French power company demanded more financial support from Paris. EDF declined to spell out exactly what the current situation was, but referred to the statements Zhu made at the select committee when he said: “We have agreed the package deal in terms of the heads of terms. We then spent our time to translate the heads of terms into long-form. What I can say today is that our discussions [are] practically completed.” Peter Atherton, a utility analyst at Jefferies investment bank in London, expressed concern about the complexities of the wider Hinkley programme, noting that EDF had spoken of having “thousands and thousands” of pages of legal documents to be signed off with it Chinese counterparts. “Complexity is itself a warning that this project is likely to run into some kind of problem. Often when you have a major infrastructure project that runs into problems, say the [London] tube PFI, complex contracts have added to the risk and uncertainty over who bears the responsibility for which costs. “I would be staggered if anyone in government could tell you where exactly the risk lay [with regard to Hinkley].” The Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “Hinkley Point C is a major infrastructure project which will boost our energy supply and our economy, bringing in billions of pounds of investment into the UK and creating 25,000 jobs during construction. “A deal of this scale is by its nature complex, but we are clear on the construction and financing risks, which fall firmly on the developer rather than bill payers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/07/cant-wont-pay-britain-realistic-costs-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-07T16:12:31Z","webTitle":"Can’t pay, won’t pay?

A report in the Sunday Telegraph cited Whitehall figures suggesting they would offer a divorce bill of £36bn to move talks on to future trade arrangements. The EU side is reported to be expecting something around the €75bn (£66bn) mark. Citing headline figures is unhelpful. The talks will take place by agreeing broad principles on assets and liabilities and then seeing what kinds of numbers they produce. There are two main calculations: the financial framework liability and pensions. EU financial frameworks work in seven-year cycles, with the current one agreed in 2013. Member states decide in advance how much they will spend for the years ahead, covering everything from academic research grants in Romania to decommissioning nuclear power stations in France. The EU is likely to argue that we’re on the hook until the end of 2020, when the existing period ends. The pensions payments are more complicated. Do we pay by the proportion of UK citizens working at EU institutions or in line with our overall contribution? Which assets should be used to guarantee the pensions benefits? Will we pay in one go or in instalments? The list goes on and on. These kinds of tedious questions are central to the Brexit debate, but there have been few attempts to grapple with them from its leading proponents on the Tory backbenches. After the Sunday Telegraph article, Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted that “legally we owe nothing”. Peter Bone found it all “very strange”. John Redwood said that “there is absolutely no legal need or political need to offer them anything at all”. Downing Street claimed not to recognise the figure. It’s possible the statement can actually be taken at face value. The £36bn figure may have been given to the newspaper by a frustrated official trying to bounce the government into coming up with a realistic opening offer – or indeed to force it to adopt any position at all. The Europeans have been baffled by the British team’s total lack of meaningful engagement with the issue. This needs to be urgently addressed. Until the EU is satisfied there is sufficient progress on the divorce settlement, we can’t discuss future trade. It’s in this second section of the talks that a transition arrangement can be agreed to cover us between Brexit day and the new trading agreement. Without it, Britain is hurtling towards the cliff edge. But even without that dynamic, Brexit demands a realistic approach from the government. We’re about to cut ourselves off from our largest market and lose access to the trade arrangements we hold with other countries through the EU. We desperately need new trading partners. But if they find us knee-deep in a vicious legal dispute with our former trading bloc, we won’t be an attractive proposition. A similar problem arises at the WTO, where Brussels can make life very difficult for Britain if it chooses. The next few years are filled with hazards for the UK. They become far less severe if we have a cordial relationship with Europe. Being realistic about what we owe is a first step towards that. The hawkish vitriol of parliament’s hard Brexiters is a step backwards. Its only accomplishment is the temporary alleviation of their emotional inadequacy. Their behaviour is by this stage unremarkable. We’re used to seeing a certain kind of Tory backbencher talk utter nonsense on this issue. But the failure of No 10 to present realistic alternatives is much more troubling. Until they do, we are stuck on the no-deal conveyor belt, where each day the country’s situation becomes more precarious. • Ian Dunt is editor of politics.co.uk and author of Brexit: What The Hell Happens Now?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/24/low-carbon-policy-less-vital-than-low-energy-bills-and-security","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T11:09:06Z","webTitle":"Government intervention has led to higher energy bills, claims Lords report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/24/low-carbon-policy-less-vital-than-low-energy-bills-and-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/24/low-carbon-policy-less-vital-than-low-energy-bills-and-security","fields":{"headline":"Government intervention has led to higher energy bills, claims Lords report","bodyText":"Ministers should establish a new energy commission to spur on construction of power stations because successive governments have failed to encourage enough fresh power capacity in the UK, according to a House of Lords report. Subsidy-backed growth in renewable energy projects, such as windfarms, has deterred the construction of new conventional power plants, the economic affairs committee claimed. The peers envisage the new energy commission would oversee auctions where all technologies, including fossil fuel power plants, competed for guaranteed electricity prices. The auctions would cap carbon emissions. At present the government only allows low-carbon power, such as windfarms and new nuclear power stations, to compete in auctions for such deals, known as contracts for difference. The influential cross-party group of peers concluded that successive governments have got their priorities wrong on energy policy by giving priority to carbon emissions cuts – a statutory duty under the Climate Change Act – over keeping costs down and keeping the lights on. The report has sparked an angry response. Robert Gross, director of the centre for energy policy and technology at Imperial College, London, said: “The term ‘post truth’ has become over-used. Yet it would be possible to take all the evidence the committee presents and tell a completely different story: there’s been huge success in growing renewables and reducing emissions from the power sector.” Lord Hollick, the committee’s chair, said: “We are critical of the drift that’s taken place over the last 15 years or so, which has delivered on the decarbonisation agenda but very much at the expense of consumers paying 58% more than they were in 2003. On the affordability front we haven’t looked after consumers.” However, as the report acknowledges, most of the price increases came from higher gas prices, not the 10% added by renewable energy subsidies. The peers, who include the former chancellor Norman Lamont, and a former head of the civil service, Andrew Turnbull, said security of supply should become the key aim of energy policy, above decarbonisation and cost. “Low-carbon but chronically unreliable electricity is not acceptable. Similarly very cheap prices at the expense of frequent shortages would be unacceptable,” the report says, which also claims fossil fuels have remained cheaper than renewable sources. But Paul Massara, the former chief executive of npower who now runs the renewable energy firm North Star Solar, said the committee was simply wrong to say fossil fuels were always cheaper than renewables, and condemned the report as “backward looking”. Darren Baxter, a researcher at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, said: “A failure to keep the pace up with decarbonisation, as suggested in this report, would be a disaster for the north [of England] and its growing low-carbon economy.” Hollick told the Guardian that the government had micromanaged the energy market and did not need to interfere as much. He said the government “should now allow the energy commission to move forward, to run auctions, to fill the gap and to build a properly balanced [energy system]”. Hollick denied the report was anti-renewables. “Exactly the opposite. We see renewables very much as the way forward,” he said, arguing that more public money should go into R&amp;D in renewables and energy storage. The committee also urged the government to publish its plan B if the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is expected to provide 7% of the UK’s electricity from 2025, is delayed or even cancelled. Hollick said the biggest surprise during the committee’s inquiry was the “fragility” of the government’s nuclear ambitions, which envisage new nuclear reactors in Somerset, Suffolk, Anglesey and Cumbria. “It is imperative that the government publishes it contingency plans for how it will make up the capacity due to be provided by these plants in the event one or more does not succeed or is delayed,” the report says. Hollick said he expected the government’s energy back-up plan to be made up largely of new gas power stations and offshore windfarms. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable. Our top priority is making sure UK families and businesses have secure, affordable energy supplies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/07/edf-unions-call-for-hinkley-point-project-to-be-postponed","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T14:36:23Z","webTitle":"EDF unions call for Hinkley Point project to be postponed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/edf-unions-call-for-hinkley-point-project-to-be-postponed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/07/edf-unions-call-for-hinkley-point-project-to-be-postponed","fields":{"headline":"EDF unions call for Hinkley Point project to be postponed","bodyText":"Union leaders at the French energy company EDF have called for investment in Britain’s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant to be delayed for at least two years, warning that it represents a threat to the company’s future. Workers’ representatives say the sudden resignation of EDF finance director Thomas Piquemal has revealed that doubts over the feasibility of the controversial project go right to the top. “The resignation of such a high-ranking executive is pretty spectacular and shows the disagreement even at the highest levels,” Serge Gianorsi, trade union secretary for the Force Ouvrière union at EDF, told the Guardian. “Until now, managers have not expressed themselves publicly, but we have known for a long time that our position is shared by the majority of specialists inside and outside the company.” The union leader’s warning was backed up by Martin Young, an analyst with the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, who said proceeding with the Hinkley project would verge on “insanity”. “The European electricity industry faces unprecedented challenges and change. EDF is not immune from these challenges, and we believe needs to act to a greater degree than has been proposed. Against that backdrop, to proceed with Hinkley Point C at this juncture would be verging on insanity. M Piquemal’s resignation arguably suggests exactly that,” wrote Young in a briefing on the company. Gianorsi is the latest union leader to express deep misgivings about the Hinkley Point project, and to question the French government’s insistence that it go ahead. He added that if the French state, which owns roughly 85% of EDF, did not step back from the deal “there will be very heavy consequences for the future of the company and staff”. In January, EDF announced it was laying off 4,000 workers over the next two years. Last summer, the French government and EDF were forced to step in with a multibillion-euro package to rescue Areva, France’s designer and builder of nuclear reactors that had been hit by competition from foreign rivals and a plunge in demand for nuclear reactors following the Fukushima disaster. Marie-Claire Cailletaud, of the powerful CGT Energie union at EDF, agreed the UK project must be delayed. “We have already said it is urgent that this project be postponed because we feel the current state of EDF’s nuclear branch and the company’s financial situation make it dangerous to launch this right now,” Cailletaud told Europe 1 radio. “We know this view is shared at the top level of the company but that people don’t feel free to express themselves. So, I imagine this is a way for Mr Piquemal to show his disagreement.” On Monday, EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said he wants to reach a final decision soon on investing in Britain’s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant after Piquemal’s resignation cast further doubt on the French energy company’s ability to fund the £18bn project. Levy said he regretted the “hastiness” of Piquemal’s departure. Piquemal resigned because he believed pursuing the world’s most expensive nuclear project could threaten the group, whose finances are already stretched by rising debt. The finance chief’s departure increased the feeling of crisis surrounding the Hinkley project, which is seen as vital for Britain to keep the lights on. If the plan were to collapse, it would be a serious blow to the UK government, which has offered generous guarantees to build two reactors at the site in Somerset. When asked if she could guarantee that there would be no additional costs for UK taxpayers, David Cameron’s official spokesperson pointed to the discussions that were under way with the French government. “I am not going to speculate about the resignation of one individual, that is a matter for EDF,” she said, and insisted that it was clear from François Hollande at the UK-France summit in Amiens last week that it had “the full support of the French government”. EDF’s battered share price fell 6.5% on Monday after Piquemal’s resignation was revealed over the weekend. The company’s shares have more than halved from €22 to €10 in the past year as concerns have mounted about its finances. In a deal supported strongly by the chancellor, George Osborne, EDF joined forces with the Chinese utility CGN in October to construct the reactors. But many industry figures now believe the project is on the verge of collapse. EDF said in October it expected to take a final decision and start deploying engineers at Hinkley Point in November. But the company has still not signed a final contract as fears have mounted about its financial strength. In an emailed statement, Levy said: “With the support of its state shareholder, EDF confirms it is studying the investment in the two Hinkley Point reactors in the best financial conditions for the group, with the aim of announcing a final investment decision soon,” Reuters reported. On top of its large debts, EDF is grappling with a collapse in power prices, cost overruns on a nuclear project in France and upgrades costing tens of billions of euros on its domestic reactors. Piquemal’s resignation raises grave doubts about EDF’s ability to carry out the project, which the UK government is relying on to meet the country’s energy needs. Levy said last month a decision on Hinkley Point was “coming closer” as EDF reported a 68% plunge in annual profit and cut its dividend. The company said its net debt had increased by €3.2bn (£2.5bn) to €37.4bn. EDF union leaders say the state and company should wait until France’s first European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) go online at Flamanville around 2018 – six years late – to evaluate their safety and efficiency before agreeing to build them in Britain. “It will take at least two to three years to see how they work and to evaluate the technology and a minimum of security,” Gianorsi said. “We consider that EDF is not in a position, financially or industrially, to launch the Hinkley Point project.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/jan/16/le-grand-macabre-barbican-london-review-lso-simon-rattle-ligeti-peter-sellars","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-16T16:42:15Z","webTitle":"Le Grand Macabre review – Sellars brings muddle but Rattle, beauty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/16/le-grand-macabre-barbican-london-review-lso-simon-rattle-ligeti-peter-sellars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/jan/16/le-grand-macabre-barbican-london-review-lso-simon-rattle-ligeti-peter-sellars","fields":{"headline":"Le Grand Macabre review – Sellars brings muddle but Rattle, beauty","bodyText":"London should have seen Peter Sellars’ take on György Ligeti’s only opera in 1999, when the production he had unveiled at the Salzburg festival two years earlier was due to come to Covent Garden. But the then newly renovated Royal Opera House was still having technical teething problems and the show was cancelled. We’ve finally seen it now, though, more or less: the semi-staging that Sellars has devised for the London Symphony Orchestra’s performances with Simon Rattle follows the same 20-year-old line, setting Le Grand Macabre in a world of nuclear catastrophe. After the Salzburg production, for which Ligeti made the total revision of the score that’s now definitive, the composer publicly repudiated the reading of his stage work as a post-Chernobyl parable. Two decades on, Sellars, however, has stuck to his approach. But with the stage strewn with drums of radioactive waste, characters wearing white coats or decontamination suits and backed by video footage of nuclear power stations and mushroom clouds, demonstrations against Trident and survivors sifting through the devastation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, the whole thing seems muddled. Is this a critique of nuclear power or of nuclear weapons, or is it just saying, in a kneejerk way, that everything “nuclear” is bad? None of this helps the dramatic coherence of Le Grand Macabre either. The production by La Fura dels Baus staged at ENO seven years ago suggested the score had lost its subversive edge. Nothing in this performance contradicts that; in fact, it undermines what dramatic coherence there is, while the po-faced sermonising suffocates the anarchic black humour that is such a vital ingredient. From the grand macabre himself, Nekrotzar, who arrives in Breughelland to bring an end to everything but is too drunk to do his job properly, to the lovers Amando and Amanda, too wrapped up in each other to notice that anything apocalyptic is happening at all, everybody in the opera is a cartoon character. Turning them into nuclear operatives, besuited apparatchiks and victims adds nothing. Musically, though, the performance under Rattle is superb. From the opening toccata played on car horns which parodies the canzona from Monteverdi’s Orfeo, to the radiant passacaglia that supports the final scene, everything in Ligeti’s score is heard more vividly than it could ever be in an opera house, and the playing of the LSO is astoundingly good. So, too, are most of the solo performances – from Pavlo Hunka’s lugubrious Nekrotzar and Peter Hoare’s drink-sodden Piet the Pot, Frode Olsen and Heidi Melton as Astradamors and Mescalina the couple whose relationship is conducted entirely in S&amp;M terms, to Ronnita Miller and Elizabeth Watts as the young lovers. Only Audrey Luna as Gepopo, the chief of police, does not make the most of her coloratura nonsense aria. It’s normally one of the show-stopping moments, but then Sellars has Luna sing from a hospital bed, complete with one of his trademark drips. As too often in this production, the tired old message has to come first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/22/monday-briefing-trump-shutdown-continues-in-us","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T06:32:00Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Trump shutdown continues in US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/monday-briefing-trump-shutdown-continues-in-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/22/monday-briefing-trump-shutdown-continues-in-us","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Trump shutdown continues in US","bodyText":"Top story: Deadlock and chaos as president marks first year Good morning – it’s Warren Murray bringing you the stories to start the week. The shutdown of the US government has continued overnight as Republicans scrambled to win the Democratic votes they need to keep funding federal departments. The crisis is a result of Donald Trump scrapping protections against deportation for the “Dreamers” – undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. Democrats are demanding Trump soften his stance on the Dreamers’ fate, and have been able to deny Republicans the supermajority needed to push through a bill providing the government’s day-to-day finances. Overnight, Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, offered the Democrats a later vote on immigration reform if they agree to continue funding the government. However, one Democratic source cautioned that no deal had been reached. A shutdown is triggered when Congress fails to pass appropriate funding for federal operations and agencies. Nearly 40% of the workforce is placed on unpaid leave and told not to work, though “essential” ones such as homeland security, the FBI and military personnel on active duty are able to continue. The situation is a humiliation for the president who has just notched up one chaotic year in office. * * * Epidemic of vanity steroids – Up to a million British people are using muscle-building anabolics and other image and performance-enhancing drugs (IPEDs), experts have warned. The desire to conform to a “ripped” image is driving men to put their long-term health at risk. Yorkshire-based Joe Kean, who recruited steroid users for the study of IPED use, warned of a burden on the NHS: “Lads are taking steroids, drinking and taking a bit of coke and they go out feeling hard and manly. Steroids, alcohol and cocaine are the holy trinity for heart issues.” The problem is prevalent in Wales where boys as young as 13 are known to use IPEDs. * * * ‘Don’t risk losing to Russians’ – Britain’s defence chief of general staff, Sir Nick Carter, will warn today that the UK is trailing Russia in terms of defence spending and capability. Military chiefs and Conservative MPs claim the funding has dropped to dangerously low levels, and Carter will say in a London speech that one of the biggest threats is cyber-attacks targeting both the military and civilian spheres. “We have seen how cyber-warfare can be both waged on the battlefield and to disrupt normal people’s lives.” The Ministry of Defence is pressing the Treasury for a significant increase in spending on the army, navy and air force. * * * Wanted: nuclear dump site – Britain is restarting the search for an area willing to be the host of an underground repository where nuclear waste would remain stored for hundreds of thousands of years. The last such effort collapsed in 2013 when Cumbria county council abandoned its bid for the geological disposal facility (GDF). Stable geology and local consent are being treated as essential to the process of finding a site. On the latter point the misgivings are obvious, but the construction of a nuclear power plant in Somerset, and plans to build four others, mean finding a solution is a pressing matter for the government. “I hope to God they get it right this time,” said one source close to the process. * * * Go home … to nowhere – The Home Office has left a stateless man in limbo by telling him to return to Palestine, where he can not get in because of his lack of papers. It is a “brutal and illogical” situation, said Michael Ferguson, from the charity Passage. Mohammed Al-Mustafa, 36, left Gaza at age five with his parents after his brother was killed. He has never had any legal status, and claimed asylum in the UK in 2010. The Home Office appears to have tried to have it both ways, questioning his claims of Palestinian origin in order to refuse him protection, but also advising him to move back there – which he has attempted to do twice, unsuccessfully. “Give me country,” he pleaded in an interview with the Guardian. Al-Mustafa’s case is being reviewed by the Home Office. * * * Valuable Titian flushed out – A Renaissance painting once owned by Charles I and given to his plumber to settle the royal debt is coming to auction. Titian’s two-metre tall work depicts the virgin martyr St Margaret escaping from the mouth of Satan in the shape of a dragon. After Charles I’s execution in 1649, Oliver Cromwell’s government gave it to John Embry in lieu of £100 worth of plumbing bills. It will be auctioned at Sotheby’s New York on 1 February and carries an estimate of £1.5m-£2m. In London, the Royal Academy of Arts is to open an exhibition on Saturday of works collected by Charles I that are being reunited for the first time in 400 years. * * * Younger at heart – Your “heart age” is basically your actual age, adjusted for health risk factors such as smoking, drinking and family history of heart problems.

Lunchtime read: Flying against fair play Instructive reading, this one, about how Ryanair dances around the rules for compensating passengers for disruption to their flights. According to Coby Benson, from flight claims specialists Bott and Co, the Irish airline is the greatest offender in dodging legitimate claims. One plane bound for Berlin was diverted mid-flight to Hanover, and passengers left stranded there at 1am. They were fobbed off when claiming for the train fares needed to reach their actual destination. Others in similar straits have been denied compensation – they say Ryanair falsely claims to have offered them alternative transport. Benson has a backlog of 15,000 claims against Ryanair: “These are not isolated incidents but company policy.” Sport Marco Silva, replaced as Watford coach by Javi Gracia, forged a thrilling side at Vicarage Road but the tailspin that hit after his courtship of Everton leaves a sour taste all round, write Simon Burnton and Nick Ames.

Citizens were either misinformed or kept in the dark about the damage: the government would not even use the term “meltdown” until three months later. In an interview with a national newspaper in 2014, novelist Haruki Murakami diagnosed a national character flaw: irresponsible self-victimisation. “No one has taken real responsibility for the 1945 war end or the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident,” he said. “I’m afraid that it can be understood that the earthquake and tsunami were the biggest assailants and the rest of us were all victims. That’s my biggest concern.” Resurgence director Hideaki Anno, a revered otaku (nerd) hero best known for creating one of Japan’s darkest and most elaborate anime classics, Neon Genesis Evangelion, doesn’t let his compatriots off the hook, visually or emotionally. Shots of cars and yachts piling up along canals by the force of water pointedly replicate scenes from the 2011 disasters, turning Godzilla into a personified tsunami. Relief workers and politicians in hazmat suits and light blue jumpsuits respectively echo the surreal imagery of the catastrophe’s aftermath. But during the first half of the film, the monstrosity is neither natural nor imaginary. It’s bureaucracy – specifically, Japan’s sclerotic civil servants, most of whom are men in matching charcoal suits too concerned with protecting their careers and following protocol to risk a decision that might save lives. For them, responsibility is to be shirked at all costs. These officials and their circuitous exchanges get so much screen time that it’s a relief whenever the eponymous creature rises from the sea or rubble and, unlike the human droids in their corporate uniforms, flexes its reptilian skin, unleashes a trademark birdlike shriek, and actually does something, however disastrous. “Extermination, capture, and expulsion,” says a ministry official, airing his empty musings as the danger nears Tokyo. To which a fellow suit replies: “Who are you addressing?” Lampooning bureaucratic inefficiency isn’t unique to Japan, of course. (Gavin Hood’s underappreciated 2015 thriller Eye in the Sky makes similar hay of UK and US officialdom’s tortuous response to impending violence.) But for Japanese audiences, Resurgence’s depiction of paralysed civil servants selfishly fumbling their response to a crisis born of radiation delivered a sharp domestic sting. Resurgence (Shin Godzilla translates as “new” or “true” Godzilla) was the top box office live-action domestic feature of last year, became the highest grossing of the franchise’s 31 films to date, and won seven Japanese Academy Awards. Murakami’s analysis of his homeland, dramatised on the big screen, resonated most powerfully at home. The conventional take on the series’ 1954 original is that the monster is a metaphor for America’s nuclear attacks on Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and more recently at the time, the US military’s testing of a hydrogen bomb at Bikini Atoll, whose fallout contaminated a Japanese fishing vessel and resulted in at least one casualty. But the literary critic Norihiro Kato has argued that Godzilla may also, and perhaps more accurately, be seen as a revenant, an angry and restless symbol of Japan’s estimated 3.1 million soldiers and citizens who perished during the second world war and were quickly cast aside in shame, as the defeated nation embraced its American conquerors (and “a shallow simulacrum of democracy”) through an economic and military alliance that persists to this day. After all, Kato writes, in 31 films spanning six decades, why does the monster always return to Japan? Why not Australia, New Zealand, Singapore? Kato’s question and interpretation are brought to the foreground in Resurgence – in exasperation, one bureaucrat literally asks: “Why is it coming here again?” Americans appear on the film’s fringes, as condescending, unilaterally minded bureaucrats who carelessly respond with overwhelming force (and the film was made before Donald Trump), and more centrally in the character of Kayoko Anne Patterson, a Japanese-American representative of the US government whose vulgarity and self-regard reveal a wilful ignorance of Japanese etiquette. But the harshest critique is levelled at Japan. In its portrayal of a people unwilling to speak out or act on their own and a nation paralysed by dependency, Resurgence piles on heaps of destruction that is almost entirely self-inflicted. • Roland Kelts is a Japanese-American writer and author of Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture has Invaded the US"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/mar/29/toshiba-nuclear-westinghouse-bankruptcy-us-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-29T08:20:19Z","webTitle":"Westinghouse bankruptcy move casts shadow over world nuclear industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/29/toshiba-nuclear-westinghouse-bankruptcy-us-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/mar/29/toshiba-nuclear-westinghouse-bankruptcy-us-uk","fields":{"headline":"Westinghouse bankruptcy move casts shadow over world nuclear industry","bodyText":"The US bankruptcy filing by nuclear giant Westinghouse has been branded a major blow to the prospects for new atomic power globally. The nuclear arm of Toshiba proudly states “we are nuclear energy” on its website, a boast underpinned by its technology being in around half the world’s reactors. But the US firm was humbled on Wednesday when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a New York court, in a bid to reorganise and limit losses for its Japanese owner. Westinghouse’s plight stems from a $6.1bn (£4.9bn) writedown because costs have overrun on the two plants it is building in Georgia and South Carolina, the first new US nuclear power stations being built for decades. Toshiba said liabilities for its US unit totalled $9.8bn. Westinghouse has raised $800m in finance for its reorganisation, $200m of which is from Toshiba. José Emeterio Gutiérrez, the company’s chief executive officer, said: “We are focused on developing a plan of reorganisation to emerge from Chapter 11 as a stronger company while continuing to be a global nuclear technology leader.” Toshiba said the writedown could mean net losses for 2016 of 1tn yen (£7.23bn), significantly more than the 390bn yen (£2.82bn) it warned investors to expect in February. Mycle Schneider, a Paris-based consultant and author of an annual global nuclear report, said that although utilities and companies building nuclear plants had gone bust before, it was new to see a bankrupt nuclear builder. “If Westinghouse was nuclear energy, where does that leave nuclear energy after the Westinghouse bankruptcy? In the dark. This development illustrates that there is no bright future for nuclear new-build and that new nuclear plants will be irrelevant on the international power market,” he told the Guardian. The bankruptcy brings some relief for Toshiba, as the US unit will now be off its books. The Japanese corporation has said since that as result of Westinghouse’s troubles, it will no longer build new nuclear plants internationally, but focus on its home market. Satoshi Tsunakawa, Toshiba’s president, told a Tokyo press conference on Wednesday: “We have all but completely pulled out of the nuclear business overseas.” He added that he felt a “great responsibility” over the financial losses. Westinghouse and Toshiba said they were “working cooperatively” with the utilities that own its US projects at Plant Vogtle in Georgia and Virgil C Summer in South Carolina, to ensure construction continues. But there are doubts as to whether the plants, which are less than halfway built, will ever be finished. The Chapter 11 filing also raises question marks for projects around the world. The same reactor design being used in the US plants has also been slated for new power stations in India and the UK. Schneider said those projects were now effectively dead. Unions and the Labour party called on the UK government to step in and support the proposed Moorside nuclear power station in Cumbria, which would be Europe’s biggest if built. The NuGen consortium behind it is owned 60% by Toshiba and 40% by France’s Engie, whose chief executive has said she is sceptical about new nuclear’s future. Toshiba, which is yet to make a final investment decision on the project, admitted the supply of the reactors for the plant had been made uncertain by the bankruptcy filing. But it said there was no change in the business climate, and it would still “work to enhance NuGen project’s value”. NuGen said it would continue developing the site “in a business as usual manner”. Labour, which recently lost a byelection for the Copeland constituency where Tories attacked party leader Jeremy Corbyn’s perceived lack of support for Moorside, said the government had “dragged its heels” despite Westinghouse’s problems being known for months. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “This announcement throws into doubt the Moorside new nuclear plant that could create 20,000 jobs in Cumbria.” She continued: “When Westinghouse’s viability was first called into question, Labour said the government should step in to underwrite the company’s investment if the project was at significant risk of collapsing.” Chris Jukes, a senior organiser at the GMB union, said Moorside was crucial for west Cumbria’s local economy and the UK’s energy needs. “A collapse of the firm could delay the project or even put its entire future in limbo,” he said. “It is vital that this project is given the certainty it needs and therefore we are calling on an urgent government announcement to give clear and unambiguous clarity for the short, medium and long term future of Moorside.” However, Peter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Energy, said while the bankruptcy filing was a “big move” globally, it was unlikely to change circumstances much in the UK. “Toshiba is clearly looking to ringfence the US problem. But financing Moorside was always going to be a big problem.” Another major nuclear builder, South Korea’s Kepco, last week ruled out buying Westinghouse but said it was considering taking a stake in NuGen. However, anti-nuclear campaigners said that would risk Kepco, which is also building reactors in the UAE, repeating Toshiba’s mistakes. Ai Kashiwagi, an energy campaigner at Greenpeace Japan, said: “The Moorside reactors are of the same design that sunk Westinghouse’s nuclear business. While Kepco may be desperate to access the UK nuclear market, they would be making the same disastrous mistake that Toshiba made with its purchase of Westinghouse a decade ago.” Toshiba’s share price rose by 1% after Westinghouse’s bankruptcy filing was announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/22/edf-at-decision-point-over-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-21T23:04:11Z","webTitle":"EDF to decide on Hinkley Point next week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/22/edf-at-decision-point-over-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/22/edf-at-decision-point-over-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"EDF to decide on Hinkley Point next week","bodyText":"EDF will finally decide whether to proceed with a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset next week. The French government-controlled energy giant said on Thursday night that its board of directors would meet on Thursday 28 July. The final investment decision on whether to build two reactors at Hinkley Point is on the agenda for the meeting. EDF had said in April that it was delaying a final decision until September while it consulted with trade unions. The company has repeatedly delayed making a final decision on the project because of concerns about its £18bn cost. It said: “The two reactors at Hinkley Point would strengthen EDF’s presence in Britain, a country where its subsidiary EDF Energy already operates 15 nuclear reactors and is the largest electricity supplier by volume.” The company added that the project, Hinkley Point C, “is a unique asset for French industry as it would benefit the whole of the nuclear industry and support employment in major companies and smaller enterprises in the sector”. The French company said in April that its works council would be consulted on the terms of the partnership with the Chinese company, CGN. The Chinese group has said it would not go ahead on the project by itself if EDF drops out. The business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, said: “New nuclear is an essential part of our plan for a secure, clean and affordable energy system that will power the economy throughout this century. This is a welcome decision from EDF, and we look forward to the outcome.” Last month EDF managers told MPs that the company should postpone the Hinkley Point project until it had solved a series of problems with the reactor design and multibillion-euro lawsuits over delays on similar schemes. French unions have raised concerns about the cost of building the power station, but UK unions have strongly backed the project. The government argues that Hinkley Point C is a crucial part of the UK’s future energy mix as coal and older nuclear plants are shut down. It is expected to provide 7% of the country’s electricity demand when it becomes operational. It is due to be completed by 2025, but many regard that timetable as highly unrealistic given that reactors of the same design being built in Finland and France are running years behind schedule."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/12/uk-puts-energy-efficiency-at-heart-of-climate-change-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T13:28:20Z","webTitle":"Draughty homes targeted in UK climate change masterplan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-puts-energy-efficiency-at-heart-of-climate-change-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-puts-energy-efficiency-at-heart-of-climate-change-strategy","fields":{"headline":"Draughty homes targeted in UK climate change masterplan","bodyText":"Millions of draughty homes in England and Wales will be insulated and overhauled by 2035 to save families as much as £300 a year on their energy bills, under the government’s climate change plans. The long-delayed blueprint for how the UK will hit its binding target of cutting emissions by 57% by 2032 includes about 50 policies supporting everything from low-carbon power and energy savings to electric vehicles and keeping food waste out of landfill. Big winners in the 164-page Clean Growth Strategy include offshore windfarm developers, which will be guaranteed a further £550m of subsidies. Experts believe that could more than double the UK’s existing offshore wind capacity. Energy efficiency for businesses and householders is at the heart of the plan, which the government was required to publish under the Climate Change Act. There is an aspiration that all houses will be brought up to the minimum of energy band C by 2035, but how that will be achieved is not spelled out. Existing schemes to improve insulation will be extended until 2028. New nuclear power stations are encouraged, but they will only go ahead if developers can do so at competitive prices. Solar power was given tentative support, while onshore windfarms won partial backing. The business secretary, Greg Clark, compared the changes under way in energy today to the big changes wrought by the UK’s first coal power station in 1882. “This government has put clean growth at the heart of its industrial strategy to increase productivity, boost people’s earning power and ensure Britain continues to lead the world in efforts to tackle climate change,” he said, launching the plan at the Olympic Park in east London. Green campaigners, industry groups and businesses mostly welcomed the plan but said it needed more ambition and lacked detail in some areas. Robert Gross, the director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College London, said the politics of the strategy were key, and showed the greener wings of the Tory party had won out. “In 2015 the government started hacking and slashing at all manner of green policies. This has stopped, and that’s very welcome,” he said. Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, echoed that view. He said the strategy showed a “sea change” in “top-line thinking about the low carbon economy”, with Theresa May’s government seeing it as an opportunity rather than a cost as it was viewed under David Cameron. Claire Perry, the climate minister, said May’s foreword to the plan was important and showed how seriously the government was taking it. Asked if the strategy showed green-minded Tories were winning out after a slew of climate programmes were axed by the Conservatives in 2015, she said: “This isn’t about factions winning, it’s about getting on with capturing the opportunity [for business].” She told the Guardian: “This is doubling down on the green ambition, actually saying we see the economic benefit from doing this.” The minister said there would be a new “triple test” for whether the government backed clean technologies. They would have to maximise the amount emissions come down; show they can become cheaper in the future; and be an area in which the UK could lead the world. She said a proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon at Swansea – which an independent government review backed in January but on which government has yet to signal its view – would have to pass that test. New policies included a green light for onshore windfarms on remote Scottish islands being allowed to compete for subsidies. The move was welcomed by Orkney and companies including SSE, which plans a windfarm on Shetland, jointly owned with the community. There is also £100m of funding for research on carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, that is a fraction of the £1bn government competition on the technology that was cut two years ago. The plan is also scant on any detail of how the UK will cut emissions from heating, talking instead of simply exploring the best options. Low-carbon alternatives to gas include electrification via heat pumps, or using greener gases such as hydrogen. Many of the ideas in the strategy have already been announced, such as phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 and £246m to develop batteries for cars and energy systems. Despite the wide-ranging policies, the strategy concedes that the UK is still not on track to meet its legally binding carbon targets for the late 2020s and early 2030s. The government noted it had ‘flexibilities’ on meeting the targets under the Climate Change Act, but might not need to use them. The Committee on Climate Change, the UK’s statutory climate advisers, welcomed the strategy but warned ministers against using the law’s flexibilities in meeting its carbon targets. “This should not be the plan,” said Lord Deben, the group’s chairman. The authority will pass its verdict in January after analysing the plan. Campaign group ClientEarth said it was weighing its options, given the legal requirement for government to close the gap. Jonathan Church, a lawyer at the group, said: “The UK government is still in breach of the Climate Change Act. The UK is on course to miss its 2023-27 emissions reductions targets by 116MtCO2e – equivalent to more than the Philippines’ emissions in a whole year – and the clean growth strategy does not fix this.” The Green party said the strategy was a missed opportunity. Caroline Lucas, the party’s co-leader, said: “Government has blown this enormous opportunity to put Britain on track to meet its climate target.” Other observers, including the London School of Economics, said the broad thrust of the strategy was good, but it was too vague. The union Prospect said there were “still too many unanswered questions”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2020/mar/05/flybe-collapses-into-administration-coronavirus-cost-ftse-stock-markets-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-05T22:01:33Z","webTitle":"Coronavirus crisis drags down Flybe, as Wall Street slides again – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/05/flybe-collapses-into-administration-coronavirus-cost-ftse-stock-markets-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2020/mar/05/flybe-collapses-into-administration-coronavirus-cost-ftse-stock-markets-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Coronavirus crisis drags down Flybe, as Wall Street slides again – business live","bodyText":"Finally, here’s our latest news story on the crisis: One tiny comfort - the Dow didn’t lose a thousand points today. But it came close! It just closed down 970 points, or over 3.5%, as this week’s highly volatile trading continues. Ouch. Again. Here’s a catch-up on coronavirus, as the global infection total heads towards 100,000: Stocks are sliding as more cases are reported in the US, with the death toll now at least 11. Traders aren’t cheered by the news that the US Senate has approved $8.3bn in new funding for America to tackle the expanding coronavirus outbreak; the legislation has gone to Donald Trump for his signature. Here’s we go again (again). With a hour’s trading left, the Dow is on track for another hefty loss. It’s currently trading at 26,055 points, down 1,035 or 3.82%. That means pretty much all Wednesday’s rally has been swept away. After another busy day.... here’s our latest news story on the collapse of Flybe, by Gwyn Topham: The government has defended its role in Flybe’s collapse, as business groups, trade unions and passengers around the country voiced dismay at the loss of the UK’s biggest regional airline. Flybe went into administration in the early hours of Thursday morning, with the loss of 2,400 jobs, less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal, having promised to “level up” Britain by investing in transport links. The impact of the coronavirus on flight bookings proved the last straw for the Exeter-based Flybe, which had operated almost 40% of UK domestic flights, as the government stalled on a controversial £100m loan. Flybe was the fourth UK airline to go bust in a little over two years, following just months after the demise of travel group Thomas Cook. While cabinet ministers raced to announce they had saved Flybe in January, when the airline flirted with bankruptcy, it was left to the transport minister Kelly Tolhurst to defend the government’s actions in the Commons on Thursday. She said the government had been working “tirelessly” with Flybe’s owners Connect Airways – a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and the hedge fund Cyrus Capital – since then. Existing problems had been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak which had a “significant impact on demand”, Tolhurst said. “The directors, therefore, decided it was not viable to keep Flybe operating.” More here: The coronavirus crisis has forced Starbucks to stop customers bringing in their own cups. The coffee chain is “temporarily suspending” the programme, which gives a small discount to encourage people to be environmentally friendly. Apparently you’ll still get the discount if you arrive with your own receptacle - but you’ll get the drink in a new plastic cup. The coronavirus outbreak has also struck commodity pricing agency S&amp;P Global Platts, forcing staff to be sent home. Reuters has the story: S&amp;P Global Platts told employees at its Canary Wharf office in London to work from home until further notice after a visitor was diagnosed with the coronavirus, the company said. “Platts has a robust business continuity plan to ensure there are no disruptions to our MOC (market-on-close) price assessment process and the essential commodity market intelligence our customers rely on across news and analytics,” a company statement said. Platts said about 1,200 employees work in that office. Britain has so far registered 115 cases and reported its first death from the coronavirus on Thursday. There are also some anecdotal signs that fewer financial workers are heading into the City right now -- perhaps because banks are experimenting with home working? Business figures and politicians around the UK have warned that Flybe’s collapse could lead to severe consequences for regional economies following the loss of key air transport links. My colleagues Steven Morris and Joanna Partridge report: Exeter-based Flybe operates nearly 40% of the country’s domestic flights and there were fears over the impact of its collapse from around the country. In the south-west, Flybe’s failure was met with alarm that there could be substantial ripple effects financially. “A huge pack of cards has just fallen over,” said Tim Jones, chairman of the South West Business Council. Jones said that if the services the airport provided were not replaced quickly – and lost jobs restored as well – the result could be losses of up to £600m a year to the regional economy. Exeter airport – where all but one of the scheduled departures on Thursday was supposed to be a Flybe service – is an important hub not just for holidaymakers but for business people who use it to hop to London and other major cities in the UK and Europe. It is also used by people flying in from other parts of the UK to work on infrastructure projects for a week at a time, such as the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant site on the Somerset coast. Back on Wall Street, the sell-off is gathering more momentum. The Dow is now down 3.7%, or 1,010 points at 26,080. Before this crisis began, a 1,000-point move was very rare -- occurring only three times before. We’ve now seen four in the last fortnight (two up, two down), and could be on track for a 5th. Volatility, of course, is up: Outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney has pledged that global policymakers will deliver a “powerful and timely” response to the economic damage caused by the coronavirus. Speaking in London tonight, Carney tries to calm market concerns, saying the Bank is in talks with the UK Treasury (finance ministry) to plan its response. Carney declared: The Bank will take all necessary steps to support the UK economy and financial system, consistent with our statutory responsibilities. Our policy arsenal includes monetary policy instruments, special liquidity facilities, and macroprudential tools. We are also coordinating with HM Treasury to ensure that any initiatives are complementary and that they will collectively have maximum impact, consistent with our independent responsibilities. And lines of communication are wide open with our international colleagues at the G7, G20 and the IMF. While there will be differences in the exact timing and form, the collective impact of our efforts will be both powerful and timely. This is Carney’s last (scheduled) public speech before his departure. It’s got a suitably grand title-- The Grand Unifying Theory (and practice) of Macroprudential Policy -- and tries to explain how central bankers can ensure the financial system supports the economy. An important issue at this time in particular -- with Carney pointing out that financial crises occur roughly once a decade: The Italian government has doubles its stimulus programme to protect its economy from the coronavirus. Ministers have announced that the plan now totals €7.5bn, up from €3.6bn. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte says the money will be available to help “families and businesses tackle this emergency which is not just a health one but also an economic one”. The boost comes as Italy shuts all its schools for several weeks, as my colleague Lorenzo Tondo explains: Italy has been grappling to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of coronavirus, which so far has claimed 107 lives. On Thursday, Rome revealed that is evaluating the possibility of providing support to families, including reimbursements for babysitter costs and unpaid leaves of absence from work. “We should not assume that people are home using up holiday pay or paid leave,” Elena Bonetti, minister of family affairs, told Radio Capital. The collapse of Flybe today will be felt the most severely in outlying regions, where domestic flights are crucial lifeline for those travelling for work, writes my colleague Jessica Murray. Down in Cornwall, one 52-year-old who travels frequently to London and further afield for meetings, said losing the Flybe service would have a major impact. With four Flybe flights a day to Heathrow, it was possible to get to London and back in a day. “With the collapse of Flybe and no sign of a viable alternative I will have to start travelling the previous day and stay over in London.” Meanwhile, David Eyes commutes to Edinburgh from Manchester every week, flying up on Monday morning and returning on Wednesday evening. He has booked his flights with Flybe up until the end of March, and still has no guarantees about whether he will be refunded. Eyes, a consultant in financial services, said: “Flybe is central to commuters all over the country to get from region to region. I’m amazed the government hasn’t stepped in and done something. It will impact the country’s economy and people getting around.” Holidaymakers have also been affected, with one unlucky hen party seeing their flights cancelled for a second time, after originally booking through Thomas Cook last year. Hannah, 27, is organising a trip to Disneyland at the end of March for her friend’s hen do, and after having to deal with cancelled flights twice, the party of 10 have now spent nearly £2,000 on Eurostar tickets to get to Paris. Hannah says: “For two airlines we’re using to go into administration in the space of six months, it just feels like sod’s law. Now the group are keeping their fingers crossed that the Disneyland resort remains open as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout Europe. US hypermarket giant Walmart is restricting staff from travelling to conferences, trade shows and other events. It is also restricting cross-border international travel to “business-critical trips” only (and they’ll require high-level approval), while domestic travel is only allowed if it’s essential. Even group meetings are being cut back, Marketwatch reports, with Walmart telling staff: “Let’s use video conferencing or call in rather than travel.” European stock markets have closed in the red, hit by coronavirus gloom. ITV was the top faller in London, down 12% after warning that advertising revenue would fall 10% in April due to a plunge in travel adverts. Cruise company Carnival and holiday firm TUI both tumbled 7.2%, with traders expecting much less demand for its services until Covid-19 is under control. British Airway’s parent company, IAG, fell 5.3% after Flybe’s collapse showed the crisis facing airlines. IATA’s warning that a fifth of global revenues could be wiped out this year also drove its shares down. Here’s the damage. FTSE 100: down 110 points or 1.6% at 6705 German DAX: down 182 points or 1.5% at 11,944 French CAC: down 103 points or 1.9% at 5,361 This leave the EU-wide Stoxx 600 slightly up on the week, but still 11% less than two weeks ago. The steady increases in cases in Europe, the UK (now 115) and the US are alarming investors, as David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Health fears have ramped up again and traders are running for the hills. Even though governments along with international bodies have pledged huge sums of money to help combat the health crisis, dealers are still scared. It is as if the more money is thrown at the problem, the more nervous dealers become - the intervention acts as an indication of weakness. Getting back to Flybe’s collapse... there are concerns about the security of the airline staff’s pensions. This is because the firm’s scheme, the British Regional Airlines Group (BRAG) pension scheme, is registered in the Isle of Man. That means it is not protected by the UK’s pension lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), following the airline’s collapse this morning (5 March). A PPF spokesperson told Pensions Age: “We understand this must be a worrying time for Flybe employees and pension scheme members. “The Flybe pension scheme is based in the Isle of Man under the jurisdiction of their government, which is separate from the UK government, meaning the scheme is not protected by the PPF.” According to Pensions Age, the scheme has liabilities of £170m across 1,350 members, with an overall deficit of £11.6m as of November 2018. A ray of sunshine for British manufacturing amid coronavirus disruption: digger manufacturer JCB has ended short-time working at its UK factories, reverting back to a full working week. JCB had cut back hours for about 4,000 employees in mid-February as it struggled to source parts. They moved to a 34-hour working week, banking the extra hours to be worked later while not having their pay cut. However, those pressures had eased as the outbreak slowed in China, although the disease’s spread elsewhere could also affect it, JCB said. Graeme Macdonald, JCB’s chief executive, said: “This is not a moment for celebration, but it is a step in the right direction. There has been some improvement in the shipment of components from China but new threats are emerging from our supply chain in other parts of the world, notably Italy and South Korea. “We will continue to monitor the situation very closely on a daily basis and take any necessary measures to protect the business.” Wall Street’s tumble is quite a contrast with China, where the main stock index hit a two-year high today. The CSI 300 jumped 2.2% today, meaning it has more than recovered its slump after the Lunar New Year. Traders are encouraged by signs that Chinese factories are getting back to work, and by falls in the number of new Covid-19 cases. Beijing’s efforts to stimulate its economy through cheap loans for banks, tax cuts, and loan relief, are all helping too. More and more companies are asking staff to work from home, or reining in their travel plans. In the US, Amazon and Facebook are encouraging their employees in Seattle to stay home after workers for each company tested positive for Covid-19. CNN explains: Amazon revealed earlier this week that one of its Seattle-based employees has been diagnosed with the virus. On Wednesday, Facebook said a contractor who works at one of its offices in Seattle had tested positive. The market turmoil has provided one benefit for Americans - mortgages rates are now their lowest ever. Associated Press explains: The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has hit a record low of 3.29%, driven down by investors shifting money into the safety of U.S. Treasurys as the viral outbreak deepens. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on the benchmark 30-year loan this week tumbled from 3.45% last week. The new rate is the lowest level since Freddie Mac started tracking it in 1971, the company says. Capital Economics have had a stab at estimating the impact of coronavirus on the US economy. They freely admit it’s a “finger in the air” exercise, as we simply don’t know how far the virus will spread. And they’ve come up with two scenarios - one rather more alarming than the other. Their current working assumption is still that the number of coronavirus cases in the US is restricted to the low tens of thousands (out of 325m people), and drops off by the summer. That would only knock 0.2% off US growth this year. But....in a worse-case scenario that resembles past pandemics, up to one-third of the population could eventually become infected, with the disruption lasting for closer to 12 month. And in that severe scenario, they estimate that GDP would fall by 3.0% over that year -- a painful downturn. The resulting recession would prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to near-zero again and we would expect a major fiscal stimulus too. Today’s selloff means the Dow Jones industrial average is 9% below its levels on 21 February, before the coronavirus selloff began. It’s still up on the week, following surges on Monday and Wednesday. Those gains appeared to be driven by hopes of stimulus moves, and relief that Joe Biden did so well on Super Tuesday (he’s less of a threat to Wall Street than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren). Shares in major cruise operators are also sliding: Every member of the Dow is falling. Financial stocks are being hit by the prospect of a fall in US growth, with American Express down 4%, JP Morgan losing 3.8% and Goldman down 3.1%. Boeing has lost 3.45%, as a slump in airline revenues is going to hurt demand for new planes. Consumer-focused companies are also being hit. Nike are down 3.1%; it would suffer from a drop in retail spending. Media company Walt Disney has lost 3.3% Newsflash: Stocks are tumbling on Wall Street at the start of trading, as fears of a global recession sweep the markets again. Another very nervy session has begun with a wave of sell-orders. This has driven the Dow Jones industrial average down by 709 points, or over 2.6%, to 26,381. That’s wipes out two-thirds of yesterday’s rally, and sends New York stocks back towards the lows seen last week. The S&amp;P 500 is taking a buffeting too, down 71 points or 2.2% at 3,058. Airline stocks are leading the selloff, following IATA’s grim warning that the coronavirus could knock $113bn of global revenues this year. Some Flybe customers should be able to recover the cost of cancelled flights -- but they’ll still be hit in the pocket. My colleague Miles Brignall explains your rights: Those who bought a tour package should get a full refund, or the offer to reschedule the trip to a later date. However, many passengers will have been left holding expensive onwards flights, hotel, and other holiday bookings that they will not be able to cancel. In many cases they have lost their money. Onward flights booked with a second airline, will likely go ahead, and as a result the second airline is under no obligation to refund you. Passengers booked onto a flight that has been cancelled by the airline because it no longer wishes to operate the flight, are entitled to a full refund, but will struggle to recoup their “consequential” losses Cinema operator Cineworld has also been hit by the coronavirus crisis. Shares in Cineworld have slumped by 17% so far today, to a near seven-year low, as the Covid-19 virus threatens to keep people out of its seats. The delay of the next James Bond film, from April to November, is clearly a major blow to Cineworld, as my colleague Benjamin Lee explains: No Time to Die will now face competition from the Disney animation Raya and the Last Dragon, Godzilla vs Kong and King Richard, a drama starring Will Smith as the father of Venus and Serena Williams. The move comes after fears that the coronavirus could impact the global box office by as much as $5bn. There have been cinema closures in Italy, South Korea, China and Japan. Just in. Britain’s train operators have agreed to provide free travel to Flybe staff and customers who are unable to travel over the next week (as the Caledonian Sleeper also pledged earlier). Robert Nisbet, Director of Nations and Regions at the Rail Delivery Group, on behalf of train operators, says: ”We know how distressing the news about Flybe is for their staff and customers which is why train operators have arranged free travel to help them get to their destinations.” The threat of a global recession has forced the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree the deepest oil production cuts since the global financial crisis in 2008. The oil cartel said Covid-19 could halve the world’s expected oil demand growth for the first half of this year. In response it plans to deepen its existing production cuts of 2.1 million barrels of oil a day by another 1.5 million barrels, or 3.6% of global oil supplies, from next month. Opec will take responsibility for cutting 1 million barrels of oil a day, and expects its allies in the Opec+ group, led by Russia, to cut the remaining 500,000 barrels from their combined oil production. Opec+ is expected to give its verdict on the plan tomorrow. The proposed cuts are the deepest since Opec agreed to hold back around 4.2 million barrels of oil a day during the global financial crisis. Jeff Currie, Goldman Sachs’ head of global commodities research, told Bloomberg that the plans might be too little too late to prop up oil prices “I think the damage is done. “Cutting production by 1.5m barrels a day in April or May is not going to not really going to save you in the current environment. That’s why I say it’s too little too late.” Overnight rail service Caledonian Sleeper is rather decently offering free travel for the next week to Flybe customers stranded by its collapse. They can secure a seat on either the Lowlander route (which runs from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London), or the Highlander (which links Aberdeen, Fort William, Inverness and London). Ryan Flaherty, Serco’s Managing Director for Caledonian Sleeper, says: “The news about Flybe entering administration is extremely sad and we’re aware that many passengers and crew will be struggling to get home. It’s best to phone their Guest Service Centre [0330 060 0500], rather than just turning up at the station. The Sleeper’s not as fast as flying -- although much better for the environment -- and the service has been hit by teething problems. The ‘hotel on wheels’ relaunch last April was something of a disaster, with delays, booking errors, a water leak, and problems serving food to customers. But on the upside, the Guardian’s Gwyn Topham was accidentally served three ‘delicious’ game pies.... HSBC has confirmed that an employee has tested positive for the coronavirus, and that around 100 colleagues from its research department have been sent home while the office is deep-cleaned. A spokesperson says: We have been informed that one of our employees at 8 Canada Square has been diagnosed with COVID-19. This colleague is under medical supervision and has self-isolated. We are working closely with the health authorities. We are deep-cleaning the floor where our colleague worked and shared areas of the building. Colleagues on that floor, and others who came into contact with him, have been advised to work at home. Based on medical and official advice the building remains open and operates as normal. Our first priority and concern is the health of our employees and customers – and we are encouraging our colleagues to monitor their health carefully and stay at home or call a doctor if they feel unwell.” Back at the British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting today, health secretary Matt Hancock said he was working with the Department for Work and Pensions on a way to extend sickness benefit to all workers. That could including contract workers and the self employed, my colleague Phillip Inman reports. Asked about the issue, Hancock said. “It is vital that the same approach applies to all workers,” But the situation was not an easy one to resolve and talks were ongoing he added. Yesterday, prime minister Boris Johnson said sick pay would be paid from day one -- but that won’t benefit the self-employed, gig economy workers, or some on low pay. Earlier, the CBI said the government should extend Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) to all workers (e.g. agency staff and others on flexible or zero-hours contracts) who self-isolate themselves in accordance with public health guidance. Among its demands were: Clarifying in law that being unable to work because you’re self-isolating to comply with public health guidance - even if you are otherwise healthy - entitles a worker to statutory sick pay Clarifying that workers who are following public health advice on Coronavirus are entitled to SSP even if they don’t have a GP’s ‘fit note’ Removing the need to earn over £118 a week to qualify for SSP, which is unfair to part-time employees. The Government proposed this in a 2019 consultation - which the CBI supported - and these plans should now accelerate Introducing emergency relief for business – especially small businesses – if the total cost of sick pay becomes unsustainable. Small businesses may be particularly susceptible to cash-flow problems meaning that prompt reimbursement will be key to their ability to continue supporting staff. The Advertising Standards Authority has also also been clamping down on “alarmist” and “scaremongering” marketing for face masks, which could exploit people’s fears over the coronavirus outbreak. Our science editor Ian Sample explained yesterday: In rulings published on Wednesday, the regulator found that online ads from two companies breached its code and were misleading, irresponsible and “likely to cause fear without reasonable justification”. One advertiser, Novads OU, based in Tallinn, Estonia, ran display ads and webpages for an Oxybreath Pro face mask, which highlighted the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak and referred to a “growing sense of panic” before touting the mask’s “unparallelled [sic] protection.” Here’s an example of why the CMA are clamping down on coronavirus-related products: Just in: Britain’s competitions watchdog has warned retailers not to hike prices, or make misleading claims, to exploit customers during the coronavirus outbreak. The Competition and Markets Authority says companies who charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about the efficacy of protective equipment may be breaking the law. We will take “direct enforcement action” where necessary, the CMA adds menacingly, as it tries to prevent price-gouging, with many healthcare and cleaning products in short supply. The CMA is also assessing whether it should advise Government to consider taking direct action to regulate prices. CMA Chairman Lord Tyrie says anyone trying to rip off customers should stop: “We will do whatever we can to act against rip-offs and misleading claims, using any or all of our tools; and where we can’t act, we’ll advise government on further steps they could take, if necessary.” The warning also applies to online shopping -- including anyone offering, say, hand sanitisers or face masks on Amazon (where prices of some items have soared several hundred percent). CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli explains: “We urge retailers to behave responsibly throughout the coronavirus outbreak and not to make misleading claims or charge vastly inflated prices. We also remind members of the public that these obligations may apply to them too if they resell goods, for example on online marketplaces.” Here’s our news story about HSBC’s Covid-19 infection: Business leaders then quizzed Matt Hancock about the government’s plans to protect the economy from the coronavirus. One pointed out that venues, such as Newmarket racecourse, will suffer -- how will restaurants, for example, recover lost business? After all.... There’s nothing so valueless as a ticket to yesterday’s race. The health secretary replies that protecting the economy is a “very important consideration”, although the top priority is to keep people safe. There are a “range of options” to support businesses and supply chains if needed. Hancock insists the government is following the advice from scientists,. The UK didn’t ban flights from China because the experts said it would not be effective. The only country that ignored that advice was Italy, Hancock says pointedly. So on large events, the current scientific advice is that there is no material, epidemiological benefit to cancelling events, as long as people obey the medical advice to wash hands, and catch a sneeze in a tissue. And ultimately, Hancock adds: We are a herd. You can’t get away from the fact that we as a community, as a country, and indeed globally, we are all we are affected by this virus because others are affected. UK health secretary Matt Hancock is speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce’s annual meeting in London now. Hancock tells the assembled business people that the weeks ahead will be tough, as there is unlikely to be a vaccine available in the next few months. He explains the government has been trying to contain Covid-19, by detecting people infected and tracking down those they have spent time with. But it may not be able to contain the virus forever, especially if cases continue to rise in Europe. When that happens, Britain will move to the “delay” phase of its plans. There are now 85 confirmed cases in the UK, so shutting down all the schools and universities would not bring clinical benefits but would have major social and economic costs, Hancock adds. Across the country, readers are evaluating the impact Flybe’s collapse will have on regional travel, both for work or to visit family, my colleague Jessica Murray reports. Mike Green, 29, was due to fly from Aberdeen with Flybe this morning and is now facing a six-and-a-half hour train journey back to Manchester. Green, a manager at an oil and gas company, regularly travels with the airline to more remote areas of the UK including Aberdeen, Inverness, south Wales and Southampton where FlyBe is the leading carrier. With the airline now gone, he doesn’t know if this will be able to continue. Green says: “To be honest, I think the situation is going to be either that the travel doesn’t happen, so we work out some other way around it, or there’s going to be an expectation of traveling at the weekend because I know my employer is going to be fuming that six-and-a-half hours of my day today is going to be spent on a train,”. “I was supposed to fly into Manchester and go to a set of meetings, but that’s not going to happen now.” He added the decentralised nature of the oil and gas industry means communication could be tricky without the reliability of Flybe’s service. “There’s still a premium placed on face-to-face meetings as opposed to talking over the phone, so I spend a lot of time in airports and train stations.” For Hayley Anderton, 46, in Leicester, Flybe’s collapse means she may no longer be able to visit elderly father who lives in Shetland, or her father-in-law in Inverness, as often. She would fly from Birmingham up to Aberdeen or Inverness around four times a year to visit her relatives. “I don’t like taking short-haul flights but on a limited income and without a car it’s been the only feasible option to get to northern Scotland,” Anderton said. “Flybe has been a lifeline service for keeping the UK connected, they’ve been good to fly with, and I’m really going to miss them.” She is now looking at trains which are three times the cost of the previous flights and take much longer - a train from Birmingham to Inverness takes eight or nine hours. “It makes getting somewhere like Shetland from the Midlands a 24-hour journey. I guess it’s the same for a lot of regional airports around the UK that people who relied on those flights are going to struggle perhaps for work and definitely for seeing family. Anderton added that she actually considered moving up to Inverness with her partner last year, but when Flybe first ran into trouble in January she reconsidered. “One of the things that made it attractive was that it was reasonably well-connected with the rest of the UK by Flybe.” The incident at HSBC comes as City firms prepare to let more staff work from home. They already have contingency plans for an epidemic -- including splitting teams up so that everyone doesn’t catch the virus at the same time. They’re also getting ready for an explosion in remote working, although the Financial Times reports that there are concerns: While most banks have ample capacity for staff to access internal networks remotely, senior bank executives are concerned about broadband capacity at their employees’ homes, which is not as fast as at the banks and could be slowed down even further if their children are also off school watching streaming services such as Netflix. HSBC has evacuated a floor of its Canary Wharf office after an employee was feared to have caught coronavirus. The bank has ordered a deep clean of the area, which houses its research department, a source said. It has so far not affected HSBC’s trading floor, which carries out large transactions on financial markets for big institutions.The evacuation was first reported by Financial News. Newsflash: Pioneering low-cost airline Southwest has just issued a warning about coronavirus. Southwest, which basically created the budget airline model in the early 1970s, says customers demand has declined. It fears the crisis will wipe $200m-$300m off its operating revenues this quarter. Aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst also told MPs that the government “stands ready” to support the regional airports that will be hit by Flybe’s collapse. “We recognise the impact that this will have on UK airports particularly those which have large-scale Flybe operations. Government stands ready to support this sector.” “We are urgently working with industry to identify opportunities to fill routes. Tolhurst does have one piece of good news - Scotland’s Loganair has committed to keep 16 Flybe routes running. In parliament, transport minister Kelly Tolhurst is giving a statement on Flybe’s collapse. She says the government has been working “tirelessly” with Flybe’s owners since January (when the firm nearly collapsed). Ministers are reviewing Air Passenger Duty, to see how it can support the government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda, Tolhurst adds. She explains that existing problems at Flybe have been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak, which had a “signifiant impact on demand’. As such, the directors decided it did not have a viable future. Tolhurst explains: Unfortunately, in a competitive market, companies do fail, and it is not the role of government to prop them up. Tolhurst says there is sufficient capacity on other airlines to bring Flybe passengers home, and is pleased to see some airlines such as easyJet are offering rescue fares Flybe passengers should not got to the airport, she continues - they should look at the Civil Aviation Authorities website instead. And she expresses “sincere sympathy to those who have lost their jobs”, including cabin crew and ground staff. It is a worrying time for them and their families. Finally, Tolhurst reveals she will hold a meeting with the airline industry to discuss coronavirus’s impact next week. European stock markets have fallen sharply this morning, as fears of a global downturn rise again. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by over 1.5%, wiping out Wednesday’s recovery, as shares continue to whip-saw around. Investors appear to jumping between pessimism about a global recession, and optimism that policymakers will announce stimulus measures to avert it. Yesterday the Dow Jones industrial average surged by 4.5%, or 1173 points, but pessimism now has the upper hand: Financial data firm MSCI fear Wall Street could tumble by another 10% in the short term, warning: The global spread of coronavirus is already affecting global growth. We’ve conducted a what-if scenario analysis that assumes a short-term drop in growth of 2 percentage points and a risk-premium increase of 2 percentage points. Our model indicates that, in such a scenario, there’s room for further short-term losses: U.S. equities — already down 11% from Feb. 19 through March 3 — could drop a further 11%, while a hypothetical 60/40 global multi-asset-class portfolio could lose another 7%. In other travel news, the British Chambers of Commerce has called on the government should press ahead with Heathrow expansion. Speaking at the BCC’s annual conference in London, director general Adam Marshall said a third runway should be a broad agenda of infrastructure spending. It must also pump more money into trade support “to give a leg up to the many thousands of companies whose overseas efforts will make global Britain a reality,” Marshall added. At Manchester Airport, Flybe customers are also coming to terms with the airline’s collapse. Patrick Greenford, 77, retired, from Leeds, tells my colleague Gregory Robinson: I think it’s very sad that it’s gone bust and I feel very sorry for the people who were meant to be flying with them today. It’s very sad for the people who don’t have work anymore too. Margaret Shepherd (75) and Stuart Shepherd (69) from Bradford, had been planning to fly to Knock, on the west coast of Ireland, for Margaret’s birthday. Now they’ll have to fly to Dublin and hire a car instead. It’s really sad especially after Thomas Cook, they say, pointing out that there isn’t another airline which serves the UK’s regional airports. Student Lauren Rose, 20, was flying home to Jersey - and says many people will miss Flybe. I use their services to take me to and from Jersey. I’m used to flying from home to here in Manchester but I know there were a lot more locations they provided services which will probably affect so many people. Practically everyone I know back home has used them at some point. Niamh Kennedy, 66, a retired teacher from Manchester, adds: I’ve never flown with FlyBe but my sister always used to. She always used to visit Knock in Ireland. I have no idea how she’ll get there now... French contract worker Sebastien Cressent is also stranded at Birmingham Airport by Flybe’s collapse. Cressent, who doesn’t speak English, works at a local car plant. He returned his hire car to fly back home to Paris for a few days off and discovered what had happened. He’s been told the 2pm flight to Paris is full, so he might need to go to Manchester to get an evening flight to the French capital. The 10 Flybe check-in desks at Birmingham airport are deserted, following the airline’s collapse in the early hours of this morning, my colleague Joanna Partridge reports. Several people in hi-vis vests from the Civil Aviation Authority, a government surge response team and from the airport are on hand to help any passengers who have travelled to the airport, unaware of Flybe’s demise. An airport spokesperson said as many as 30 passengers had arrived at the terminal during the morning, hoping to depart for a range of domestic destinations such as Belfast, Aberdeen, Isle of Man and Jersey, as well as continental Europe. Departure screens in the terminal listing the cancelled flights inform Flybe passengers to “seek alternative arrangements”. One of those disappointed was Carole Lewis, due to fly to Inverness to visit family. She’d taken an early train to the airport from her home in Shrewsbury and hadn’t heard the news. Lewis tells us: “I’ve never flown there before, I was quite looking forward to it,”. She was hoping to be able to book a seat on a coach, but was expecting the journey to take a long time. An airport spokesperson said there have been “very positive discussions” with other airlines interested in taking on some of Flybe’s routes. Back outside Exeter Airport, Michelle Fegan, who sells pasties, sandwiches and snacks says she is devastated by Flybe’s collapse. “It’s a huge blow for Exeter. It’s going to affect the whole city and the region. I feel so sorry for the staff.” IATA are urging governments to help airlines ‘stay afloat’ - an admission that others could follow Flybe into administration. Alexandre de Juniac, Iata’s director general, says: “The turn of events as a result of Covid-19 is almost without precedent. In little over two months, the industry’s prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. “Many airlines are cutting capacity and taking emergency measures to reduce costs. Governments must take note. Airlines are doing their best to stay afloat as they perform the vital task of linking the world’s economies. As governments look to stimulus measures, the airline industry will need consideration for relief on taxes, charges and slot allocation. These are extraordinary times.” If IATA’s worst-case scenario comes to pass, then the airline industry is going to be in serious trouble. Here’s some reaction: NEWSFLASH: The global coronavirus outbreak could be as severe a blow to the airline industry as the global financial crisis a decade ago. That’s according to IATA, which represents the airline industry. In a new report, it warns that Covid-19 is set to cost the airline industry at least $63bn of lost revenue -- or $113bn if the virus spreads ‘extensively’ across more countries. IATA had previously expected a $30bn hit -- but has dramatically raised its forecast as the crisis escalates. Its worst-case scenario now shows a fifth of revenues being wiped out, with heavy losses in Asia, Europe and the US. That would be a severe blow to the airline sector. In new analysis, IATA sees 2020 global revenue losses for the passenger business of between $63bn (in a scenario where COVID-19 is contained in current markets with over 100 cases as of 2 March) and $113bn (in a scenario with a broader spreading of COVID-19). IATA says the situation has deteriorated fast in the last fortnight. IATA’s previous analysis (issued on 20 February 2020) put lost revenues at $29.3 billion based on a scenario that would see the impact of COVID-19 largely confined to markets associated with China. Since that time, the virus has spread to over 80 countries and forward bookings have been severely impacted on routes beyond China. Financial markets have reacted strongly. Airline share prices have fallen nearly 25% since the outbreak began, some 21 percentage points greater than the decline that occurred at a similar point during the SARS crisis of 2003. To a large extent, this fall already prices in a shock to industry revenues much greater than our previous analysis. IATA’s “limited” scenario is based on counties with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases (as of Monday) experiencing a sharp downturn followed by a V-shaped recovery profile. This would wipe out $63bn of revenues this year. IATA’s “extensive spread” scenario uses a similar methodology but to all markets that currently have 10 or more confirmed COVID-19 cases. The outcome is a 19% loss in worldwide passenger revenues, which equates to $113bn. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has warned that the coronavirus will push the UK economy to the ‘brink of recession’. In a new research note, Goldman say Britain faces “a substantial hit to growth in coming months. The UK is highly exposed to global activity (which we expect to contract in Q1), tourism exports are significant and the virus is spreading steadily within the UK. It now expects the UK economy will stagnate in January-March, and contract by 0.2% in April-June. Deutsche Bank are also anxious -- they’ve halved their forecast for British economic growth this year to just 0.5% this morning. Other travel companies are stepping in to help Flybe customers who have been stranded. London North Eastern Railway (LNER) is offering free travel for stranded staff and customers on its East Coast line today. EasyJet is offering to fly customers home free today and tomorrow, or for a small fee until the end of May: John Cullen, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, says the coronavirus outbreak made a bad situation worse at Flybe: “It had been reported that Flybe only had sufficient financial resources to last until the end of this month, but the dip in seat sales due to the coronavirus has piled on additional pressure, forcing the company into insolvency with the loss of over 2,000 jobs. “Last month it seemed that the loss-making airline might be successful in securing a state loan, due to its important role in facilitating regional connectivity. However, the terms of the loan could not be agreed. “It is clear that this Government has no intention of being free and easy with taxpayers’ money. Its prospective loan to Flybe had always carried significant risk, but the coronavirus situation has made matters worse.” Michael Mulligan, insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, fears more companies will follow: “Flybe’s collapse is the fourth significant UK airline failure since 2017. Whilst the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was only partly to blame for its collapse, it is clear that the industry is going to take a savage hit in the coming weeks and months. The end of the line for another troubled European operator, Alitalia, is rumoured. “It is still early days, but the unprecedented impact of Coronavirus is already causing massive challenges to people, business and supply chains. The virus could be the tipping point for those businesses already facing financial difficulties or with tight margins. James Goodall, Transport &amp; Leisure analyst at Redburn, agrees: “Flybe’s failure this morning will likely be the first of many in 2020. The company was already in financial strain before any impact from coronavirus. That being said, we expect that the demand destruction caused by Covid-19 accelerated its demise and we believe further airline bankruptcies should be expected in the coming months. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, whose constituency contains Exeter Airport, has blamed the government for not reforming Air Passenger Duty in time to help Flybe: Flybe had hoped to persuade the government to halve APD (£26 per passenger) on domestic flights in next week’s budget. They’d been promised a review, but clearly this wasn’t enough... The FT explains: Flybe became increasingly concerned that any cuts to APD might not kick in until 2021, which would be too late. These are the routes which will be lost now Flybe has collapsed: Some of these places will have been hoping to benefit from the UK government’s “levelling up” agenda... so this is a blow to them too. Other Flybe staff, such as pilot Sarah Nicol, are also coming to terms with the airline’s collapse: The coronavirus crisis means it’s a really difficult time to be finding a new job -- several airlines are putting staff on leave. But her uncle, former Scotland rugby union player Andy Nicol, is doing his bit: Katherine Densham, who had worked for Flybe for 13 years as cabin crew, heard in the early hours that the company had collapsed. She was due to fly from Exeter to London City and came to the airport – in her uniform – to check what was happening. She broke down in tears and said: “I feel really sad. I’m not sure what I’m going to do now. I heard in the early hours of the morning. I thought we’d be saved. I’ve no idea what I’ll do next – try and find some work to pay the bills.” A few passengers arrived at Exeter airport this morning, having not got the message not to turn up – or simply not knowing what else to do. Among them was a man who was hoping to fly to Paris for a birthday party. Disappointed, he turned around and went home. Three young women, Abbey Fletcher, Jessica Canha and Robyn Kent, who work for a recruitment company and have been training in Bristol, were trying to get home to Jersey. Fletcher said: “We heard last night that flights might be cancelled but we just got up at 4.30am and turned up anyway. We didn’t know what to do.” They were among the fortunate ones. The airline Blue Islands has stepped in to put on a free flight to the Channel Islands this afternoon. Canha tells us: “We’ll wait for that and take a nap in the meantime,” Only one other flight is expected into Exeter today – a plane that left for Lanzarote this morning and is due back this afternoon. Flybe’s collapse could cost 1,400 jobs at companies which worked with the airline, as well as the 2,000+ staff directly employed, says the GMB union. Nadine Houghton, GMB National Officer says in a statement: “The collapse of Flybe is a tragedy for the company’s loyal workforce. “A domino effect now puts 1,400 jobs in the wider supply chain at immediate risk and threatens the future of vital regional airports. “The last thing regions crying out for investment need is to see infrastructure that maintains good jobs ripped away. “We need the Government to urgently step in and save jobs wherever possible. The damage to already fragile local economies must be minimised.” Newsflash: John Lewis’s staff are getting the smallest annual bonus since 1953, as the retailer reports a 23% slump in underlying profits for last year. Its staff, or partners, will get just 2% of their basic pay -- down from 3% last year . New chair Sharon White has warned that “these are the most challenging but exciting times in retail for a generation”... More here. ITV is forecasting a slump of at least 10% in advertising revenues in April as companies in the travel sector pull spend in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus. ITV’s acts as a bellwether for the wider UK TV ad market and its plummeting forecast paints a grim picture for other broadcasters. The company is already feeling the impact of the spread of the virus, with total advertising revenue in the first quarter growing significantly slower than analysts forecast. ITV said total advertising revenue is set to grow 2% in the first quarter. Analysts at Citi had expected growth of 3.3%, indicating a significant pull back by advertisers as the crisis has gathered pace. Announcing its full year results on Thursday, ITV says: “In March and April, we have seen an impact from travel advertising deferments relating to the coronavirus, “Early indications suggest total advertising revenue will be down 10% in April.” Flybe certainly isn’t alone. Saga, the insurance and travel company for the over-50s, said this morning that it had seen an increase in holiday cancellations and a sharp drop in bookings in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Passenger bookings at its tour operations had been down 20% from a year earlier, but have slumped even more in recent weeks, it told shareholders. There are a range of actions the group can take to mitigate against weaker trading in the travel business, such as the cost efficiency actions already underway.” Flybe’s collapse is a blow to Northern Ireland’s economy -- at a time when Brexit uncertainty is also high. Brian Ambrose, chief executive of Belfast City Airport, hopes that rival airlines will step in to replace Flybe’s services. In a statement, he says: The airline was a significant economic driver for the region, carrying 1.6 million passengers to and from Belfast in 2019. “I am confident that these well-established routes, coupled with our city centre location and recent £15m investment in terminal facilities, will prove an attractive option to airlines. “Negotiations with a number of carriers are already underway. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, describes Flybe’s demise as “simply devastating news for Northern Ireland”, adding it will hurt its tourism sector. “The regional connectivity that Flybe offered was vitally important to tourism and our wider hospitality sector here, without it there will be a huge impact on visitor access. “The knock-on effect of fewer visitors and tourists means that this sounds alarm for our pubs, restaurants and hotels at a time when coronavirus is compounding the sector’s problems. The scene at Exeter Airport, Flybe’s base, is bleak this morning: We reported yesterday that London City Airport (one of Flybe’s destinations) was worryingly quiet, as the coronavirus scared customers away. My colleague Joanna Partridge spotted that there were as many (or as few) check-in staff as passengers: “The plane was half-empty,” said Andrew Ross, who works in construction in the Netherlands and flies from Amsterdam to London a few times each year. “I wouldn’t have expected it – it’s usually busier. But it was nice and quiet.” Just landed from Frankfurt, Kim Vaughan said there were fewer than 30 passengers on her flight. “It was a bigger plane, and it was almost completely empty,” Vaughan said. Jilles Visser, a Dutch electrician on a work trip from Rotterdam, thought his BA-operated flight was “very empty”. Other airlines are suffering from the same problems as Flybe, points out our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham: For now, the effects of Covid-19 on airlines echo the pattern among the human population: standstill in China, tolerated by the stronger carriers abroad, but potentially fatal to those less robust. And Flybe’s pre-existing conditions included an unusually onerous tax burden of air passenger duty affecting domestic flights, dampened demand alongside Brexit, and increased fuel and leasing costs from a falling pound. Its investors – a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic swooped in last year – had sensed a final opportunity after its share price had tanked; but by January they were begging the government, in vain, for assistance to stay alive. But other airlines – including Virgin itself – are more directly exposed than Flybe to the crisis, first cancelling major Chinese routes and then seeing the drop in demand “rippling through” the global networks, as the International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned this week. On Wednesday, Virgin announced emergency measures, including cutting executive pay, and urging other staff to take unpaid leave, after bookings halved in recent days. Ryanair and EasyJet have cancelled hundreds of flights to Italy, and other destinations, while IAG and BA have even cut transatlantic services. No airline, it appears, is immune – underlined by the sight of US airline executives meeting Donald Trump this week to discuss the impact in a country where domestic aviation is far bigger than international travel Associated Press points out that Brexit has also been a factor: Flybe has struggled with a series of issues, including the weakening of the pound in light of Britain’s pending departure from the European Union. The weaker pound hurts airlines like Flybe that have significant costs in dollars but take in revenue in pounds. The airline also was struggling to pay its airline passenger duty, a tax on flights that many airline groups have long complained restricts growth. There are two ways in which coronavirus scuppered Flybe’s prospects. 1) Scores of UK companies have been telling staff to work from home, or to cancel non-essential meetings. That undermines demand for Flybe’s routes to business centres such as London, Manchester, Paris, Hannover or Geneva. 2) Rising anxiety about catching Covid-19 is hurting holiday traffic. Flybe offered flights to Milan and Verona, for example -- but demand has slumped as Italy closes its schools for two months and bans crowds from football matches. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has said the government tried its best to save Flybe, but the impact of Covid-19 on its business was too great: “We really tried to do everything we could back at the turn of the year but unfortunately though, with the situation that’s developed with coronavirus, an already weak company just hasn’t been able to survive.” Alan Hudson of accountancy firm EY, who took control of Flybe overnight, says coronavirus put “added pressures” on the airline. But he also points to the other problems which dragged Flybe down -- including currency volatility (a weak pound pushes up fuel costs), and general economic uncertainty: “Despite an agreement with the Government to provide assistance to the Company, added pressures on the travel industry in the last few weeks have further deepened the severity of its financial situation. “Flybe had already been impacted by rising fuel costs, currency volatility, and market uncertainty.” The British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa) blamed Flybe’s owners and the government- not coronavirus - for Flybe’s failure. Flybe was owned by Connect Airways – a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and hedge fund Cyrus Capital. General secretary Brian Strutton blasted them, saying: “A year ago Flybe was taken over by new owners with promises of funding for a bright future. “Six weeks ago, when the ownership consortium lost confidence, the government promised a rescue package, apparently at that time recognising the value of Flybe to the regional economy of the UK. “Throughout, pilots, cabin crew and ground staff have done their jobs brilliantly, while behind the scenes the owners and, sadly, government connived to walk away. Flybe staff will feel disgusted at this betrayal and these broken promises.” Passengers booked with Flybe are being urged not to go to the airport this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Flybe, Europe’s largest regional airline, has collapsed into administration this morning as the economic damage caused by the ongoing coronavirus crisis escalated. The airline ceased trading in the early hours, as administrators took control of the Exeter-based group -- which operated services to regional airports across the country. Last-ditch crisis talks failed to secure a rescue package, in a devastating hit to the company’s 2,000 staff. It’s also a real blow to the passengers who relied on the company’s services -- leaving some stranded today -- and a stark illustration of the consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak. One source at the airline told the PA news agency that a drop in demand caused by the coronavirus “made a difficult situation worse” for Flybe. Flybe was already in trouble, of course. Back in January, it came extremely close to collapse before a rescue deal was announced. But it wasn’t able to secure a £100m government loan, forcing its demise. Flybe CEO Mark Anderson has told staff that the coronavirus has put additional pressure on the company, as it slipped over the brink into administration overnight: “It’s with enormous sadness and a deep feeling of sorrow that I share the upsetting news that Flybe is shortly being put into Administration. Despite every effort, we now have no alternative – having failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading.... Anderson said Flybe’s management tried to secure support from the government and key suppliers, but without success, adding: The coronavirus has impacted both our shareholders and ourselves and has put additional pressure on an already difficult situation. I am very sorry that we have not been able to secure the funding needed to continue to deliver our turnaround plan. Flybe’s collapse will send a shiver through the travel sector. Passenger numbers are down sharply on some routes, particularly to Italy where over 100 people have died of the coronavirus. We’ll be tracking reaction to Flybe’s collapse, and other economic consequences of the coronavirus, through the day.

With even war-torn Syria now signing the agreement, the leadership of every world country has announced its intent to tackle the existential threat posed by human-caused climate change, except the United States. While this decision may seem puzzling to the rest of the world, the explanation is simple - a study published two years ago found that the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world that rejects the need to tackle climate change, and we know that voters follow elite cues. In 2016, American voters made the terrible mistake of putting that party in charge of the entire federal government, including electing this man president: Most Americans admit the mistake of 2016 However, a year later, Americans are already recognizing this error. Trump’s approval rating is around 38%, and has not touched 40% in over six months. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats enjoy an 8–10% lead over their Republican opponents. Those polling results translated into a landslide Democratic victory in the 2017 elections last week. The clearest result came in Virginia’s gubernatorial election, in which Republican candidate Ed Gillespie ran a Trump-like culture war campaign. He also took the standard Trump administration line on climate change, acknowledging only that humans play some undetermined role while supporting America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accords and opposing all policies to address the problem. Gillespie’s campaign was praised by Trump and Steve Bannon, until he lost the race by 9%. Translating the shift to election wins will be difficult Last week’s election results showed that Trump has strongly mobilized Democrats to vote, even in off-year elections. In Virginia state House of Delegates elections, Democratic candidates similarly beat their Republican opponents by more than 9% in total votes. However, due to gerrymandering and geographical disadvantages (Democrats tend to cluster in cities), unless recounts change the results of close races, Democrats will only hold 49% of the seats in the Virginia House. That structural disadvantage holds across the country. Estimates are that Democrats need to beat Republicans by 7–8% in overall congressional votes in order to win a bare majority of the seats. With a current lead of 8–10% in the generic congressional ballot, they have a chance to take the House in 2018, depending on what happens over the next year. We saw that same structural advantage hand Trump the presidency in 2016. While he lost the popular vote by over 2% (nearly 3 million votes), Trump won the Electoral College, as was the case in 2000 with Bush v. Gore (Gore won the popular vote by a half million votes). America has a bizarrely unbalanced election system in which people who live in sparsely populated areas (predominantly rural Republicans) are disproportionately represented in the government. It will take a landslide election for Democrats to overcome that structural disadvantage, but last week’s results demonstrate that Trump and the Republican Party have become so unpopular, it very well might happen in the 2018 and 2020 elections. That would give Democrats the opportunity to undo Republican gerrymandering after the 2020 census. The Supreme Court is also currently considering a critical gerrymandering case. Regarding the presidency, betting markets currently give Trump approximately a 35–40% chance of winning a second term (which seems overly bullish), and Democrats a 55% chance of retaking the White House in 2020. If that happens, the next president can quickly begin reversing the damage the Trump administration has done to American climate policies and its standing in the world. America’s divide is on display at COP23 At the UN climate talks in Bonn, the ‘We Are Still In’ coalition of US states, cities, tribes, and businesses has been given a US Climate Action Center. Meanwhile, the US government for the first time doesn’t have a pavilion, and the Trump administration perversely plans to promote fossil fuels and nuclear power in a presentation at the meeting. As Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) noted, If you show up at a climate conference to talk about coal, you’re likely to be ignored. I think the We Are Still In delegation will get more attention than the executive branch. We’ve gone from the indispensable leader to being the only country not engaged in climate change. Many people in Congress are troubled not only from a climate standpoint but a geopolitical standpoint. China is happy to take that leadership from us. Indeed, China is stepping into the global leadership role that the United States has shrunk from under Trump’s “America First” platform. Chinese carbon pollution is approaching a peak 15–20 years ahead of schedule, and its leaders relish the opportunity to take America’s place as a global leader. America Last, for now Americans embrace the notion that their country is the greatest in the world. But what does it say that the United States is the nation that is responsible for the largest fraction of overall carbon pollution and global warming over the past 200 years, and is the only country in the world that refuses to take steps to address the existential threat we created? That lack of responsibility and willingness to protect the well-being of future generation is not the behavior of a great nation. However, that is almost exclusively a Republican Party position, and the party and its president are currently supported by fewer than 40% of Americans. Most of its leaders seem unwilling to reverse the party’s slide toward anti-climate culture wars-based isolationism, but with accelerating climate change and a growing population of non-whites, these are positions that will cost them elections. As we saw last week, the ‘Trump base’ is relatively small, and structural advantages won’t be enough to withstand landslide elections. America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement won’t take effect until the day after the 2020 elections. The next president can quickly reverse that withdrawal, making America the last country to sign on, but resuming its global leadership role. While the Trump administration has exceeded everyone’s fears in its anti-environment, anti-climate actions, the damage is temporary. While the American majority fights to wrest control of its government away from the isolationist climate-denying minority, the rest of the world (literally) is moving forward to tackle this problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/25/challenges-merkel-faces-as-she-starts-fourth-term-as-german-chancellor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T04:00:03Z","webTitle":"Challenges Merkel faces as she starts fourth term as German chancellor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/challenges-merkel-faces-as-she-starts-fourth-term-as-german-chancellor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/25/challenges-merkel-faces-as-she-starts-fourth-term-as-german-chancellor","fields":{"headline":"Challenges Merkel faces as she starts fourth term as German chancellor","bodyText":"In what will be her fourth and likely final term in office as German chancellor, Angela Merkel is unlikely to get complacent about the tasks ahead. She has told confidantes she would like to step off the treadmill of power at a time of her choosing, but it would not be in her nature to leave mid-term – unless, she has herself said, her health became an issue. Neither would it be characteristic of her to leave any major loose ends undone. But the challenges she faces are considerable and weighty. While Germany is enjoying something of a golden age in economic terms, there are plenty of signs of trouble ahead, from challenges in the ailing steel industry, which employs thousands of workers, to the diesel crisis and calls for the abolition of the combustion engine, which needs her leadership to ensure it doesn’t do lasting damage to the German car industry on which around 800,000 jobs are dependent. Merkel is also aware that Germany needs to make huge strides in improving its digitalisation performance, with many indications that it is lagging behind other international players. The country’s economic robustness is also likely to be hit by a looming demographic crisis which over the next few years will see baby boomers go into retirement, and whilst the country’s chronically low birth rate has recovered somewhat in recent years, it has occurred far too late to manage the shortfall. While the hundreds of thousands of refugees Germany has taken in are often viewed as being a partial solution to the demographic crisis, the challenges of integrating and assimilating them into German society and the workplace remain immense and will require more guidance and fine-tuning - both financial and legislative - from central government if Merkel does not want her legacy to be that her open door policy was her biggest failure. She will have to address the pressing demands for reform of German immigration policy to ensure a more controlled flow of skilled and semi-skilled workers, as well as investing more in training and education at home, in recognition of the fact that it is very hard to get skilled workers to move to Germany. A reform of the pensions system will also be imperative. Merkel’s recent insistence that she wants to stick to the rule of retirement at 63 is out of sync with many of her political allies and economic advisers, who have called it highly unrealistic. Environmentally she faces a backlash over her support for lignite - a form of coal - and for the car industry despite its grave errors and the deeply corrupt behaviour it has displayed over diesel emissions. And she may well be forced to face the fact that her knee jerk reaction to Fukushima which led to her announcing Germany would abandon nuclear power, was overly hasty. On defence, Merkel will be forced to address demands from Nato and the US that it doubles its defence budget, at the same time as appeasing the generally pacifist outlook of the German voter. But as the German military plays an increasingly important role in places like Africa and the Middle East, coupled with increased costs due to technological developments, she will have little choice but to fight for a bigger defence budget. The crises in Ukraine, Turkey - with whom she has a delicate deal over refugees - and over North Korea will see her continued deep involvement in major foreign policy issues. Donald Trump’s isolationism, Russian belligerence and international terrorism will all keep her busy. And with the EU increasingly being run through Berlin rather than Brussels, she will play a central role in the Brexit negotiations, with everything indicating that she will continue to take a tough line over anything that appears concessionary towards Britain. With France’s president Emmanuel Macron, she will also have to work closely on EU reform including working towards the introduction of a European Monetary Fund. If her partnership with Macron falters and his presidency fails, Berlin is well aware, it could trigger the election of the far right in France. While Merkel has said she rejects as “grotesque and absurd” the label placed on her of the “new leader of the free world” following Trump’s election as US president, she is well aware of the expectations on her by the German electorate as well as her counterparts in many parts of the world, to continue to ensure Germany acts as an anchor of stability. This is why she has offered to act as a negotiator between North Korea and the United States, but this is a role which Germany will only continue to play if in turn it remains economically stable. Merkel will face a tougher period in office than in any of her previous three terms due to the presence in the Bundestag of far-right populist party Alternative für Deutschland, which will have a significant number of seats (between 60 and 85), and which has pledged to shake up the debating culture which it has described as far too consensual and boring. And she will be forced to pay attention to an issue she has completely neglected over the past 12 years – that of finding a successor. After 12 years in the post, and with her on course to equal or beat Helmut Kohl’s record of 16 years in office, many Germans find it hard to contemplate anyone else in the driving seat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/11/hinkley-point-c-case-against-cgn-has-the-feel-of-a-modern-spy-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T18:33:12Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: case against Chinese firm has the feel of a modern spy thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/hinkley-point-c-case-against-cgn-has-the-feel-of-a-modern-spy-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/hinkley-point-c-case-against-cgn-has-the-feel-of-a-modern-spy-thriller","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: case against Chinese firm has the feel of a modern spy thriller","bodyText":"A network of agents, payments from a Beijing-backed slush fund and a series of illicit transfers of highly sensitive nuclear knowhow: the case against Britain’s Chinese partner in the controversial Hinckley Point C project could have leapt from the pages of a modern spy thriller. According to the US Department of Justice, the FBI has discovered evidence that China General Nuclear Power (CGN) has been engaged in a conspiracy to steal US nuclear secrets stretching back almost two decades. Both CGN and one of the corporation’s senior advisers, Szuhsiung Ho, have been charged with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material in a manner that is in clear breach of US law. Ho, who is alleged to have boasted that “budget is no issue” while developing his network of co-conspirators, has also been charged with acting unlawfully as a foreign agent. His legal team argues that there is far less to this affair than meets the eye. It says he is an innocent, 66-year-old Chinese American known to most of his friends and neighbours as Allen Ho, who has been openly engaged in commercial activity involving non-classified information. Now, it says, overzealous prosecutors are turning his life upside down. The lawyers also say that Ho could not possibly have known about the clauses in the US Atomic Energy Act that he is alleged to have breached, because no one has previously been charged under them in the 60-odd years they have been on the statute. His lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, says it is unclear to him whether any crime has actually been committed. Ho’s legal team, however, has a number of hurdles to overcome. The first is that one of his alleged agents, Ching Ning Guey, a senior manager with the Tennessee Valley Authority’s nuclear programme, has already pleaded guilty to unlawfully developing special nuclear material outside the US without government authority. The guilty plea was sealed for more than a year, until Ho was arrested in Atlanta earlier this year, and both he and CGN were charged. Another is that among the many emails the FBI has gathered and used to build a case against Ho is one in which he allegedly describes a $15,555 (£12,000) payment made to Guey as coming from “his company’s slush fund”. CGN, Ho, and a company he owns called Energy Technology International, all face a charge that they “did conspire with each other and with others known and unknown to wilfully and knowingly engage and participate … in the development and production of special nuclear material outside of the United States, namely, in the People’s Republic of China”. According to sections 2077(b) and 2272(a) of the Atomic Energy Act, this can be done only with the permission of the US energy secretary. Ho faces a possible life sentence if convicted. The offence is also punishable by a $250,000 fine. There has been no immediate comment from CGN. According to the indictment, Ho’s efforts began in 1997 and only came to an end with his arrest in April. He is alleged to have been attempting to provide technical assistance for CGN’s small modular reactor programme, advanced fuel assembly programme, in-core detector systems and various nuclear-related computer codes. Operating from a large colonial-style mansion in the suburbs of Wilmington, Delaware, where he lives with his wife, Anne, Ho is alleged to have recruited Guey and five other nuclear specialists. Identified in the indictment as “US Persons 2 to 6”, they are all nuclear engineers or mechanical engineers working in the nuclear industry, and living in Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Colorado. He is said to have made a series of payments in exchange for reports that the six individuals submitted. Some of them were also paid for answering a series of questions submitted by CGN employees, and Guey and “Persons 5 and 6” are alleged to have travelled to China to give presentations. Guey is said to have received his $15,555 payment in a cheque sent to an address in Chattanooga, and “Person 6” is said to have received $22,698 for consulting services and travel expenses. Ho was born in Taiwan and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1971. Two years later he travelled to the US to take a master’s degree at the University of California, and married Anne the following year. He completed a PhD in nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois in 1980. The couple are naturalised US citizens. When Ho appeared in court in Knoxville, Tennessee, in April, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that prosecutors alleged he had channelled about $3m from a Chinese bank to various banks in the US. They also said that when arrested he was in possession of an encrypted Chinese bank card. Ho is also said to have a second wife and a nine-year-old son in China. The assistant US attorney Charles Atchley Jr was quoted as saying: “This man is not living in the US. He may be a US citizen, but he lives in China. His family is in China.” Zeidenberg insists that his client lives in Delaware, and on Tuesday he will ask the court in Knoxville to grant him bail, allowing him to live in the house with an electronic ankle tag. In November, in an article in the Washington Post, Zeidenberg wrote that he believed innocent Chinese Americans were being victimised by prosecutors swept up by an atmosphere of paranoia about the dangers of cyber-attacks and industrial espionage directed by Beijing. Two of his clients had been charged with illicitly handing over technical secrets, only for the charges to be dropped or dismissed, but by then their private and professional lives had been severely damaged. “While the danger posed by Chinese agents may indeed be real, so is the danger of overreacting to it,” he wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/17/shut-old-nuclear-reactors-says-unprecedented-alliance-of-eu-cities","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-17T15:16:07Z","webTitle":"Shut old nuclear reactors, says unprecedented alliance of EU cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/17/shut-old-nuclear-reactors-says-unprecedented-alliance-of-eu-cities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/17/shut-old-nuclear-reactors-says-unprecedented-alliance-of-eu-cities","fields":{"headline":"Shut old nuclear reactors, says unprecedented alliance of EU cities","bodyText":"An unprecedented alliance of 30 major cities and districts from three countries has joined forces to try to shut down two ageing Belgian nuclear reactors close to their borders. Cologne and Dusseldorf in Germany, Luxembourg City and Maastricht in the Netherlands are among the cities co-funding a lawsuit to close one reactor – Tihange 2 – and calling on the European commission to prepare a separate case at the European court of justice. “More than 30 districts have adopted resolutions to support us, and want to join the lawsuit,” said Helmut Echtenberg, the mayor of Germany’s Greater Aachen region, who is leading the campaign. Only one plaintiff may appear in court, “but we will ensure that Tihange 2 is no longer connected to the grid in the future,“ Echtenberg said. “This is my honest conviction.” Around 60% of Belgium’s electricity comes from seven reactors in the country’s Tihange and Doel plants. Two of the reactors – Tihange 2 and Doel 3 - reopened in December after a repair process that lasted 21 months. But Doel 3 on the Dutch border had to be shut down again one week later. The 40-year old reactors have been plagued by a litany of problems such as reactor pressure vessel micro-cracks, fire and one mysterious case of sabotage. These have sparked what Echtenberg calls “existential fear” in Aachen, which lies 60km upwind of the plant. Anxiety is rife that house prices and business activity could soon suffer. Anti-nuclear posters festoon the shops in Aachen town centre, stickers adorn car windows and stories about Tihange are regularly splashed across local papers. Hartmut Falter, the owner of Aachen’s oldest bookstore, Die Mayersche, has put up a 10m x 3m anti-nuclear poster in his storefront. “The risk of a nuclear accident is not very high but if it happened, the damage would be extreme,” he told the Guardian. “Unfortunately, nuclear dangers do not stop at the frontier.” “So far the situation has not had an economic impact on the region but it definitely could,” he added. As a groundswell of opposition gathers force, Echtenberg says he will not rule out mass protests at the Belgian border. “If our lawsuit is rejected, that might happen because then the political will would clearly need to be articulated,” he told the Guardian. “Once [the people of] Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany and the NGOs all say this is just not safe, it will of course have an impact on the Belgian state.” For Germans to be exposed to nuclear risks after shuttering their more modern plants because of the Fukushima disaster was an “absolute irony of history”, he added. Last week, it was announced that France’s oldest reactor in Fessenheim, on the German border, would close after complaints by Germany and Switzerland. Lawyers are already working on a second nuclear lawsuit, which may be filed in Belgium by the Dutch city of Maastricht. The regional governments of North Rhine Westphalia and Rhineland Palatinate are taking separate cases against the reactors to the UN and European commission. Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, is said to be a supporter of the campaign and may add heft to its call for the release of allegedly missing documents authorising the reopening of the two reactors. The debate about their safety revolves around the thousands of micro-cracks or hydrogen flakes – measured at up to 18cm long – that were found in reactor pressure vessels at Tihange 2 and Doel 3. The plant’s operator, Electrabel, blames the damage on the vessels’ original design and the relatively unsophisticated visual testing of that time. Anne-Sophie Huge, a spokeswoman for Electrabel said: “In the 1980’s the tests were internationally acceptable but the technology has evolved since then. There are no reasons to be afraid. Our power plants are some of the most safe and secure nuclear power plants in Europe.” Environmentalists and anti-nuclear academics counter that the original tests used ultrasonic technology which would have detected the defects, unless they emerged and grew bigger later. “It is not comprehensible that a less sensitive ultrasonic technique should not detect large flaws,” wrote Ilse Tweer, a former adviser to the Austrian government. “The reverse observation has to be expected.” Jean van Vyve, Electrabel’s project director for reactor pressure vessels, said that the original ultrasonic tests were done manually and that, while some flaws may have been seen, they would have fallen within “perfectly acceptable” limits. “We may regret that there was not a detailed report but at that time, 40 years ago, there was no recording,” he said. “It was purely manually done.” In the Tihange 4 pub opposite the reactor site, Sebastian De Proot, a 24-year-old barman, was sanguine about any potential risks. “It is not very dangerous here,” he says. “They stop the plant whenever someone gets even a little injury so I think we are safe. It’s not like Fukushima.” Industry advocates often point out that nuclear power emits less CO2 than coal – a possible substitute fuel if Tihange 2 is shut. Coal also has damaging cross-border health impacts of its own. De Proot said he agreed with the anti-nuclear case but: “the plant is the only thing for people here. If it closed there would be a lot of trauma. Unemployment in Belgium is very high.” Not all local people agree. In the nearby town of Huy, Marie Duschen, a 19-year-old student said: “The plants should be closed down because they are dangerous. I have friends working in Tihange. They are afraid that an accident may happen.” Such sentiments are music to the ears of German anti-nuclear activists who worry that they could revive ghosts of history if they are perceived to be dictating energy policy to their neighbours. “I do not have the right to demand that a Belgian produces energy my way but there is a real threat from these two reactors and I do have the right to protect my health,” said Jorg Schellenberg, a key activist in the Aachen coalition for action against nuclear power. The group is trying to reach out to Belgian activists and the next of a rolling series of regional protests will take place in Liege on 17 April. But the heartland of the new anti-nuclear movement is clearly in Aachen where the Tihange reactor “is discussed in every family and political group,” according to the town’s local mayor, Marcel Philipp. “It is a defining issue,” he said. More than half a million people live in the greater Aachen district and Jorg Schellenberg, a leading anti-nuclear activist, says that Echtenberg’s tough anti-nuclear stance has been a vote winner. “It is very strange that the Greens are part of the North Rhine Westphalia government but they have done nothing against these reactors while a conservative is leading the fight against them,“ he said. “There will be elections next year and I think the Greens will be punished.” Echtenberg is an unlikely rebel, a career politician in Angela Merkel’s CDU who has been pushed to the forefront of the new anti-nuclear movement by popular anger. Merkel’s silence on the issue so far had been “disappointing”, if understandable in light of the refugee crisis, he told the Guardian. “We would have a further refugee problem if there was an accident,” he said. “Then we would all be refugees.” In a worst case scenario, Germans would only hear of of a nuclear accident in Tihange after a circuitous phone chain. Electrabel would call the Belgian government, who would contact officials in Berlin, who should alert the government in North Rhine Westphalia, which would then call Aachen. Social media or text messages could speed that process, but some local physicians question what would happen next. Public health plans in Aachen do not go far beyond the distribution of 130mg iodine pills, to protect against thyroid cancer. “For the time being, there are no concrete plans for evacuation,” Echtenberg said. Advice that citizens should stay indoors and await instructions from the authorities would probably not be followed. North Rhine Westphalia’s interior ministry is drawing up contingency plans after being pushed by Aachen’s mayors, but these will not happen overnight. Philipp said that he had a blueprint ready to act on but that the limited options in the case of an emergency still gave him sleepless nights. “In a situation where everyone is leaving the city and there is a nuclear rain over Aachen, you cannot do anything that would help,” he said. “It is a really big problem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/21/copeland-byelection-corbyn-proving-barrier-in-sellafield-seat","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-21T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Copeland byelection: Corbyn proving 'barrier' in Sellafield seat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/21/copeland-byelection-corbyn-proving-barrier-in-sellafield-seat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/21/copeland-byelection-corbyn-proving-barrier-in-sellafield-seat","fields":{"headline":"Copeland byelection: Corbyn proving 'barrier' in Sellafield seat","bodyText":"Even the most committed Labour campaigners in the once safe seat of Copeland admit there is one topic of conversation that comes up more often than most: the leader. “Corbyn is a real barrier. Comes up every fifth or sixth contact I’ve made,” said one downcast Labour canvasser after rapping on doors in west Cumbria ahead of next Thursday’s byelection. “Those who voted Labour in the general election in 2015 who mention Corbyn in the main aren’t voting at all.” This is a worry, given the slim 2,564 majority bequeathed the party by Jamie Reed, an outspoken Corbyn critic who quit to take a job at the local Sellafield nuclear decommissioning plant, saying he could do more good for the community there than in Westminster. “I’ve voted Labour all my life but I can’t see myself doing so this time,” said Andrew Morgan, 48, who has worked at Sellafield since he was 16. “I just don’t think Jeremy Corbyn is the right person to lead the party and I don’t think he will ever get the party into government.” Labour’s big problem is whether voters in Copeland believe Corbyn supports nuclear power. The party leader has insisted he was right behind Sellafield, the nuclear decommissioning site that is the constituency’s biggest employer, as well as Moorside, a multibillion-pound nuclear power plant which the government insists will be built next door despite huge financial problems engulfing the major backer, Toshiba. But there are doubts. An avalanche of leaflets from the Conservative party reminds voters of a speech Corbyn gave in 2011, in which he declared through a megaphone: “I say NO nuclear power, decommission the stations we’ve got.” If Labour wins, all sides privately agree it will be largely down to Tory-backed plans to downgrade the maternity unit at the new West Cumberland hospital, which only opened in October 2015. “I’m not a betting man, but if it weren’t for that hospital I’d bet on us winning it,” said one Tory MP, who has been on the stump in Copeland. The Labour canvasser concurred: “The hospital issue has real cut-through,” he said. Though the Labour vote has not totally collapsed, the party should worry that it can no longer rely on voting habits being passed down the genepool in heartlands such as Copeland, which has been Labour for more than 80 years. “The younger generation aren’t sticking with Labour. They’ve never experienced extreme poverty,” said a 78-year-old former shop assistant in a cafe in Cleator Moor, a working class village where the Labour campaign has its headquarters. Like many standing by Labour, she said she was doing so with no particular passion but simply because her family had a long history of voting red. Labour can also expect to lose some votes to the Liberal Democrats. Some 38% of the constituency voted to remain in the EU in last year’s referendum and Tim Farron’s party has been most vocal in opposing Brexit. Louise Robson, who runs an electrical shop in Whitehaven town centre, said she would face a real dilemma in the polling booth next Thursday, deciding between Tory and Labour. “Most of the family relies on Sellafield and Jeremy Corbyn is definitely anti-nuclear. But I have daughters who want babies so we need a proper maternity unit,” she said. “All four of my children were born at West Cumberland. If you need an emergency c-section you don’t want to be put in an ambulance to travel 40 miles to Carlisle.” The Conservative candidate, Trudy Harrison, a regeneration officer who only joined the party last year, is in a bit of a bind. She too gave birth to four children at the hospital and opposes plans to downgrade the maternity unit. But she cannot pledge to reverse them, only to promise a government-backed review of recruitment problems facing the constituency’s three hospitals. Labour is so keen to campaign on the single issue of the NHS that it has severely limited media access to its candidate, Gillian Troughton, a local councillor and volunteer ambulance driver who trained as a doctor several decades ago but gave up her medical career to raise two children. Last week, she made an appearance on Channel 4 news stonewalling political reporter Michael Crick when he ambushed her outside her office, having failed to secure an interview in the conventional way. After much wrangling, the Guardian was granted 11 minutes with her in the Morrisons cafe in Whitehaven, in which she turned almost every question into a treatise about how the Tories could not be trusted with the NHS. Five times she said: “I am not going to give the Tories a green light to strip away our NHS services.” Asked if it was not a problem that her party leader had been an outspoken opponent of the industry which pays the mortgages of thousands of her prospective constituents, she said: “What is important is that Labour will campaign to make sure we get investment in this area in the infrastructure we need, both at Sellafield and the new build at Moorside. In me they can see they have a local advocate who is 100% behind the NH [sic] … the nuclear industry, no ifs, no buts.” Reminded that before being selected as Labour’s candidate she had not only voted for Owen Smith as leader but also retweeted articles such as “Corbyn’s past will destroy Labour’s future” and “Jeremy Corbyn literally makes no sense”, she said it was all part of living in a democracy. “We are a democratic party and everyone has a vote and Jeremy is the leader,” she said. “This election is not about leadership of the party, it’s about investment in west Cumbria – or lack of investment by the Tories.” No politician who visits Copeland can leave unaware of the severe infrastructure problems facing the constituency, whether they’ve struggled to get a mobile phone signal or on the internet, or come overnight to find the A66 main access road still closed while repairs from flooding more than a year ago are carried out. On Whitehaven’s Woodhouse estate, which is among the most deprived wards in the county, mechanic Russell Burns said he thought Labour would lose the byelection “because Jeremy Corbyn isn’t strong enough”. He said he was switching to Ukip, adding: “I think they’ve got better ideas.” He said: “We seem to be forgotten about up here, anywhere north of Liverpool or Manchester. Everybody seems to forget we exist. And what have we got here? All people know is Sellafield and Derrick Bird [a local taxi driver who killed 12 people in a gun rampage in 2010].” He is voting for Fiona Mills, an NHS accountant (“Not a bean counter!” she tells prospective voters) who believes she has made headway in Woodhouse, as well as other former Labour strongholds. “We are taking more votes from Labour than the Conservatives,” she insisted. But with party resources concentrated further south on getting the Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, elected in Stoke, she is up against a Tory party which has deployed everyone from the prime minister down to join its campaign. Though publicly Labour insists it can hold Copeland, behind the scenes senior figures are more pessimistic and fear a narrow Conservative victory – the first time a party in power would win a byelection since the Tories took Mitcham and Morden, London, in 1982. “The big story is that a totally fucked NHS can’t and won’t save Labour,” said one who is well plugged into the byelection campaign. “That should be put in neon lights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/mar/17/french-government-edf-united-front-hinkley-point-money-nuclear-plant-union","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-17T19:26:54Z","webTitle":"France agrees bailout for EDF to proceed with Hinkley Point C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/french-government-edf-united-front-hinkley-point-money-nuclear-plant-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/french-government-edf-united-front-hinkley-point-money-nuclear-plant-union","fields":{"headline":"France agrees bailout for EDF to proceed with Hinkley Point C","bodyText":"The French government has promised a financial bailout for cash-strapped energy group EDF so that it can proceed with the £18bn plan to build the first nuclear reactors in Britain for 20 years. France’s economics minister, Emmanuel Macron, said it would be a mistake for the 85% state-owned company not to build a new Hinkley Point C power plant in Somerset and he would ensure it happened. “If there is a need to recapitalise (EDF), we will,” he said during a visit to a nuclear power station at Civaux in midwestern France. “If there needs to be a further waiver of dividends (from EDF to government), we will.” Flanked by Jean-Bernard Lévy, the EDF chief executive under fire from French unions and his own former finance director, Macron added: “If you believe in nuclear, you cannot say that you will not participate in the biggest nuclear project in the world. Not doing Hinkley Point would be a mistake.” The promise of aid will infuriate British anti-nuclear campaigners but bring relief to the British government, which has billed Hinkley as a vital part of its move to a lower-carbon and secure energy system. Lévy raised the pressure on the French government last week by writing to EDF staff promising not to build the reactors in Britain unless he received more state help to ease the group’s creaking balance sheet. The government had already promised to take more shares in EDF, rather than cash payments, for a short time but is now indicating it could stretch this out further as Lévy wants. There is also speculation the government is willing to use the state bank CDC as a buyer for a half share in EDF’s power transmission operation, another way of helping the energy group. The minister’s public support for EDF came as the French CGT union repeated its calls for him to shelve the £18bn Somerset scheme, which it fears will lead to more job losses in France. “It will jeopardise the company. We are not saying don’t do it but it must be delayed. It’s too premature,” a spokesman for the union, Sébastien Menesplier, told Reuters as CGT members jeered Macron at Civaux. The union, which has seats on the EDF board, has said for some time that the energy group cannot afford to proceed with the plants in Britain until EDF finances are strengthened. The CGT’s hand was bolstered by the resignation last week of EDF’s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, who had put similar arguments to Lévy. Macron and the French government have always been supportive of EDF’s Hinkley plans. They see the project as an important opportunity to market the country’s new European pressurised reactor (EPR) design and support local engineering jobs. There have also been reports that state-owned bank CDC might even be asked to take a minority stake in Hinkley. The project is meant to be financed two-thirds by EDF and one-third by Chinese partners. The scheme is ultimately to be funded by British energy consumers under a controversial and generous subsidy arrangement agreed with the Treasury. Many in the City have said the scheme does not make financial sense for Britain – or for EDF. One analyst last week called the plan “insane”. Hinkley will rise to the top of the British political agenda next week with confirmation that Vincent de Rivaz, boss of EDF’s UK arm, will be forced to answer critics of the nuclear project at a parliamentary committee meeting. The energy and climate change committee has called EDF, and other energy companies planning to build reactors in the UK, to give evidence on the future of the nuclear industry on Wednesday. Angus MacNeil MP, who chairs the committee, said: “The government is counting on new nuclear to supply a significant proportion of the UK’s demand for low-carbon baseload power in future. “The focus right now is on Hinkley Point C but there are other important projects in the pipeline. Serious questions are being raised about the cost and viability of the Hinkley project and the value for money for taxpayers.” There has been widespread criticism of the generous subsidy arrangement agreed between the Treasury and EDF. Some analysts in the City of London have criticised the Hinkley project because the company has been promised a subsidy level – ultimately paid for through bills to energy consumers – that is double the current cost of wholesale electricity. The government insists it is a good deal because the future price of power will rise and many existing coal, nuclear and even gas plants are closing down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/29/government-seeks-to-reassure-investors-as-hinkley-point-delayed","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-30T13:44:15Z","webTitle":"Government seeks to reassure investors as Hinkley Point C delayed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/government-seeks-to-reassure-investors-as-hinkley-point-delayed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/government-seeks-to-reassure-investors-as-hinkley-point-delayed","fields":{"headline":"Government seeks to reassure investors as Hinkley Point C delayed","bodyText":"The British government has tried to reassure France and China that plans for a controversial new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point C are still on the table, despite ordering an unexpected review into the £18bn project. The companies behind the initiative, EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), were shocked when the UK refused to give immediate approval for the nuclear plant, which has been dogged by concerns about its cost and safety. The government intervened just two hours after French energy company EDF announced its board had approved construction of Hinkley Point C. However, the UK prime minister, Theresa May, is understood to have discussed her plans to reassess the £18bn project with François Hollande, the French president, during a phone call on Wednesday. Sources said French officials were satisfied with the UK taking a final decision in the autumn. However, officials close to the Chinese consortium said they were “bemused at the turn of the events”. Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, also met with the chief executives of both companies on Friday to try to reassure them that the government’s energy policy had not changed. A senior Whitehall source said: “There is a new prime minister and a new government with a major decision in the in-tray.” The source said it was not unreasonable for them to want time to assess a complicated deal that has taken years to develop. However, there are understood to be new concerns within the government about the involvement of the Chinese state-backed CGN in the project. May’s joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, criticised the project last year and warned the government was “selling our national security to China”. Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website in October 2015 that it was “baffling” that the government was allowing Chinese state firms to invest in sensitive infrastructure and that “rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment”. He claimed security experts were worried the Chinese could build weaknesses into computer systems that would allow them to “shut down Britain’s energy production at will”. Timothy’s views are in stark contrast to the approach adopted by the former chancellor, George Osborne, who courted investment from China in what was dubbed his “silk road” policy. Government sources played down the importance of Timothy’s comments on Friday. Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Conservative MP whose constituency includes Hinkley Point, added: “I am 100% sure this is going to happen, I am 100% sure it is going to be signed, and 100% sure that we will build it on time on budget. “Knowing Theresa May, she is a formidable lady who makes up her own mind. When you send her things she questions it, and it is always her who responds. That is how she ticks.” EDF and CGN, which holds a 33% stake in the power plant, were preparing to sign the contracts to start the project on Friday and had to cancel a celebratory lunch for 150 VIPs. However, Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chief executive of EDF, said on Friday he had no doubt about the British government’s support for the £18bn project. “There is no comment to make. The statement made by Mr Clark is perfectly clear,” he said. “I have no doubt about the support of the British government led by Mrs May.” Nonetheless, Levy confirmed he had not been warned about the government’s review and only found out when he saw the announcement on the internet. EDF’s chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said in a open letter to staff the company was “ready” to start building as soon as the government gave the go-ahead, the BBC reported. De Rivaz said: “The new prime minister has been in post for just 16 days. Her full cabinet has been in post even fewer. “We can understand their need to take a little time. We fully respect the prime minister’s method.” He added: “The very good news is that we are ready. The board’s decision means that when the government is ready to go ahead, we are ready, too.” The Guardian understands that May discussed the Hinkley Point deal at dinner with Hollande last week, in one of her first overseas visits as prime minister. While Cameron and Osborne had been waiting for EDF to give the green light to the project, May indicated that the final decision would be for the UK government, with one insider suggesting that September was talked about as a date for that decision. Given that EDF failed to finalise the Hinkley Point deal under the leadership of David Cameron despite being urged to do so, officials believe it should not be surprised that a new government wants to proceed with caution. They claim final approval was always expected to be in the autumn until EDF announced last week it would hold a board meeting on Thursday. One energy expert with knowledge of the deal, who previously worked in Whitehall when May was home secretary, agreed that she was not the sort of politician who would sign something off without understanding the detail. “She’s not a knee-jerk politician. She takes her time. She likes evidence based policy.” He said that contrasted with Osborne, who was willing to agree to Hinkley at an even higher price. Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy secretary, said the government was in chaos and the new review “sends the most appalling message out to investors”. He told the Guardian: “The government says we are open for business but it says to investors ‘we will dally with you for 10 years, we will give an indicative contract, and then after a final decision, we will pull the plug and say we will take another three months’.” Gardiner said Labour had warned about the project – which could eventually cost taxpayers £30bn – for years. However, he claimed that announcing the review so late risked damaging Britain’s relationship with France just as negotiations about Brexit begin. “This is not a time to be making enemies, and particularly not of the French,” he added. Trade union leaders called the decision “bewildering and bonkers”. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary for energy, said: “After years of procrastination, what is required is decisive action not dithering and more delay. This unnecessary hesitation is putting finance for the project in doubt and 25,000 new jobs at risk immediately after Brexit. It is a gross error of judgment and must be reversed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-is-no-answer-to-britains-energy-needs","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T18:57:52Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C is no answer to Britain’s energy needs | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-is-no-answer-to-britains-energy-needs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-is-no-answer-to-britains-energy-needs","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C is no answer to Britain’s energy needs","bodyText":"So Theresa May has favourably reviewed the case for Hinkley Point (Report, 15 September). Put out the bunting, Britain will have its first new reactor for 20 years. We can assume therefore that our prime minister has completely satisfied herself that the unproven EPR nuclear technology for Hinkley is viable, deliverable and cost effective. Evidence from Finland (Olkiluoto), France (Flamanville) and China (Taishan, twice) has shown the EPR to be unviable, way overdue for delivery and way over budget. Oh, and EDF is on the verge of financial insolvency. If this is the PM’s attention to detail, happy days. Nigel Bruen Martley, Worcestershire • Damian Carrington (A risky solution from the 20th century, 15 September) states that, according to the government’s own research, energy efficiency could deliver six Hinkleys’ worth of electricity by 2030. Achieving this would require a fundamental alteration to established policy, in favour of greater energy efficiency rather than subsidising endless new supplies of fuel. Even so, you may care to note that since 2010 annual electricity consumption has already fallen by 25 terawatt-hours, coincidentally the amount of electricity we might realistically expect Hinkley C to be producing when/if it is finally built. Andrew Warren Chairman, British Energy Efficiency Federation • How many domestic solar arrays would the £18bn that Hinkley may currently cost provide? At £6-7,000 for the average house, it would be quite a few. And they can be fitted and working from now on instead of having to wait until 2026. This would give the solar industry a much needed boost and easily match the 25,000 jobs that Hinkley might create. The government could also insist that every newbuild house is fitted with solar (and, possibly, electricity storage units), the cost of which would soon be recouped by lower electricity bills. Of course, feed-in tariff subsidy payments would have to be forfeited, but it would show a government intent on tackling climate change with clean renewables – without the added cost and danger of nuclear waste and the prospect of higher bills that French and Chinese nuclear will bring. Rob Parrish Starcross, Devon • After the foolishness of grammar schools, our new prime minister’s idea of a great deal is to give us foolishness multiplied. But even worse, if that’s possible, is the blindness of Labour’s approving anointment. Where Theresa May’s decision is all about the politics of keeping China onside, Barry Gardiner’s is all about the politics of keeping (some) jobs. Neither approach has anything to do with what might actually produce the cheapest, cleanest electricity, and of course provide thousands of jobs in sensible, safe industries. So repeat after me, and the nuclear engineer who Damian Carrington quotes: “Hinkley Point is unconstructable.” Simon Barley Bradwell, Derbyshire • Paul Kenny, former general secretary of the GMB union, has said: “The UK government can no longer outsource the building of our power stations to foreign governments. The UK built the first generation of nuclear power stations so we can build the new generation we need for low carbon reliable base load electricity.” Hinkley C is a big mistake. Our fleet of advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) has given excellent service, with the one at Heysham the world’s longest-serving civil power station. AGRs produce electricity at a much lower price than the strike price negotiated for Hinkley C; they are of British design and were built by British contractors. A reactor of the same design as Hinkley C being built in Finland is nine years behind schedule and 5.2bn euro over budget, while another at Flamanville in France is six years late and 7.2bn euro over budget. AGRs could be built much faster: for example, Torness power station took only eight years. John David Simnett Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear • Britain has been blessed with an island geography and advanced industrial history which together now offer great opportunities for developing tidal and wave energy (as on Shetland). These are safer, cleaner and more sustainable than nuclear, predictable for centuries ahead, and cheaper than Hinkley Point, plus offering potential applications and economic benefits worldwide. Elsa Woodward High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire • So we are to build this monstrosity. Where was the referendum on this? It seems ironic that we are judged sufficiently mature to decide on whether or not we leave Europe but not given the opportunity to vote on an issue that has the potential to wipe us all out.

MPs and peers are applying pressure for the government to get behind the tidal power project, saying it is an essential “plan B” to ensure energy security. The Conservatives committed to the Swansea Bay tidal project in their Welsh election manifesto, but there are strong signs that government backing for the scheme is cooling due to the level of subsidies it would need. After it emerged there was still no legally binding contract for EDF and its Chinese partners to invest in Hinkley Point, Lynne Featherstone, a peer and former coalition minister, claimed the tidal scheme would last for longer than a nuclear station and ensure security of supply. She told the House of Lords: “The finance director of EDF has quit; the value of EDF shares is falling; and EDF does not have a legally binding contract with the Chinese. “If it does not proceed with Hinkley Point, what is the government’s plan B for the security of our energy supply in future years, given that the support for renewables industries has been completely undermined by the government and that there is still no commitment to the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon, which would provide energy for 120 years – three times as long as would a nuclear power station?” David Jones, a Tory former cabinet minister, also called for the tidal scheme to go ahead, saying: “Nuclear projects are finite and have potential unforeseen consequences in terms of disposal of waste, [but] tidal lagoons provide a clean source of power that, built on a Victorian scale, will last for many decades if not centuries.” Another Welsh Tory MP, Byron Davies, said the lagoon “has the potential to produce energy that is cheaper than even nuclear and gas”, while the Labour MP Paul Flynn said tidal energy was “free, British and of immense power, whereas the source of energy for Hinkley Point is an imported form of fuel that will leave a legacy for all time”. The government has been in negotiations about possibly giving the Swansea Bay tidal project a guaranteed price for electricity, like the Hinkley Point nuclear project. However, the future of the plan to generate electricity from a lagoon in Swansea Bay was thrown into doubt last month when the government unveiled plans for a six-month review of the wider tidal power sector. Sources in the Department for Energy and Climate Change argue there should be no link between tidal power and Hinkley Point, which ministers insist will go ahead because of French and UK government backing for the scheme. Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, told MPs this week that the Swansea Bay scheme was “not comparable” to the new nuclear station. “We are very confident that the Hinkley Point project will get built,” she told an MP in a Westminster Hall debate. “The Swansea Bay project was in our manifesto. The government absolutely recognises its potential to deliver low-carbon, secure energy for the future. “However, it was not a commitment to deliver a contract for difference. This government [is] absolutely determined to prioritise keeping costs down, to be on the consumer’s side and to decarbonise at the lowest price while keeping the lights on.” She said the project was “of huge interest” but the government would appreciate that “we must keep a close eye on the cost”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2019/aug/26/democrats-vote-down-climate-focused-debate-for-2020-candidates-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-27T00:15:41Z","webTitle":"Trump pushes his 'magnificent' resort as site of next G7 summit – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/aug/26/democrats-vote-down-climate-focused-debate-for-2020-candidates-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2019/aug/26/democrats-vote-down-climate-focused-debate-for-2020-candidates-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Trump pushes his 'magnificent' resort as site of next G7 summit – as it happened","bodyText":"Kari Paul logging off for the night. Here’s the top news of the evening: Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty for a gunman accused of murdering 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in October 2018. 19 states and the District of Columbia are suing over the Trump administrations effort to detain immigrants indefinitely The Department of Homeland Security is making new efforts to prevent election hacking The Department of Homeland Security said Monday it is creating a program to prevent voter registration databases from being infected with ransomware to avoid election meddling in 2020. The effort is being led by the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, a division of the Homeland Security Department. “Recent history has shown that state and county governments and those who support them are targets for ransomware attacks,” said Christopher Krebs, CISA’s director. “That is why we are working alongside election officials and their private sector partners to help protect their databases and respond to possible ransomware attacks.” Disgraced Hollywood producer and major political donor Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty Monday to new charges of sexual assault. The new indictment against Weinstein was revised to included charges predatory sexual assault, a development that caused the judge to delay the start of his trial until early next year. The change to the case was intended to open the door for an actress to testify against Weinstein in a rape and sexual assault trial that had been scheduled to start on Sept. 9. Weinstein previously pleaded not guilty to charges accusing him of raping a woman in 2013 and performing a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006. The case remains about those two women, but prosecutors said the new indictment was needed to allow a third woman, Annabella Sciorra, to testify. Sciorra, who is best known for her work on “The Sopranos,” says Weinstein raped her inside her Manhattan apartment after she starred in a film for his movie studio in 1993. Court papers unsealed on Monday indicate that, in addition to Sciorra, prosecutors plan to call three other women as witnesses to try to demonstrate a pattern of “prior bad acts” by Weinstein. Weinstein, 67, who’s free on $1 million bail, has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex. Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made her first public appearance on Monday since her most recent cancer scare. It was announced Friday the 86-year-old justice had recently completed a three-week course or radiation therapy to treat pancreatic cancer. The court statement said the tumor was “treated definitively” and that there was no evidence of disease elsewhere in Ginsburg’s body. If Ginsburg, one of the nine-member court’s four liberal justices, were unable to continue serving, Republican President Donald Trump could replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right. Trump has added two justices since becoming president in January 2017, cementing its 5-4 conservative majority. Conservative operatives tied to the Trump Administration are pursuing an “aggressive operation” to discredit news organizations by targeting journalists, the New York Times reports. The network of Republicans are digging into social media posts and other public statements made my journalists at organizations deemed unfriendly to Trump to find potentially embarrassing content, the newspaper reported. Operatives have closely examined more than a decade’s worth of public posts and statements by journalists, the people familiar with the operation said. Only a fraction of what the network claims to have uncovered has been made public, the people said, with more to be disclosed as the 2020 election heats up. The research is said to extend to members of journalists’ families who are active in politics, as well as liberal activists and other political opponents of the president. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia sued on Monday over the Trump administration’s effort to alter a federal agreement that limits how long immigrant children can be kept in detention. “We wish to protect children from irreparable harm,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said as he announced the lawsuit he is co-leading with Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. Both are Democrats. A 1997 agreement known as the Flores settlement says immigrant children must be kept in the least restrictive setting and generally shouldn’t spend more than 20 days in detention. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said last week it would create new regulations on how migrant children are treated. The administration wants to remove court oversight and allow families in detention longer than 20 days. About 475,000 families have crossed the border so far this budget year, nearly three times the previous full-year record for families. A judge must OK the Trump administration’s proposed changes in order to end the agreement, and a legal battle is expected from the case’s original lawyers. It’s not likely that U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee would approve the changes; it was her ruling in 2015 that extended the application of the Flores agreement to include children who came with families. She ordered the Obama administration to release children as quickly as possible. Still, Becerra argued California has a role to play in the case because the state is home to so many immigrants. “The federal government doesn’t have a right to tell us how we provide for the well-being of people in our state,” he said. California does not have any detention centers that house migrant families. The Trump administration argued that because no states license federal detention centers, they wanted to create their own set of standards in order to satisfy the judge’s requirements that the facilities are licensed. They said they will be audited, and the audits made public. But the Flores attorneys are concerned that they will no longer be able to inspect the facilities, and that careful state licensing requirements will be eschewed. Becerra echoed that argument, saying that removing state authority over licensing centers could allow the federal government to place centers in California or other states that don’t meet basic standards of care. Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington, also a Democrat, said prolonged detention will have long-term impacts on the mental and physical health of immigrant children and families. “When we welcome those children into our communities, state-run programs and services bear the burden of the long-term impact of the trauma those children endured in detention,” he said. California on Monday also sought to halt a Trump administration effort that could deny green cards to immigrants using public benefits. Other states joining the lawsuit are Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. (From the Associated Press) Federal prosecutors announced Monday they will seek the death penalty in the case against a domestic terrorist who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October. The accused gunman pleaded not guilty after he opened fire on the Tree of Life synagogue in the deadliest act of antisemitism in American history. Prosecutors previously stated they would seek the death penalty and sought approval from Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pursue a capital case, the Hill reports. The Monday filing “formalizes their intentions.” Hello readers, this is Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over the blog for the next few hours. Stay tuned for updates. That’s it from me today. I’m handing the blog over to my West Coast colleague Kari Paul for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Trump held a wide-ranging news conference to close out the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, but he mainly avoided details on pressing matters like his trade war and the climate crisis. He did manage to make a pitch for holding the 2020 G7 summit at his Florida resort, though. Johnson &amp; Johnson was ordered to pay $572 million in damages to Oklahoma for the company’s role in fueling the opioid epidemic. The state’s attorney general had been seeking damages of more than $17 billion. A new poll showed Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden effectively tied for the lead in the Democratic primary race. As Sanders’ team celebrated the results, some of Biden’s supporters insisted the poll should be dismissed given its relatively small sample size. Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican of Wisconsin, announced he would resign next month as he and his wife prepare for the birth of their next child, who appears to have a heart condition. He is at least the eighth House Republican to announce his departure in recent weeks. Representative Joe Kennedy has formed a committee to explore the possibility of launching a primary bid against Massachusetts’ incumbent Democratic senator, Ed Markey. A Republican senator, Tom Cotton, wrote a New York Times op-ed defending Trump’s proposal to buy Greenland from Denmark. Kari will have more on fallout from Trump’s press conference and coverage of Sanders’ rally tonight in West Virginia, so stay tuned. Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, will travel to South America next week with the deputy secretary of state to promote her Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. An Oklahoma judge ruled that Johnson &amp; Johnson should pay $572 million in damages to the state for the company’s role in fueling the opioid epidemic. Reuters reports: Judge Thad Balkman of Cleveland County District Court in Norman, Oklahoma delivered his decision in a lawsuit alleging that J&amp;J’s marketing practices fueled the opioid epidemic by flooding the market with painkillers. Shares of J&amp;J rose 5% following the verdict. The case brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter was the first to go to trial out of thousands of lawsuits filed by state and local governments against opioid manufacturers and distributors. Hunter had been seeking to make J&amp;J pay more than $17 billion to help the state address the epidemic for the next 30 years through addiction treatment and prevention programs. The White House Correspondents’ Association has filed a court brief contesting the suspension of reporter Brian Karem’s White House press pass. The White House said earlier this month that it “made a final determination” to suspend the Playboy correspondent’s press pass for 30 days, following a “preliminary decision” to do so. The more deliberative process appears to be a response to the uproar over the previous suspension of CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who had asserted that the swift decision violated his due process rights. But the WHCA argued in its court brief that the suspension of Karem’s pass still violated his First Amendment rights. “When government officials—including the President of the United States here—attempt to restrict, curtail, intimidate, or silence the press in its news gathering activities, the rights of the people and the press, as guaranteed by the First Amendment, are infringed, and our democratic form of government is placed in jeopardy,” the brief reads. An aide to Representative Joe Kennedy emphasized that the Democratic congressman is still weighing whether to launch a primary battle against Senator Ed Markey. He has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to launch a Senate committee, but the aide said the committee would simply allow Kennedy to more fully explore the possibility. Matthew Petersen, the vice chairman of the Federal Election Commission, has announced his resignation ⁠— leaving the agency without enough commissioners to make decisions as the 2020 election season gets into full swing. The Center for Public Integrity reports: Petersen’s resignation, first reported by the Washington Examiner, will throw the FEC into turmoil for weeks — and perhaps months — as the nation enters the teeth of 2020 presidential and congressional elections. For now, the FEC can’t conduct meetings. It can’t slap political scofflaws with fines. It can’t make rules. It can’t conduct audits and approve them. It can’t vote on the outcome of investigations. And while staff will continue to post campaign finance reports and attend to day-to-day functions, the commission itself can’t offer official advice to politicians and political committees who seek it. Sarah Hucakbee Sanders, Trump’s former press secretary, has launched a new website touting her role as a “trusted confidante of the President” who “advised him on everything from press and communications strategy to personnel and policy.” The website has increased speculation that Sanders will launch an Arkansas gubernatorial bid in 2022. Her father, Mike Huckabee, previously held the office, and Trump encouraged her to enter the race when she announced her resignation back in June. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican of Arkansas, has written a New York Times op-ed in support of Trump’s proposal to try to purchase Greenland from Denmark. Cotton writes: After news leaked last week that President Trump had expressed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark, his critics predictably derided him as crazy. But once again, the president is crazy like a fox. The acquisition of Greenland would secure vital strategic interests for the United States, economically benefit both us and Greenlanders, and would be in keeping with American — and Danish — diplomatic traditions. ... America is not the only nation to recognize Greenland’s strategic significance. Intent on securing a foothold in the Arctic and North America, China attempted in 2016 to purchase an old American naval base in Greenland, a move the Danish government prevented. Two years later, China was back at it, attempting to build three airports on the island, which failed only after intense lobbying of the Danes by the Trump administration. It was first reported earlier this month that Trump had floated the idea of purchasing Greenland to senior aides, but politicians in Greenland and Denmark dismissed the idea out of hand. Ane Lone Bagger, Greenland’s foreign minister, said it was “open for business, but not for sale”. Trump reacted to the less-than-enthusiastic response by canceling a planned trip to Denmark and calling the country’s prime minister “nasty.” The Drug Enforcement Administration announced it would move forward with a long-delayed expansion of its marijuana research program. “DEA is making progress in the program to register additional marijuana growers for federally authorized research, and will work with other relevant federal agencies to expedite the necessary next steps,” DEA’s acting administrator, Uttam Dhillon, said in a statement announcing the move. “We support additional research into marijuana and its components, and we believe registering more growers will result in researchers having access to a wider variety for study.” Reuters has more: The announcement comes more than three years after the DEA first said in August 2016 that it would expand the number of licensed growers. ... The DEA has yet to take action on the 33 applications it has received since then, as the Trump administration has threatened a crackdown on a drug that is now legal for recreational or medical use in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, creating legal uncertainty and freezing many businesses out of the banking system. Then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told federal prosecutors in January 2018 that they could go after marijuana users and producers in states that had legalized the drug, reversing the hands-off position taken by the Obama administration. The White House issued a clarification that the first lady, Melania Trump, has actually not met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The president confused many reporters when he said during his news conference earlier today, “I also say that, by the way, with respect to North Korea. Kim Jong-un, who I’ve gotten to know extremely well, the first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong-un and I think she would agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.” The latest polling from Monmouth University seems to have sparked a lot of celebration and pushback among Democratic strategists and commentators. The Monmouth poll showed Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden in an effective three-way tie for the Democratic nomination. But Biden’s supporters pointed to the relatively low sample size, 298 registered voters, as a reason to dismiss the poll. A Republican pollster was also skeptical of how Monmouth identified potential Democratic primary voters. But Sanders’ supporters and advisers in particular celebrated the results as an indication of how their candidate is picking up momentum in the race. Sanders’ speechwriter, David Sirota, even focused the campaign’s latest newsletter on the poll. Representative Joe Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts and the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the Senate next year. If the 38-year-old congressman moved forward with those plans, he would face an incumbent Democratic senator, Ed Markey, in a primary battle. “Over the past few weeks I’ve begun to consider a run for the U.S. Senate. This isn’t a decision I’m approaching lightly and — to be completely candid — I wasn’t expecting to share my thoughts so soon,” Kennedy wrote in a Facebook post explaining his decision. “I hear the folks who say I should wait my turn, but with due respect — I’m not sure this is a moment for waiting. Our system has been letting down a lot of people for a long time, and we can’t fix it if we don’t challenge it.” Markey has attracted praise as a sponsor of the Green New Deal, but Kennedy may be looking to argue that it’s time for the 73-year-old senator to pass the torch. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who serves on both the House intelligence committee and the House oversight committee, announced his support for launching an impeachment inquiry. According to a Politico reporter, Krishnamoorthi’s announcement leaves only two Democrats on the House intelligence committee who have not yet explicitly weighed in on an impeachment inquiry ⁠— but one of them is the committee chair, Adam Schiff. A new poll found that Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden are in a virtual three-way tie for the lead in the Democratic presidential primary. The Monmouth University poll showed Sanders and Warren leading the pack with the support of 20 percent of Democratic voters, while Biden was just behind them with 19 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits. But other recent polls have shown Biden maintaining his front-runner status. A poll released last week by CNN found Biden had regained his double-digit lead over Warren and Sanders, besting them by 14 to 15 points. Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican of Wisconsin, announced he would resign from the House next month to focus on his family. The five-term congressman said that, although his resignation was “not an easy decision,” he felt the need to be closer to his family as he and his wife prepare for the arrival of a new baby who will likely face health battles. “Recently, we’ve learned that our baby, due in late October, will need even more love, time, and attention due to complications, including a heart condition,” Duffy wrote in a Facebook post announcing his decision. “With much prayer, I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby and family need right now.” Duffy will leave office on Sept. 23, and the solidly red district is expected to remain in Republican hands. The Wisconsinite’s decision makes him at least the eighth House Republican to announce plans to leave office in recent weeks. Our climate correspondent Emily Holden reports: Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang unveiled his climate policy, which would both decrease heat-trapping pollution and adapt to the changing planet. He is calling the plan “Lower Emissions, Higher Ground,” referring to sea-level rise that will force humans in from the coasts. “The right time to deal with this crisis was decades ago,” Yang said. “We’ve waited too long, so we need to act fast and recognize that all options need to be on the table in order to adapt to the changed world we live in, while mitigating behaviors that make it worse and reversing the damage we’ve already done.” Yang has qualified for the third Democratic debate and has recently seen a surge in support, although he is far from a front-runner. In his blueprint, he says he wants the US to be carbon-neutral by 2049, a year earlier than most Democratic candidates who have published plans. That means he wouldn’t completely eliminate all carbon emissions but would require any remaining ones to be offset, perhaps with clean energy elsewhere or forests that absorb carbon. Yang would spend almost $5 trillion. Bernie Sanders, by comparison, would aim to spend $16 trillion. Any such government climate action would require congressional approval. Yang also wants a carbon fee starting at $40 a ton. At least half the revenues would go to helping Americans afford the transition. He says that it’s hard to mobilize change when “78% of our fellow Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.” His proposal includes a timeline to: Neutralize emissions from new buildings by 2025 Build and start running new carbon-free nuclear reactors (with thorium and fusion) by 2027 Cut emissions from new cars by 2030. Have a 100% renewable electric grid by 2035 Make transportation carbon-neutral by 2040 Recapture 85% of methane from oil and gas facilities by 2045 Yang would use nuclear power as a backstop as the country transitions to all renewables. He also would make money available for power companies to modernize the electric grid. He says his administration would not employ anyone who formerly worked as a lobbyist for an oil, gas or coal company--many of whom currently work for Trump. He also would direct funds for Americans to “support the politicians they agree with and wash out the influence of lobbyists.” Here’s where the day stands so far: Trump held a wide-ranging press conference with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to close out the G7 summit in Biarritz, France. The US president was short on details for matters like his trade war with China, the Iran nuclear deal and the climate crisis. But he did make a point to plug his Florida resort, Trump National Doral Miami, as the potential site for the 2020 G7 summit. Trump skipped the G7 climate session this morning, and he brushed off a question about the climate crisis by saying he did not want to “lose [US] wealth on dreams, on windmills.” The Democratic National Committee has voted against allowing presidential candidates to hold a climate-focused debate, disappointing activists who have argued the race has focused too little on the crisis. The blog will be covering more analysis and fallout from Trump’s press conference, so stay tuned. Throughout his press conference, Trump avoided offering details on a number of pressing issues, including the climate crisis, Iran and his trade war with China. On combating climate change, Trump dubiously argued that confronting the crisis would threaten the country’s economy. “I feel the US has tremendous wealth ... I’m not going to lose that wealth on dreams, on windmills - which, frankly, aren’t working too well,” Trump said. He added, “I think I know more about the environment than most.” When asked about inviting Vladimir Putin to the G7 summit, Trump repeated the falsehood that the Russian president was previously excluded from the gathering because he “outsmarted” Barack Obama. PBS Newshour’s Yamiche Alcindor responded by correcting Trump that Putin was actually excluded after annexing Crimea, but the president stood by his original position. He also mentioned that he was sure Alcindor, who is black, did “like” Obama. Trump also said he would consider meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, under the right circumstances but did not clarify what those circumstances would be. And he said he trusted China wanted a trade deal because otherwise, the situation could get much worse for the Chinese people. But he didn’t clarify how it would get worse or what he specifically wanted from such a deal. One of the few matters where he did elaborate was on his Florida resort, Trump National Doral Miami, hosting the 2020 G7 summit. He went on at length about how the resort’s “magnificent buildings” and proximity to the airport made it the perfect site, while dismissing out of hand any implication that he could personally profit from holding the summit there. When asked about why he skipped the G7 session on the climate crisis, Trump was dismissive of the threat it represents. Trump told reporters in Biarritz, France, that he was proud of the United States’ “tremendous wealth” and that he was “not going to lose that wealth on dreams, on windmills.” But he also insisted that he was “an environmentalist.” Trump has concluded his press conference to close out the G7 summit in Biarritz, France. He spoke to reporters for about half an hour after appearing alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for roughly 35 minutes. The last question Trump took had to do with the climate crisis. The president told reporters, “I’m an environmentalist. People don’t understand that.” Trump previously pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord, has slashed environmental regulations and skipped this morning’s climate session about the Amazon wildfires. Trump said he would soon be visiting Germany at the request of the country’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. He also intends to travel to Australia. The US president sat down with Merkel earlier today and indicated that the meeting had gone well. Trump has repeatedly mentioned his company’s properties during the closing news conference of the G7. Trump offered a very defensive, sarcastic apology when he was asked about the strategy behind escalating his trade war with China even as global markets struggled because of it. “Sorry! It’s the way I negotiate,” Trump said. “It’s the way I negotiate. It’s done very well for me over the years, and it’s done even better for the country.” On the question of potentially hosting the 2020 G7 summit at his Florida resort, Trump also touted the site’s “magnificent” buildings and the size of its ballrooms, arguing that it was the best of the dozen locations his administration was considering. PBS Newshour’s Yamiche Alcindor asked Trump why he considered it appropriate to invite Russia to the G7 after the country was found to have meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The US president went on to tout his 2016 victory and then blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for his relations with Russia. “I think it would be better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent,” Trump said. He added, “I do nothing for politics ... I do what’s right, and people like what I do.” Alcindor, who is black, pointed out that Russia was actually excluded from the G7 previously because of Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea. Trump said he knew that Alcindor did “like” Obama but that he stood by his assessment. In response to a question about his Florida resort potentially hosting the G7 summit next year, Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claim that the presidency was costing him between $3bn and $5bn. He went on to argue that Trump National Doral Miami offered many benefits as a G7 site, including its proximity to the airport and parking availability. “I don’t want to make money,” Trump said. “I don’t care about making money.” He argued that if his primary interest were money, he would be more worried about losing billions of dollars. But again, there is no proof that he is in fact losing billions. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has left the closing news conference of the G7. Trump will now take more questions from US journalists. Before Macron left, Trump was asked about whether he would drop his proposal of a digital tax on France, given that first lady Melania Trump had appeared to enjoy French wine during their trip. “I can confirm that the first lady loved your French wine,” Trump said to laughs, but he deflected the rest of the question. Trump said he would consider meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, under the right circumstances. “If the circumstances were correct or right, I would certainly agree to that,” the president said. “But in the meantime, they have to be good players.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he would encourage such a meeting between the two leaders. Trump also said that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, kept him in the loop about every decision he made regarding the G7 summit. The French leader’s decision to invite Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to the summit had sparked speculation that Macron was trying to force the US president’s hand on softening his stance toward Iran. Asked about the Iranian nuclear deal, Trump said that Iran was “not the same country” it was when he came into office but that he considered it to be a “country of tremendous potential.” Trump emphasized that the United States was not looking for a leadership change in Iran, instead simply looking to ensure that the country would not develop nuclear missiles. He also expressed optimism about reaching a deal with Iran. “We can have it done in a very short period of time,” Trump said. Trump said he believed China wanted to reach a trade deal and that he considered their statements about doing so to be sincere. He added that he considered the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to be a “great leader” and a “brilliant man.” But he did not repeat his previous claim that China called US officials to restart trade talks, an assertion that Beijing denied. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that Trump appeared willing during the G7 summit to quickly strike a deal with China on its trade war. “President Trump clearly showed his willingness to reach an agreement,” Macron said, adding that France supported such a scenario. “Our deep wish is for an agreement to be reached between the United States and China.” But he added, “It has to be a balanced agreement that’s good for everyone.” Macron warned that leaders were concerned about trade that does not comply with international rules. Trump said that the leaders at the G-7 had gotten along very well and that the participants were hesitant to adjourn the summit. “We would have stayed another hour,” Trump said. “Nobody wanted to leave.” Emmanuel Macron said that he and Trump had reached an agreement on the digital tax dispute and that the US president has been in talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, about their trade war. “Discussions are underway currently, in particular between president Trump and President Xi,” Macron said, vowing that leaders would work to ensure that “no one is treated unfairly.” “There was a lot of nervousness because of misunderstanding,” Macron said, but he added that participants would “work on a bilateral and multilateral basis” to address trade issues. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, kicked off the joint news conference by saying (according to CNN’s translation) that participants of the summit had engaged in “extremely productive work.” “There was a lot of nervousness at the outset, a lot of expectations, a lot of tension,” Macron said, adding that participants were “keen to convey a positive and joint message.” Macron also presented a one-page document that he said covered a lot of the ideas discussed during the summit. On Iran, Macron said, “We agree that Iran needs to comply with its nuclear obligations.” He added that he had encouraged Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, to sit down with Trump amid escalating tensions between the two countries. Trump and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have arrived for the closing news conference of the G7 summit in Biarritz, France — just an hour later than expected. Trump and the French president are expected to take just two questions each from US and French journalists before Emmanuel Macron leaves, a White House spokesperson said. The White House has asked reporters at the G7 closing news conference to stick to questions about the summit and said Trump may talk to the press corps more after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, leaves. Reporters in Biarritz, France, are still waiting for Trump and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to start their closing news conference at the G7 summit. But this minor feat from three US television journalists entertained the press corps in the meantime: Trump and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will soon hold their closing news conference at the G7 summit in Biarritz. The presser was originally set to start at 9.30am ET, but the leaders are running more than a half hour behind schedule. Will Hurd, a Republican congressman from Texas, wrote a USA Today op-ed arguing that “decoupling from China in the global economy is simply unrealistic”. He writes: Over the past two decades as a former CIA officer, partner in an international strategic consulting firm and now member of Congress on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I’ve seen how the Chinese government has threatened global supply chains, stolen American intellectual property and economically bullied smaller countries. Instead of pursuing a 19th century tit-for-tat tariff war, which is a self-imposed sales tax on American consumers, we should be collaborating with our allies to out-innovate China ... A common mistake in Washington is thinking about US-China competition through a cold war mentality that views Beijing as an adversary that we can contain and isolate like the Soviet Union. The United States and China are economically intertwined in a way that America and the Soviet Union never were and that America and Russia are not today. Regardless of presidential tweets saying that ‘we don’t need China’ and that US companies should find alternative markets, decoupling from China in the global economy is simply unrealistic and would be in neither country’s interest. Hurd’s op-ed comes as Trump has sent increasingly mixed signals about what he intends to do next in his trade war against China. But Hurd’s voice may not carry as much weight since he announced earlier this month that he would not seek re-election. The president confirmed in Biarritz that he has suggested hosting the 2020 G7 summit at Trump National Doral Miami in Florida. Trump said during a joint appearance with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that his administration was still entertaining other possibilities, but he emphasized the merits of his resort for hosting the event. “They love the location of the hotel,” Trump told reporters. “We haven’t found anything that’s even close to competing with it. “It’s one of the biggest airports, takes planes from everywhere. Sometimes you have hours and hours of driving to get to certain locations. “You’ll only have a five-minute drive, which is good,” Trump told Merkel. The possibility of Trump’s resort hosting the international summit, which was first reported last month, immediately raised concerns about the president trying to profit off his office. Trump has repeatedly claimed (without evidence) that the presidency is costing him billions of dollars, but reports also indicate the Secret Service has paid tens of thousands of dollars to the president’s Florida resort Mar-a-Lago during his trips there. The president was not present for a G7 climate meeting at which world leaders decided to dedicate $20m to fighting the Amazon wildfires. Angelique Chrisafis reports in Biarritz: Reporters noticed at the start of the session that the US president’s chair was empty. Trump was later asked by reporters covering a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whether he had attended the climate session. He replied: ‘We’re having it in a little while.’ He did not appear to hear when a reporter told him it had just taken place. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed Trump had not personally attended the climate session but that Trump’s team had been present. He said he had held long and in-depth talks with Trump on the Amazon fires and that the US president “shares our objectives” and was “fully engaged” in the joint G7 effort to help Brazil put out the fires and reforest. Trump’s press secretary put out a statement saying: “The President had scheduled meetings and bilaterals with Germany and India, so a senior member of the administration attended in his stead.” But Trump had previously said he would attend the session. The House judiciary committee is expected to subpoena Rob Porter, the former White House aide who resigned last year amid domestic abuse allegations. Politico reports: [Porter] was at the president’s side during several episodes of potential obstruction chronicled in [special counsel Robert] Mueller’s 448-page report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump’s attempted to thwart the probe. The White House is likely to block Porter from complying with the committee’s subpoena, which seeks public testimony. White House and Justice Department lawyers have repeatedly asserted that former top presidential aides have ‘absolute immunity’ from testifying to Congress, a claim House Democrats are challenging in court with a lawsuit seeking former White House Counsel Don McGahn’s public testimony. The subpoena to Porter comes as the committee is ramping up its obstruction investigation targeting the president, writing in recent court filings that impeachment is a possible outcome of the probe as Democrats seek witness testimony and Mueller’s grand-jury materials. Good morning, live blog readers! This is Joanie Greve taking the blog back over after a week away working on other projects. Over the weekend, members of the Democratic National Committee voted 222-137 against allowing the party’s presidential candidates to hold a debate focused on climate change. Environmental activists have insisted that the worsening climate crisis demands its own debate in the 2020 race, but party leadership ⁠– including DNC Chairman Tom Perez ⁠– have appeared skeptical of the idea. At the DNC’s August meeting in San Francisco, the committee’s resolution committee approved a measure encouraging “candidates to participate in multi-candidate issue-specific forums with the candidates appearing on the same stage, engaging one another in discussion,” but it was voted down by the larger membership. The vote came just days after Washington Governor Jay Inslee, who had focused his presidential bid on combatting the climate crisis, dropped out of the race. And many climate activists complained that the first Democratic debates spent too little time exploring what they consider the defining issue of our time. Other presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders, have unveiled bold climate proposals, but the confluence of events has led some to worry that Democratic leadership will continue to downplay the crisis until it’s too late. Here’s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Donald Trump is still at the G-7 in Biarritz, France. He will hold a press conference with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, at 9.30am ET before flying back to Washington. Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang is campaigning in New Hampshire, where he is expected to unveil a new climate proposal. Bernie Sanders will hold a rally in West Virginia later tonight. That’s all still coming up, so stay tuned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/07/we-are-making-the-wrong-energy-choices-for-future-generations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-07T11:23:39Z","webTitle":"We are making the wrong energy choices for future generations | Andrew Simms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/07/we-are-making-the-wrong-energy-choices-for-future-generations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/07/we-are-making-the-wrong-energy-choices-for-future-generations","fields":{"headline":"We are making the wrong energy choices for future generations","bodyText":"Eight months and counting Which energy technologies will future generations thank us for? Once hyped as providing electricity that would be too cheap to meter, the next, increasingly troubled nuclear power installation proposed for Britain, Hinkley Point C, stands at more than £24bn to be the most expensive building on Earth. Given the current economic climate with its emphasis on austerity, and the range of other energy options on offer, why is the government so keen to give the nuclear industry a second life? The then energy secretary, Ed Davey, speaking in late 2013 when the government agreed the deal with French energy company, EDF, said that investing in new nuclear capacity was needed because without it, “we’re going to see the lights going out.” He added that the deal was “good value” for money and for the nation. The prime minister, David Cameron, explained that the government’s motivation was to provide, “long-term, safe and secure supplies of electricity far into the future”. It’s easy to see the superficial political attraction of projects like Hinkley C – they look like big, simple solutions to a problem. They’re technologically shiny, highly visible, seemingly easy to keep an eye on and have large, influential lobbies behind them. With so much seemingly in its favour, it says a lot about the state of the nuclear industry that Hinkley C is heading south faster than a great snipe in migration. In a new report for the Intergenerational Foundation, co-published with the New Weather Institute, I found the economic case alone for new nuclear to be as leaky as a plastic bag of plutonium. Discounting the untold extra billions, typically hidden and underwritten by the public, required by nuclear reactors to pay for complex security, disposal of radioactive waste, insurance (and, perversely, liabilities from under-insurance), over the course of its initial 35-year contract period, Britain could save at least £30-£40bn on electricity generated by solar and onshore wind with their costs steadily falling. The costs for nuclear generation, meanwhile, have been doing exactly the opposite. From a government estimate of £5.6bn in 2008, by the time EU officials signed off the deal to build Hinkley C just six years later, the expected construction cost had risen to over £24bn. As obstacles, the burden of the financial architecture for the deal is only beaten by the problems with the technology itself which was meant to be state-of-the-art and a flagship for its operator EDF. A range of renewable energy options are readily available that prove to be cheaper, safer, more secure, quicker to deliver and, overall, better value for Britain. Yet, instead of grasping this option, the government seems to have gone out of its way to hamper renewables by slashing support and creating a capricious, unstable policy environment. In his most recent budget statment, the chancellor, George Osborne stated a clear priority for policy. “In this budget we choose the long term,” he said. “We choose to put the next generation first.” A wonderful sentiment but how is that determined in policy, and what does it look like in practice? It’s time for clear, transparent criteria for making energy choices which, when applied, will maximise economic benefits to the country, meet climate change obligations, boost security in terms of both having a dependable, efficient energy system, in warding off terrorist threats and the dangers of nuclear proliferation recently highlighted. On everything from pensions to public services, our current economic crises and ageing population already present a bad and worsening deal for the next generation. If we really are to have policies for the long term and with future generations in mind, we need to ensure energy choices are made to protect and promote their interests. A rational, evidence-based, intergenerational energy system won’t just emerge from political rhetoric, it needs to be designed and based on clear principles. Such principles would include having an energy system most likely to preserve a climate convivial for future generations; a system with the least toxic environmental burden and which maximises ancillary economic benefits such as local jobs, manufacturing and services. As an opening bid, here’s a set of intergenerational design criteria to aid intelligent, future energy planning. They are: Employment and broader economic return on investment - how much value to the broader economy does investment in different technologies bring; in other words, what is its economic multiplier effect? Environmental return on investment - how efficiently does an investment lower carbon emissions and minimise other toxic pollutants and contribute to a healthy environment? Energy return on investment - how much energy is generated for the amount of money invested to produce that energy? Security return on investment - how much does the technology contribute to domestic energy security and what other security risks does it carry? Transition return on investment - how does it contribute, comparatively to the speed and scale of deployment of low carbon energy generating capacity? Conviviality return on investment - the degree to which a technology can be responsive to and supportive of a society’s or a community’s own vision and pathway for its development, and that of future generations. Paul Massara, is the chief executive of the energy supplier, RWE npower. Reflecting on the prospect of Hinkley C, he commented: “We will look back and think that nuclear was a expensive mistake. It’s one of those deals where my children, and my children’s children, are going to be thinking ‘was that a good deal’?” It’s easy to imagine what conclusion they will come to, and the bewilderment they will feel at why better options were not more aggressively pursued."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/dec/23/who-will-win-the-copeland-byelection","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-23T16:30:21Z","webTitle":"Who will win the Copeland byelection?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/23/who-will-win-the-copeland-byelection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/dec/23/who-will-win-the-copeland-byelection","fields":{"headline":"Who will win the Copeland byelection?","bodyText":"Where is Copeland, and why is there going to be a byelection there? Copeland is a large constituency on the Cumbrian coast, taking in Whitehaven (the old name of the constituency), part of the Lake District National Park and the Sellafield nuclear power plant. Labour’s Jamie Reed has been MP here since 2005 but he announced on Wednesday that he will quit at the end of January to take a job as Sellafield’s head of development and community relations. Reed has been a fierce critic of Jeremy Corbyn – he resigned from the front bench virtually the moment Corbyn’s election as leader was announced in 2015 – but he insists he is leaving parliament not as a Corbyn protest, but so that he can be at home as his children are growing up. On paper, who should win? In normal circumstances, a Labour hold would be a very safe bet. Copeland, and its predecessor seat, have been held by the party since the 1930s and, even though Reed’s majority was just 2,564 over the Conservatives at the last general election, it is highly unusual for the government to gain a seat at a byelection. In fact, it hasn’t happened since the Tories took Mitcham and Morden in 1982, after the Labour MP defected to the SDP and fought a byelection on behalf of his new party, ensuring that the 1979 Labour vote in the seat was split in half. Oh, and polling took place while the Falklands war was being fought, which didn’t help Labour either. Surely things aren’t that bad for Jeremy Corbyn – why do the Tories think they’ve got a chance? Because Labour’s national poll ratings are dire, and this will be the first byelection fought in a Labour/Conservative marginal since Corbyn was elected leader. At the 2015 general election, the Conservative share of the vote was 38%, and Labour’s 31%. The latest Guardian/ICM poll puts the Conservatives on 41% (+3) and Labour on 27% (-4), a swing of 3.5% from Labour to the Tories. In Copeland, Reed was on 42% at the general election and his Conservative opponent 36%. A 3.5% swing here would be just enough to enable the Tories to do a Mitcham. Is that how byelections work? Er, no. Sometimes there is a connection between how a party is doing in the national polls and how it performs in byelections, but sometimes there isn’t. In the five byelections held in Labour seats since Corbyn became leader, Labour has retained all five of them, with its share of the vote going up in four (Oldham West and Royton +7.5%; Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough +5.8%; Tooting +8.7%; Batley and Spen – where other parties stood aside – +42.6%) and falling only fractionally in the fifth (Ogmore, -0.3%). Voters might have their doubts about Corbyn, but the party has not been choosing Corbynites as byelection candidates and voting Labour in a byelection won’t result in Corbyn becoming prime minister. What is going to decide who wins? At this stage, we just don’t know. The parties have not selected candidates, and it is not clear yet what is going to emerge as the key campaign issue. There is a good chance that it could be the NHS. There is a huge row in the constituency at the moment about plans to downgrade maternity services at West Cumberland hospital in Whitehaven, which would involve some patients being sent 40 miles away to another hospital in Carlisle. Theresa May has defended the proposals, in words that could end up as a millstone around the neck of the Conservative candidate. But, equally, it could turn into another Brexit byelection. Copeland council (which overlaps broadly but not exactly with the constituency) voted 62% to leave and, with Reed leaving parliament at the end of January, campaigning may start very soon after the supreme court ruling in the article 50 case, which could trigger a bout of media hysteria about Brexit supposedly being blocked. Ukip were third here at the general election, with 15.5% of the vote, and if they were to pick up more new votes from Labour than from the Tories, a Ukip surge could let the Tories in. Ukip’s new leader, Paul Nuttall, who is from the north-west, might have some appeal here, but financially and organisationally the party is in a weak state, and might not have the capacity to mount a strong campaign. With Sellafield essential to the local economy, nuclear power will feature, too. Labour supports nuclear energy but a policy document Corbyn released during his 2015 leadership campaign saying he opposed “new nuclear power” (ie, new power stations) could be problematic. So, will the Conservatives win? The bookies think so, because they have the Tories as favourites (Conservatives 5/6, Labour 5/4). But in practice Labour’s prospects are probably quite a bit better than these odds suggest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2016/jul/26/pokemon-go-players-fukushima-disaster-zone-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-26T14:05:08Z","webTitle":"Pokémon Go players urged not to venture into Fukushima disaster zone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/26/pokemon-go-players-fukushima-disaster-zone-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2016/jul/26/pokemon-go-players-fukushima-disaster-zone-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Pokémon Go players urged not to venture into Fukushima disaster zone","bodyText":"Japan is asking for the Fukushima nuclear exclusion zone to be classified as a no-go area for Pokémon after the discovery of at least one of the game’s characters on a power station’s site. Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (Tepco) has requested that Pokémon Go developer Niantic and the Pokémon Company prevent Pokémon appearing in and around areas affected by the nuclear reactor meltdown in Fukushima to help prevent encouraging players to enter dangerous areas. Tepco said it has tested the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which was partially destroyed by the March 2011 disaster, the nearby Fukushima Daini plant and the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata Prefecture and found Pokémon on-site. Japan’s nuclear regulator sent out a warning to national energy providers telling them to tighten security after the incursion of three teenagers into a nuclear power plant in Ohio in the US. Tepco has banned employees from playing Pokémon Go on site. The Fukushima governor, Masao Uchibori, said that it was not good that people might enter nuclear plants or evacuation zones designated after the nuclear disaster on the hunt for Pokémon and that “the prefectural government will consider how to draw attention to this”. The city government of Nagasaki has already requested that Niantic remove Pokémon from Nagasaki Peace Park, which is maintained as a memorial to victims of the atomic bombing of the city in 1945. The city has also asked visitors to refrain from playing the game saying that “the Peace Park is a place for prayer”. Niantic said it would modify the game if the company discovered problems. Japan, the home of Pokémon, had to wait for weeks after the Pokémon Go’s original launch in Australia, owing to worries about overloaded servers and the commercial agreement with McDonald’s for sponsored Pokéstops. Since the game’s launch in Japan, reports of minor traffic incidents including that of a Pokémon Go-playing male high school student and a 30-year-old man colliding on a street in Tokyo’s Adachi Ward while riding bicycles. The Pokémon Go global craze has led South Koreans to flock to a remote region, holocaust museums having to discourage players, naive New Zealanders led to Hell’s Angels clubs and police stations filled with players. It has also caused car accidents, impromptu flash-mobs in the middle of New York streets and people to walk into the sea in pursuit of some of the more rare creatures. Hiroshi Hase, Japanese minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology, said that global frenzy involving content created in Japan was “gratifying,” but that it’s location-based nature could put gamers and others at risk in certain situations and urged caution. 14 essential tips to get you started in Pokémon Go Pokémon Go: eight advanced tips to prepare you for gyms Pokémon Go accounts are being sold for thousands of pounds on eBay What’s a Pokémon Go gym and how do I master them?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/live/2020/jan/08/brexit-pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-to-tell-eu-chief-at-first-meeting-that-trade-deal-wont-be-based-on-alignment-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-08T17:24:43Z","webTitle":"Labour leadership contest: Boost for Starmer's campaign as he gets Unison's backing – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/08/brexit-pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-to-tell-eu-chief-at-first-meeting-that-trade-deal-wont-be-based-on-alignment-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2020/jan/08/brexit-pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-to-tell-eu-chief-at-first-meeting-that-trade-deal-wont-be-based-on-alignment-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Labour leadership contest: Boost for Starmer's campaign as he gets Unison's backing – as it happened","bodyText":"Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, has said it will be “impossible” for the UK to negotiate a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of Brexit within the timeframe set by Boris Johnson. She also said Johnson should reconsider his decision to rule out extending the post-Brexit transition period. (See 2.29pm.) At the afternoon lobby briefing a spokesman for the PM said this would not happen. He said: The prime minister has been clear that the implementation period will end at the end of this year and we will work with the European Union to negotiate an FTA [free trade agreement]. Keir Starmer’s Labour leadership campaign has received a boost after he won the backing of the UK’s biggest trade union, Unison, and became the first person to get more than the 22 MPs required to become a candidate. Boris Johnson has strongly backed the US’s decision to kill the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a missile strike, telling prime minister’s questions that while he could not comment on the legality of the act, “most reasonable people” would think the operation was justified. The UK could introduce tariffs on imports of food from countries with lower food safety and farming standards than the UK, using World Trade Organization rules, Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, has suggested. MPs have voted down proposals to enshrine protections for child refugees as part of the government’s Brexit agreement. As the Press Association reports, following his election victory, Boris Johnson re-drafted his European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill and rowed back on the previous government’s acceptance of an amendment from Labour peer Lord Dubs to allow unaccompanied child refugees to continue to be reunited with their families in the UK after exit day. Clause 37 of the bill replaces the pledge with a watered-down vow for ministers to “make a statement” on the progress of the talks once the divorce with Brussels is complete. An attempt to re-instate the Dubs provision was defeated this afternoon by a majority of 96 votes. This is from the Green MP Caroline Lucas. Three MEPs who quit - and one who was sacked by - the Brexit party have joined the Conservatives. Annunziata Rees-Mogg - sister of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg - Lance Forman and Lucy Harris resigned the Brexit party whip only a week before the election to back the PM’s push to “get Brexit done”. As the Press Association reports, they were joined in backing Boris Johnson by John Longworth, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce who was sacked for “repeatedly undermining” leader Nigel Farage’s election strategy only days before the trio’s walkout. The four confirmed they have switched allegiance to become Tory MEPs in the European parliament, in a move that will more than double the number of Conservatives in Brussels. It takes the number of Tory representatives to seven. Airbnb-style short-term lets could be subject to new licensing schemes from spring next year, the Scottish government has announced. As the Press Association reports, as well as handing councils the power to bring in licensing schemes, local authorities will in future be able to designate new control areas for short-term lets, with those wanting to let out properties in this way first having to obtain planning permission. The measures are being introduced following concerns about the impact such lets have on areas such as Edinburgh - one of the most popular places for Airbnb listings. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, who attended the meeting in Dowing Street with Boris Johnson alongside Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission. From LabourList’s Sienna Rodgers Jon Lansman is head of Momentum, the Labour organisation set up for Jeremy Corbyn supporters. And Matt Zarb-Cousin is a former press spokesman for Corbyn. Here is Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and Labour leadership candidate, responding to news that Unison is backing his campaign. Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen have been reminiscing about the fact that they attended the same school in Brussels during their meeting in No 10. Their fathers both worked for the European commission, and so they both attended the European school in Brussels, although not at the same time. The Telegraph’s Peter Foster has a good take on the exchanges. Northern Ireland businesses have vowed to take their fight for a Brexit mitigation package to the House of Lords any beyond. And they have dared the government to “prove it” after the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker told MPs that “this deal is a good deal for both businesses and individuals in Northern Ireland.” An amendment proposing cash compensation for the extra disruption they will face post-Brexit because of checks on goods crossing the Irish sea was comprehensively defeated by 75 voters in the Commons, as was a proposal for an annual review of the new arrangements if the impact of Brexit is adverse. “The fight will go on in the House of Lords, at Committees and with the EU. We are determined to protect NI families and the affordability and choice they enjoy,” the business groups said in a statement. The 12 business groups backing the amendment include the Ulster Farmers Union and the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland. So far there have been four votes on amendments to the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill in the Commons this afternoon. The government has won them all very easily. Here is a rather sad tweet from Laura Smith, who was Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich until she lost her seat in the election. These are from HuffPost’s Paul Waugh, who has been at the afternoon Downing Street lobby briefing. The Labour leadership candidates have mostly been wary of criticising Jeremy Corbyn directly, but they have been more willing to have a go at his advisers and none more so than Emily Thornberry, who in an interview before Christmas effectively called for Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy, who have been Corbyn’s two most powerful aides, to be sacked. Today Thornberry has escalated her attack, saying that unnamed “advisers” in Corbyn’s office tried to remove a line from the 2019 manifesto criticising rocket and terror attacks by Palestinian groups against Israel. In a blog for Jewish News she says: Even that didn’t prepare me for the battle I had over Labour’s 2019 manifesto, where the advisers around Jeremy Corbyn proposed to amend the language we had used in the 2017 version to remove the condemnation of rocket and terror attacks by Palestinian groups against Israel, while rightly continuing to condemn the illegal occupation of Palestinian land and the blockade of Gaza. When I repeatedly complained that this was utterly unacceptable, I was told by Jeremy’s office that they thought this was “very balanced considering the considerable imbalance in the conflict”. Disgustingly, attacks on Israeli civilians were being deliberately dismissed in a way that would never have been tolerated of attacks on any civilians in any other country around the world. At Labour’s clause V meeting to agree the manifesto, I finally won the argument, and succeeded in reverting the proposed text to the 2017 language, but the whole process left me deeply disturbed at the mentality of the advisers around Jeremy. In a passage on Israel and Palestine the manifesto said: All sides must avoid taking action that would make peace harder to achieve. That means both an end to the blockade, occupation and settlements, and an end to rocket and terror attacks. In the blog Thornberry says she does not think Corbyn was aware that his advisers were trying to make sure the manifesto did not contain implicit criticism of groups like Hamas. She says: As for Jeremy, based on his reaction at the meeting, I think he knew nothing about the row, even though his advisers had invoked his name several times beforehand when pressuring me to drop my objections, something I believe they frequently did without his knowledge. She also says the party needs to be much tougher with antisemites in the party. She says: If I was leader ... driving antisemitism out of Labour would be my most urgent and immediate priority. No more suspensions, training sessions, or forgiveness, I would just kick these scumbags out of our party, the way we should have done long before now. Corbyn’s office has been asked to comment, but has not replied yet. I will post their response if I get one. A government minister has said there will be “reporting requirements” for goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. But Robin Walker, a Northern Ireland minister, told MPs during the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill: “It is clear there are reporting requirements in terms of the functioning of the protocol.” But Walker said the checks would be light touch. He said: What we want to ensure is, as set out in article 6 [promising unfettered access] of the [Northern Ireland] protocol, that we use the joint committee in that to reduce those and make sure we have the absolute minimum burden. Walker added he recognised the concerns of businesses over checks because of Brexit and the government would seek to minimise them. They are demanding cash compensation that could run to more than £100m for the disruption caused by Brexit. Walker said the government recognised the “strong voice” and concerns of Northern Ireland businesses but article 6 of the withdrawal agreement NI protocol gave the government the power to ensure “unfettered” access. He said: The prime minister has been absolutely clear, that beyond our obligations under international law, there will be no new checks or processes on the movement of such goods and our manifesto commitment is absolutely clear the bill gives us the power to deliver this. Unison, the largest union in the UK, has endorsed Sir Keir Starmer for next Labour leader. Starmer has already become the first candidate to get the required number of nominations from MPs (see 11.18am) and the Unison endorsement means that he can be confident of clearing the other nomination threshold: getting the support of either 10% of CLPs, or 5% of the affiliate vote. Unison accounts for more than 5% of the affiliate vote. Under Labour rules Starmer needs another two affiliated organisations to back him – either trade unions or socialist societies. Given the support he is already attracting, he is certain to achieve this. Explaining Unison’s decision, Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, said: This is a pivotal time for Labour. We believe – if elected by the membership – Keir Starmer would be a leader to bring the party together and win back the trust of the thousands of voters who deserted Labour last month. Unions created the Labour party to give working people a voice in Westminster. But it can only achieve for them, their families, their communities and the country’s public services when in government. Keir has a clear vision to get Labour back to the winning ways of the past. He is best placed to take on Boris Johnson, hold his government to account and ensure Labour can return to power and once more change working people’s lives for the better. Here is the full text of the speech by Ursula Von der Leyen, the new president of the European commission, at the LSE earlier. Here is my colleague Lisa O’Carroll’s write-up. And here are the key points. Von der Leyen said it would be impossible to negotiate a full UK-EU trade deal by the end of this year. Boris Johnson claims it will be possible to conclude the negotiations within this time frame. But in her speech Von der Leyen said: The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be. And without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, you cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership. She went even further in the Q&amp;A, saying: The transition time - it is very, very tight. I briefly [in the speech] touched on the topics we have to negotiate, and this was not even the whole list. It is basically impossible to negotiate all of what I’ve been mentioning ... Therefore we will have to prioritise as long as we face that deadline of the end of 2020. I can only recommend that we prioritise in a way we first of all tackle those topics where, at the end of the year, when we are running out of time, we will not have an international agreement or something to fall back on, but only a hard exit, which would not be good for the UK, nor would it be good for the European Union. Therefore the priorities will have to be sorted out. She urged Johnson to reconsider his opposition to an extension of the post-Brexit transition period. Johnson has amended the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill to make it illegal for the government to agree an extension with the EU. But Von der Leyen said this option should remain open. In the Q&amp;A she said: I would prefer that we look at the whole scenery during the summer, or before the summer starts would be better, because we might together want to take reconsideration of the time frame before 1 July. But let us start first of all at 1 February with sorting the field and going into the negotiations determined to work as hard as we can, as much as we can, but there are of course limits. The 1 July deadline is important because, if the UK and the EU do want to extend the transition period for one year or for two years, as allowed under the withdrawal agreement, they have to decide that by that point. She said that after Brexit the UK and the EU would continue to be “the best of friends and partners”. She said that after Brexit the UK’s relationship with the EU would change. In her speech she said: The truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before. And it cannot and will not be as close as before – because with every choice comes a consequence. With every decision comes a trade-off. Without the free movement of people, you cannot have the free movement of capital, goods and services. Without a level playing field on environment, labour, taxation and state aid, you cannot have the highest quality access to the world’s largest single market. The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be. But she did say the EU wanted a trade deal “unprecedented in scope”. In her speech she said: We are ready to design a new partnership with zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping. A partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope. Everything from climate action to data protection, fisheries to energy, transport to space, financial services to security. When asked in the Q&amp;A what she meant by a zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping relationship, she replied: Zero quotas, zero tariffs, zero dumping means level playing field, clear level playing field, on both sides. So whatever is diverging from a level playing field decreases the uncomplicated access to the single market. She said Brexit had strengthened faith in the EU project. In her speech she said: One consequence of the Brexit vote has been to strengthen the unity and the faith in Europe as a project for the common good. The truth is that Brexit has highlighted the value of being together in today’s ever more unsettled world. She praised the contribution of Britons to Europe and to the European Union. She said: Before the ashes of the second world war had even settled, it was Winston Churchill who made the best case for a united Europe. I read out passages from his 1946 Zurich speech the last time I was here – it is the most eloquent and powerful case for the European Union you could ever wish to read .... As president of the European commission, I want to pay tribute today to all those British people who contributed so much to the 45-plus years of EU membership. I think of the British pragmatism and leadership when it came to opening up our union to members of our family who had been out in the cold for so long. The successive EU enlargements were historic steps for our continent and they bear the British hallmark. I think of those who helped to build our institutions. People like Commissioner Arthur Cockfield who was known as the ‘father of the single market’. Or Roy Jenkins, president of the European commission while I was at LSE, who did so much to pave the way for our single currency. I think of the European civil servants of British nationality who devoted their lives and careers to Europe and have done so much to build our Union. She stressed her love for the UK. Speaking about her time as a student at the LSE, she said: I got to know a warm, vibrant, colourful, multicultural society – the likes of which I had not really experienced before. I saw people from different walks of life going out together, enjoying life, breathing in freedom. I immersed myself in this melting pot of cultures, traditions and music. And I truly fell in love with this city and this country. This country, strong-willed, open-minded and big hearted. Proud and patriotic. Kind and generous in spirit. Clive Lewis, the Labour leadership hopeful, has revealed plans for increased cooperation with the Greens if he takes over from Jeremy Corbyn, highlighting what seems likely to be an increasing focus for Labour as it comes to terms with its latest election defeat. Lewis, the Norwich South MP and shadow Treasury minister, said that if he became leader he would seek to work directly with the Greens on a so-called green new deal, the idea of investing heavily to transform the economy on a sustainable basis. He said: We need a new politics of collaboration and openness as the building blocks of the political forces and practices necessary for progressives to take power nationally by 2024 at the latest. The Greens’ sole MP, Caroline Lucas, said she welcomed the idea of cooperation on the green new deal, an idea pioneered in the UK by her party. In practical terms this probably won’t make much difference, for two reasons. Firstly, while the Greens would argue for a more radical reshaping of the economy than Labour, it seems inevitable they would back a Labour green new deal plan in parliament anyway. Also, Lewis is currently seen as an outsider to win the leadership contest. But it is nonetheless a notable move, cementing ideas of the so-called progressive alliance on the left as a way to circumvent the first-past-the-post electoral system. Lewis himself is a notable Labour proponent of proportional representation, which does tend to necessitate closer cross-party collaboration. Speaking to reporters after PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said it was “hard to see” how the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a US drone strike could be justified as a legal action. The spokesman said: Since the assassination of senior officials, generals, or ministers of internationally recognised governments is, on the face of it, entirely illegal in international law, that defence – the defence of an imminent threat – has to be made public for there to be any question of there being legality around it. No such evidence has been forthcoming and, on the face of it, it’s hard to see how that would be the case. But, of course, if that was produced by the US government then that would have to be taken seriously. The spokesman also said if the Iraqi government called for the expulsion of foreign troops then the British government should respect that. Following the decision of the Iraqi parliament by 175 votes to none to request the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Iraq, if that is subsequently requested by the sovereign Iraqi government then that must be respected. If Iraq is a sovereign country, and the British government and the US government have always said that that was their intention following the invasion and occupation of Iraq, then that sovereignty must be respected and if such a request is made then that should be respected. He also said there should be an emergency meeting of the UN security council to de-escalate the crisis. Here is my colleague Lisa O’Carroll’s story on the Ursula von der Leyen speech. And this is how it starts. The president of the European commission has said it will be “impossible” for the UK to negotiate a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of Brexit within the timeframe set by Boris Johnson. Speaking before her first face-to-face bilateral meeting with the prime minister in Downing Street on Wednesday, Ursula von der Leyen said the price of the clean-break Brexit the prime minister was pursuing was a “distant” partnership with the EU. Unless the UK accepted a level playing field in the UK and EU’s trade positions after Brexit, there would inevitably be barriers for British manufacturing, she said in a speech at the London School of Economics. Labour leadership hopeful Clive Lewis has said he cannot think of any reason why he would authorise the use of Britain’s nuclear weapons should he ever become prime minister. In an interview on Wednesday morning, the former shadow defence minister said he did not believe the country needed nuclear weapons and that they did not act as a deterrent. Speaking on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show about whether he would ever “press the nuclear button”, Lewis said: I couldn’t conceive of any circumstance where I would. Think about what you’re doing, you’re wiping out millions of women and children and probably consigning the planet to perpetual night, darkness, death, famine, destruction. Why would any politician want to boast about pushing the nuclear destruction of billions of people on this planet? I find that quite difficult. I could not conceive of a situation where I would push the button. The former infantry officer, who served on a three-month tour in Afghanistan in 2009, said the party was committed to paying for the renewal of the deterrent. However, he said his personal opinion was that were other means of defending the UK should it be threatened by a nuclear power. Jeremy Corbyn has been a long-standing opponent of nuclear weapons but in November he said Britain’s Vanguard submarine fleet, based at Faslane in Scotland, would continue if he became PM but would be part of the “equation” when it came to non-proliferation discussions. Lewis said: “Our party policy is to renew [the nuclear deterrent].” Asked how he would mark Corbyn out of 10 (in the light of Rebecca Long Bailey’s awarding Corbyn “10 out of 10” on Tuesday), Lewis said he would give Corbyn six out of 10 for his performance during the election. “It wouldn’t be 10 out of 10. I would say maybe six out of 10,” he said. He explained: There were mistakes made in terms of our position on Brexit and actually sticking to a position and understanding this was a rightwing, hard-right project and we should have stuck to our guns on our position from 2016. That’s one of my own personal views. Stronger and better leadership was needed on antisemitism, he said, as well as a better strategy during the election campaign. The individual policies in the manifesto were correctly “radical”, he said, but it needed to be explained that they would take place over several years and not all in one go. Who won? Well, it was obviously Sir Lindsay Hoyle, because he has transformed PMQs, getting it back down to a brisk, 30-minute event, instead of the sprawling fixture it was under John Bercow normally lasting the best part of an hour. Whether or not this is a good thing or a bad thing, it is probably too early to tell, but it means that Hoyle has stamped his authority on the place. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were clearly warned in advance that they weren’t going to be allowed to talk as much as in the Bercow era, and both questions and answers were tighter than in the past. It was the first time Johnson has spoken in public about the Iran crisis – in fact, it was the first time he has spoken in public on anything in 2020 - and he came out with about the strongest endorsement heard so far from the UK government of the US decision to assassinate the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Suleimani had supplied “improvised explosive devices to terrorists, which I’m afraid killed and maimed British troops”, he said. “That man had the blood of British troops on his hands.” But even in this answer he avoided saying outright that the US attack was lawful, and overall Johnson sounded like someone who would rather be commenting on other matters, not this one. (See 10.14am.) Corbyn has spent his life denouncing US warmongering and last week it felt as if President Trump’s decision to order the killing of Suleimani vindicated everything the Labour leader has ever said about Washington being a threat to the world order. But he did not make that case very well at PMQs, and Johnson successfully brushed him aside. Ministers can’t say clearly that they think the killing of Suleimani was a wise thing to do (presumably because they don’t think it was – their support has been quite qualified) and they seem to have some doubts about the legality of the operation too. But it would have taken sustained, forensic questioning to get this to show up at PMQs, and Corbyn did not pull that off. He is obviously right about Johnson being nervous about criticising Trump in public. But British prime ministers are always wary of criticising US presidents, and so Corbyn’s attempt to link this to sensitivities around a US trade deal was unconvincing. But with the date for his departure already set, Corbyn could be forgiven for not operating at full pelt. Johnson seemed relatively disengaged in their exchanges too, and his anti-Corbyn put-downs felt rather underpowered. He seemed much more animated arguing with Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, but that is not surprising; looking ahead over the next five years, Scotland will be much more of a threat to his premiership than Corbyn. Labour’s Karl Turner asks about a constituent serving a life sentence. But the constituent was also one of the people who tackled the terrorist in the London Bridge attack. Will the PM congratulate him? Johnson says he hopes this gallantry is respected in the usual way. And that’s it. PMQs is over. The SNP’s Douglas Chapman says the SNP’s mandate is much stronger than Johnson’s. He says the Scottish government has an “oven-ready” plan for an independence referendum. When will discussions begin? Johnson says he has already addressed this. Asked what he has done to restore the Iran nuclear deal, Johnson says the UK still thinks the JCPOA is the best way forward. He says he thinks that way forward will remain. It is a shell at the moment. But it is a shell into which substance can be put. Labour’s Colleen Fletcher asks Johnson to support a new walk-in centre for Coventry. Johnson refers this one to the health secretary too, saying he is sure he will be able to do something about it. Dehenna Davison, a new Conservative MP, asks about the NHS. Johnson congratulates Davison on her election victory. He says the health secretary is looking into the matter raised by Davison. Shailesh Vara, a Conservative, asks the PM if he agrees that overseas companies would invest in Northern Ireland if the assembly were revived. Johnson says the UK is the third highest recipient of inward investment in the world. Northern Ireland could get more with the assembly up and running, he says. David Morris, a Conservative, says the north of England needs an Eden project. Does the PM support it going to Morecambe? Johnson says Sajid Javid, the chancellor, tells him the Eden project is “very likely” to come to Morecombe. The SNP’s Brendan O’Hara says Margaret Thatcher and other Tory leaders accepted the union with Scotland would only survive by consent. What mechanism is available to the Scottish people to give their consent to maintaining the union, he says. Johnson says the Scottish people had a mechanism, they used it in 2014, and it was a once-in-a-generation vote, he says. Labour’s Ian Murray asks Johnson to accept that he will be responsible for any negative consequences from Brexit. Johnson says, contrary to the claims of doomsters, unemployment is at a record low. He will get Brexit done, he says. Johnson says he will chair a new cabinet committee to drive forward change on climate change. Plaid Cymru’s Hywel Williams asks what the PM’s vision is for the relationship between Wales and England. Johnson says he wants it to go from strength to strength. Paul Holmes, a Conservative, asks about a Lib Dem housing plan for Eastleigh. Johnson says the government wants more home on brownfield sites. Fiona Bruce, a Conservative, asks what the government will do to support troubled families? Johnson says it was thanks to Bruce that “family hubs” were proposed in the Tory manifesto. They will be introduced, he says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks: who should decide the future of Scotland – the PM, or the people of Scotland? Johnson says the people of Scotland decided to stay part of the UK. Blackford says this is about democracy. That provokes some laughter from MPs. Blackford says people voted for the SNP. Why is the Tory government dismissing the will of the people of Scotland? Johnson says the real question is why the SNP keeps going on about breaking up the most successful union in history to distract from its appalling domestic record. Penny Mordaunt, a Conservative, asks how many people are being held in inappropriate adult social care settings, like Winterbourne View. Johnson says the number is 2,190, but it is coming down. Corbyn says he asked if the UK would respect the sovereignty of Iraq. He says Johnson did not answer. He says the UK has not been putting the interests of the UK first. He says Johnson has been prioritising his relationship with President Trump. He is not standing up for the UK because he has prioritised a trade deal with the US. Johnson says he was waiting for the “little green men” to come out at the end of Corbyn’s contribution, implying that Corbyn is reciting a conspiracy. He says Corbyn took £10,000 from Iranian TV. He says he is surprised the Corbyn has yet to condemn Suleimani’s activities. Johnson says the British government should be doing everything it can to protect the integrity of Iraq. Corbyn asks what evidence there is that the killing of Suleimani was legal. Johnson says it is not for the UK government to provide this evidence. But he refers to Suleimani’s record. He says Suleimani helped orchestrate bomb attacks on British troops in the region. He had the blood of British troops on his hands, he says. Corbyn asks what representations the PM will make to President Trump to make sure the Iranian foreign minister can attend the UN in New York. Johnson says the US is obliged to let people attend the UN. Jeremy Corbyn starts by paying tribute to Andrew Miller, the former Labour MP who died on Christmas Eve. He says the Australian fires are a warning of what climate change does. He asks the PM to confirm that he opposes any further retaliation or violence in the Middle East. Johnson says of course he can confirm that. He says the UK has been working with its EU allies to urge a de-escalation. But he says the EU three criticised the “baleful” role played by Qassem Suleimani. He says Corbyn has not condemned Suleimani in the same way. Corbyn ignores this, and asks Johnson if is he confident that UK personnel in the region are safe. Johnson says non-essential personnel have been moved. The government wants to de-escalate this, he says. Andrew Lewer, a Conservative, asks for a review of the rules affecting benefit claimants with terminal illnesses. Johnson says the DWP is reviewing these rules. Boris Johnson starts by condemning the Iranian attacks on US bases. He says Iran should not pursue these attacks. He offers condolences to those affected by the Australian bushfires, and by the crash of a Ukrainian airliner. Boris Johnson is taking PMQs now. Q: Would it be possible to negotiate parts of a trade deal this year, and then conclude it after 2020? Or is it all or nothing? Von der Leyen says it will be “impossible” to conclude a comprehensive deal by the end of this year. It is impossible to negotiate all of what I have been mentioning [in 2020] ... Therefore we will have to prioritise. She says therefore they should prioritise negotiating on issues where, if there is no deal by the end of 2020, there is a fall-back that does not involve “no deal”. Von der Leyen says getting a comprehensive UK-EU trade deal by the end of 2020 will be “impossible”. She says she would like both sides to consider where they are before the summer, so that they can “reconsider the timeframe”. Von der Leyen says she does not want to rule out extending the trade talks beyond 2020. Johnson has ruled this out. Here is the full text of the Von der Leyen speech. Ursula von der Leyen is now taking questions – from students in the audience, and from journalists. Q: Are you concerned about the UK watering down its protections for EU nationals living in the UK after Brexit? How should the UK respond? Von der Leyen says of course this is a pressing issue. She says there are around 3.5 million EU nationals living in the UK, and around 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries. The good news is people will be able to stay where they work and live until the end of their lives, she says. Q: What will the security arrangements be like after Brexit? Von der Leyen says the UK will be a third country after Brexit. There are rules that prevent third countries being involved in agencies like the European Defence Agency. But these rules are being reviewed. She says she wants the EU to be clear-minded, and for it to build an unprecedented security partnership. Talking about relations with China, Von der Leyen says it is important for the EU to be very clear on issues where it disagrees with China. For example, the cybersphere. But on other issues, like climate change, the two sides have the same agenda. Here is some Twitter commentary on the speech from Peter Foster, the Daily Telegraph’s Europe editor. Von der Leyen says Brexit does not just mark the end of something. It marks the beginning of a new relationship, she says. Addressing her audience, she says young people can shape this future. Von der Leyen says the EU’s priority will be to protect the single market. But she says the EU is willing to offer a trade deal including zero tariffs, zero quotas, and zero dumping. It can go well beyond trade and be “unprecedented in scope”, she says. She says the EU is willing to work day and night to achieve this. It must be ambitious in scope, she says. Here is the key quote. Von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will still share the same values after Brexit, as well as the same geography and history. As one door closes, another will open, she says. She says now is the time to look forward, time “for the best and oldest friends to build a new future together”. She says during the first stage of the Brexit negotiations, the uncertainty about whether Brexit would happen caused difficulties. Now there will be more clarity, she says. She says the EU wants to go as far as it can in building the new relationship. But the relationship will not be as close as before. Without free movement of people, you cannot have free movement of capital and services, she says. And without a level playing field, the UK cannot have full access to the single market. She says both sides will have to prioritise in the talks. Von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will still be “the best of friends and partners” after Brexit. And they will still have a lot to learn from each other. Von der Leyen is now paying tribute to the contribution of individual Britons to the EU, like Roy Jenkins, a former president of the commission, and Lord Cockfield, a European commissioner. Cockfield helped to pave the way for the single market, she says. Ursula von der Leyen is speaking now. She says she spent just a year at the LSE, but she learned a lot while she was here. The time she spent here “opened my eyes”, she says. She saw a warm, vibrant, multicultural society. She fell in love with London, and with the UK. The UK is strong-willed, open-minded, patriotic, kind and generous, and full of contradictions, she says. She says she learned there can be a hidden meaning in every sentence. Before and after the referendum she thought about this period a lot – not just because of her love for the UK, but because of what the UK has contributed to Europe. She says it was Winston Churchill who made the best case for a united Europe. She says his Zurich speech is the best case made for a united Europe. At the LSE Minouche Shafik, the LSE director, is introducing Ursula von der Leyen. Shafik says that Von der Leyen was a student of the LSE, and that her daughter has studied there too. Sir Keir Starmer has become the first Labour leadership candidate to get the 22 nominations from MPs that he needs to be on the ballot, Sky’s Sam Coates reports. But Starmer, and all the other candidates, will also need to clear the threshold from nominations either from CLPs or from affiliates. The details of those rules are here. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European commission, is due to start her lecture at the LSE on UK-EU relations very soon. From Politico Europe’s Cristina Gallardo Yesterday Rebecca Long Bailey, a candidate for the Labour leadership, said she would give Jeremy Corbyn 10 out of 10 as a leader. On Sky News a few minutes ago Margaret Hodge, the Labour former minister and one of Corbyn’s most outspoken critics in the PLP, said this was “crazy”. Hodge, who is supporting Jess Phillips for leader, told the programme: I think Rebecca Long Bailey would be a disaster for the Labour party ... For Rebecca Long Bailey to give 10 out of 10 to Corbyn when we’ve all come back from the election where on the doorstep Corbyn was a huge problem, to deny that is crazy. And to say that it’s all the media’s fault is an insult to the intelligence of the electorate. What was so interesting about this election was that people sussed what Labour was about in the offer we were giving, and they voted against it. If you don’t hear that, if you don’t listen to that, you are actually condemning the Labour party to history. Labour MPs are currently listening to candidates for the deputy leadership speak at a private hustings organised by the parliamentary Labour party (PLP). One of the candidates is Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, and according to extracts from his speech released by his office, he is saying that he would like to be a campaigning deputy leader in the style of John Prescott. Burgon says: Whoever is leader – I’ll be a team player. I don’t see this job as an alternative pole to the leader. Or as leader in-waiting. It’s important in its own right. When I joined the party back in the mid-90s, I was impressed by how John Prescott used it as a campaigning role. I’ll be a campaigning deputy leader, one focused on getting us election-ready to win local, mayoral and devolved elections – but most importantly to win that next general election. One focused on powerful local campaigning to demonstrate to those communities, whose trust we’ve lost, that we’re on their side. The reference to a “leader-in-waiting” deputy will be seen as a jibe at Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, who is seen as favourite in the deputy leadership contest. Some of her supporters think that she would be a good leader now, and that if she wins the deputy leadership, that will put her in a strong position to take the top job next time round. Burgon’s speech also repeats some of the points he made in his pre-Christmas Tribune article, saying Labour’s election defeat was largely down to Brexit and that a special commission should be set up to consider how it can win back leave voters. In an interview this morning Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, rejected claims that Boris Johnson should have taken a higher public profile over the Iran crisis. Although No 10 has issued statements, Johnson has not been speaking about it in public, and yesterday he got Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, to give an oral statement to the Commons on the subject, instead of doing it himself. But Barclay said it was not fair to say Johnson had been absent. He said: The prime minister has been engaging, he has been speaking on a regular basis with world leaders, he is continuing to do that today, as are my colleagues across government. According to Annabelle Dickson at Politico Europe, Johnson is deliberately keeping a low profile on this issue. In her story she says: According to officials familiar with the thinking in Downing Street, the prime minister’s decision to delegate the foreign policy spotlight to other cabinet ministers – leaving Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to do the flagship media interviews and Wallace to face MPs in the Commons — is deliberate. It is also a sign of things to come. The prime minister will make domestic priorities such as the UK’s public health care system, the National Health Service, and rebalancing the economy toward the north of England and the Midlands his public focus, according to one official. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has caught up with yesterday’s news that the government is looking for a career civil servant to replace Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington. Farage used to claim that he did not want the job himself, despite Donald Trump once saying he would be ideal for the role, but judging from this tweet, perhaps he was still hoping that he, or one of his Brexit party chums, would get the call. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has been giving interviews this morning (although not to the BBC’s Today programme, which is still subject to a No 10 boycott for reasons that have never been properly explained by Downing Street). Judging by the interviews I did hear, Today didn’t miss much, but Barclay did use a new argument to justify the government’s claim that it will be possible to conclude a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020. This is what he told Radio 5 Live: When you say there needs to be this much time for parliamentary scrutiny and so forth, just look at what happened in the House of Commons yesterday. When I was involved in the withdrawal agreement bill in the previous parliament, I was constantly being told that there needed to be much more time for parliamentary scrutiny, that the House of Commons needed to be able to go through the bill in great detail, that it was a very significant bill, and that the time put forward by the government was insufficient. We had time yesterday in parliament that was not used. We had additional time available for scrutiny of the bill, and yet we actually finished the scrutiny early because the house did not want to go into more detail. So people speculate as to how much time is needed. I’m optimistic about the deal. Both sides have said they want to have a close partnership. The commission president is here as part of that commitment and discussion on the EU side. Barclay is right about the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill debate taking much less time than expected yesterday. Eight hours had been set aside for the first day of the committee stage debate. Yet MPs started voting after less than three and a half hours of debate. There were three divisions but the government won them all, with majorities of 90, 86 and 92 respectively. The era of knife-edge Brexit votes is well and truly behind us. The BBC’s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has posted a helpful thread on Twitter about the talks between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street today. It starts here. It is worth reading the thread in full (just click on the link above), but here is a key assessment. One of Boris Johnson’s ambitions for 2020, apparently, is to turn Brexit into a story for the business pages and not the front pages (assuming he fails in his reported ambition to get people to stop using the word altogether). You might think some of the Brexiters have concluded that the whole process hasn’t been quite the triumph that some of them were predicting in 2016. But it would be surprising if the UK-EU trade negotiating taking place this year does not end up being a front page story and, although that negotiation is not starting today, there will be an important landmark in the process when Boris Johnson holds his first meeting with the new president of the European commission, the former German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen. They will meet in Downing Street this afternoon, a few hours after Von der Leyen delivers a lecture on the UK-EU relationship at the LSE. According to Downing Street, Johnson will tell Von der Leyen that he is firmly committed to wrapping up the negotiation this year (which many experts think is unrealistic), that he is firmly opposed to extending the post-Brexit transition period and that the new deal will not be based on “alignment” with EU rules. In a statement last night Downing Street said: At the leaders’ first face to face meeting since Von der Leyen took office in December, the prime minister is expected to stress the importance of agreeing a confident and positive future relationship by the end of December 2020. He is expected to tell President Von der Leyen that, having waited for over three years to get Brexit done, both British and EU citizens rightly expect negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement (FTA) to conclude on time. There will be no extension to the implementation period, which will end in December 2020 as set out in the political declaration. The withdrawal agreement bill enshrines this in UK law. The prime minister will likely underline that the upcoming negotiations will be based on an ambitious FTA, not on alignment. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports, Von der Leyen is expected to tell Johnson that this might not be as beneficial for the UK as he thinks. Von der Leyen and Johnson will not be holding a press conference, and so it is not clear quite how much we will learn about what gets said at their meeting, but I will be covering everything that does emerge in full. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Candidates for the Labour party deputy leadership take part in a private hustings for Labour MPs in the Commons. 10am: MPs start voting in a ballot to elect two deputy Speakers. These two posts are both for Conservative MPs, and there are five candidates. 11.15am: Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, gives a speech at the LSE in London entitled “Old Friends, New Beginnings: building another future for the EU-UK partnership.” 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 12.30pm: MPs resume their debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. 3.30pm: Von der Leyen meets Johnson in Downing Street. The Iran crisis is likely to come up at PMQs, and of course I will be covering what gets said there, but generally I will be leaving coverage of developments in this story to our separate live blog, which you can read here. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up.

Wind turbines are also far more popular than fracking or nuclear power, contrasting with the UK government’s decision to block onshore windfarms but back shale gas exploration and new nuclear power plants. The ComRes poll, conducted for climate change charity 10:10, found that 73% of the British public supported onshore windfarms, with just 17% opposed, and the rest not sure. Strong support remained even when only considering the views of those from rural areas, who might live near windfarms: 65% support versus 25% against. However, when people were asked what level of support they thought windfarms had across the country, just one in 10 said it was more than 70%. The average level of support estimated by people was just 42%, far below the true figure. Research for 10:10 conducted by Imperial College London showed that more than two-thirds of newspaper comment and editorial articles in the last five years were negative overall about windfarms. “The UK public love wind power and they don’t even realise,” said Max Wakefield, at 10:10, which launched its Blown Away campaign on Thursday. “It’s plainly not true onshore wind is unpopular with the UK public. It’s time our politicians caught up. Onshore wind is already the cheapest tool we have to achieve energy independence, keep bills under control and tackle climate change.” The government’s own polling has consistently shown that renewable energy has 75-80% public support. But the Conservative victory in 2015, with 37% of the vote, has all but ended onshore windfarm developments, fulfilling a manifesto pledge to do so. The new poll showed even stronger public support for solar energy - 83% for and 8% against - but ministers have slashed solar subsidies. Fracking was supported by 34% and opposed by 45% in the poll. Ministers overruled Lancashire council earlier in October to grant permission for shale gas exploration, leading to accusations of double standards, as local communities have the final say over windfarm applications. Nuclear power was supported by 46% in the new poll and opposed by 37%. In September, the prime minister, Theresa May, gave the go-ahead for a new heavily subsidised nuclear plant at Hinkley in Somerset. Offshore windfarms, which are supported by ministers, are also popular with the public, with 80% supporting and 10% opposing. The ComRes poll interviewed 2,037 British adults online on 12-13 October 2016 and data were weighted to be representative of all British adults."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jan/28/edf-hinckley-point-nuclear-reactor-contractors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-28T19:00:52Z","webTitle":"EDF tells contractors to restart work on Hinkley Point, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/28/edf-hinckley-point-nuclear-reactor-contractors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jan/28/edf-hinckley-point-nuclear-reactor-contractors","fields":{"headline":"EDF tells contractors to restart work on Hinkley Point, report says","bodyText":"EDF has told contractors at Hinkley Point to restart “unconstrained spending” in anticipation of the £18bn nuclear plant obtaining the final green light within days. The instructions to suppliers, reported by the industry magazine Building, comes despite EDF’s unwillingness to press the last investment button at a board meeting on Wednesday. The state-owned French group delayed the decision after last-minute pressure from its investors and unions over the cost of the scheme, but contractors in Somerset are being told to restart work, which stopped in April last year. A source told Building: “EDF used the words ‘unconstrained spending’ to the supply chain to get the project moving. By ‘unconstrained’ they mean ‘we’re going to go on as if a decision has been made’.” Another source said: “EDF asked us ‘if we release the budget to you, what will you do with it?’ We told them what we would do with it, and they said ‘get your plans ready to start spending this’.” But the company, which is 85% owned by the French government, is reported by the financial daily Les Echos to be leaning on ministers to help with the demands of financing Hinkley, even though the Chinese have promised to take a 33% stake. EDF had earlier let it be known that it wanted to reduce its stake in all the existing British reactors it owns from 80% to 50% by bringing in other private investors. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has made clear that it does not want to increase its holdings from 20%. Despite all this, the EDF chief executive, Jean Bernard Lévy, has twice within the past week reiterated his belief that the company is ready to proceed with Hinkley Point. The company is now believed to be aiming for 16 February, when a board meeting and the reporting of annual financial figures are scheduled. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it is still confident of a positive decision. EDF is already struggling to cope with a raft of extra demands that have been imposed on it, most recently the takeover of its financially troubled engineering partner Areva. EDF has also been told to upgrade its 58 nuclear plants in France in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident in Japan, at a possible cost of £40bn, when it is burdened with a £28bn debt mountain. In addition, there have been delays and cost overruns at another EDF new-build project in Flamanville, northern France. Flamanville and Hinkley would use the same European pressurised reactor technology. Another European scheme involving these reactors, at Olkiluoto in Finland, is also10 years behind its target opening time. Despite the delays, a market source said suppliers – which include heavyweight contractors Kier, Laing O’Rourke and Bouygues – will already be “gearing up” to deliver the work following the instruction from EDF. The source told Building: “The indications [EDF is] giving suggest they just want to get on with the project. They haven’t secured any additional funding. They’re telling people to get on with it now and hoping they can fix the balance sheet later.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2019/jul/02/parliament-coalition-labor-morrison-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-02T07:42:24Z","webTitle":"'Stop Adani': protester disrupts opening of parliament – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/02/parliament-coalition-labor-morrison-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/02/parliament-coalition-labor-morrison-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"'Stop Adani': protester disrupts opening of parliament – as it happened","bodyText":"And on that note, we will wrap up the blog for the day. Tomorrow, it is all about Bob Hawke, so most of the actual parliament work will be delayed until Thursday. But it looks like the government has its tax plan ready to pass, so it’ll just have another day to lock that in. After that? Well, you saw the legislation list. And you also saw the RBA announcement. There’s some rough waters ahead. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers and the Guardian brains trust for dragging me through another day. And to all of you who messaged and commented. It means a lot. We will be back bright and early tomorrow morning – as always, take care of you. We seem to be missing one. And some final images of the day from Mike Bowers Dutton continued: The United Kingdom has had a system operating in relation to temporary exclusion orders which allows the minister in the UK as we would propose here to exclude citizens for a period of up to two years and it would be us building on the tools we have already to deal with people we think pose a serious threat to Australians.” Which sounds like Dutton wants to stop someone from returning to Australia: Without talking about the specific case, what the government proposes with the temporary exclusion order is the ability for a person to be excluded, prevented from turning back from Syria or Iraq, for example, or two years. It allows us more time to manage individuals. When some people come back, it is very difficult to gather the evidence that would be admissible in a court of law in Australia to convict that person beyond reasonable doubt so we need to make sure that we got every tool available to us to keep Australian safe and people coming back from theMiddle East who have either been members of Islamic State or trained in the art of terrorism otherwise, they pose a very significant threat and would seem that in our own region, in Indonesia, in Europe and across North America, right around the world. This is a significant threat in the Australian Government wants to keep people safe and that’s why we think this bill should be supported on a bipartisan basis. Peter Dutton is speaking on the arrests of three Sydney people on terror charges: Since the terrorist threat level was raised on the 12 September 2014, this is now the 16th major counterterrorism interruption. I want to truly pay tribute all of those police officers. I want to highlight the incredible partnership that exists between the Australian federal police, the New South Wales police and Asio and other agencies involved in keeping Australians safe. Collaboration and partnership is an important reason why we brought together the Department of Home Affairs. As you’d be aware, earlier today, through the party room of the joint party, we were able to have agreement from the party to introduce legislation into the parliament this Thursday of a temporary exclusion order bill. This is incredibly important because it will be alleged in relation to one of the individuals arrested and charged today that he returned from overseas as an Australian citizen and obviously, given his activities alleged to have been involved in over the course of the last 12 months, it’s resulted in his arrest today. We obviously have a very serious threat in this country. The fact that 16 attempted terrorist attacks are being disrupted in our country’s the Australian public that this threat is not diminished, it’s not going away and it remains current, particularly when we got Australians overseas in a theatre of war being trained by Islamic State or inspired on line and we want to deal with those people as best we can. Anthony Albanese says the second rate cut is a “cry for help” from the RBA and an “absolutely dire” situation being painted by the reserve bank. He points to the RBA’s comment on the protracted period of low wage growth as a reason for the economic growth slowdown. Albanese says that has come at the same time as penalty rate cuts. “What this does is build our case,” he says, about Labor’s demand to bring the stage-two tax cuts (that are already legislated) and delay the third tranche. Conservative Zed Seselja popped up on Afternoon Briefing to explain why he believes those with religious beliefs should be able to express their views, but secular companies can not necessarily uphold their own values: Nobody is drawing conclusions as to what will be in the legislation. I will leave that to Christian to lead the process. We are grappling with the ability of organisations to exist, faith -based organisations as you point to to be able to continue to be faith -based organisations, and when we are talking about faith -based schools for instance, there are a plethora of choices that people have. You can choose to go to a pretty conservative Christian school, you can choose to go to a much less conservative church base or Christian school, you can choose an Islamic school, a school run by members of the Jewish community or an independent school where there is no faith basis. There is a lot of choice in that space, I would like parents to continue to have those choices, when it comes to, I guess, these questions around how we deal with public figures who have expressed a view, and in the case of Israel Folou, a sportsman who has expressed a view that has nothing to do with his day job which is being a football player, you get into a more complex area. I would say again that I don’t think any law will easily fix this, I think we should pursue laws that protect against unfair treatment, but no law will perfectly be able to deal with these issues and I think it would be better in most cases if we could get together and talk and agree and sometimes they will be differences of opinion, and there will be differences of opinion within organisation and people should coexist Vale Nola Marino’s whip career https://twitter.com/AboutTheHouse/status/1145934534417899526 Anthony Albanese is headed over to the Sky studios to talk interest rate cuts – and how that has vindicated Labor’s position on the tax cuts (the bringing it forward bit). Having a very quick re-read of all of that, there didn’t seem to be a lot new in that speech – most of it was announced in the budget, with a few of the add ons from the election campaign. We also have the legislation list: 1 - Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Relief So Working Australians Keep More Of Their Money) Bill 2 - Road Vehicle Standards Legislation Amendment Bill 3 - Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 4 - Criminal Code Amendment (Agricultural Protection) Bill 5 - Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment (Sunsetting of Special Powers Relating to Terrorism Offences) Bill 6 - Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 7 - Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 8 - Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 9 - Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 10 - Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendment Bill Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill At the end, a middle-aged man stood up in the public gallery and started yelling at the chamber to act on climate change. “Action is hope, look at Greta Thunberg, stop Adani,” he yelled, as he was removed by security. That was happening as the same time the canons were going off to mark the official, official opening of the parliament. Yes, the governor-general reads the sub-heads. Conclusion The opening of a new parliament marks a new chapter in our country’s history. It marks an opportunity for our nation’s elected members and senators to come together to tackle important new issues, and to view existing challenges with fresh eyes. Democracy is a robust undertaking, and disagreement is a fundamental part of that contest of ideas. As the prime minister has often noted, the challenge of modern democracies is not to disagree less, but to disagree better. That is best achieved when members and senators focus on the lives, welfare and opportunities of the people of Australia. It is their welfare and their security which is the unifying force of this great institution. I wish you all well as you proceed in the service of our good and decent country. And with those words it is my duty and my very great pleasure to declare the 46th Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia open. Online crime and safety The way we live our lives is constantly changing. Social media and online platforms are a bigger part of our lives than ever. They also bring with them new challenges and new dangers. My government will crack down on social media providers, online predators and trolls, to better protect children and the broader community. These measures will build on the world-leading protections Australia already has in place. The rules that apply in the real world must also apply to our life online. A new online safety act will be developed to ensure our regulation keeps pace with technological change. Penalties for online harassment will be increased and new aggravated offences introduced for the worst categories of online crimes. New offences will be introduced for providing electronic services to facilitate dealing with child abuse material and for grooming activity; and my government will re-introduce legislation to impose mandatory minimum sentences for child sex offences. My government will also invest $156m in protecting all Australians from cyber-attacks that harm individuals, businesses and our national security. The Cyber Resilience and Workforce Package will ensure we create the cyber workforce we need for the future; counter the capability of foreign cyber criminals; and expand assistance to the community to fight against malicious online criminals. Ending Violence Against Women Combating violence against women and children remains an important priority, as part of my Government’s plan to keep Australians safe. The commonwealth will make a $328m investment into prevention and frontline services as part of the Fourth Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. Tackling the scourge of domestic violence is a community responsibility and my government will continue to work with the states, territories and non-government sector to deliver lasting change to prevent and reduce family, domestic and sexual violence. Older Australians My government will continue to prioritise better support for the people who made this country what it is today – older Australians. It will establish a new aged care workforce research centre to find new ways to deliver care for older Australians and appropriate training for aged care providers, as well as ensuring the aged care workforce grows to meet increasing demand. My government also recognises that not all older Australians need care, but many find themselves spending long days alone and simply need a friend. With that in mind, it will invest $10m in a program to keep senior Australians connected to their communities and to one another. Loneliness is a terrible thing, never more so than toward the end of a full and well-lived life. My government is committed to doing more to ensure that the people to whom this nation owes the greatest debt have the chance to live fulfilled and more connected lives. Through the Royal Commission into Aged Care as well as the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, Australians will have a clearer idea about the quality of services and care that needs to be provided to some of our most vulnerable citizens. Indigenous Australians My government will continue to prioritise the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. For the first time in Australian history, an Aboriginal member of this parliament will have responsibility for policy affecting Indigenous peoples. Congratulations to the member for Hasluck and on behalf of all Australians I wish you every good fortune in your endeavours. I also congratulate the member for Barton on her appointment as the Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians and wish her the best as well. My government has also bolstered its commitment to First Australians by creating a new agency – the National Indigenous Australians Agency – to oversee all policy and programs related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This new agency is part of the prime minister’s portfolio, ensuring that its important work is overseen at the most senior levels of Government. The agency is tasked to deliver on the revised Closing the Gap targets that drive improved outcomes for Indigenous Australians. Priority will be placed on practical efforts to ensure Indigenous children are healthy and in school; that they can live safely in their communities; that we confront the terrible curse of youth suicide in remote communities; that we improve employment outcomes; and ensure that Indigenous Australians can expect the same from life in Australia as any other citizen. My government will also continue to work to find consensus on a way forward for constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians and develop ground-up governance models for enhanced, inclusive and local decision-making on issues impacting the lives of Indigenous Australians. Rural and regional Australians For many Australians, living in a rural and regional area is not only a way of life, it informs the very core of their identity. Regional and rural Australians provide much of the food we eat and the fibres we wear; they work in the industries that produce export income to help our economy thrive. Like all Australians, those in the bush are resilient, self-reliant and aspirational – but they’re also hit harder than most by unexpected events. Earlier this year, nature flung its worst at North Queenslanders, and they are demonstrating their resilience and strong character as they rebuild and recover. The government’s focus is on assisting local communities to continue that recovery. Though we would all like it to be otherwise, drought conditions are not expected to ease in the short term. One of the first orders of business of this 46th Parliament will be to legislate the $3.9bn Future Drought Fund. That funding must be a priority to help better manage drought, protect our valuable rural industries and the people who make them possible. My government will also introduce a new suite of measures to support farmers, their families and rural communities to continue to battle drought, floods and natural disasters. Concessional loans will be available for re-stocking and replanting to help farmers bounce back when the rain returns. And the farm asset threshold will be permanently raised to $5m to allow more people to access the farm household allowance. My government wants to encourage new farmers. That’s why it is establishing a new concessional loan product to help farmers to buy their first farm. My government will also prioritise legislation to criminalise the invasion of rural properties and the incitement of violence that too often leads to such behaviour. It is also committed to eliminating mobile phone black spots across one million square kilometres of this country. It will also do more to support university and vocational education students to stay in their local communities by providing five additional regional study hubs. And to improve the health of people living outside our cities, 13 new regional cancer centres will be opened, and 3,000 more doctors and the same number of nurses will be supported into regional general practice in the decade ahead. New medical treatments and medicines will also be delivered through clinical trials in regional, rural and remote areas. My government’s promise is to govern for all Australians and that promise includes those of us living in our most rural and remote communities. Environment Caring for our environment and conserving it for the future is an integral part of meeting our intergenerational obligation to future Australians. My Government will improve soil health, protect threatened species and restore wetlands by investing $1 billion for Phase 2 of the National Landcare Program. It is also investing $1.2 billion in the future health of the Great Barrier Reef. These efforts include improving water quality, combating crown of thorns starfish and undertaking vital research. My Government is determined to reduce waste and increase recycling. We will work closely with industry on achieving needed change. This includes supporting a phase-out of microbeads from personal care and cosmetic products, and working with the packaging industry to ensure 100 per cent of Australian packaging is recyclable, compostable or reusable by 2025. My Government will also move to take up a global advocacy position with other nations in our region, like Indonesia, on the health of our oceans. Our continent touches both the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Our geography, values, responsibilities and interests demand that we lift our advocacy efforts in this important area. We will use our existing and expanded domestic actions as the basis for our advocacy, to lead by example on this important global environmental agenda. Climate Change My Government understands that Australia must and will continue to take urgent and effective action to address climate change. We will undertake this action as part of a coordinated global effort. We will continue to set and meet responsible and achievable carbon emissions reduction targets and encourage other nations to do likewise. Australia is on track to meet our emissions targets under the Kyoto protocol, and will exceed our target by 367 million tonnes. Australia will meet our 2030 targets under the Government’s Climate Solutions Plan. Energy My Government’s policies will address energy affordability, improve energy reliability and ensure Australia meets its emissions reduction goal. Policies to introduce a default market offer for electricity and ban unconscionable late payment fees commenced yesterday. The default market offer will benefit up to 800,000 Australian families and businesses, providing them with more affordable electricity prices. As well, five million eligible social security recipients will benefit from Energy Assistance Payments of $75 for singles and $125 for couples — assisting them with their next power bill and cost of living expenses. My Government is focused on building the Snowy 2.0 scheme and we are supporting the Battery of the Nation Project and Marinus Link, delivering record investments in new renewable energy for Australians. Foreign Policy My Government will continue to work with international partners to further Australia’s national interest at home and internationally. It is committed to further strengthening our Alliance relationship with the United States in support of our shared interests and values, including through increased US engagement and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. It will seek to create opportunities to expand and deepen Australia’s valued relationship with China — a comprehensive strategic partnership founded on mutual respect and mutual benefit. The Government is fully committed to maintaining the momentum of Australia’s Pacific Step-Up — our strategy to boost engagement with Australia’s Pacific neighbours by strengthening community, economic and security bonds and working in partnership to tackle common challenges. We will intensify efforts to ensure the Indo-Pacific region remains free, open and inclusive, including through deepening engagement and closer cooperation with ASEAN and Australia’s partners in South East and South Asia. Beyond the Indo-Pacific region, my Government will continue to work with like-minded partners to uphold and reinforce the rules based global order, which has served Australia’s interests and fundamental values for nearly 75 years. This will include building interest-based coalitions in international forums to press for further action to tackle challenges posed by terrorist exploitation of the internet and reform of the multilateral rules- based trading system. Security The fight to keep us safe doesn’t only occur on the battlefield. My Government will provide the nation’s security and intelligence agencies with the resources and the legal framework they need to protect us all from terrorism and foreign interference. These agencies have already thwarted 15 major terrorist attacks and we thank them for their ongoing commitment to the safety of all Australians both at home and abroad. And my Government will maintain its absolute commitment to Operation Sovereign Borders to ensure our migration program remains orderly and accountable to all Australians. Defence And Veterans In a period of unprecedented change in our global security environment, nothing is more important to my Government than keeping Australians safe. That’s what the men and women of the Australian Defence Force dedicate their lives to every day. My Government will continue to give our Navy, Army and Air Force the capabilities they need to combat new threats and challenges in the 21st century. In addition to the continuing commitment to restore defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP, my Government will continue to deliver our ambitious Naval Shipbuilding Plan, our Combat Vehicle Program, and our 5th generation Air Force. My Government will ensure the Australian Army is better protected with a new self-propelled Howitzer artillery system. And my Government will not forget our veterans, who have served in our nation’s uniform with courage and dedication. We will keep our promise to our returned servicemen and women, including those who have been involved in the more recent chapters of our military history. If we ask men and women to risk all for our country, then it behooves our nation to do everything we can for them. Our efforts supporting veterans and their families will focus on: improving veterans’ care and support; helping veterans find jobs after their service in uniform is complete; and recognising and respecting the service and sacrifice of veterans and their families. My Government will continue to ensure that veterans and their families are cared for and supported through record investments in mental health care and counselling, which will remain uncapped and demand-driven. But there is always more that we can do to ensure that we are consistently meeting the expectations of our veterans and the wider community, particularly as we fight the scourge of veteran suicide. My Government will continue to work with veterans and the ex-service community to ensure that no veteran ever believes that taking their own life is the only way forward. We will invest in six new veterans’ well-being hubs around the country to ensure those who’ve served have the health and employment services they need when they return home or return to civilian life. Government Services And Payments Every day, the Commonwealth has millions of interactions with citizens through the provision of government services and payments. My Government intends to lift the performance of government service delivery — and will establish Services Australia. Bringing government services together and ensuring those services support people at key stages of their lives — such as having a baby or retiring from work — will underpin the transformation of government service delivery. As more and more Australians choose to engage with government using convenient digital services, my Government will continue to invest in the use of data as a national resource to make better informed decisions, develop innovative solutions to the issues facing citizens and provide improved services. Education This country owes a responsibility to all young Australians to enable them to meet their full potential. From early childhood to university, no Australian child or teenager should be denied opportunity for want of a quality education. Over the next decade, my Government will increase funding for all primary and secondary schools, across all sectors, by an average of 62 per cent per student. This $310 billion investment is a commitment to deliver the world class education system that will equip Australia for the decades ahead. National Disability Insurance Scheme Too often in the past, Australians with disabilities have been on the periphery of our national conversation about health services. Now, having fully funded the National Disability Insurance Scheme and made services available to almost 300,000 people, my Government’s commitment is to extend those services to more than half a million Australians over the next five years. My Government has, for the first time, appointed a Minister especially for the NDIS who will sit at the Cabinet table. The Minister will be dedicated to ensuring Australians with disabilities have the services they need, where and when they need them, and in a way that works for them. Mental Health Each year, one in five Australians aged over 16 experiences mental illness. For young people, that rate is even higher — affecting just over a quarter of those aged between 16 and 24. Tragically, suicide is a leading cause of death for our young people — devastating families, schools and communities in every corner of this nation. That should not be so in our country. We must do more and my Government will. I know this is an issue to which the Prime Minister is strongly and personally committed. My Government will invest almost $740 million in youth mental health and suicide prevention services. Thirty new Headspace centres will be opened to reduce wait times and make more counselling services available to young people, and eight dedicated mental health centres for adults will be trialled. Importantly, more services will be made available in regional and rural areas where the insecurity that comes with every season takes a heavy toll on the mental health of young people and older members of the community alike. My Government will increase support for mental health services for First Australians because too many precious lives are being lost far too early. And my Government will support more post-natal support services to ensure new mothers get the mental health help they need when they most need it, and their children get the best possible start in life. Health My Government’s commitment to a strong economy will enable it to invest in the services all Australians rely on for happier, healthier and more prosperous lives. Services like public hospitals that provide the critical care we all rely on. My Government will invest an extra $31 billion in public hospitals over the next five years — providing funding for more emergency department visits, outpatient services, needed scans and surgeries, and treatments of life-threatening illnesses and diseases. My Government will also invest $308 million to reduce the cost of life-changing medicines for Australians, especially those with chronic health conditions who require multiple medications. From 1 January 2020, the threshold to receive free or discounted medicines will be lowered by 12 prescriptions for pensioners and concession card holders, and by two for non-concession card holders. These investments in the health of all Australians are the dividend of good economic management. My Government’s ability to return the Budget to surplus is also enabling greater investment in mental health — particularly for our young people. Infrastructure. Building new, strong communities requires a commitment to new infrastructure. To building the roads, rail links and airports we need for congestion and make everyday life easier for all Australians. The new western Sydney Nancy Bird Walton international airport as long as transport links to support its operation are being built. It will be a job producing hub for Western Sydney. My government is supporting major infrastructure projects around the country. The Melbourne airport rail link and East-West link to get that great city moving. Fast rail between Geelong and Melbourne to open up new opportunities for businesses and families throughout that busy corridor. Upgrading the Tonkin highway in Perth, fixing the Bruce highway in Queensland. The Buntine highway in the Northern Territory and completing the north-south corridor. In South Australia. And funding for the worst pressure points in congested cities and regional centres right across the nation. My government has committed $100bon to these projects to make life easier for mums and dads in the suburbs and businesses that require transport. Our efforts also include digital infrastructure and by 2020, the rollout of the national broadband network will be complete. My government will further address the issue of congestion in our cities to better match policies with migration for Australia’s needs, easing the pressure on big cities while supporting the growth of smaller cities and regions. Homeownership. More jobs, more money in the pockets of working Australians, together with new support from my government will enable more Australians to realise the dream of owning their own home. Australians work hard to get a foot on the housing market ladder. A home allows individuals, couples and families to create their own economic security. My government believes in homeownership and seeing more Australians in their own homes. My government will use the dividends of a strong economy to make it easier for more Australians to buy their first home. It will introduce the first home loan deposit scheme to help people who want to buy their home, to access finance without having to save a 20% deposit, so they can get into the market more quickly. On the 1 January 2020, first home buyers who have already saved at least 5% of their deposit and to earn up to $125,000 for a single person or $200,000 for couples will be able to get better and earlier access to mortgage finance. My government is also addressing housing affordability by investing $1 billion in local infrastructure to unlock new housing supply. Releasing more suitable commonwealth land for housing development. Reducing barriers for older Australians to downsize from their family homes and enforcing rules on foreign investment in established residential real estate. Jobs With a stronger economy, my government will deliver on its plan to get Australians into more and better paid jobs. An essential part of this plan is ensuring our work places have the skills they need. This means strengthening our vocational education and training systems. My government will address and build on the findings of the Joyce review by setting up a national schools commission and a new national careers institute which will give people the information they need to make the best decisions about their future careers. My government will support its job creation efforts with a $585 million commitment to improving skills and training. Including creating 80,000 new apprenticeships and establishing 10 new industry training hubs in key locations of high youth unemployment in regional Australia. My government will double the apprentice subsidy trial to assist 3200 youngAustralians in regional and rural areas secure the job and qualifications they need to pursue a rewarding career. Australians who wish to return to the workforce will also be supported by a new government program, the midcareer checkpoint. This initiative will support up to 40,000 Australians, particularly women, to return to the workforce. Usually after taking time-out to care for children and older family members. To strengthen investment, my government will undertake renewed regulatory reform and will partner with businesses and identifying barriers, blockages and bottlenecks to investment. Confidence to invest relies on productive and harmonious workplaces. This means tackling lawlessness in work places wherever and whenever it may occur. My government will introduce legislation to deal with registered organisations and individuals who make the law. It will prohibit officials who are not fit and proper persons from holding office and stop the misuse of worker entitlement funds. As well, the minister for industrial relations is reviewing impediments to shared work place gains for employers and employees. This work will be evidence-based. It will protect the rights and entitlements of workers and identify a way forward that will benefit our economy and most importantly the workers who rely on it. My government’s plan for a strong economy begins with sound fiscal policy. This financial year my government is returning the budget to surplus. The first in 12 years. The budget put down in April sets down the government’s plan to deliver surpluses over the forward estimates with $45bn in surpluses over the next four years. Recognising the work that was made in repairing the budget, my government will put more power into the hands of Australians by letting people keep more of what they earn. That is why my government’s first legislative priority will be to provide tax relief to hard-working Australians earning up to $126,000 a year. My government trusts Australians with their own money and wants them to have more of it. That is why my government will lift the threshold for the minimum rate of tax from $37,000 as it is today up to $45,000 from 2022-23 onwards and abolish the second top rate of 37% entirely from 2024-25. Middle tax rate of 32.5% will also be to 30%. This means in five years, 94% of Australian taxpayers will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar in tax and only on their earnings above $45,000 a year. From 2024-25, Australians will be able to increase their earnings and $45,000 up to $200,000 a year without basing an increase in the marginal tax rate. And around 60% of all personal income tax will be paid by the highest earning 20% of taxpayers. My government’s plan for tax relief also includes small, medium and family businesses. By 21-22, the small business tax rate will be 25%. The extension expansion of the instant asset write off will provide the incentive for small businesses to invest in equipment necessary to grow. My government is creating a fairer tax system and one providing more incentives for Australians to work hard and get ahead, enables Australians to exercise more control over how their own money is spent. Regulatory reform and industrial relations. While Australia is on track to achieve 28 years of economic growth, a modern economic wander, there are headwinds. Reductionist sentiments and trade conflicts abroad, drought and flood and a necessary moderation of the housing market at home. An essential driver of growth is cooperative, productive and confident businesses of which investment is an essential outcome. The economy and tax reform. My government believes a strong economy is the foundation of the compact between Australians and their government because a strong economy underpins a stronger society. A strong economy enables more spending on schools and hospitals and allows government to subsidise more medicines, to fund better roads and provide motorsport to Australia’s rural and regional communities and just as importantly, a strong economy makes us more resilient to economic shocks and global headwinds. My government understands you can’t take economic growth for granted and it requires continual work in improving confidence and competitiveness. The government has clear goals based on this. To create 1.2 5 million jobs over the next five years including jobs for 250,000 young Australians. These will build on the additional 1.4 million created over the past 5.5 years, to pay down debt, consistently and responsibly and eliminate net debt by 2030. To see another 250,000 small and family businesses open their doors during the next five years. And to see 10,000 more Australian companies exporting to the world by 2022. With these exporters benefiting from existing and new trade deals which by the end of this term will cover around 90% of our trade. Agenda speech continued: On 18 May 2019, more than 15 million Australians had their say about the future of our country and what they expect for the government and parliament they have elected to serve them for the next three years. Australians quietly going about their own lives, making decisions and taking responsibility for themselves and their families and working to make their community stronger. These hard-working Australians made a simple and humble demand that they are honest and decent aspirations for the future be respected and supported by those they elected. They voted for a government that understands Australians are focused on raising their families, running their businesses, working hard, volunteering and caring for their family and friends. My government was elected on the platform to keep the economy strong and to pursue policies that ensure Australians keep more of the money they work so hard to earn. And to give them more freedom and opportunity to make their own choices about their priorities in life. My government understand that it is individual and collective efforts of the Australians that make our country stronger. That is why the aspirations, efforts and priorities of these Australians will now drive my government’s agenda. Our economy strong, to keep Australians safe and to keep Australians together. Agenda speech: I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land in which we meet and pay my respects to the elders past and present. Emerging leaders and all Aboriginal Torres Strait Islanders gathered here today. Honourable senators and members of the parliament of Australia, once again, we can be very proud of our democracy. We are a free people. We are a nation that has achieved great things and earned a special place in the modern world and the region in which we live. We are home to one of the world’s oldest living cultures. We are blessed with an environment boasting oceans, forests, soils, water, coast, rivers, deserts and other ancient landscapes beyond compare that we must steward responsibly. We are now in our 28th year of uninterrupted economic expansion. More Australians are working than ever before and fewer Australians of working age are dependent on welfare than in generations. Our economic strength has been won by the enterprise, innovation and termination of a hard-working people, especially those running small and family businesses. Our prosperity enables us to deliver one of the world’s most reliable social safety net providing income support, universal healthcare, disability support, aged care and comprehensive education to a growing population regardless of where they live. We are deeply connected into our region, economically, strategically and through our deep historical ties. We have liberalised trade agreements with economies that account for more than 70% of our trade. We are the largest provider of development assistance to the island nations of our Pacific family. Our defence force is respected, not just for its capability, but for its compassion. As it has responded to the many threats and events that have impacted our region. Our security, law enforcement, border protection and emergency relief agencies keep Australians safe in an often unpredictable world in the face of fierce natural disasters. We are one of the world’s oldest democracies. Our freedom has produced a cohesive society that makes us the most successful immigrant and multicultural nation on earth. GG David Hurley has begun the speech in the great tradition of former generals turned monarch surrogates - very, very dryly The governor general is still being totally extra and sending the Usher of the Black Rod to summon the House of Reps MPs to the Senate chamber. Has anyone told him he can just send a text? DM? It’s across the corridor – they could just yell across the hall. Anyways, the MPs are now filing into the Senate to listen to the GG read a speech from the prime minister’s office to learn what the agenda of the term is. #yetanothermeetingwhichcouldbeanemail Jim Chalmers has responded to the rate cut: Two rate cuts in two months are a damning indictment of the Liberals’ economic mismanagement. Interest rates are now a third of what they were during the depths of the global financial crisis. The Reserve Bank can’t do all of the heavy lifting. It’s time for the government to do its bit and support Labor’s amendments, which would see every Australian worker receive a tax cut in this term of parliament. The key point from the RBA governor’s statement today was: “Consumption growth has been subdued, weighed down by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices.” After six years in office, the Liberals have no one to blame but themselves for feeble growth, stagnant wages and weak consumption. The Liberals’ claim that they’re good at managing the economy isn’t backed up by facts. This is the only government which has ever presided over an economic growth rate and a cash rate which both have a one in front of them at the same time. This third-term government has no plan and no idea how to fix the mess it’s made of the economy or boost the feeble growth on its watch. If the Liberals were doing such a good job managing the economy, the Reserve Bank wouldn’t have had to cut the cash rate for two months in a row. Tim Wilson, being Tim Wilson There is always a bit of interest when parliament opens whether the MPs swear on Bibles or take an affirmation. Victorian Liberal Tim Wilson has taken the whole process into new territory by taking his affirmation today while holding a copy of Milton Friedman’s Capitalism and Freedom. Always best to start as you mean to continue. The RBA also doesn’t want to see unemployment rise any higher. That’s a bit difficult, with some analysts predicting it could hit 6%. This is just one of the problems facing the government at the moment – the economy is not, to put it lightly, looking fantastic – mostly because of outside factors, but that is what makes it so difficult. The RBA has cut the cash rate by 0.25%, making it a new record low. That’s the second month in a row it has cut rates – it is now sitting at 1%. The RBA wants to see some wage growth. It’s not great news for the economy. Scott Morrison addressed the joint party room and told his government that it was the “year of surplus”. He wants the government known for its “humility”, which is also what he said on 7.30 last night. And he wants the focus to be on those outside the building, not inside the building. Long live the quiet Australians. Josh Frydenberg told a really bad joke, saying someone had sent him a text saying great to see the focus on tax cuts “now you need to focus your Albo-es”. Get it? The bells are ringing once again. The afternoon session is about to begin. And we should have news from the RBA on that rate cut in the next 10 minutes. Got a passport? Cool, cool, cool Craig Kelly is back on Sky, continuing his tradition of appearing on live TV like he’s yelling at you over a pub bar. The Senate comes back at 2.25pm. There are a few more formalities, then the governor general will deliver the agenda speech. The Senate will suspend at 5pm and we’ll be off for the day. Tomorrow, most of the sitting is dedicated to condolence motions for Bob Hawke. The government is currently holding its party room meeting, so we’ll bring you the update from that after 2pm. A bit more from Mike Bowers this morning Just wondering - has anyone checked whether Kevin Andrews is OK? He has only spent one term in the parliament since his election in 1991 without Tony Abbott. I mean, he has Ian Goodenough as a bench buddy now, but still. Much diversity. Many differences. What do we call a flock of flag pins? Shining happy people: Seating arrangement is out: The governor general will read the agenda speech at 3pm, which is written by the prime minister’s office. He uses the phrase ‘my government’ and the pronoun ‘we’ quite a bit, which is a bit weird, but it will give us an insight into what this government is actually planning, outside of tax cuts. Hit me up with the buzzwords you think may appear. Michael McCormack also said some things. Anthony Albanese on Tony Smith: You love this institution. You are passionate about it. You bring great credit to all of us with the way that you conduct yourself. Of course, we, on this side of the House, would have preferred a different result on May 18, but I am pleased to see that you are back in control of the House. You are as fair and impartial a Speaker as I have seen on either side of politics in Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2017 than two decades in this House. Indeed, Mr Speaker, you are for the third time elected unopposed. That is the first time that that has occurred in more than a century since the beginning of, indeed, this parliament going back to federation. The fact that you have been nominated by the government’s side and seconded by the opposition side is to your credit and also I think will be welcomed by Australians who want to see solutions, rather than arguments, in this place wherever that is possible. Of course, from time to time, it will be the case that there are arguments, but you have always conducted yourself with diligence, grace and good humour and that has assisted, I think, in focusing attention from members of this House on outcomes on what unites us, rather than what divides us in the legitimate contests that will take place over the future direction of this country. Where at times it will be passionate. I will be, too. You might have noticed, but what we need to do always is to recognise that the standing orders and the procedures that are in place are here so that those debates are conducted in a way that produces outcomes and really focuses on the needs of the Australian people, rather than on ourselves. You have always conducted yourself in that way. Of course your task is more than just chairing the parliament. As the prime minister has said, you also lead the parliament in terms of the officers, the clerks, all who work to make this institution operate on a day-to-day basis, and you do that in a way which always has been consultative, particularly over some difficult issues. National security is a much greater issue today than it was when I and yourself were elected those years ago. It is important to get this balance between the openness of a parliament, whereby people can come along and can hear debates and participate with those national needs. Your job also is to be the representative of the parliament of all of us, which is why it is important that you have been elected unopposed. Scott Morrison on Tony Smith’s election: But to you, Mr Speaker, you have many great loves and passions in this life, none greater than Pam and the boys, who I know once again will be deeply proud of their dad today. But you have the great passions, as we have heard, for the Carlton Football Club and your Holden panel van and many other things which we have discussed on so many occasions as great friends. But one of your great passions is this House. This chamber. The role that it plays in our great country. You bring a real honour to this institution. This is the second time that you have been elected to this position, following an election unchallenged and I think that says much about the respect with which you are held by all members of this House. You understand its responsibility. You understand that we all come here, particularly on a day like today, expressing great hopes, noble intentions, but these are things that you have always lived as a man, as a member of your community, in your family, as a friend and as a member of this House. That is what best commends you to this role, more than any of each of us here could. You have a wise and calming presence in this place. The normal passions in the heat of the debate that occurs in this place, you accept and you celebrate, but at the same time you temper us in those times when, of course, there is overreach. But in this role, Mr Speaker, you also do something which I think is truly great and that you honour and you work so well with those who service in this chamber and you lead them incredibly well. Tony Smith has been dragged to the Speaker’s chair after Labor seconded the motion for his nomination. Scott Ryan has been elected as president of the Senate. The Senate president vote is duly under way: Bronwyn Bishop is in the House from the looks of the chamber TV, having a chat to Jenny Morrison. I didn’t hear a helicopter, but it’s a big place. Nick McKim has challenged Scott Ryan for president of the Senate, saying the election of a president is a “stitch up” between the major parties. I mean, he’s not entirely wrong, but I think we can all say that this is not going to go his way. Scott Ryan will be elected Senate president. This is a nice story tho: I believe there are 26 new House of Reps MPs being sworn in and 40-something senators. This is the day that never ends, it just goes on and on my friends. Some people, started traditions not knowing what they were and they’ll continue doing them forever just because.... The Senate will elect its president (spoiler – it will be Scott Ryan) and then the House of Representatives will elect its Speaker (double spoiler – it will be Tony Smith) and then boom – lots of speeches. The tax bill will be entered into the chamber this afternoon/evening, where Labor will wave it through, before entering the Senate. There, Labor will attempt to amend it. Not that it is looking like that matters – word is the crossbench will give the government the numbers it needs to pass it. Let the games begin. May the odds be ever in your favour. The Usher of the Black Rod is walking from the Senate to the House of Representatives at the behest of the chief justice, Susan Kiefel, who is acting as the deputy governor general, to ask the lower chamber to come on over. Everyone got that? The Usher of the Black Rod has just given the nod to the Sergeant of Arms, and now the House of Reps will wander over to the Senate. All of this because a bunch of blokes in England back in the day had a riot when the king tried to arrest a bunch of MPs. Since then, the monarch and their representatives can’t enter the House of Reps. I mean, there was a civil war after Charles I attempted to arrest MPs for treason, so I suppose there was a reason for the rule. And now it is to give everyone something to do when parliament begins. Thus concludes your history lesson with Amy. The bells are ringing for the first time in months, which means the 46th parliament is about to get under way. I never realised what a pavlovian response I have to that sound until my eye started twitching at the first shrill note. I am not sure if androids do dream of electric sheep (I mean, are they battery operated or do they plug them in?) but my dreams are certainly haunted by these bells. About the House doing the work so you don’t have to: Well this seems pretty definite. Stirling Griff on the tax plan: I would think, all things considered, I would imagine that the tax cut legislation will pass this week. Centre Alliance has a loose working arrangement with Jacqui Lambie. They will work together on issues where they have common ground, and do their own thing where they split. They have also agreed not to talk about each other’s position. Jacqui is her own person. We’ve had initial discussions with Jacqui in relation to what we’re looking for. But, um, we’ll just have to see where she ends up in the end. But given that the government either needs Lambie or One Nation to pass the tax plan, if Labor doesn’t come on board, and Pauline Hanson is still opposed, well, that from Griff is an indication of where this is all heading. A little earlier, Rex Patrick said he had been down to Tasmania to speak to Lambie after her election and had spoken to her at least three times since yesterday. That is going to be quite the interesting voting bloc at times. I’m told that quite a bit of Anthony Albanese’s speech ahead of the smoking ceremony was off the cuff. That he had a prepared speech, and read from some of it, but that he ad-libbed quite a bit, as he had something he really wanted to say. Reconciliation is shaping up as the major sleeping issue of this parliament – and so it should be. It is outrageous that we haven’t done more already. Back to the tax debate, and Jim Chalmers had this to say about Labor’s position: If the Reserve Bank cuts interest rates today, that will further bolster our strong case that we need to get more money into the hands of more workers sooner to boost this floundering economy. The Reserve Bank can’t do all the heavy lifting on its own. The Reserve Bank has already cut interest rates to extraordinary lows – much lower than they were even during the global financial crisis. It’s time for the government to do their bit. Labor’s prepared to do our bit to get stage one of the tax cuts into the economy and to bring forward stage two. That’s what my amendments will seek to do tonight. The test for Scott Morrison is does he want a tax cut for every Australian worker this term or not? That’s the question for him. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg need to stop obsessing about Labor, stop spending all of their time poring over our transcripts and writing op-eds about the Labor party, and they need to actually do something about this floundering economy. They’ve been pretending that nothing’s wrong for some time now. We’ve got slowing growth, we’ve got stagnant wages. People are worried about their mortgages, people are worried about their standard of living. People are worried that their wages aren’t keeping up with their costs of living. We can’t have a government that keeps pretending that nothing’s wrong. It’s time for them to act. We’ve proposed a responsible way forward, which would pass stage one of the tax cuts, bring forward part of stage two of the tax cuts and take out stage three, which commits $95bn five years down the track when we don’t know what the economy or the budget will look like in 2024-25. The smoking ceremony is being held on the forecourt of Parliament House. Albanese ends with: We know that for parliament to be asked to be welcomed by the traditional owners of the land on which we meet is a modest step. It is more than a decade since the apology. It is time to go further in reconciliation. The parliament should show its respect for the strength and determination of First Nations peoples by working with you to progress the agenda of the Uluru statement from the heart, to establish a voice, recognise First Nations people in our constitution and to close the gap which remains so vast across so many categories. We have to acknowledge the patience and persistence of First Nations people in their wishes, including the nature of future agreements with them that was made clear in the Uluru statement. The parliament should do more than hear an Aboriginal welcome, the parliament should also hear an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice, that would be a significant change for our country. We would all be stronger for it and once done, we would wonder, just like with the apology, just like this welcome to country, why we hadn’t done it before? I say to the prime minister, I look forward to working with you in the spirit in which we’ve already had discussions. We will work with you, this can be done. We have been welcomed to this country today in such a generous spirit, with such a hopeful heart, and we should respond with courage, kindness and with determination. Forty five times we have opened the parliament in this country without a voice to parliament for the First Nations of this great land. This 46th parliament should be the last time in which we do that. Anthony Albanese: I also think of the first welcome to country here when we gathered in this place in February 2008. I’m very proud to have been leader of the House of Representatives when we instituted that reform. It is a great example whereby people at the time thought “Why haven’t we done this before?” And once done, just like the apology, no one could imagine us not doing it. It was indeed a rare moment where the parliament showed humility and respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. What I remember most from that February day was the same strength, the strength of your culture, to survive everything that has been thrown at you, to survive everything that this institution has done to you and the strength of your character to welcome us with the oldest continuing human culture and custom in the world, customs whose antiquity stretches back beyond our comprehension. The generosity of First Nations people to offer that welcome is quite extraordinary. I welcome the fact that we now regard this as an essential component of the beginning of the parliament. Anthony Albanese also spoke ahead of the smoking ceremony. He said that when he first spoke to Scott Morrison following his election as Labor leader, the first issue they spoke about was reconciliation: I am so grateful to be welcomed again to Ngunnawal country by the traditional owners here. Linda [Burney] said to me this morning “We’ll be back, we always do come back”. When I was elected to this place some 23 years ago, there was no welcome to country, simply because the parliament didn’t ask for one. I came down from a lifetime in the inner west of Sydney, the land of the Gadigal clans, to a new era in this Ngunnawal and Ngambri country, without any acknowledgement of the cultural significance of that moment. What a lost opportunity to learn about this place. We now begin every shadow ministry meeting with the acknowledgement of country from Linda Burney who informs us about the cultural significance of where we are meeting, wherever it is. Just like, of course, the parliament didn’t ask to be welcomed by your leaders when we first met in this building in 1988, nor when we first met in this city in 1927. But even when the parliament has tried to ignore First Nations people, they have been here and the prime minister has outlined that extraordinary history with Jimmy Clements and John Noble, proud Wiradjuri men and the actions that they took and the response that they got from their fellow Australians. Mike Bowers was at the ecumenical service held this morning to mark the opening of the new parliament. This year, it was held at St Christopher’s Cathedral. As they were leaving, Anthony Albanese quipped that as a Catholic, he held the home ground advantage. Scott Morrison: Being at peace with our past, being at one with our past and while we reflect on how far we have to go, consider how far we have come. This year, my government appointed Ken Wyatt as the first ever Aboriginal person to hold the position of minister for Indigenous Australians and as a member of cabinet and I welcome him here and this morning. I am also pleased, as I know that the leader of the opposition is, that he will be joined in the parliament by the member of Barton, Linda Burney and senators Patrick Dodson, Malarndirri McCarthy and Jacqui Lambie, but together, between Linda and Ken, I think Anthony and I are both very optimistic about the partnership that can be forged. Indigenous important voices that I am confident will be joined by many, many more in the years to come. It was a different story at the official opening of what we now call the Old Parliament House back in 1927. Not a single First Australian was invited to celebrate. However, that didn’t stop two men, Jimmy Clements, better known as King Billy, and John Noble. They left their home near Gundagai and began the long walk to Canberra. They trudged over the mountains until they arrived in our nation’s capital. The 80-year-old King Billy stood firm in front of the new parliament and protested his sovereign rights to the federal territory. The police ordered him to move on. They feared his shabby clothes and the dogs at his bare feet would offend the sensibilities of the Duke and Duchess of York who were in attendance. An incredible thing happened. The crowd, Australians, took King Billy’s side. They called on him to stand his ground and he did. A clergyman declared he had a better right than any man present to be there and that was true. King Billy won that fight and the next day he was among those citizens officially presented to the duke and duchess. His long walk to Canberra paid off. Almost eight decades later, footballing great Michael Long would also begin a long walk to Canberra and would famously meet with the then prime minister John Howard to discuss the issues facing indigenous communities. As Michael’s wife, Lesley, put it so well, when one person starts walking, someone will walk next to them and they’ll say “I’ll believe in that too. I’ll walk with you.” Here we are, walking together, all Australians, Indigenous or not, walking together, side-by-side towards reconciliation, towards equal opportunities, towards closing that gap once and for all, walking in the same way a determined steely-eyed 80-year-old Wiradjuri man walked to Canberra almost a century ago. We have a long way to go, we know, but we will walk that journey together. Scott Morrison is speaking ahead of the smoking ceremony at the front of parliament, which will mark the official opening of the parliament. We gather in respect, acknowledging the Ngunnawal elders, the ancient ceremony of fire and smoke that will commence shortly has become part of the tradition of this building and thankfully so. It was just over a decade ago that the first ever smoking ceremony was accompanied the opening of parliament and I thank the Speaker and the president of the Senate for their continuing support of this as it shall always be in this place. We couldn’t imagine this day without this ceremony. Nor should we. It is appropriate that the entrance of our parliament just beyond the great verandah is the beautiful mosaic on the forecourt ... Jagamara’s possum and red kangaroos, rock wallabies and more. The ancestors all gathering for an important ceremony, stirring in its subtly. As the artist said himself, the 90,000 hand guillotined granite pieces present and represent a place where all people come and meet together, just like we do in our ceremonies to discuss and work things out together. That captured the work, the job of this place, to work things out together. In my maiden speech to parliament I said a strong country is at peace with its past. This is a work in progress. Back over on Sky News and Angus Taylor was very Angus Taylor about what the government was planning to do in regards to nuclear power. There is a big chunk of the party room (mostly Queensland) who want a Senate inquiry into nuclear power. Taylor continued to hedge, saying he was focused on the “short and medium term”. “If we are going to solve this energy problem in the next couple of years, it is going to be much more immediate initiatives that are going to need to be in place ... like the reliability obligation. Future energy sources, and broadening those, will have a much longer term time line before they can have any impact. “So I am very focused on the short-term solutions, it is what Australians want. “... What has to be established here [nuclear] is the economic business case. There are lots of ways of doing that, there are many ways for many people to make that economic case ... what I am saying is, there are many ways to establish the economic case. The fundamental issue though we face now is making sure we get more energy supply into the system, making sure the competitive regime is right, that the energy companies are doing the right thing by their customers – that is what is going to make the difference. “... As I said, I am focused on getting those short- to medium-term problems solved.” On tax cuts, it looks as though a deal with the crossbench is very, very close. Centre Alliance seems quite hopeful it will get its gas reserve for the domestic market, which will get it across the line. Then it is down to Jacqui Lambie, who hasn’t said much publicly but is tipped to vote in favour. But even if she doesn’t, Labor is leaning towards passing the whole package if the government won’t split it, despite its reservations about stage three. Which just begs the question – what on earth is the government going to talk about if the tax package passes? Outside the church service, Scott Morrison stopped and had a quick chat as well: [Yesterday] at the war memorial and this morning’s reflections, I think, are very important ways for our parliament to begin. And certainly on this occasion. People coming together from across the political divide and, of course, this week, with the swearing-in of a new governor general, I think it is a timely reminder of all the things that make our democracy, our country so great. There is a tremendous stability, I think, in these things that anchor our country, whether it’s our constitution, as we remembered yesterday with the governor general, the great sacrifice and service of those men and women who sacrificed everything for us. Today, reflecting on the deeply held faith values of our nation. And later this morning, the welcome to country. I think that all brings it together, and for the ceremonies that follow. And this is the right way to start a parliament. And I look forward to continuing in that vein. This morning, there are many prayers that I must say. My prayers this morning are for Alek Sigley and his family. This is a troubling situation and we will continue to use every effort we have to locate him and hopefully bring him home safely. There is no update on the Sigley situation as yet. You can follow along with parliament here. Anthony Albanese stopped and had a chat to journalists outside the church service this morning. Asked if the tax debate was damaging for Labor, he had this to say: We’ve got till 2022. I’ll give you the big tip. I’ve said we will hasten slowly. I’ve said we won’t be terribly concerned about the 24-hour media cycle … we’re prepared and support the House and the Senate remaining here in Canberra on Thursday, continuing to sit until these issues are all dealt with. Because we want every Australian worker to get a tax cut in this term. That’s what we’re arguing for. Because we are back in 2016, religious freedom is back on the agenda, despite the Philip Ruddock review finding that there isn’t that big a problem in Australia when it comes to religious freedom. But here we are. Scott Morrison will be looking at it, and he is hoping for bipartisan support from Labor to try to limit how out of control the debate could grow. Mathias Cormann, speaking to ABC TV this morning, is all about it: Well, I do believe it’s a pressing issue to protect Australia’s right to religious freedom. And, I mean, that is obviously something that we’ve said that we would pursue. The prime minister and others have made it very clear that this is something that we will pursue through legislation by the end of this year. And at the right time the attorney general will obviously explain all of the ins and outs of what we’re proposing to do. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese attended a Last Post ceremony as the sun set yesterday. The war memorial holds a daily ceremony, but it is traditional for the leaders to attend the service just before parliament resumes. Well, after the pomp and ceremony of yesterday, the parliament is gearing up for more pomp and ceremony today, with the 46th parliament to be officially sworn in. First up is the traditional church service, attended by the leaders, where everyone reflects on peace and goodwill before returning to the parliament and slamming each other again. Sometimes they don’t even make it to the parliament – just the steps of the church. Back in the parliament it is all tax, tax, tax. Josh Frydenberg has promised the low- and middle-income tax rebate will be in people’s bank accounts next week. “People will get it next week,” he told Laura Jayes on Sky News this morning. “Once they put in their tax returns, and they can put in their tax returns next week, then they will get it just days after.” Now of course, that depends on the parliament passing it. Labor is still hoping it can amend the bill in the Senate, but will pass it the House. If it can’t amend the bill, well, it hasn’t really made up its mind yet about what it will do. Stage one and two are fine, according to the opposition – or at least mostly fine – but stage three is a sticking point. The government is holding firm and refusing to split the package. So we’ll stay on this merry-go-round a little bit longer. In other news, the treasurer is holding his breath while waiting to see if the RBA cuts the cash rate for the second month in a row. There isn’t much further for the reserve bank to go, but it is a sign of a weakening economy that there is even the expectation it could. Frydenberg is holding on to Australia’s triple A credit rating for comfort but the global economy has to be making for some sleepless nights. We’ll cover that, and everything else that happens today. There is no question time until Thursday, but Mike Bowers is out and about and freezing in Manuka to bring you shots of the MPs pretending to like each other, and the Guardian’s brains trust is at your service. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T15:09:00Z","webTitle":"Solar power breaks UK records thanks to sunny weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/26/solar-power-breaks-uk-records-thanks-sunny-weather","fields":{"headline":"Solar power breaks UK records thanks to sunny weather","bodyText":"Solar power has broken new records in the UK by providing nearly a quarter of the country’s electricity needs, thanks to sunny skies and relatively low summer demand. National Grid said the thousands of photovoltaic panels on rooftops and in fields across the UK were generating 8.7GW, or 24.3% of demand at 1pm on Friday, smashing the previous high of 8.48GW earlier this month. Experts said the unprecedented share for solar energy meant about 60% of the UK’s power was low carbon, taking into account Britain’s wind farms and nuclear power stations too. That figure is normally around 50%. National Grid, which is tasked with ensuring a match between supply and demand for electricity, said it was excited but unfazed by the challenge of accommodating “significant volumes” of renewables. Duncan Burt, who manages day-to-day operation of the grid, said: “We have planned for these changes to the energy landscape and have the tools available to ensure we can balance supply and demand.” Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace, said: “Today’s new record is a reminder of what the UK could achieve if our government reversed its cuts to support for solar, and backed the clean technologies that could provide jobs, business opportunities and plentiful clean energy for decades to come.” The milestone reached on Friday is the latest in a series of records for solar, which has grown from almost nothing seven years ago to 12GW of capacity today. Last summer it provided more power than the UK’s last 10 coal-fired power stations. In April this year, Britain achieved its first-ever full working day without coal power since it started burning the fuel in 1882, thanks in part to solar energy. Solar’s rapid growth is overturning conventions for the managers of the UK’s power grid. In March, for the first time ever, the amount of electricity demanded by homes and businesses in the afternoon was lower than it was in the night, thanks to the cut in demand due to solar panels. Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said of the latest record: “I think it’s a positive sign. It’s free electricity today, for the consumer, and we should make the most of it.” He said that with solar continuing to be installed despite the government’s drastic subsidy cuts in 2016, further records will certainly be broken this summer and for years to come. Buckley said the grid could handle a far greater proportion of solar power than currently seen, because gas power stations could be ramped down. For National Grid, periods of high pressure bringing lovely weather to the UK like this week were: “really predictable, so easy to plan for,” Buckley said. Robert Gross of Imperial College said: “This doesn’t pose fundamental problem for the grid – many sunnier countries manage a similar proportion of solar on a much more regular basis.” Government statistics published on Thursday show that UK solar power capacity has grown from 11.3GW in April last year to 12.1GW this year, enough to power 3.8m homes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/14/toshiba-unions-uk-government-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-14T17:01:48Z","webTitle":"Toshiba crisis: unions urge government to 'get a grip' on nuclear policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/toshiba-unions-uk-government-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/14/toshiba-unions-uk-government-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Toshiba crisis: unions urge government to 'get a grip' on nuclear policy","bodyText":"Unions are urging the government to take back control of its nuclear strategy after Toshiba’s deepening financial crisis cast fresh doubt about its involvement in the planned Moorside power station in Cumbria. Justin Bowden, GMB’s national secretary for energy, described the situation as a “fiasco” after Japan’s Toshiba, the lead party behind Moorside, revealed a $6.3bn writedown in its US Westinghouse business and confirmed it was scaling back investment in new overseas nuclear projects. Toshiba prompted confusion among investors on Tuesday by saying it was not ready to publish third-quarter results as scheduled, only to announce the write-down in its US nuclear business and resignation of its chairman, Shigenori Shiga, hours later. The company’s shares fell 8% in Tokyo. Bowden said the UK government had become too reliant on foreign companies for delivering its energy strategy. “Toshiba’s chairman falling on his sword underlines the gravity of the company’s situation but must not be allowed to jeopardise the future of Moorside and put the security of this country’s energy supply in any more of a precarious situation than it already is,” he said. “The fiasco with Toshiba shows exactly why relying on foreign companies for our energy needs it just plain stupid.” Toshiba has a 60% stake in NuGen, the consortium behind the planned Moorside plant. French firm Engie is its partner on the project. The Japanese company first flagged up its financial woes and a potential multibillion-dollar write down in December. A spokesman for Toshiba said the company remained “committed” to Moorside, but it was unclear how long it would remain involved in the project, or to what extent. The firm confirmed on Tuesday that it would reduce its role on the construction of new plants, instead focusing on lower risk involvement such as equipment supply and engineering. Commenting specifically on Moorside, the spokesman said: “Regarding the NuGen project, while Toshiba is committed to invest in the project until the final investment decision, we will subsequently seek to sell our shares to new investor(s). This has been our position from the start. Toshiba will consider participating in the project without taking on any risk from carrying out actual construction work.” Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, sought to reassure that the UK project would go ahead. “I have spoken to Toshiba and NuGen today. I welcome the continued commitment of the NuGen consortium to the Moorside project,” he said. “The UK government is committed to new nuclear as an important part of our energy mix, having commissioned the first new nuclear power station in a generation. The UK is one of the most attractive countries to invest in new nuclear and we continue to work closely with partners to see Moorside built.” Toshiba said the chairman was resigning to take “management responsibility” for the writedowns related to its US subsidiary, Westinghouse, and its purchase of US construction company CB&amp;I Stone and Webster last year from Chicago Bridge and Iron. Toshiba warned that the figures it eventually released, including the $6.3bn write-down of its Westinghouse nuclear business, had not yet been approved by its auditors and could still be subject to major revision. The company’s fully audited results are now due to be published on 14 March.Toshiba’s stock market value has halved to $8.6bn since the financial problems at Westinghouse first came to light in December and it said it would seek to raise cash by selling the US nuclear operation and its Nand flash-memory chips business. Kevin Coyne, national officer for energy at Unite union, said Toshiba’s indecision and delays would pile “further agony upon this Cumbrian community”. “The government must get a grip of the funding of these projects. It is the duty of the government, not the private sector, to ensure that UK energy is safe secure and that means it must act to bring our new power stations on stream. Keeping our lights on cannot be left to the whimsy of market forces.” A decision by Toshiba to scrap Moorside would be a major blow to the government’s strategy for nuclear, one of five areas prioritised in the prime minister’s industrial strategy. The project, near Sellafield, is a key part of the government’s ambitions for a new generation of nuclear power stations to fill the UK’s energy gap in the next decade as coal plants and ageing atomic plants close."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/26/nuclear-fears-30-years-after-chernobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-26T18:08:34Z","webTitle":"Nuclear fears 30 years after Chernobyl | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/26/nuclear-fears-30-years-after-chernobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/26/nuclear-fears-30-years-after-chernobyl","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear fears 30 years after Chernobyl","bodyText":"Thirty years on from the tragedy of Chernobyl (theguardian.com, 26 April), the potential of nuclear power to provide cheap, safe, decarbonised energy is not diminished. While we pause to reflect on this worst imaginable accident, we must not let misplaced perceptions of risk mean we overlook reality. Nuclear power is our safest option for the supply of baseload, low-carbon electricity. Coal power has killed more than a thousand times more people per unit of energy produced than nuclear power, including both UN confirmed deaths from reported incidents and epidemiological evidence. All new nuclear build has passive redundant safety systems and must be able to withstand the worst-case disaster, no matter how unlikely. The UK also has a clear programme in place to deal with all our nuclear waste, including the reduced volumes generated by new-build reactor designs compared to current reactors. The planned generation of nuclear technologies offer the UK security of supply and low-carbon solutions to our power needs. There is also a significant economic opportunity, including highly skilled jobs in construction and operation, provided the government holds firm on a minimum percentage commitment to the British supply chain for all new nuclear projects. We must keep nuclear fears in proportion and our minds open in order to keep the lights on.

We would ask that Amber Rudd download the US Environmental Protection Agency paper on health risks from radiation exposure from www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides and the paper produced by the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, (NIRS) “No such thing as a safe dose of radiation”, from nirs.org. Understanding this relatively recent addition to international scientific evidence leaves no possible conclusion other than that nuclear power is not safe, not clean, not reliable and not low-carbon. Therefore Hinkley C and other new build must be ruled out, UK nuclear regulators must enforce a zero emissions policy at all nuclear sites, including decommissioning and waste management. Meanwhile the health costs continue to mount in Somerset: more sudden premature deaths, more heritable genetic mutations, more cancers, more central nervous system fatalities, more early onset dementia and Alzheimers. Just take a look at our medical records; listen to the NGOs that have been struggling to educate DECC officials for decades. And, please, stop killing our children.

The accusation was levelled after Theresa May said the Conservative party was “committed” to nuclear, but did not offer state support following huge losses reported by one of the backers of a deal to build the Moorside nuclear plant near Whitehaven. NuGen, the company behind the Moorside scheme in Cumbria, has insisted Toshiba remains committed to the project despite doubts after the Japanese giant revealed it was on track for losses of 390bn yen (£2.7bn) for the year to March. Toshiba has a 60% stake in NuGen. Justin Bowden, national officer of the GMB union, which represents nuclear workers, said: “Theresa May has ducked the central question, just when strong leadership was required.” During the visit the prime minister refused to make any new guarantees, although she said the business secretary, Greg Clark, had spoken to the Japanese firm and got a pledge of its backing. “It’s the Conservatives who are committed to the nuclear industry in the UK. Trudy Harrison, our candidate here, has made very clear to me the importance of Moorside,” May said. Bowden said: “It is crucial for the future of Moorside, for the economy and jobs in Copeland and for the future security of Britain’s electricity supply that there is a government-backed plan B. The government just crossing its fingers and toes will not guarantee the lights stay on if there is a further wobble with Toshiba.” May said: “Jeremy Corbyn was asked five times in one interview whether he would back Moorside and he would not back Moorside. “It’s the Conservatives who understand the importance of the nuclear industry. Trudy Harrison knows that – her husband works in the nuclear industry. She knows how important it is.” Gillian Troughton, Labour’s byelection candidate, insisted her party was fully committed to nuclear power. “No ifs, no buts, Labour was and is the party of nuclear … That is party policy. It always will be party policy. “Tom Watson [deputy leader] has been up here and quite clearly stated that. Jeremy has quite clearly stated that. This is a distraction from what the Tories are doing regarding investment in this area. The Tories are heartlessly stripping away Sellafield workers’ pensions. That’s how interested they are in nuclear.” In December unions representing many of Sellafield’s 10,000 workers threatened “serious industrial unrest” over government plans to downgrade their final salary pension scheme. On a visit to a primary school in Bootle, in the south of the seat, May also denied that the A&amp;E department at the West Cumberland hospital in Whitehaven would be closed. But she would not say if she personally opposed plans to downgrade maternity services at the hospital – a source of much public concern in the marginal constituency. In October last year May said there was a “general consensus” among clinicians in Copeland that the consultant-led unit should close because of staff recruitment problems, even though it meant women with difficult births would be forced to travel 40 miles along a single-lane road to Carlisle. During a tightly controlled visit to Captain Shaw’s primary school on Wednesday, May rebuffed four attempts by a reporter from ITV to ask if she personally opposed the maternity downgrade, saying: “There has been a lot of scaremongering about hospital services and the NHS here by the Labour party. There is no truth in the suggestion that A&amp;E at West Cumberland hospital is about to be closed. Trudy Harrison, our candidate, does indeed know the importance of these services. She is opposed to the downgrading of these services.” Harrison said she had secured a government-backed review of recruitment problems facing the constituency’s three hospitals. “I’ve spoken to supporters, staff and Philip Dunne, the health minister, and I know that it’s not about funding, it’s about recruitment. That’s why my plan for a stronger economy, better services and improved infrastructure will help with that challenge of recruiting enough talented doctors and nurses into West Cumberland hospital and also Millom and Keswick – we have three hospitals in this constituency,” she said. Harrison insisted she was “absolutely” against the maternity plans, saying she and her four daughters were born in West Cumberland hospital."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/jul/13/us-worlds-top-gas-exporter-2020-iea-russia-norway","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-13T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"US 'will become one of the world's top gas exporters by 2020'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/13/us-worlds-top-gas-exporter-2020-iea-russia-norway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jul/13/us-worlds-top-gas-exporter-2020-iea-russia-norway","fields":{"headline":"US 'will become one of the world's top gas exporters by 2020'","bodyText":"The American shale gas revolution will enjoy a second wind as rapid growth in domestic production sees the US join the world’s club of top gas exporters, a leading energy authority has predicted. Fracking has already opened up US shale oil and gas deposits, leading to a fall in gas prices and a drop in greenhouse gas emissions as power generation switches from coal to gas, as well as reducing America’s historical reliance on fossil fuel imports. But an increase in US gas production over the next five years will cause another revolution as the country begins liquefying and shipping gas to Asia, Europe and the Middle East, the International Energy Agency said. In a report published on Thursday, the IEA forecast the US would generate almost 40% of the rise in global gas output between 2016 and 2022. Come 2022, the US will produce more than a fifth of the world’s gas, putting it on the same level as top gas exporters such as Russia and Norway, the agency predicted. As an exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), it would become second biggest in five years, behind Australia but above Gulf state Qatar. “The US is already the largest gas producer in the world and will increase production more than any other country over the next five years,” said Keisuke Sadamori, director for energy markets and security at the IEA. “US gas production will grow by nearly 3% a year.” More than half of that new production will be turned into liquefied natural gas for exports, he added. Three major LNG terminals are being built on the Texas coast by Houston-based firms, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars, to export the gas. Last weekend, the first shipment of LNG imported from the US arrived in the UK, to provide about half of the country’s gas needs this summer. That came just weeks after the first US LNG shipment to central Europe, in a delivery to Poland, which is trying to reduce its reliance on Russian gas. However, the big demand growth is predicted to come from Asia. China is anticipated to account for 40% of global demand growth, driven by government policies to tackle the dangerous levels of air pollution in many cities, which is largely caused by coal power stations. “Especially in China, and more and more other Asian countries, gas is being used in order to reduce the coal and address the local pollution issue,” said Fatih Birol, executive director at the IEA. India would lead growth in the rest of Asia, the report forecast. While Japan is already a big importer of LNG, the IEA said that Seoul’s decision to switch away from coal and nuclear power could see South Korea increase its appetite for LNG too. The sources of demand in those countries will also change, with industry taking over from the power sector as the “main engine of demand growth”. The IEA cited the examples of the growing use of gas in the chemicals sector and in fertilisers in India. By 2022, the agency said the three giant LNG exporters would be the US, Australia and Qatar, which is undergoing a blockade that the IEA said served as “a reminder that security of gas supply cannot be taken for granted”. Last month, a giant floating LNG vessel set off from a South Korean shipyard to work on Shell’s Prelude gas field off Western Australia, where production is expected to begin in 2018. The report did not assess the impact of Qatar’s recent announcement that it would increase LNG production by 30% within the next seven years. The UK relies on Qatar for nearly a third of its gas imports. Overall, Sadamori said the key factor in the gas market in coming years would be production growth in the US and its emerging role as an exporter. “The ability of the gas fields in the US to provide large quantities at competitive prices will be the most important feature [of the gas market], not only to keep gas competitive for US power generation and industry customers, but also to further increase pipelines exports to Mexico, Canada and deliver LNG to the global market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/18/german-left-succeed-election-offer-more-angela-merkel-status-quo","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-18T11:30:22Z","webTitle":"If the German left wants to succeed, it must offer more than Merkel’s status quo | Christian Odendahl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/18/german-left-succeed-election-offer-more-angela-merkel-status-quo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/18/german-left-succeed-election-offer-more-angela-merkel-status-quo","fields":{"headline":"If the German left wants to succeed, it must offer more than Merkel’s status quo","bodyText":"The German elections on 24 September are bound to be boring. Polls show Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) leading the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) by 15 percentage points. Absent a miracle for the SPD, Merkel will be re-elected as chancellor for the fourth time. The really interesting question is: why? Merkel has an unmatched ability to disarm her opponents and demobilise their supporters. Take the recent legalisation of gay marriage. Merkel realised her party’s official opposition would cost her votes. So she allowed MPs a free vote, which meant that gay marriage passed by a landslide. Merkel herself voted against the motion to protect her conservative credentials, but the issue was politically neutralised. This episode is telling of Merkel’s leadership style. Instead of vacating the centre ground to the SPD or the Greens, she integrates many of their more leftwing policies into a Christian-conservative narrative. She applied the same strategy in abolishing conscription, introducing a minimum wage, ending nuclear power and introducing modern parental benefits. Her response to the refugee crisis in 2015 alienated some rightwing voters, and contributed to the emergence of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), but Merkel was willing to take that risk. She was right: the AfD stands to gain voters from all parties at the election, not just the CDU/CSU. Merkel’s party will remain the largest party in the Bundestag and will likely be indispensable for any governing coalition. Merkel’s relatively open stance on refugees has also helped to convince left-leaning and young voters that the country is in good hands: an extraordinary 57% of 18-21 year olds prefer the conservative Merkel to Schulz as chancellor. The SPD has failed to counter the CDU/CSU’s strategy of disarmament and demobilisation. Martin Schulz’s brief poll lead at the beginning of the year showed that after 12 years of Merkel as chancellor, there was a desire for change. But the Social Democrats have failed to deliver: their programme struggles to distinguish itself from Merkel’s platform. For those voters who do want change, the SPD is not offering enough. If the SPD is to reclaim lost ground and mobilise its voters, it needs to be more radically social-democratic. And there is plenty of scope to be bold. First, Germany has one of the largest low-wage sectors in Europe, at 23%. The SPD should put together a new agenda that aims to halve the number of people on low wages. Second, the SPD wants to increase public investment, but is too cautious. Municipalities do most of the investing in Germany but labour under a debt burden of €144bn (£131bn). A complete municipal debt jubilee in return for increased local investment would be a bold policy, popular and radically different from the CDU/CSU’s. Third, there is plenty of scope for programmes to help parents, especially single parents. The SPD could set out a plan to turn Germany into a Scandinavian paradise for them. Even in policy areas where the SPD campaigns on a platform that differs from CDU/CSU policy, the Social Democrats have not succeeded in shaping domestic debate. Take Germany’s security policy: SPD foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel spoke to the doubts of many when he said that Germany should not just be “buying tanks, driving defence spending to insane heights and escalating the arms race”. But rather than present an independent vision for future defence policy, the SPD has got bogged down in criticism of Merkel’s support of Nato’s 2% spending target, and has started a petty fight over the CDU/CSU’s alleged kowtowing to the US. Die Linke also helps Merkel win. In both 2005 and 2013, the left-of-centre parties (Die Linke, the Greens and the SPD) had a majority in parliament, but the CDU/CSU still ended up leading “grand coalition” governments, because Die Linke was considered by centrist voters to be unfit. Their radical proposals have cost the Social Democrats votes in this year’s campaign, too, because Martin Schulz cannot credibly rule out a red-red-green coalition under his leadership. Finally, Merkel benefits from the status quo. Germany’s economy is doing well; the federal government’s fiscal situation is excellent; the political situation in Europe and the world is scary enough that Germans want an experienced leader (Merkel wins that contest against Schulz hands down). Germany’s population also has a median age of almost 47, a bracket that prefers stability over reform. If Merkel wins again in September, the SPD should not enter another grand coalition. As Merkel’s junior partner, the Social Democrats would once again get bogged down in compromises, instead of developing convincing alternatives. Instead, Germany’s left should use the next four years to do some serious soul-searching, to ensure that the elections in 2021 are, by German standards, a bit more exciting. • Christian Odendahl is chief economist at the Centre for European Reform"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/jul/10/brexit-pm-making-plans-to-replicate-membership-of-atomic-energy-group-euratom","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-10T14:56:32Z","webTitle":"Ministers act to head off revolt over membership of European nuclear regulator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/10/brexit-pm-making-plans-to-replicate-membership-of-atomic-energy-group-euratom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jul/10/brexit-pm-making-plans-to-replicate-membership-of-atomic-energy-group-euratom","fields":{"headline":"Ministers act to head off revolt over membership of European nuclear regulator","bodyText":"The government is drawing up plans to replicate the benefits of remaining a member of the Euratom treaty, which governs the movement of nuclear materials across Europe, in the face of a growing rebellion of Conservative MPs. The Guardian understands that one option being considered is an “associate membership”, similar to that held by Switzerland, or paying money to an international agency to set up an independent arrangement. Nine Tory MPs signalled that they could line up with Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the issue, making it difficult for May to secure a parliamentary majority. Ed Vaizey, a former Tory minister, joined forces with Labour MP Rachel Reeves over the weekend to warn that the treaty was vital to protect the nuclear power industry in the UK. It comes after a warning that cancer patients could be at risk if the government fails to stay part of the group, the European atomic energy community. Dr Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, told the Evening Standard she feared the risk of “Brexatom” could threaten the supply of radioactive isotopes, used in scans and treatment. The newspaper, edited by the former chancellor George Osborne, carried a story on its front page with the headline: “Cancer patients in Brexit scare.” The pressure has been mounting since May included leaving Euratom in her article 50 letter to the European council president, Donald Tusk. Critics believe May has created the problem by insisting that the UK cannot remain under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. However, a senior Whitehall source told the Guardian that the government had included that line because of a belief that the UK had no choice. They said that “both the UK government and the European commission thought it was a legal necessity” to leave Euratom as part of Brexit. However, they said significant work was under way to ensure that Britain had the “same outcomes” as currently enjoyed within the grouping, and admitted that country membership was being considered. “We will not be marking our own homework when it comes to nuclear safety,” he added. A source from the European commission confirmed that, legally speaking, the UK would have to leave Euratom as part of Brexit. All the members of Euratom are inside the EU, but Switzerland is an equal partner through associate membership. Reeves, who is running to become chair of the business select committee in parliament, said: “MPs from across the political spectrum are clearly very worried about the prospect of leaving Euratom and ideology getting ahead of sensible politics. “It is time for the government to rethink this. Nobody voted to leave the EU to come out of Euratom, and no one would think the government was going soft on Brexit if they rowed back on this.” Dame Sue Ion, honorary president of the Nuclear Skills Academy and former chair of the Nuclear Innovation Research Advisory Board, said: “Associate membership is better than nothing, but it all depends on exactly what that means. It’s normally associated with access to Euratom research, not the wider cover provided by the treaty for everything else [such as transport of nuclear materials].” She added: “The best option is clearly to stay in, which is entirely possible.” Unions urged ministers to listen to their MPs and change their mind on quitting Euratom. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, said: “It is now clear that a hasty retreat from Euratom would be damaging to the UK. The risks to the NHS, British nuclear sector and high-skilled jobs in the industry are too great for the government to get this wrong.” At a recent industry conference, Lord Hutton, chair of the Nuclear Industry Association, said he still held out hope that the government could reconsider leaving Euratom entirely. If the UK was to leave without new arrangements or a transitional arrangement in place, he warned: “There is real concern that the economic growth potential of the UK’s nuclear programme might be damaged. We mustn’t let that happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/23/hinkley-point-c-edf-energy-nuclear-power-plant-deadline","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-23T20:02:49Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: either call the plan off or set a deadline and stick to it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/23/hinkley-point-c-edf-energy-nuclear-power-plant-deadline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/23/hinkley-point-c-edf-energy-nuclear-power-plant-deadline","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: either call the plan off or set a deadline and stick to it","bodyText":"“I will start by saying clearly and categorically that Hinkley Point C will go ahead,” declared Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, the UK end of the French state-owned company that is supposed to be building the £18bn nuclear plant in Somerset. So that’s a definite yes? Not exactly. It’s a definite maybe because, as de Rivaz was obliged to concede in the next breath to MPs on the energy select committee, he cannot say when an investment decision will be made. That is because events are out of his and EDF’s hands. Everything depends on the willingness of the French government to bail out an overindebted company that already faces the costly challenge of upgrading France’s nuclear generating capacity. The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, this week floated the notion of supplying the funds and making a final investment decision on Hinkley in early May, but it was unclear whether this “deadline” has any greater force than the others that have come and gone. The Conservative MP James Heappey summed up the true state of affairs: “If the French government doesn’t commit to that recapitalisation, you can’t build us a power station because you’ve not got the cash.” De Rivaz, instead of agreeing with a plainly correct statement, descended into yet more bluster about how confident he remains. It was excruciating to watch. The best thing the UK government could do, as argued here for ages, is to call the whole thing off and write a better energy policy for the 2020s. EDF’s European pressurised reactor model is unproven and the versions under construction in Finland and France are nine and six years behind schedule respectively. Not only this, but the cost of Hinkley is hideous for future UK consumers. The chancellor, George Osborne, unwisely attached too much of his personal political capital to Hinkley. But even he should realise that this farce cannot be prolonged beyond May. Set a deadline and stick to it. William Hill suffers as customers set online betting limits Shocking news from world of bookmaking. No, not the confirmation that William Hill lost money on every day of the Cheltenham Festival. These things happen and the bookies shouldn’t grumble, because their business would be smaller if the punters didn’t enjoy a winning run once in a while. Instead, the revelation was within the other half of a profit warning that sent the share price down by 11%. It turns out that the Gambling Commission might not be quite the toothless watchdog we supposed. Online punters, it seems, are using the time out and automatic self-exclusion buttons that the commission insisted should be installed last year. William Hill reckons its online profits will be hit by £20m-£25m this year, which at the upper end would be almost a fifth of last year’s online tally of £126m. Most of the self-excluders are banning themselves for the maximum three years and most had been playing casino games such as roulette. Give credit to the commission for a striking a small blow for gambling education. Its buttons may have underlined the message that fixed-odds games, where the house’s long-term edge is mathematically certain, really aren’t like horses, football or even poker. William Hill et al, once they have overcome the apparent shift in players’ behaviour, should count their blessings. If parts of the commission’s code of practice are seen to be effective, the heated public debate over “responsible gambling” may cool by a degree. As for the commission, it shouldn’t spend long congratulating itself. We’re still sputtering over the Paddy Power case in which the bookie identified a gambling addict yet encouraged him to keep feeding its fixed-odds betting terminals. The commission solemnly declared that the chain was guilty of “serious failings”, but tickled Paddy Power with a £280,000 voluntary payment. A command to turn off the machines for a week would have sent a stiffer message. BHS takes another step on the long road back Hurrah, BHS is saved for a nation of grateful shoppers. Well, up to a point. The new owner, an outfit called Retail Acquisitions that bought the business from Sir Philip Green for £1 a year ago, has done well to secure the immediate future of BHS with the support of a thumping majority of creditors. There will now be steep cuts in rent on 87 of its 164 shops. But that arrangement only gets BHS back in the game. The next step is to secure £100m of funding. The process is advanced, but the terms of a £60m loan from Gordon Brothers are unlikely to be generous. Then comes the much harder task of improving sales, reversing trading losses and earning the trust of understandably nervous suppliers. Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, has declared that he wants to make the chain “an iconic British brand again”. Full marks for ambition, but BHS, for a couple of decades, has been an icon of shoppers’ boredom with such department stores. Does anybody miss C&amp;A? Topp’s plan hinges on the ability to increase like-for-like sales by 1% in the second and third years of a three-year plan. It doesn’t sound too difficult, but Marks &amp; Spencer hasn’t produced annual growth in general merchandise in four years.

The papers confirm the steps the government took to reassure French energy firm EDF and Chinese investors behind the £24bn Hinkley Point C plant that the amount they would have to pay for the storage would be capped. The Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy – in its previous incarnation as the Department for Energy and Climate Change – resisted repeated requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the release of the documents which were submitted to the European commission. “The government has attempted to keep the costs to the taxpayer of Hinkley under wraps from the start,” said Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace chief scientist. “It’s hardly surprising as it doesn’t look good for the government’s claim that they are trying to keep costs down for hardworking families.” But, earlier this month, on the very last day before government officials had to submit their defence against an appeal for disclosure of the information, the department released a “Nuclear Waste Transfer Pricing Methodology Notification Paper”. Marked “commercial in confidence”, it states that “unlimited exposure to risks relating to the costs of disposing of their waste in a GDF [geological disposal facility], could not be accepted by the operator as they would prevent the operator from securing the finance necessary to undertake the project”. Instead the document explains that there will be a “cap on the liability of the operator of the nuclear power station which would apply in a worst-case scenario”. It adds: “The UK government accepts that, in setting a cap, the residual risk, of the very worst-case scenarios where actual cost might exceed the cap, is being borne by the government.” Separate documents confirm that the cap also applies should the cost of decommissioning the reactor at the end of its life balloon. The level of the cap is unclear. But Dr David Lowry, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who made the FoI request, said it was clear that the risk of footing the bill for a significant cost overrun had been transferred from Hinkley’s operator to the taxpayer. “This shows that the government cares more about the economic future of a foreign power generator than British taxpayers,” Lowry said. In return for the cap, the document reveals that Hinkley’s operator will pay the government a risk fee which “is expected to be relatively low, reflecting the high level of confidence that the cap will not be breached”. But Lowry pointed out that the nuclear industry had form when it came to sizable cost over-runs. He warned that an accident that could force the closure of the reactor, either because of problems with it or at another plant, as happened in Japan, would leave the taxpayer having to pay billions of pounds for the clear-up years after it ceased generating revenues. A government spokesman said: “All operators of new nuclear power stations in the UK are legally obliged to meet the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste management and disposal costs. They will also pay the UK government to dispose of the waste produced at the end of a plant’s life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/may/28/uks-biggest-solar-company-takes-shine-to-global-projects-with-deals-worth-3bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T15:56:59Z","webTitle":"UK's biggest solar company takes shine to global projects with deals worth £3bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/28/uks-biggest-solar-company-takes-shine-to-global-projects-with-deals-worth-3bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/may/28/uks-biggest-solar-company-takes-shine-to-global-projects-with-deals-worth-3bn","fields":{"headline":"UK's biggest solar company takes shine to global projects with deals worth £3bn","bodyText":"Britain’s biggest solar power company has shrugged off the cloud of drastic UK subsidy cuts by reinventing itself as an international firm with more than £3bn of projects planned. More than 12,000 solar jobs were lost in the industry after the government slashed support in 2015, but Solarcentury has survived by turning outward to target markets in Latin America and Europe. The firm, founded by former oil geologist Jeremy Leggett in 1998, generated 85% of its £168m revenues in the UK during 2015-16. This financial year it expects to flip to 85% of revenues coming from international markets. “We’d been successful in the UK, benefiting from the support scheme, and then in May 2015 the Tories came to power and completely changed direction: they wanted a nuclear power plant [Hinkley Point C], and frustrated renewables,” said Frans van den Heuvel, the company’s chief executive. The expertise the company built in the UK, where it fitted panels on 90,000 homes, has proved crucial in winning contracts abroad, he said. Solarcentury recently reached a major deal with Panama-based private equity investor ECOSolar, which takes its international pipeline of solar projects to 3,400MW, equivalent of three conventional power stations. The planned utility-scale projects, built at scale in fields rather than on rooftops, are worth about £3bn. Economic growth and sunny climes in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Panama are the big drivers behind the growth. “Mexico is a huge market that is still growing despite all the threats from the new president in the US. They need more power. It was a monopoly and it’s now privatised and more competitive,” said van den Heuvel. In Columbia, Solarcentury said the new president and the peace deal with rebel group Farc had led to stability returning to a country where oil was still transported by plane to produce power in remote places – an expensive option that increasingly cheap solar could undercut. Favourable government policies, spurred by the historic Paris climate accord, have helped, too. “Definitely the Paris deal is a big driver. Without the Paris deal, it would still happen because of economics but now it will be even faster,” said van den Heuvel. But the transition, from a company putting solar in British fields and on British homes and businesses, to one competing across the world against a host of rivals has not been easy. “It’s very painful,” the chief executive said of the reorganisation. “But you have to do that, because the market is changing.” Van den Heuvel is no stranger to transformation, having moved operations for the Dutch solar company he founded in 1999 from the Netherlands to Germany after the Dutch government cut support schemes. Scheuten Solar was later bought by a Chinese firm. “I would say, with a smile, the Dutch government stimulated export – and that’s what the UK is doing now,” he said. Solarcentury sees the UK market today as “quite poor” but believes solar is becoming so cheap that it will not need subsidising. One area of promise is the emerging market for battery and solar installations, which maximise the financial benefits from generating electricity from the sun. The company has a dedicated team working on batteries and is working with an undisclosed retailer on one major storage project. Van den Heuvel does not have high hopes for a change of mindset on solar by the Conservatives after the election. But he is certain growth in solar, which has stalled at about 11GW of capacity since the subsidy cuts, will return to the UK. “It will come back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/07/russia-2018-world-cup-england-base-gareth-southgate","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T15:38:04Z","webTitle":"Welcome to England’s World Cup base: ‘People come here for total quiet’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/07/russia-2018-world-cup-england-base-gareth-southgate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/07/russia-2018-world-cup-england-base-gareth-southgate","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to England’s World Cup base: ‘People come here for total quiet’","bodyText":"If England are looking for self-reflection and meditation, this sleepy Russian town where they will train during the World Cup next summer could fit the bill. The 10-minute drive north from their modest accommodation in the village of Repino, 19 miles from St Petersburg, cuts through birch and pine forest, the view occasionally punctuated by a large steak restaurant or a glimpse of the Baltic Sea. “People come here looking for total and absolute quiet,” says 61-year-old real estate agent Nadezhda, whose allotment garden touches the training complex. “The young are not interested in buying here. There’s nothing for them to do.” Zelenogorsk, with a population of around 15,000, is one of a string of resort towns lining the Gulf of Finland and is home to a curious mix of newly built villas and crumbling Soviet architecture. In the summer, its sandy beaches fill up with St Petersburg residents eager to flee the city. The town’s main drag, Lenin Avenue, has a limited selection of run-down shops selling Russian food staples and copious amounts of hard alcohol. Most local business owners were unaware that England will train here. A few minutes’ walk away sits the future stadium. Encircled by a rudimentary grey iron fence, fluorescent-clad migrant workers from Uzbekistan are busy laying down the pitch. A new, two-storey building sits on one side, its beige exterior reflects the light. Seats are yet to be installed. The barrier is around two metres high and small white security cameras are omnipresent. RosStroiMontazh, the private firm building the complex, did not grant the Observer access to the grounds, but a spokeswoman said the work would be completed by the end-of- year deadline. On a recent visit, the silence in the air was interrupted by two workers welding metal and the crow of a rooster. A man nearby, under a light spray of rain, was grilling pork kebabs in his overgrown garden. Locals have mixed feelings about the massive construction effort under way, which replaces a Soviet-era pitch that was used primarily by children. For decades, Nadezhda, who declined to give her last name, has grown cherries, plums and blackcurrants on the 100m2 plot the Soviet government gave her. She and her neighbours, who also own allotments, worry they will be flattened when England arrive. Irina, a 70-year-old former schoolteacher, disagrees. “It will do nothing but good for our small town. After the English leave, it will be returned to the Russians for us to use,” she says. Repino, though without a town centre and much smaller with 2,000 people, is more upmarket, with a gourmet supermarket and a vast wine store, though still nowhere near the plush surroundings England teams have become accustomed to during past tournaments. The village’s sole nightclub, Zaliv, meaning Gulf, is frequented by middle-aged people dancing to a steady stream of Russian pop music and smoking shisha pipes. Complete with a mirrored ceiling and a disco ball, Zaliv recently held strip shows and “schoolgirl outfit” nights. The ForRestMix resort club where the team will stay is also no luxury affair. Nestled between a private school and a dilapidated cement tower block filled with construction workers, it is understated in style. The rooms’ decor is spartan, but the beds are large. They look out on to a thicket of trees, whose leaves are an autumnal yellow and red. Gareth Southgate has defended his decision to base England in the middle of a forest, saying it would benefit the players to live quietly and with privacy. He cited the heat of Sochi on the Black Sea and the relentless traffic of Moscow as reasons to avoid them. But with the closest airport an hour away from Repino, and an average summer temperature in the high teens, quickly adjusting to the hotter parts of the country could prove a challenge over June to July. The longest flight time they may have to endure will be from St Petersburg to Yekaterinburg in the Urals, lasting 2½ hours and covering 1,100 miles. Southgate picked the venue from a Fifa World Cup booklet featuring more than 70 places across the European part of the country. Russia has come under fire for poor accommodation at previous major sporting events. The Sochi Winter Olympics, in 2014, became notorious for their hotels, many of which were built hastily and virtually from scratch. When thousands of athletes and journalists descended on the resort town there were reports of murky tap water, missing door handles and the bizarre case of twin toilet cubicles. Unlike other large hotel complexes in the Gulf of Finland, ForRestMix – whose staff say the name is not a pun on its location – is gated and sealed off from the outside world. It also offers a large swimming pool, a spa and a walled indoor area for playing football. In its three restaurants, Deutz and Lanson Champagnes are available for £100 and £135 a bottle, respectively, and dinners are served by candlelight. Its multi-paged menu is typical of the type of Russian fare that was in vogue a decade ago, offering a combination of traditional food such as meat dumplings to crab sushi rolls and hamburgers. The food is good, though, and England might be amused by the menu’s creative translations, such as the word for “herbs”, which is described as “green stuff” in English. But an invisible nuclear threat could be lurking among the tranquillity, warn scientists and researchers. Across the Gulf of Finland lies the town of Sosnovy Bor, home to the largest nuclear cluster in the Baltic Sea region. Next year, upgrades to the Leningrad nuclear power plant, as well as the completion of a new nuclear facility, are expected to go on stream. While they pose no immediate threat to residents, neither have undergone environmental impact checks, says physicist Oleg Bodrov, who sits on the board at the Public Council of the South Coast of the Gulf of Finland, a non-profit organisation concerned with the local environment. “If an accident happens, it will take one and a half hours to reach Repino,” said Bodrov, adding that Russia’s state-run atomic industry has forfeited safety for economic gain. “Fifa should take this into account.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/04/spectra-gas-pipeline-nuclear-plant-meltdown-new-york","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-04T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Planned gas pipeline alongside Indian Point nuclear plant stirs meltdown fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/04/spectra-gas-pipeline-nuclear-plant-meltdown-new-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/04/spectra-gas-pipeline-nuclear-plant-meltdown-new-york","fields":{"headline":"Planned gas pipeline alongside Indian Point nuclear plant stirs meltdown fears","bodyText":"Across a narrow swath cut by bulldozers and chainsaws through the woods of Westchester County, New York, triangular yellow flags are clotheslined between pairs of trees. The flags trace the eventual path of the gas pipeline that the energy giant Spectra is building through the area, escorted at times by police and harried by local residents worried by its proximity to a decaying nuclear power plant. If that pipeline leaks or breaks, say experts, its contents could detonate and destroy the switchyard that sits 400ft from the gas line. Entergy, which runs the Indian Point power station, said the plant could be quickly shut down in such an event. Nuclear engineer Paul Blanch is not so sure. Blanch, who has previously consulted for Entergy and now assists an organization calling for the pipeline to be stopped, said that assertion is a best-case scenario. In the worst case, he said, the reactors could melt down. And he believes Entergy and Spectra have not fully considered that worst-case scenario. “I’m not anti-nuke or anything like that. I’ve been in the business for 50 years and I’ve never seen anything as egregious as this,” he said. He’s not the only one who is worried. The area’s residents are unhappy with the project, which began construction in late 2015, and they have tried to keep it from continuing – objecting in court, in meetings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc) and in the trees themselves as the protests grow more aggressive and construction continues unimpeded. The gas company has used eminent domain laws to acquire adjoining chunks of property in the countryside just north of New York City to place its pipes and compressor stations. Spectra has paid Entergy to build the pipeline on its property. Entergy said its “compensation from Spectra is nominal and in line with industry practice” but declined to give a dollar figure. The payment creates a potential conflict of interest. Entergy’s primary regulator, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), required Entergy to assess the safety of Spectra’s pipeline on its property. The NRC said the amount of the compensation paid for the easement was “out of our jurisdiction”. The town of Yorktown was paid $1.5m by Spectra for the easement on its lands; Westchester County received $2m; the town of Buchanan, where Indian Point is located, received $700,000. Entergy’s assessment itself also has some experts worried. The safety of the pipeline is addressed in an eight-page document that includes a hand-drawn diagram of the property. Its brevity has some worried that risks have been overlooked. Regulators are nonplussed. “We verified the accuracy of their computations,” said Neil Sheehan, spokesman for the NRC. Indeed, few concerns outside those of the industry have attracted attention from regulators. New York governor Andrew Cuomo asked Ferc to review the assessment more thoroughly, but Ferc refused, saying it had already dealt with objections. What frustrates Blanch, who has worked around nuclear technology since he was a 21-year-old in the navy, is what he sees as the regulator’s refusal to do a more thorough risk assessment. He scoffs at the document Entergy produced – the environmental impact survey concerned with nearby wildlife is enormous, especially by comparison. “We have a risk assessment for the turtles in the area and the one-eyed bats but we don’t have a risk assessment for the humans,” Blanch said. “There are guidelines about how to do a high-hazard risk assessment; they’re totally ignored.” Ferc’s environmental impact report cites “consultations with the NRC”. The 42in-diameter natural gas pipeline is an integral part of Spectra’s plan to transmit gas from controversial fracking sites throughout Appalachia’s Marcellus shale deposits all the way up the eastern seaboard to an export terminal in Nova Scotia, where they will be shipped overseas and sold. The route is planned to pass within 105ft of the fuel oil supply tank for the Indian Point switchyard’s emergency generators. The plant is in poor condition, and two Spectra gas pipelines predating its original construction already run underneath. Last week, the Guardian published an assessment of the ageing reactors’ worsening safety record. Since then, Entergy admitted that some of the bolts holding together the interior of one reactor suffered “degradations” and were, in some cases, missing. “That’s a big fucking deal,” Blanch said. The NRC’s office of the inspector general, its internal watchdog, confirmed to the Guardian an open investigation into the NRC’s conduct at Indian Point. A spokesman was not allowed to discuss its details but said it was safe to assume the investigation pertained to the pipeline. A Spectra spokesman said the company believes the pipeline is safe. Construction in Westchester continues. ‘The gas company sends out its stuff about accidents saying they’re like unicorn farts’ Nancy Vann, who lives in Buchanan, near Indian Point, says she won’t put up with the situation. The 68-year-old former attorney is president of the cooperative colony Reynolds Hills, a community founded in 1929 as a campground for Jewish communists, where residents consider the group’s support of the Rojos faction in the Spanish civil war a badge of honor. In her spare time, she works with a local group called Sape – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion – which has galvanized local people against Spectra. Vann has been to court over the proposed payment for use of her co-op’s land – too small, she said – and has made it a point to stand so close to Spectra’s giant tree-harvesters that the company couldn’t operate them safely. Spectra had to shut down the site for the day and return the following morning with chainsaws. Last week, because Ferc does not have a public comment process, Vann stood up in the middle of a Ferc meeting and addressed the commissioners. “I got out the words, ‘Chairman Norman Bay, we would like to ... ’ and then the security guard came over,” Vann recalls. “I walk with a cane. The security guard grabbed me – I was sitting the third seat in; there were two guys between me and the aisle – grabbed me, pulled me over the laps of these two guys, and I said, ‘I need my cane,’ and she said, ‘Somebody will bring it to you.’” A video of the confrontation shows Vann then falling over the men next to her on to the floor as the security guard continues to pull her. After a moment, more guards come to help and she is dragged from the room, still talking. “I cause trouble wherever I go,” she said proudly. Vann, whose ankle has been reconstructed and whose knee has a metal plate and screws in it, said she had to use a wheelchair to leave the building. Ferc declined to comment on the incident, but a spokeswoman said the regulator accepts only written comments, which are handled by an external contractor. Courtney Williams also wants the pipeline shut down – she lives in Peekskill and the pipeline runs next to her children’s school. A cancer researcher for a pharmaceutical company, she was initially skeptical, but said Vann’s group’s research checked out. “[They] kept saying the sky was falling and we were going to be the next Fukushima, and the gas company sends out its stuff about accidents saying they’re like unicorn farts and are nothing to worry about, and that everything’s fine.” Further research horrified her: people who live near compressor or “pigging” stations experience nosebleeds and headaches, one survey of a few south-western Pennsylvania residents found. A team from the State University of New York Albany found that carcinogenic airborne formaldehyde was in abundance around the stations in a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Health. Williams said she receives emergency procedure pamphlets from both the power plant and the gas company now; last year they arrived on the same day. ‘With high heat flux, it would actually melt the power lines’ The safety assessment of the pipeline’s proximity to the plant was performed by Entergy on behalf of the NRC, in turn on behalf of Ferc. It is a scant eight pages long. Those pages include a few figures from an analysis assuming a single kind of pipeline rupture; some of the figures are written out by hand. On one page, a freehand map of the power plant is jotted in thick ink. The document was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by Blanch, who now works with Sape, Vann’s organization. Blanch sent 39 questions to the NRC and Sape enlisted congresswoman Nita Lowey to try to elict a response. Stephen Burns, chairman of the NRC, wrote to Lowey in January that the regulator had done its own “confirmatory analysis” of the project. “I remain confident that the NRC staff has conducted thorough, independent analysis of the impacts of this project on the Indian Point facility,” Burns wrote to Lowey. In its response to Blanch, the NRC said it had no authority to stop the pipeline from being built. The Department of Transportation’s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration (PHMSA) deferred to the NRC in correspondence to Blanch passed to the Guardian. The NRC confirmed that its internal analysis does not represent a separate document but the commission’s efforts to double-check the eight-page Entergy analysis. Experts in the pipeline field including Richard Kuprewicz, who conducts risk analyses through his company Accufacts, say that the assessment on which Ferc relies does not even begin to do the necessary job: “The fundamental question still remains,” Kuprewicz said. In the event of break in the line, “can the Indian Point facilities be safely cooled down?” If they can, he said, the current assessment does not show how. Kuprewicz performs assessments of that kind regularly and his own assessment of a rupture next to the switchyard where the pipeline will run is blunt. Were a pipeline to rupture, “the heat radiation and the impact zones are so great that with high heat flux they would actually melt the power lines”, he said. If power lines melt, that will be the end of Indian Point, Kuprewicz said. “If they were to have a rupture of that 42in gas pipeline, yes, the Indian Point facilities are coming down. When the electricity can’t go out [of the plant], the plant’s got to come down, and it’s going to do that fairly quickly.” ‘Probably not the smartest way to do it’ Kuprewicz is not a tree-hugger. The oil industry veteran – Kuprewicz worked for Arco and Anvil Alaska for more than 20 years – sits on PHMSA’s own hazardous liquid pipeline safety standards committee, which advises the regulator but cannot force it to take action. It isn’t that gas pipelines should never be built, he said – it’s that the buildings around them must be hardened in the event of a rupture. Kuprewicz said the Entergy report was inadequate. “You need a list of the equipment required to cool down the reactors as the rupture will force the emergency shutdown of both facilities via power blackout,” he said. Entergy spokeswoman Patricia Kakridas said the company’s assessor assumed Spectra could immediately shut down a worst-case-scenario “guillotine” rupture because its systems could pick up that significant drop in pressure immediately, and that Indian Point could shut down safely in the event of an explosion. “Indian Point has a federally approved comprehensive emergency plan that addresses all potential emergencies, including an event that damages plant equipment and makes it unavailable,” she said. “Both Indian Point units are designed to safely shut down when posed with any challenge to safe operations.” But when the most recent major gas explosion in New York, in the heart of the East Village, was investigated, researchers found evidence of natural gas in the soil, indicating that the problem stemmed from a slow leak over a long time. The gas line planned next to the Indian Point power plant would be reinforced, with “enhanced protective measures like increasing the thickness of the pipe” and additional corrosion protection, Kakridas said. The assessment focuses on prevention, rather than response, which Kuprewicz characterizes as a flaw: “Assuming low probability is no probability when it means you might have to evacuate New York City is probably not the smartest way to do it.” This article was amended on 7 April 2016 to clarify that the NRC required Entergy to assess safety of the Spectra pipeline, and not merely commissioned the review."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T12:05:58Z","webTitle":"Why have ministers delayed final approval for Hinkley Point C?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval","fields":{"headline":"Why have ministers delayed final approval for Hinkley Point C?","bodyText":"The government’s decision to delay final approval of the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear power station has cast fresh doubt on the project. Theresa May’s government plans to review the proposed £18bn plant before making an announcement in early autumn. The move has shocked EDF, which was expecting to sign contracts for the plant on Friday after the board of the largely French state-owned company signed off the project. This is what could have caused the government to launch a review: Theresa May simply wants time to study the project This would be understandable, given that May’s government is barely a month old. David Cameron and George Osborne backed the project heavily, and it is unlikely that a review would have taken place if they were still prime minister and chancellor, but they are now consigned to the backbenches. Downing Street sources insist that May agreed the review and a new timetable with François Hollande, the French president. However, if this explanation is correct, why was EDF surprised? The company had planned a VIP party and an interview with its UK chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, to celebrate Hinkley Point C being approved. China The Hinkley Point C project is being led by EDF, but China is providing major financial support. The state-backed China General Nuclear Power Corporation has agreed to take a 33% stake in the project. But May could be having doubts about Chinese involvement in such an important domestic project. Last year, Nick Timothy, her joint chief of staff and then aide, accused Osborne of “selling our national security to China”. In a piece for Conservative Home, he claimed that China was effectively buying Britain’s silence on allegations of Chinese human rights abuse. On Hinkley Point, Timothy said: “Security experts, reportedly inside as well as outside government, are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems, which will allow them to shut down Britain’s energy production at will.” Renegotiation of costs Although EDF and China will initially pay for the construction of Hinkley Point C, which will create 25,000 jobs, the cost will eventually be picked up by British taxpayers. The National Audit Office has warned that taxpayers could end up paying more than £30bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project. The government has agreed a “strike price”, a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point C, of £92.50 a megawatt hour for 35 years. This is more than twice the cost of existing wholesale electricity prices. The government could now look to renegotiate these terms, although EDF, whose finances are in a perilous state, is unlikely to be accommodating. Negotiating tactic for Brexit The construction of Hinkley Point C would represent a remarkable collaboration between the British and French governments. The UK is a vital growth market for EDF, with other major industrialised countries such as Germany and Japan closing down their nuclear reactors. By delaying approval of the project, the prime minister may be looking for some leverage with France as Britain begins talks about leaving the EU. The project is going to be scrapped To its critics in the UK and France, Hinkley Point C is an expensive, unsafe and outdated white elephant. Greenpeace claims that the government would be better off developing cheaper renewable energy sources, while trade unions in France believe that EDF simply cannot afford the project. The British government’s decision to delay approval could be a means of shelving the project without anyone losing face."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/14/peter-preston-guardian-appreciation-by-roger-alton","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:04:12Z","webTitle":"‘Peter Preston believed that journalism should try to make the world a better place’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/14/peter-preston-guardian-appreciation-by-roger-alton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/14/peter-preston-guardian-appreciation-by-roger-alton","fields":{"headline":"‘Peter Preston believed that journalism should try to make the world a better place’","bodyText":"Poignantly, a new blockbuster movie celebrating the best of journalism arrives at precisely the time that Peter Preston, who embodied the very best of journalists, leaves us. If there were two things Peter loved, they were movies and papers. I like to think he would have returned to the subject he addressed in his last column for this paper two weeks ago –The Post, the new Steven Spielberg movie with Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep telling the story of the Washington Post’s battle to publish the story of the Pentagon papers in 1971. Having seen the film, he might have commented gnomically on the quality of some of the storytelling – for Peter always wanted stories to be told clearly – but he would have loved the film’s message: that journalism is about telling the truth, no matter how hard it is and no matter how great the pressure against you from management, government or the law. In the last few days there have been countless wonderful tributes to Peter – to his kindness, his inscrutability, his energy, his brilliance and courage as a man and as a journalist. And then, of course, there was his pipe. He was a quiet man around the Guardian office, no shouting or swearing, but you could tell when he was standing behind you from the pleasant whiff of tobacco fumes. “Hmm, not quite sure about that …” he would say about some headline you might be writing. “What about ...?” And come up with a much better one. And the fact that you never knew when he was going to turn up meant you had to do some of the insanely long hours he worked. He was like a father to me, taught me most of what I have ever known, and gave me, like so many journalists, some of the best years of our lives. He saved two newspapers, the Guardian and Observer, which isn’t bad. The Guardian was facing terrible trouble – from a brutal price war, attacks from the Times and the Independent, raging newsprint costs, insane and malicious union disputes – but Peter battled through them all. The Independent, when it launched in the late 80s, came after many Guardian journalists, offering to double salaries. That so few of us left was a tribute to the loyalty and love we felt for Peter and his paper. Maybe a bit of fear too: journalists can be awfully cautious at times. Through a shrewd series of investments and backed by an often brilliant commercial team, Peter started hugely successful supplements on media, education and the public sector, all bringing with them shedloads of classified advertising. Most of it has gone online now, but at the time this was a coup. This was supported by editorial innovation on a phenomenal scale – the women’s page, some brilliant cartoon strips, the G2 tabloid features section, a dazzling redesign that transformed the paper and is still widely imitated 30 years on. Later he led the way when the Guardian group bought the Observer in 1993, and saved it from effective closure as the Independent wanted to fold it into its own Sunday paper. He was always immensely loyal to the Obs, despite coming under heavy bombardment from some Guardian staffers and one or two on the management side. Peter saw that the paper had great commercial potential. In fact, he was a highly commercially-minded man, unlike some on the Guardian who tended to view business and profit as dirty words. He wasn’t ideological: he was progressive, outward-looking, fair-minded but I don’t know anyone who knew how he voted. He once interviewed a friend for a senior job at the Guardian. “Is there anything I should know about your politics?” Peter asked. (This was the mid-1980s and the new and short-lived Social Democratic party was more or less run by Guardian staffers.) “Well, I was a member of the Communist party,” said my friend. “A communist? Oh well that’s OK, I thought you were going to say you were in the SDP. Half the staff seem to be eyeing up safe seats for the next election.” My friend, incidentally, got the job. Peter could always spot talent. He believed, like all the best editors, that journalists should be outsiders: Peter was unbiddable, preferring a cinema or his beloved Millwall to the bright lights, swanky parties and first nights that too many of his colleagues liked to be seen at. He worked long and attritional hours, though would occasionally join his beloved (and very understanding) wife Jean for the end of a play. She said he had seen more second halves in the theatre than anyone living. He was shrewd enough to spot the rising importance of green issues, launching Environment Guardian, another ad-yielding section as well as a skilful piece of branding. Quite how green Peter was I have never known: not especially I would guess, though at one time he did have a battered old Renault 4 parked up at the back of our Farringdon Road offices, bearing the legend “Nuclear Power? Nein Danke.” I think one of his daughters might have put it there, though. That was Peter all over: not for him the chauffeur-driven limos that most editors favoured. He would have thought it was a waste of money, for one thing. He was certainly a frugal man, Peter, and – bless him – he expected most of his staff to be fairly frugal too. Early in my time there, as a subeditor, I found things fairly tight – this was London in the 1970s. I told Peter I was thinking of taking some freelance work in the mornings before coming in. “If you must,” said Peter. “Otherwise you could just find a rich wife.” I thought it was easier to take the freelance work. Peter had recruited (and kept) an absolutely superb staff. And other papers wanted them. My, how they did. At one point the Sunday Times made an eye-popping offer for the late Frank Keating, the Shakespeare of sports writing. Frank loved the Guardian, which had given him a lavish canvas, and would have probably worked for nothing. It turned out that he almost was: Peter had a quick check on what Frank, who had certainly never complained, was actually being paid. Even Peter blanched a bit, gave Frank a few quid, though nothing like what he had been offered, and he stayed. Another predator seen off. Frank, like so many of us, loved the paper that Peter made, with all its follies and foibles. Peter’s Guardian was a brilliant newspaper, quirky certainly but full of great reporters, home and overseas: when we did a shared reporting deal with the Washington Post, it turned out that the Guardian had a considerably bigger foreign staff. From its roots as a regional paper, Peter helped to turn the Guardian into one of the most important newspapers in the world. It was also rebellious, feisty and fun, full of different voices. We enjoyed producing it and we hoped people liked reading it. Peter would not be defeated by anything: he battled polio as a child and defied its crippling effects to become a member of the Magic Circle. One of his early journalistic jobs was, he said, reviewing conjurors for the Magic Circle review. He was fired for being “too critical”. That was very believable. If pressed about his conjuring, he would say that his greatest trick was getting the Guardian out every night. When I joined the paper in the mid-1970s, Peter was night editor, the last stage in his meteoric rise following some high-calibre writing jobs. He was now the person who gets the paper out: this was a time of vivid news – IRA bombings, political mayhem at home, strikes, upheavals in America, the cold war. Peter would map out his front page; I was one of the spear-carriers doing the rest. As the night unfolded, Peter would be at his typewriter, hammering out headlines and rewritten intros, one hand holding the other wrist steady as he hit the keys one-fingered. It was always, then and for the next 40 years, an extraordinary performance. For the evening breaks, most of us would go to the pub or the canteen. Peter would stay at his desk, with a small pizza which he would microwave and a little plastic bottle of wine. It was very Peter: restrained, but not too restrained. He was brave, bold, brilliant and tenacious. He believed that journalism wasn’t just about describing the world. It was also about trying to make it a better place.

The Chinese foreign ministry told Trump that the US’s longstanding “One China” policy, by which it does not challenge Beijing’s claim over the self-ruled island, was the political basis for all Sino-US relations. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Saturday Trump said all options were on the table as he considered how he might reshape Washington’s relations with China, a country he accused of deliberately devaluing its currency in order to hamstring US businesses. “Everything is under negotiation, including ‘One China’,” Trump said, referring to the US’s longstanding diplomatic decision not to challenge Beijing’s claim that Taiwan, an independently and democratically-ruled island, is part of its territory. China’s foreign ministry hit back in a statement advising Trump, a billionaire property tycoon who has claimed “deals are my art form”, that he would never be able to achieve such a deal. “There is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable region of China, and the government of the People’s Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing China,” spokesperson Lu Kang was quoted as saying. “The ‘One China’ principle, which is the political foundation of the China-US relations, is non-negotiable.” Lu warned the president-elect that the only way to avoid “disruption” to the relationship was for him to recognise the “high sensitivity” of the Taiwan question and approach the issue with “prudence and honour”. The latest exchange between Beijing and the incoming president came after Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, infuriated Beijing by likening its island-building campaign in the South China Sea to Russia’s “invasion” of Crimea. China’s state-run media counter-attacked, claiming Trump would face a “large-scale war” if the US followed through on Tillerson’s threat to deny China access to those artificial islands. “Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories,” the Global Times, a Communist party-controlled tabloid, argued in an editorial. Before Trump’s 8 November election, leading China experts said they suspected Beijing was relishing the possibility of a Trump White House as “an enormous opportunity”. But the billionaire began ruffling Chinese feathers within days of his victory, holding a 10-minute phone conversation with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen, the first such call since the US broke off ties with the self-ruled island in 1979. Since then the atmosphere between Beijing and Washington has continued to sour, with Trump using television interviews and Twitter to criticise China’s leaders on a range of issues including North Korea, the South China Sea and their alleged manipulation of the yuan. Trump’s decision to hand notorious China hawk Peter Navarro a position in his administration also went down badly in Beijing. Navarro, a scholar at the University of California, Irvine, has described the Chinese government as a despicable, parasitic, brutal, brass-knuckled, crass, callous, amoral, ruthless and totally totalitarian imperialist power. However, it has been Trump’s threat to overturn longstanding US policy on Taiwan – which China regards as a breakaway province – that has caused most consternation in Beijing. Last month China called on Washington to prevent Tsai from transiting through the US, amid speculation that the Taiwanese president was hoping to land a protocol-shredding audience with Trump en route to a tour of Central America. Those calls fell on deaf ears but Tsai is not known to have met with Trump while in the US. Instead she visited Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco on Saturday, using the social network to announce her appearance there. The previous weekend Tsai met Republican senator Ted Cruz who rejected Beijing’s calls to shun Taiwan’s first female president. “We will continue to meet with anyone, including the Taiwanese, as we see fit,” Cruz said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/aug/17/china-hinkley-point-delay-diplomacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-17T10:44:35Z","webTitle":"What does Theresa May really think about China? | Mary Dejevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/china-hinkley-point-delay-diplomacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/china-hinkley-point-delay-diplomacy","fields":{"headline":"What does Theresa May really think about China?","bodyText":"What are the new government’s intentions towards China; is there a rationale, and do ministers know what it is? Although the prime minister is on holiday in Switzerland, she has contrived to feature in the headlines almost every day, and her latest contribution takes the form of a letter to the Chinese president and prime minister, hand-delivered by the UK’s Asia minister during a visit to Beijing. In it, according to the Chinese, Theresa May confirms that she will visit China next month and “looks forward to strengthening cooperation … on trade and business and on global issues”. Now appearance and substance need to be separated here. Whoever was UK prime minister was always likely to visit Beijing in September. China will be hosting the G20 summit; the UK has been an active member of the G20, which came into its own after the 2008 financial crisis, and it would have constituted more of a statement if May had decided not to go. What is significant is less that she is going, or even that she has written to the Chinese prime minister, than that both moves have been made so public, and right now. It would appear that there has been a degree of scrambling in Downing Street and a rather urgent effort to smooth ruffled Chinese feathers, following May’s decision to pause a final decision on the Hinkley Point power project which was to be part-funded by the Chinese. This was one of May’s first decisions as prime minister, and although justified by officials – and justifiable in many ways – its handling was unusually clumsy and last minute. The UK’s revised position was announced only hours before the final signing ceremony, after the French company EDF had (not without difficulty) cleared its part of the deal, with the Chinese part-funders raring to go, all the participants assembled, and the celebratory lunch all but laid out in a marquee at the site. For those asking whether the May government was going to be different from Cameron-Osborne, the postponement of a final decision on Hinkley Point offered dramatic proof in at least one area. There were dark hints – unattributed – about national security concerns, and a distinct sense that not just this cooperation on nuclear power, but the whole China focus favoured by George Osborne, was being reconsidered. All of which was fine and good as a message for the UK public, but the response in China seems to have been underestimated. Rather than taking the delay in their stride – as the French and EDF did, officially at least – the Chinese fired off an unusual, and unusually swift, broadside, in the form of a Financial Times article by the Chinese ambassador in London. Liu Xiaoming more than hinted that the 11th-hour postponement was seen as an unfriendly move and that the new government risked jeopardising future relations with China more broadly. “If Britain’s openness is a condition for bilateral co-operation, then mutual trust is the very foundation on which this is built,” he said. How much conviction will May’s response command in the Chinese corridors of power? Much will depend on the final decision the May government eventually reaches on Hinkley Point – but by no means all. The trust that David Cameron and Osborne had tried to forge, with apparent success, has undoubtedly been damaged. China’s acutely sensitive nose has been put out of joint. From the perspective of the UK’s long-term national interest, however, this may be no bad thing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"cities/2018/apr/23/allied-bombs-still-threaten-hamburg-ww2","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"'They haven't lost their potency': Allied bombs still threaten Hamburg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/23/allied-bombs-still-threaten-hamburg-ww2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/apr/23/allied-bombs-still-threaten-hamburg-ww2","fields":{"headline":"'They haven't lost their potency': Allied bombs still threaten Hamburg","bodyText":"“Go on, see if you can break it,” says bomb disposal technician Peter Bodes, sharing out shards of a thin plastic disc manufactured at a munitions factory somewhere in wartime Britain. The brittle material snaps easily and a piece falls inaudibly to the carpeted floor of the conference room. It’s a greyish day in March 2018 at the Hamburg office for unexploded ordnance, the Kampfmittelräumdienst, located at the rear of a fire station on the city’s southern periphery. Bodes has just plucked the pieces of decaying celluloid wafer from what, at first sight, looks like a cross section of an over-engineered pipe connector. On closer inspection, a small glass ampoule – reminiscent of a spirit level – is embedded in the milled brass; the acetone inside it has been sealed away for almost 80 years. This vial made its way from a munitions factory to an airfield and into a bomb bay, up into the air, over the North Sea, and all the way back down to earth – intact. It should have broken, discharging its corrosive contents to eat away at the celluloid disc until it cracked, releasing a striker to detonate several hundred pounds of high explosive. It is the key element in a No 47 Mk1 side pocket pistol, a chemical time-delay device which, when it worked, allowed the RAF to make the bombs explode around half an hour after landing. Emerging from air raid shelters once the all-clear was sounded, German civilians would be taken by surprise and morale shattered. The fact this vial failed to shatter saved lives at the time – and endangers lives today. During the second world war, the British and US air forces dropped around 1.5m tonnes of high explosives on the Third Reich. Hamburg, within easy reach of East Anglian airfields and with a hugely important harbour, bore the brunt of the bombardment. In summer 1943, Operation Gomorrah saw 9,000 tonnes of bombs dropped on the city, causing one of the first ever manmade firestorms and killing more than 42,000 people. The RAF reported at the time that 22,580 tonnes of ordnance had been released over Hamburg during the war by comparison, the Luftwaffe delivered around 74,000 tonnes over the whole of the United Kingdom. Around 10% of bombs dropped by the Germans are thought to have failed, and barely a month goes by without an unexploded bomb being found somewhere in Britain. A find in Docklands earlier this year closed London City airport; last summer, two bombs were found in the Bristol Channel near Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. “As a rule of thumb, though, if German ordnance hit the ground, it exploded,” says period munitions expert Stephen Taylor, “while Allied bombs were notoriously unreliable, with a failure rate generally estimated at 15% or even 20%, especially if they hit soft soil and had pistols rather than fuses.” That means that, after the war, there was anything up to 300,000 tonnes of unexploded aerial ordnance on the former territory of the Third Reich. And despite efforts to recover it during the conflict – often using prisoners of war, concentration camp inmates or forced labourers as expendable disposal squads – much of it remains unaccounted for. Prof Wolfgang Spyra, Germany’s leading research authority on the subject, estimates that there are around 3,000 live bombs still buried in Hamburg alone. In Berlin, the city’s biggest railway station, government ministries and a hospital were evacuated on Friday after the discovery of an unexploded second world war bomb. If it seems hard to imagine that so many devices packed with explosives falling from a great height failed to explode, a visit to Hamburg’s bomb disposal squad doesn’t make it any easier: after Bodes has put away the demonstration detonators, Ronald Weiler, head of underwater bomb disposal, leads the way down to the sheds in which examples of recovered munitions are kept. “Just look at that sharp, conical nose,” says Weiler, patting an eight-foot high RAF high-capacity Blockbuster as thick as a tree trunk: “Hard to believe it didn’t explode, isn’t it?” The Hamburg squad found it back in the early 1990s, four or five yards below the surface of the nearby wetlands. Boosted by false assumptions about explosives and ignorance of historical facts, the dangers posed by unexploded ordinance are frequently underestimated. “Contrary to what many people seem to think,” explains Bodes, “the explosives in the bombs haven’t lost any of their potency. The timescale for TNT to be broken down chemically is measured in millennia. Since the end of the war, there have been around 100 spontaneous detonations of undiscovered time-delay devices, so ‘letting sleeping dogs lie’ is not a sound principle.” In the immediate postwar years, huge amounts of rubble were simply buried in the race to rebuild Germany’s ruined cities; there was neither the time nor money to painstakingly search for live needles in the proverbial haystack. When accidents started happening in the 1950s, bomb disposal units were set up, yet by the early 2000s, they looked like expensive relics of an age long past – especially from the point of view of public accounts committees. “When a disposal went wrong in Salzburg in 2003, people in Hamburg were saying things like, ‘But that’s Austria, not Germany!’ Forgetting the fact that it was part of the Reich and that the same ordnance was used everywhere.” “Recent events have changed that perspective again, though.” Bodes reels off a series of finds closer to home that led to large-scale evacuations. “The real turning point was the 2010 explosion in Göttingen,” he adds. Three technicians were killed when a bomb detonated during the attempt to disarm it; Bodes was called as an expert witness to the public inquiry in Hamburg’s neighbouring state, Lower Saxony. “Since then, Hamburg has been investing in new equipment. Our politicians now fully understand the importance of what we are doing.” The city’s bomb disposal unit pioneered new techniques such as using reverse-mounted water-jet cutters to remove detonators. It has also just taken delivery of a new launch better able to withstand the strong currents in the river Elbe; many at the Hamburg Kampfmittelräumdienst are former navy divers – not immaterial in a city state whose surface area is 8.1% water and whose docks were prime targets. Spyra considers Bodes’ Hamburg unit to be one of the best in Germany. “They’ve moved from responding to chance finds to a more systematic approach. What is more, they have the expertise and self-confidence to make safety considerations paramount; they don’t let themselves get pressured by businesses and officials with other concerns. Finally, they take professional development seriously and offer training for young bomb disposal officers.” That isn’t the case everywhere in Germany, and the stark regional differences are a direct result of the war itself. On every level, the Federal Republic was set up to be decentralised: never again should a dictator be able to lay his hands on one single seat of power. As such, postwar West Germany was composed of 10 federal states (plus Berlin), or Länder, with a remit for everything from education and broadcasting through to the policing, secret services and indeed bomb disposal (the German armed forces could only be deployed within the Republic in times of national emergency). On reunification, the former East Germany became part of this structure, too, adding five states. So, while in most European countries unexploded ordnance is a matter for specialised military units, each of Germany’s Länder deals with it individually. The Berlin bomb disposal unit is part of the city state’s forensic science department, while in the city state of Bremen, it’s part of the police force. In Hamburg, it is organised as a part of the fire service. Germany’s most populous state, North-Rhine Westphalia – the target of 48% of all air attacks primarily because of the industrial importance of the Rhine and Ruhr basin – delegates down to its regional administrations. Thuringia and Bavaria have outsourced to the private sector. Importantly, it is the federal state which remains legally responsible for dealing with unexploded ordnance, even when it delegates to contractors. So when a US bomb with a chemical time-delay device was found in Munich in 2012 and the contractor – unfamiliar with the type of detonator – refused to attempt to disarm it, Bavaria ended up having to send for a bomb disposal technician from the small town of Oranienburg. A botched controlled explosion then caused millions of euros of damage and led to a protracted lawsuit brought by the insurance company Axa against city authorities, which it accused of insufficient contractor scrutiny. Incidents such as this bring regional differences into sharp relief. Little Oranienburg – bombed disproportionately due to its armaments factories – is the only local authority in Germany to proactively search for unexploded ordnance, and its state, Brandenburg, takes the threat so seriously that it is agitating for laws to standardise and fund bomb disposal in Germany. Many see central government as shirking its responsibilities, and not just because it has made no effort to share the financial burden of detection and disposal with the states. Currently, the government pays for damages caused by German munitions, but landowners are responsible for insuring themselves against the consequences of the (far more frequent) discovery of Allied bombs. And so the geographical lottery continues. While Hamburg has acquired copies of all available wartime reconnaissance photos and compiled a master heat-map of potential bombsites, the Bavarian interior ministry warns builders that it can only offer access to one third of comparable material for its state. And to the exasperation of experts, the city of Munich refers to surveys conducted in the late 1990s and declares areas such as the Theresienwiese (a vast open square on which Munich’s Oktoberfest is staged every year) to be clear of unexploded ordnance. “Technology advances, though,” says Spyra, “and what might not have been found 20 years ago might well be detected today. No area can ever be considered ‘100% free’.” Bodes, too, says that “there can never be 100% security, even though that is what – in contrast to previous generations – many people today expect. Truly freeing Hamburg of unexploded ordnance would mean evacuating and excavating the entire city.” Nevertheless, nothing is being left to chance. Whether on green or brownfield sites, whether owned by individuals, property developers or its own authorities, the state’s regulations require anyone applying for construction permits to have an ordnance survey carried out by vetted contractors. If suspect objects are encountered during works, Bodes’ department must be alerted. They remain on call round-the-clock: “As soon as unexploded ordnance is uncovered, the conditions in which it has spent the last eight decades change: soil pressure is removed, light and heat may start to have an effect, and often the device gets moved – whether by accident or in flagrant contradiction of regulations.” As if to prove a point, beepers start to sound in the conference room. In the port, an unexploded device has surfaced in an industrial rinsing tank – and been pulled out of the water. There are sighs all round. Not infrequently, companies either delay reporting finds or move them out of the way so as to not lose working time. That makes life more difficult – and more dangerous – for the Kampfmittelräumdienst. “We might be bomb disposal technicians, but we’re not suicidal,” says Bodes, passing round another object which once made its way from the UK to Hamburg: a signed copy of The Lonely War: A Story of Bomb Disposal in WWII by One Who Was There, signed by the author, Lieutenant-Colonel Eric Wakeling, on 4 June 1998. Bodes met the veteran at Nato exercises in northern Germany that year, but apart from that has had little to do with his counterparts in the UK armed forces. “There’s a lively exchange between European countries,” he says, pointing to memorabilia from the Swedish Göta Engineer Regiment behind him on the windowsill, “but the British Isles seem to be that bit further away than other countries.” Below one of the many plaques commemorating his unit’s success, however, a “Keep calm and carry on” fridge magnet has been fixed to the wall.

The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in Belgium has doubled in one week, as an average of 448.1 people per day tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week of July. Travellers entering France from 16 countries where coronavirus is spread widely must now undergo tests upon arrival at French airports and ports. At least 14 members of the US House of Representatives and Senate - seven Republicans and seven Democrats - have tested positive or are presumed to have had Covid-19 since the coronavirus pandemic began earlier this year. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the official residence of Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, as weeks of protests against the Israeli leader showed no signs of slowing. 36 crew members confined on the Norwegian cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen have tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Saturday. Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos will allow churches and mosques to resume in-person services from 7 August, and restaurants, social clubs and recreational centres will also be allowed to reopen with limited capacity from 14 August as the state, the centre of Nigeria’s coronavirus outbreak, eases restrictions despite a continued rise in infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Saturday the coronavirus pandemic was likely to be “lengthy” after its emergency committee met to evaluate the crisis six months after sounding the international alarm. Ireland’s chief medical officer described a recent spike in Covid-19 infections as “concerning”, as the average number of cases per day doubled from around 20 in recent weeks to over 40 over the past five days. Spain’s labour minister, Yolanda Díaz Pérez, suggested on Saturday that the government would extend its coronavirus furlough scheme for an extra three months. That’s all from me for today. My vivacious colleagues in Australia will be taking over shortly and guide you through the next few hours of this pandemic. Thanks for reading and writing in, goodnight. The head of Mexico’s efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic has sidestepped calls to resign after Mexico’s death count rose to overtake the UK’s as the third-highest in the world. Assistant health secretary Hugo López-Gatell expressed his respect to the nine of Mexico’s 32 state governors who called for his resignation, adding: “I hope we can continue to work together,” the Associated Press reports. Mexico reported 688 further confirmed Covid-19 deaths on Friday, raising its accumulated total to 46,688. The number of confirmed cases rose by a near-record 8,458, bringing Mexico’s total cases so far to almost 425,000. A letter calling for López-Gatell’s immediate resignation bore the names of 10 state governors, all from opposition parties, was made public on Friday, but later one of those governors said he had not approved the letter and distanced himself from it. The letter blamed the administration of president Andrés Manuel López Obrador for an erratic handling of the epidemic and a lack of efficient response that boosted Mexico’s death toll to the third-highest in the world while the country simultaneously suffered an 18.9% drop in economic activity in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Mexico has imposed a very lax and partial lockdown of economic activity that has not stopped high levels of contagion, but has strangled the economy. Rather than testing or contact tracing, the government has focused on expanding hospital facilities. The federal government has given confusing and mixed messages about whether to wear face masks. López Obrador himself almost never wears one, and said on Friday: “I will use a face mask when there is no more corruption,” a reference to his administration’s anti-graft crusade, which he views as the country’s main priority. With millions of Americans set to lose $600 (about £458) a week in extra federal unemployment benefits – an economic lifeline during the pandemic – many thousands have yet to receive that money, Bloomberg reports. State unemployment agencies have been so swamped with claims that more than $100bn of benefits owed still haven’t been paid, according to calculations based on Treasury and Labor Department data. Those billions should eventually be distributed, even if Congress doesn’t act to extend the benefits, set to expire on 31 July. But the delays underscore the magnitude of the unemployment crisis unfolding across the US, as well as the daunting bureaucratic challenges of coping with it. Some out-of-work people have received only part of their promised benefits. Morgan Johnson, a single mother in Pennsylvania, said her extra benefits were halted because of suspected fraud, and attempts to contact the relevant authorities were unsuccessful as phone lines were always busy. She hasn’t been paid in six weeks and, she says, is on the verge of “losing everything”. Brazil recorded 45,392 additional confirmed cases of coronavirus as well as 1,088 deaths from the disease caused by the virus in the past 24 hours, its health ministry said on Saturday. Brazil has registered more than 2.7 million cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 93,563, according to ministry data. Prospective brides in England whose wedding receptions have been scuppered by new social distancing restrictions have turned to social media to vent their disappointment and fury at the short notice with which the new rules were implemented. Using the hashtag #whataboutweddings on Twitter, affected brides-to-be and people working in the wedding industry are lambasting the last-minute rule change, with many pointing out it seems unfair to ban wedding receptions of up to 30 people while regular parties are allowed to turn up in the same numbers at the same venues, such as pubs or restaurants, and air travel is permitted. On Friday, prime minister Boris Johnson announced with less than 24 hours’ notice that the decision to allow wedding receptions with up to 30 people from Saturday would be reversed. South Africa’s confirmed cases of Covid-19 have crossed half a million, the health ministry said on Saturday, while cases in Africa as a whole approached a million. Africa’s most industrialised nation recorded 10,107 new confirmed Covid-19 cases, pushing the total to 503,290, the health ministry said, four months since the first case was confirmed in the country. At least 14 members of the US House of Representatives and Senate - seven Republicans and seven Democrats - have tested positive or are presumed to have had Covid-19 since the coronavirus pandemic began earlier this year, with Representative Raul Grijalva becoming the latest on Saturday, Reuters reports. Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, tested positive for the coronavirus but feels fine and has gone into isolation, he said in a statement on Saturday. Grijalva expressed frustration with the reluctance of some Republican lawmakers to wear masks, which can slow the spread of the virus. The Texas Republican Louie Gohmert, 66, a staunch conservative, said on Wednesday he tested positive in a prescreening at the White House but did not have any symptoms. “It’s really ironic, because a lot of people have made a big deal out of my not wearing a mask a lot. But in the last week or two, I have worn a mask more than I have in the whole last four months,” he said. Representative Morgan Griffith, 62, a Virginia Republican and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said in mid-July that he had tested positive. His office said he did not have significant symptoms. The South Carolina Republican Representative Tom Rice, 62, said on Facebook in mid-June that he, his wife and son had all tested positive for the coronavirus but that all were “on the mend.” Mike Kelly, 72, a Republican from Pennsylvania, tested positive for the coronavirus in late March at a drive-through testing site. He told an interviewer that it took him about a month to recover and that he lost 30 pounds (14 kg). The Utah Democrat Representative Ben McAdams caught the virus in March, was hospitalised and needed oxygen. After his release, he warned others to take the virus seriously. “I’m young, I’m 45 years old, I’m healthy, I exercise every day and it hit me really hard,” he told ABC. Other affected lawmakers include Nydia Velazquez, 67, a Democrat from New York, the Republican Florida Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, 58, and the Republican Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, 57, who had said on 22 March that he had tested positive and was in quarantine. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the official residence of Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, as weeks of protests against the Israeli leader showed no signs of slowing, the Associated Press reports. Saturday’s demonstration in central Jerusalem, along with smaller gatherings in Tel Aviv and near Netanyahu’s beach house in central Israel, was one of the largest turnouts in weeks of protests. Throughout the summer, thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets, calling for Netanyahu to resign, protesting his handling of the country’s coronavirus crisis and saying he should not remain in office while on trial for corruption charges. The rallies against Netanyahu are the largest Israel has seen since 2011 protests over the country’s high cost of living. Netanyahu has tried to play down the unrest, calling the demonstrators leftists and anarchists. Late on Saturday, his Likud Party issued a statement that accused Israel’s two private TV stations of giving free and endless publicity to the protesters and exaggerating the importance of the gatherings. While the demonstrations have largely been peaceful, they have grown increasingly violent in recent days. Some protesters have clashed with police, accusing them of using excessive force, while small gangs of Netanyahu supporters affiliated with a far-right group have assaulted demonstrators. Netanyahu has claimed demonstrators are inciting violence against him. Israeli police have arrested some 20 far-right activists in recent days and police said they were on high alert for violence at the demonstrations. The demonstrations are organized by a loose-knit network of activist groups. After moving quickly to contain the virus last spring, many believe Israel reopened its economy too quickly, leading to a surge in cases. The country is now coping with record levels of coronavirus, while unemployment has surged to over 20%. 36 crew members confined on the Norwegian cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen have tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Saturday, according to AFP. The ship’s company Hurtigruten had earlier indicated 33 positive tests. Of the 158 crew members on board, 36 are infected, said Pal Jakobsen, media officer for the city of Tromso where the ship arrived on Friday, confirming a development that raises fears of a resurgence of cases in Norway. The infected crew are all Filipino, apart from three people from France, Norway and Germany. As we reported earlier, up to 17,000 people, including libertarians and anti-vaccination activists, have marched in Berlin to protest against Germany’s coronavirus regulations. Many flouted guidance on wearing masks and social distancing as they accused the government of “stealing our freedom”. While Germany had initial success in containing the virus, infections are rising and its R number has risen above one. Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos will allow churches and mosques to resume in-person services from 7 August, the state’s governor said in a press briefing on Saturday. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu also said restaurants, social clubs and recreational centres will be allowed to reopen with limited capacity from 14 August as the state, the centre of Nigeria’s coronavirus outbreak, eases restrictions despite a continued rise in infections. Lagos state, home to the megacity of the same name with 20 million people, has more than 15,000 confirmed cases and 192 deaths, by far the largest share of Nigeria’s 43,151 cases, Reuters reports. It ordered widespread closures and a lockdown in March to halt the spread of the highly infectious virus. The lockdown was eased in early May, but Sanwo-Olu scuppered plans to reopen churches and mosques in June, citing a continued rise in cases. Christianity and Islam are widely practised in Lagos and the rest of Nigeria, and houses of worship in normal times often host services with thousands of people. Houses of worship will only be allowed to open for services once a week at no more than 50% capacity. Sanwu-Olu also increased the limit on public gatherings from 20 to 50 people. Nightclubs, cinemas and some arcades will remain closed. The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in Belgium has doubled in one week, as an average of 448.1 people per day tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week of July. The number of new infections during the period between 22 and 28 July increased by 104% compared to the previous week. This increase can be seen in almost all provinces but in the province of Antwerp in particular, according to the Belgian national public health institute, Sciensano. New cases are emerging in all age groups, but most infections are occurring among people aged 20-59. As far as hospitals are concerned, last week’s average is 22 hospitalisations per day, which represents an increase of 21%. Last week, the number of deaths with Covid-19 in Belgium averaged 3 per day. According to Johns Hopkins University figures, 9,841 people have died so far from Covid-19 in the country of about 11.5 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Saturday the coronavirus pandemic was likely to be “lengthy” after its emergency committee met to evaluate the crisis six months after sounding the international alarm. The committee “highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic”, the WHO said in a statement, and warned of the risk of “response fatigue” given the socio-economic pressures on countries. The panel gathered on Friday for the fourth time since the coronavirus crisis began, half a year on from its 30 January declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) – the WHO’s highest level of alarm. “WHO continues to assess the global risk level of Covid-19 to be very high,” said its latest statement. “The committee highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.” The coronavirus has killed at least 680,000 people and infected at least 17.6 million since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. Countries around the world have imposed strict lockdowns in a bid to control the spread of the respiratory disease, plunging economies into sharp contraction. The committee urged the WHO to provide nuanced, pragmatic guidance on Covid-19 reactions “to reduce the risk of response fatigue in the context of socio-economic pressures”. The panel urged the WHO to support countries in preparing for the rollout of proven therapeutics and vaccines. The committee also urged the agency to accelerate research into the remaining “critical unknowns” of the virus, such as the animal source and potential animal reservoirs. It called for improved understanding of the epidemiology and severity of Covid-19, including its long-term health effects. The near six-hour gathering was hosted at the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva, with some participants joining via video link. The committee will reconvene in three months’ time. Going into the meeting, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the pandemic’s effects would be long-lasting. “It’s sobering to think that six months ago, when you recommended I declare a PHEIC, there were less than 100 cases and no deaths outside China,” he said on Friday. “The pandemic is a once-in-a-century health crisis, the effects of which will be felt for decades to come.” Marathon Petroleum, the largest US oil refiner by volume, plans to permanently close two refineries in Martinez, California, and Gallup, New Mexico, the company said, in response to lower demand for fuel. The company had earlier idled the two refineries following weak demand due to Covid-19 outbreaks in the US. US refiners on average suspended about 20% of total processing capacity when vehicle and air travel reduced. Marathon said it plans to use the Martinez facility, California’s fourth-largest, as an oil storage facility, and is evaluating its future use to produce diesel fuel from industry waste and used cooking oil. The company is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on Monday. Spokespeople did not immediately respond to request for comment on whether the closures would require a charge to earnings. Up to 800 workers face job losses combined at the 161,000 barrels-per-day Martinez and 27,000 barrels-per-day Gallup refineries beginning in October, the company said. “We do not anticipate supply disruptions in these regions, and we will continue to utilize our integrated system to meet customer commitments,” the company said in a statement on its website. Ireland’s chief medical officer on Saturday described a recent spike in Covid-19 infections as “concerning”, as the average number of cases per day doubled from around 20 in recent weeks to over 40 over the past five days. The country, which still has lower infection rates than much of Europe, reported 45 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, down from a two-month high of 85 cases on Thursday, Reuters reports. “Over the last five days we have seen an average of 44 cases a day. This trend is clearly concerning,” chief medical officer Ronan Glynn said in a statement. The British government said on Saturday that 46,193 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Friday, up by 74 from the day before. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been more than 56,400 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, PA reports. The government also said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Saturday, there had been a further 771 lab-confirmed cases. Overall, a total of 303,952 cases have been confirmed. The Archdiocese of Manila will not hold any public religious activities in its churches and shrines between 3 and 14 August in response to the medical community’s call to revert to stricter quarantine measures, CNN Philippines reports. Apostolic administrator Broderick Pabillo said on Saturday: “We share the compassion of our medical frontliners for the many sick people being brought to our hospitals. So we support their appeal for a ‘time out’.” However, online activities will still continue, the administrator clarified. The Archdiocese covers churches in Manila City and nearby provinces such as Rizal, Laguna, Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Cavite, Bataan, Zambales and Mindoro. Earlier, health professionals urged the government to declare a two-week-long enhanced community quarantine in Metro Manila and nearby regions, saying workers are burning out over the surges of Covid-19 cases. Researchers also forecast that many hospitals in Metro Manila could become “overwhelmed” in the next two weeks as designated spaces for infected patients continue to get filled up. Travellers entering France from 16 countries where coronavirus is spread widely must now undergo tests upon arrival at French airports and ports. French prime minister Jean Castex announced last month that the tests would be required as of 1 August for passengers France is allowing in from a list of approved countries, unless they present proof of a negative test done within 72 hours of their departure. Those who test positive in France as of Saturday must quarantine for 14 days. France is not permitting general travel to and from the 16 countries, which include the US and Brazil. The testing requirement therefore only applies to people entering under limited circumstances: those who are French citizens and who live in these countries, or citizens of these countries with an established residence in France. Along with the United States and Brazil, which are reporting tens of thousands of new cases each day, the countries include Algeria, Bahrain, Israel, India, South Africa, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Panama, Peru, Serbia, Turkey and Madagascar. France has had over 225,000 confirmed infections and over 30,200 Covid-19 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Spain’s labour minister, Yolanda Díaz Pérez, suggested on Saturday that the government would extend its coronavirus furlough scheme for an extra three months until the end of the year. Speaking after talks in Majorca with the regional government and union bosses, Díaz said it would make no sense to drop the ERTE furlough scheme when it is scheduled to finish at the end of September, according to AFP. “It would not make any sense to drop a protection system as important as the one designed by the government,” she said of the scheme that has supported millions of people. “There is no point in designing a mechanism that involves huge amounts of public resources then at the decisive moment ... we drop it,” she said. “The key is in the last quarter of the year,” Díaz said, indicating she wanted to send a “message of calm”. “We are not going to remove anything.” Her remarks came a day after Spain formally went into recession after its GDP fell by 18.5% in the second quarter. My colleague Stephen Burgen reports that in Barcelona, businesses are furious that, when infections started to rise again in late July, Catalan president Quim Torra announced a lockdown he was not empowered to enforce. By the time he explained that the measure was merely advisory, “Barcelona in lockdown” had gone viral and hotels and restaurants were reporting cancellations. A total of 3.7 million people benefited from the government’s furlough scheme between mid-March and the end of May, labour ministry figures show. The government also banned layoffs in the six months after the end of the furlough scheme, although cutbacks are expected. A commitment to fund such temporary unemployment schemes was one of the key measures put in place by prime minister Pedro Sánchez’s government to bolster an economy battered by months of lockdown. The pandemic also destroyed more than 1m jobs in Spain between April and June, mostly in the services and tourism sector. Spain’s unemployment rate, which jumped to 15.3% by the end of June, could rise as high as 19% by the end of the year, the government has warned, while the IMF sees it rising to 20.8%. Hard-hit by the virus which has killed more than 28,400 people, Spain has been struggling with a spike in new infections that has sparked European travel warnings and a British quarantine move that has damaged the fledgling recovery of tourism. At least 33 crew members confined on a Norwegian cruise ship have tested positive for the coronavirus, the company Hurtigruten said on Saturday. Arriving at the northern Norwegian port of Tromso from the archipelago of Svalbard, the crew of the MS Roald Amundsen was quarantined onboard the ship on Friday after four staff members tested positive for the virus and were hospitalised, AFP reports. Of the 158 crew members onboard, “33 tested positive for Covid-19, while 120 tested negative,” Hurtigruten said. Five people will be retested. The company said that four crew members “were isolated several days ago because of other disease symptoms, with no symptoms of Covid-19”. “There was no reason to suspect Covid-19 when the ship docked in Tromso based on the symptoms they were showing,” Hurtigruten said. According to the hospital, the four crew members are foreign nationals. The ship had nearly 180 passengers onboard since departing on 25 July. None of the passengers reported symptoms related to coronavirus during the voyage, Hurtigruten said. All passengers disembarked the ship on Friday but about 60 people have since been quarantined in Tromso. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has not ruled out the possibility of more cases emerging but added more answers would be provided “once the tests have been carried out”. It recommended all passengers remained quarantined while awaiting their results. On Friday, Norway had 9,208 confirmed cases of coronavirus. One person died of the virus on Friday night, bringing the country’s total death toll to 256. It was the first coronavirus-related death in the Nordic country in two weeks. The airline and travel industry’s hopes of a recovery are crushed by new quarantine rules and travel restrictions amid a fresh wave of coronavirus infections in several countries, my colleague Rob Davies reports, as fed-up sun seekers are increasingly choosing to defer holiday decisions indefinitely rather than rebook for a later date. Full report here: Hello, I’m taking over from my colleague Aamna for the next few hours. Please feel free to message me with relevant updates or tips, you can get me on Twitter @JedySays or via email. Hundreds have ignored London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plea to stay at home and not attend the annual Afrikan Emancipation Day Reparations march in Brixton. Protesters gathered at Windrush Square in Brixton, south London, for the Afrikan Emancipation Day. A number of demonstrators temporarily blocked Brixton Road at the junction with Acre Lane, forcing cars and buses to stop and turn around, PA reports. Protesters, including some from Extinction Rebellion, occupied the middle of the junction until they were told to get back on to the kerb by police officers. Crowds of people listened to music in Windrush Square while a group of police officers stood nearby. A short distance away, another group observed speeches before a three-minute silence was held. A further four people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospitals to 29,342, PA reports. The patients were aged between 78 and 84 years old and all had known underlying health conditions. Another five deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. Ending support for extremely vulnerable people shielding from coronavirus while pausing the easing of lockdown restrictions in England has been described by a leading charity as “perverse”. Age UK has said it no longer made sense to end the advice for vulnerable people to stay at home, since rising infection rates led to additional lockdown restrictions in parts of northern England and the pausing of further easing in the rest of the country. As of Saturday, more than 2 million people who are extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus are no longer being advised by governments in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to stay at home, or shield. Many people have expressed concern that they feel forced to return to the workplace even though they do not think it is safe and the virus is still circulating. Caroline Abrahams, the director of Age UK, said: With a number of lockdown easements firmly on hold and millions under new restrictions in the north it seems perverse for shielding, and the supports it brings, to be paused as of today. There might have been a rationale for this pause when it was originally announced, a couple of weeks ago, but surely not now. Many shielding older workers, for example, are likely to be feeling distinctly nervous if they are required by their employer to return to their workplace on Monday. A third person died of coronavirus complications in Vietnam, AP reports, a day after the country recorded its first death from the disease. AP reports: All three died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week, more than half of them patients. The Health Ministry said the latest fatalities included a 68-year old woman who was treated for blood cancer and a 61 year-old man who suffered septic shock and chronic kidney failure. The country’s first COVID-19 death was a 70-year-old who was admitted with a kidney illness. Da Nang is Vietnams most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city. Staff at a hospital in north-west England are to be rapidly tested for coronavirus to “control the spread of the infection”. Stockport NHS foundation trust said a “small number” of patients and staff had been identified as having the virus and that swift and widespread testing would take place over the next five days. A spokesperson said: We have begun a process of rapid staff testing for Covid-19 to strengthen our efforts to prevent and control the spread of the infection across Stepping Hill Hospital. Changes to lockdown arrangements across parts of the North of England reflect the prevalence of the infection in our local communities, and recently we have identified a small number of infections amongst staff and patients. We have taken rapid action to safeguard ourselves and the people who need our care. On Friday evening we began the rapid testing programme that over the next five days will see all our hospital staff tested. Staff found to have the infection will be required to self-isolate in line with national guidelines. Several small boats filled with more Tunisian migrants have reached a tiny Italian island that has run out of room to quarantine them as required by Italy’s anti-coronavirus measures, AP reports citing local officials. The Sicilian daily newspaper Giornale di Sicilia quoted the Lampedusa mayor, Totò Martello, as saying the island could not wait until the government sent a chartered ferry. The island’s migrant holding centre was built for a maximum capacity of 95 people and was already holding 950 when the latest passengers arrived, Martello said. The 250 who arrived between Friday night and Saturday must stay on the dock for now, until the promised ferry arrives or some other solution is found. The Vietnamese coastal city of Danang plans to test its entire population of 1.1 million people for coronavirus, the governing authorities said on Saturday, as 40 new cases linked to the tourist spot were reported across the country, taking total infections to 586, with three deaths. Reuters reports: Most of the new cases are linked to hospitals in Danang city, where the first locally transmitted infection in more than three months was detected last week. The Health Ministry said on Saturday that up to 800,000 visitors to Danang have left for other parts of the country since July 1, adding that more than 41,000 people have visited three hospitals in the city since. Local medical officials in Danang have conducted 8,247 coronavirus tests in the city since July 25, when the latest cluster was first detected. Testing capacity will be increased to 8,000-10,000 per day, the governing authorities said. Vietnam has detected new coronavirus cases in other cities, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with links to Danang. Meanwhile, authorities of the capital city, Hanoi said late on Saturday it had carried out around 49,000 tests since Thursday after the city ordered mass testing for all people who recently returned from the popular coastal city. There have been 18 new cases of coronavirus recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, the latest figures show. These cases represent 0.5% of newly tested individuals, the Scottish government said. PA reports there were 260 people in hospital with Covid-19 and three in intensive care. No new deaths have been recorded among people who tested positive for the virus, meaning the total under this measurement remains at 2,491. Public Health Wales said a further two people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in the country to 1,562. The number of cases in Wales increased by 21, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 17,279. Thousands of protesters against German coronavirus restrictions converged in Berlin on Saturday for a demonstration proclaiming the end of the pandemic – just as authorities voice increasing concern about an upturn in new infections, AP reports. A crowd of people whistling and cheering, and with few masks in sight, marched through central Berlin from the Brandenburg Gate before a rally on a wide boulevard that runs through the Tiergarten park. Protesters held up home-made placards featuring slogans that included “Corona, false alarm”, “We are being forced to wear a muzzle”, “Natural defence instead of vaccination” and “End the corona panic – bring fundamental rights back”. They chanted: “We’re here and we’re loud, because we are being robbed of our freedom.” Travellers entering France from 16 countries where coronavirus is circulating widely are having to undergo virus tests upon arrival at French airports and ports. AP reports: French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced last month that the tests would be required starting Aug. 1 for the arriving passengers France is allowing in from the listed countries unless they present proof of a negative test done within 72 hours of their departure. Those who test positive in France as of Saturday must quarantine for 14 days. France is not permitting general travel to and from the 16 countries, which include the United States and Brazil. The testing requirement therefore only applies to people entering under limited circumstances - French citizens who live in these countries or citizens of these countries with an established residence in France, Castex has said. Edinburgh Castle has reopened after the coronavirus lockdown, which caused the fortress to shut for its longest period since the second world war. PA reports: Historic Environment Scotland (HES) reopened the doors of the ancient stronghold on Saturday, along with other historic sites like Stirling Castle and Urquhart Castle. The castle in the centre of Edinburgh has long been one of Scotland’s most popular tourist destinations, but capacity will be reduced and some areas will be restricted in line with social distancing rules. Tickets must be booked in advance and face coverings will be required in the castle’s shops. In the past few weeks, Paul Feeley has been abused four times for not wearing a mask on public transport. “I have a disability lanyard, which signifies I have a hidden disability. I tried to show it … And all I got back was a complete torrent of abuse.” The most recent incident took place just after he first spoke to the Observer on Thursday. The abuse has made Feeley, who suffers from fibromyalgia, borderline personality disorder and panic attacks, feel “extraordinarily angry, anxious and upset”. He is unable to wear a face covering because of his medical conditions, and legally he is exempt – but he is now worried about travelling on buses and trams in his home town of Manchester. “One man said to me: ‘If you can’t wear a mask, you shouldn’t be allowed out.’” Incidents of “mask rage” are making disabled people who are unable to wear a covering fearful of going out in public, charities warn, as they call on the government to raise awareness about the legitimate reasons many people cannot wear them. The Guardian writer Jason Rodrigues is at the UK’s largest arts complex, the Southbank Centre, in London, where about 200 arts workers have gathered to protest against job cuts. Among the protesters was the actor Vanessa Redgrave, who called for “job cuts to end” across the arts. Last month, the Southbank Centre confirmed 400 jobs were at risk as it entered into talks with staff in an attempt to reduce losses caused by the Covid-19 crisis. The job losses are expected to affect all areas of the organisation, which comprises venues including the Hayward Gallery and Royal Festival Hall, as well as being home to eight orchestras, the National Poetry Library and the Arts Council Collection. Twenty-one new cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Malta, the health authorities said on Saturday, according to a report by Times of Malta. Most of the new patients are aged below 35, but one patient is 80 years old. It was just two weeks ago when Malta marked marked a week without new coronavirus cases, but cases have started to increase more recently. There were some concerns about the four music festivals that were planned over the next few months, but the large-scale music festivals were cancelled amid coronavirus fears. • This post was updated on 1 August 2020 because an earlier version referred to four planned music festivals, however those events have now been cancelled. Vietnam’s health ministry has said that up to 800,000 visitors to Danang city, the centre of coronavirus in the country, have left for other parts of the country since 1 July. Last week Vietnam detected its first locally transmitted Covid-19 cases in more than three months in Danang, a popular tourism spot. The total number of infections in the country has since risen to 558 from 413, with most of the new cases linked to three hospitals in Danang, after the country went 99 days without any new local cases. Twelve of the new cases were reported in Danang on Saturday, and there have been other confirmed cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. More than 41,000 people have visited the three hospitals since July 1, the ministry said in a statement. Vietnam reported its first two Covid-19 deaths on Friday (see 3.54am) – both in Danang, where there has been more than 100 cases in the past week – as the toll rose to three on Saturday, Reuters reported. Fifteen other patients with Covid-19 are in critical condition, officials said. All have other underlying illnesses. Dr Kidong Park, the World Health Organization representative in Vietnam, said that Vietnam had been preparing for the possibility of wider community transmission, after the country reported its first case in January. The government has always been determined to ensure that its people are protected from Covid-19 by keeping the country’s relatively low number of cases and controlling the transmission within the community. The Afghan doctor who identified the first coronavirus case in the country has lost his life to the disease, as a US watchdog warns that Afghanistan is “headed for a humanitarian disaster”. Dr Ibrahim Basim, 64, the head of the infectious diseases department of Herat regional hospital, has died from the virus. Basim identified and treated the first Covid-19 patient in Afghanistan and raised awareness in the country about the pandemic. Officials in Herat province have already warned of a second wave of the pandemic. They said the flow of Afghan refugees from Iran, and the failure of the people to follow health guidelines, have increased the possibility of a new wave of the virus. The health ministry reported the total death toll stands at 1,283. In its latest update, the health ministry said the number of people who had tested positive for the virus had reached 36,710, an increase of 35 on the day before. There have been 25,509 recoveries, including 189 over the past 24 hours. A report by a US watchdog released on Thursday said the coronavirus pandemic was pushing millions more Afghans into poverty, overwhelming the country’s basic healthcare system and causing food shortages. The report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) indicated that only 300 ventilators are currently available across the war-ravaged country. The watchdog said the country was “headed for a humanitarian disaster” as the virus continued to spread. “The economic shock of the pandemic, including increased unemployment, food-supply disruptions due to border closures, and rising food prices, has exacerbated Afghans’ food insecurity, already impacted by the ongoing conflict and high poverty levels,” said SIGAR. It added that about one-third of the country’s estimated 32.2 million people were either in a crisis or an emergency state of food insecurity. The report says that testing remains limited, but nearly 43% of samples test positive, one of the highest rates in the world. Thousands of children in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania will return to school on 3 August. This federal state is the first in Germany to officially open the new school year, complying with health protocols imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Children will have to wear masks in the common areas of school buildings. The Philippines on Saturday reported 4,963 additional coronavirus infections, the largest single-day jump on record, Reuters reports. In a bulletin, the health ministry said total infections have reached 98,232, while deaths increased by 17 to 2,039. In the region, the Philippines is second only to Indonesia in coronavirus deaths and cases. Poland reported its highest number of new daily coronavirus cases for the third day in a row on Saturday, with 658 new infections, the health ministry said. Reuters said more than 200 cases were reported in the Silesia mining region in southern Poland, which has been grappling with an outbreak among miners. The ministry also reported five new deaths. Poland has now reported a total of 46,346 coronavirus cases and 1,721 deaths. “One thing is clear, the government is very worried about a resurgence of coronavirus in the UK,” Denis Campbell and Kate Proctor write. Read their damning report on a painful and chaotic week for the prime minister, Boris Johnson. Indonesia reported 1,560 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, Reuters reports, bringing its total to 109,936, data from the country’s Covid-19 task force showed. It also reported 62 Covid-19 related deaths, taking the death toll to 5,193. Russia reported 95 new deaths from the novel coronavirus on Saturday, pushing its national tally to 14,058, Reuters reports. Officials also reported 5,462 new cases of the novel coronavirus over the past 24 hours, pushing the country’s tally to 845,443. Prof Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said England could have to consider closing pubs in order to reopen schools next month. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I think we’re in a situation whereby most people think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households. And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools. It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other and then that’s a matter of prioritising – do we think pubs are more important than schools? He added that the rise in coronavirus infections appeared to be among younger people but warned there was a danger it could “spill” over into other parts of the population. He said: The age distribution of infections has changed, it has moved down into younger age groups and so it is likely we won’t see that increase in hospital admissions related to infection in the same way we did in March. But the big fear is the virus just gets out of control and we end up in a situation where there is so much virus that it inevitably spills out into all sections of the population. He warned the increased lockdown measures in areas across the north-west of England were “highly unlikely” to be the “last intervention that has to be done regionally”. “I fully expect that there will have to be other interventions at other times but what the interventions are really depends on what happens,” he added. PA has a roundup of the mixed reaction in the papers to Boris Johnson’s decision to delay lockdown-easing measures. The Mirror slammed the move as a “Lockdown meltdown”, taking issue with the perceived inconsistency of the government’s messaging. An editorial in the paper says: “What everyone wants is clarity and competence. At the moment the Government is failing to deliver either.” Meanwhile, the Express says the delay is an example of “Boris’s tough love”. The paper’s senior political correspondent Martyn Brown says the PM was “right to apply the brakes” to the easing of restrictions. He added: It is not an abrupt screech to a halt that would dramatically affect people’s lives but it will serve as a wake-up call that the battle to defeat coronavirus is far from over. To take action so swiftly and decisively will provide the nation with confidence and some reassurance in what are extraordinary and unpredictable times. The Daily Mail issues a warning to Mr Johnson not to “let this corona cure kill the economy”, adding in an editorial: “The Prime Minister described it as ‘squeezing on the brakes’. “It felt more like slamming the car into reverse.” The paper points to an Office for Budget Responsibility prediction that the jobless rate will peak at 12% by the end of the year. The editorial continues: If this is allowed to happen, with all the misery and heartbreak it would entail, let’s hope people don’t conclude that Mr Johnson’s coronavirus cure was ultimately far worse than the disease itself. The Guardian emphasises warnings from a number of experts that the delay “may not be enough to stop a rise in infection”. The Times takes a similar path, with the political editor of the Spectator, James Forsyth, writing a commentary piece under the headline: “If you think this is bad, just wait for winter.” The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has paused new freedoms due this weekend, as people shielding against coronavirus can now leave their home and return to work. Johnson has warned the country could go into a new national lockdown amid fears any further reopening of the economy could trigger a full-blown resurgence of the coronavirus. The delay in the easing of lockdown raises fresh concerns for the up to 2 million extremely vulnerable people who had been shielding in England. Earlier this week, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said it would be “heartless and reckless” for bosses to demand the immediate return of shielding workers on 1 August. Many told the Guardian of their fear of returning to work in person next week, while leading scientists said shielding may be ending too soon and demanded to see the scientific evidence behind the rule change. The delay in the easing of lockdown restrictions came with a warning from Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, that the country now appears to be “at the outer edge” of how far society can safely reopen in the age of the pandemic. “If we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things,” he said. “The idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong.” Meanwhile, Labour and a leading welfare thinktank have called on the government to extend the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit industries as employers are forced to make financial contributions towards temporarily laid-off workers from this weekend. The Resolution Foundation said around half of the 9.2 million people placed on the government’s job retention scheme (JRS) since it launched in April have still not returned to work. It warned this group faced the prospect of widespread redundancies when the scheme, which covers 80% of workers’ wages, closes on 31 October, unless state subsidies are maintained beyond that date. That’s where I might leave you for now, but Aamna Mohdin is here to take you through the rest of the day’s news. Here is the latest opinion piece by Guardian columnist Andy Beckett: So much seems unusual about this Conservative government: its constant disruptiveness; its preference for rhetoric over functional policies; its mixture of brazen U-turns and cult-like discipline; its flirtations with the far right alongside leftwing-sounding plans to “level up”; its deadly reluctance to curtail small freedoms in a pandemic. It’s common to attribute some or all of these tendencies to the idiosyncrasies of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings, or the effects of Brexit, or the rise of rightwing populism. But there is a less noticed and more surprising factor at work, too. Today’s Tory government has adopted some of the style, rhetoric and preoccupations of a defunct radical sect, the Revolutionary Communist party (RCP). The RCP was a tiny British party, founded in the 70s, officially disbanded in the late 90s. Despite its name, most of its stances were not communist or revolutionary but contrarian: it supported free speech for racists, and nuclear power; it attacked environmentalism and the NHS. Its most consistent impulse was to invoke an idealised working class, and claim it was actually being harmed by the supposed elites of the liberal left... You can read the full article below: For the third consecutive day, new cases of Covid-19 cases topped 1,300 in France. Friday evening’s figures showed an increase of 1,346 confirmed new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours and 15 new clusters, taking the total number of clusters currently under investigation to 157. The number of new cases, which had dropped to several hundred every day at the beginning of July, rose suddenly to top 1,000 a day a week ago, prompting health officials to warn of a resurgence of the virus. Although new cases dropped to just over 500 at the beginning of last week, they subsequently shot up again. A spike in cases in areas popular with tourists, including coastal resorts, has been labelled the “holiday effect”, by the French press. Health experts say 21% of the identified clusters have been sparked by families getting together for the summer after the strict two-month confinement, which ended on 11 May, and “temporary public or private gatherings”, including marriages. This figure was 14.5% at the beginning of July. Officials blame the increase in cases on people becoming less vigilant and abandoning social distancing and protection measures and say too many of those showing known coronavirus symptoms are failing to get themselves tested. There will be no updated figures over the weekend. The number of new coronavirus cases confirmed in Tokyo, Japan was around 472 on Saturday, a new record, NHK public television quoted Tokyo officials as saying. It was the second day in a row that the number of cases in the capital rose by more than 400. Although the Tokyo governor, Yuriko Koike, has said the city could declare its own state of emergency, the central government says there is still no need to do so nationally despite a record spike in several cities around the nation. Japan’s Okinawa region declared a state of emergency earlier on Saturday with people asked to stay home for two weeks as the popular tourist destination sees an “explosive spread” of coronavirus cases. A week is a long time in a coronavirus pandemic – a fact the UK government has learned all too painfully. Avoiding a one-week delay to lockdown in March would potentially have halved the death toll, it has previously emerged. Which goes some way to explain why there have been not one but two screeching U-turns this week – on travel to Spain and lockdown measures for 4.6 million people in northern England – both announced late into the evening and imposed within hours. The ensuing chaos and anger have been palpable, and all point to one thing: that the government is very, very worried about a resurgence of the virus on UK soil. Denis Campbell and Kate Proctor have all the details on prime minister Boris Johnson’s trying week below: Health officials in the Australian state of Victoria say there are now 1,008 active cases within the aged care sector, which has emerged as a key area of concern for authorities. It represents an increase of 80 new cases within that sector over 24 hours. Overall, there are 5,919 active cases in Victoria, after 396 were added to the total on Saturday. Of those active cases, 637 are among health care workers, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Of the largest outbreaks, there were a 10 cases added to the stricken St Basil’s aged care home, which now has a total of 134 infections, while another facility, Epping Gardens, added three cases for a total of 118. There are 399 people in Australian hospitals, including 50 people in intensive care units and 28 on ventilators, authorities say. The overwhelming majority of those were in Victoria. Australia’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Michael Kidd, told a daily briefing on Saturday the country had surpassed 200 deaths after three people died in Victoria and a further death in New South Wales. Kidd also said Australia’s controversial Covidsafe app had allowed authorities to identify two new cases in Sydney. This is a timely reminder of the importance of the Covidsafe app. Kidd said the app had resulted in hundreds of additional people being tested and may have prevented a wider outbreak like those seen in Victoria. He added that authorities had received “disturbing reports” that people who had tested positive to Covid-19 were not at home when they had been doorknocked. He stressed that those who have tested positive must stay home. Workers at an abattoir in coronavirus-stricken Melbourne have been told to isolate until further notice after a staff member tested positive, fuelling fears of a possible second outbreak at the facility. In May, Cedar Meats abattoir was at the centre of the largest cluster in Victoria with 111 cases, but this record has since been overtaken by several second-wave outbreaks.A A Cedar meats spokeswoman said in a statement: We have followed DHHS’s advice and had all close contacts of that staff member tested onsite [on Friday] at our premises in Brooklyn. We have asked all of our staff to isolate until further notice, as per government guidelines. It is unclear if the worker was infectious during their last shift, but is understood they were originally absent due to non-flu-like illness and were tested for Covid-19 only in recent days. The results of the other staff tests will determine when the plant can reopen. Gambling revenue in Macau plunged 94.5% in July year-on-year, with casinos reeling from a lack of visitors in the world’s biggest casino hub despite a loosening of quarantine restrictions which have led to only a modest rise in gamblers. July’s figure of 1.3bn patacas ($US162.89m) was in line with analysts’ expectations of a drop of about 95%, reports Reuters. Casinos are staring at heavy losses for the second quarter, with not much hope for a near-term recovery as a resurgence in coronavirus cases muddies the outlook for when China will reinstate travel visas. Police in the state of South Australia have charged two people caught trying to cross the border from New South Wales. The 25-year-old man and 20-year-old woman tried to cross the border at Pinnaroo on Thursday, claiming they were headed interstate to sell a dog, reports AAP. They were refused entry and turned back to NSW, but police stopped their NSW-registered car in the Adelaide suburb of Kilburn on Saturday afternoon. The pair were charged with breaching Covid-19 directions and have been denied bail ahead of a court appearance on Monday. The arrests came as the state recorded one new case – a man aged in his 20s – of coronavirus. He had returned from interstate and has been in quarantine since his arrival. Authorities in the state of Western Australia say no new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. However, two historical cases based on serology were recorded overnight, the Department of Health said in a statement. These cases are fully recovered and present no risk to the community. This brings the total case count to 668, comprising 640 confirmed cases and 28 historical cases. China recorded 45 new cases on Friday, mostly from outbreaks in the provinces of Xinjiang and Liaoning, the National Health Commission has announced. It comes after 127 new cases were detected on Thursday. The post was updated The elderly leader of a secretive South Korean sect at the centre of the country’s early coronavirus outbreak was arrested on Saturday for allegedly hindering the government’s effort to contain the epidemic. Lee Man-hee, 88, is the head of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is often condemned as a cult. People linked to the church accounted for more than half of the South’s 4,000-plus coronavirus cases in February when the country was enduring one of the worst early outbreaks in the world. Lee is accused of giving inaccurate records of church gatherings and false lists of its members to health authorities. He was taken into custody early Saturday “after the Suwon district court granted an arrest warrant at 1.20am”, a court spokesperson told AFP. Egypt reported 321 new Covid-19 infections on Friday, the health ministry said, the lowest figure since 3 May, according to Reuters. In total, 94,078 cases have been reported in Egypt, of which 39,638 have recovered and 4,188 have died, including 31 on Friday, the ministry said in a statement late on Friday. Egypt reopened resorts to foreign tourists on 1 July after tourism came to a halt in March under measures to curb the coronavirus outbreak. But Egypt has not yet made it to a “safe list” of countries for resumption of non-essential travel to the European Union. Japan’s Okinawa region has declared a state of emergency and asked people to stay home for two weeks as the popular tourist destination sees an “explosive spread” of coronavirus cases. Agence France-Presse reports that the governor, Denny Tamaki, on Friday asked residents to avoid non-essential outings following a record new daily addition to the southern island’s total cases, the majority of which have been detected among US forces based there. “We’re seeing an explosive spread of infections. We declare a state of emergency” through 15 August, Tamaki told reporters, adding hospitals were being overwhelmed by the surge. The measures are non-compulsory and without the aggressive enforcement measures seen in Europe, but similar requests from authorities have been widely respected in Japan. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 955 to 209,653, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 7 to 9,148, Reuters reported the tally as showing. Chile’s president, Sebastián Piñera, announced $4.5bn in additional stimulus spending to help soften the blow of the pandemic and warned against a drift toward populism as people take advantage of a new rule allowing them to dip into their pension funds. In an address to lawmakers, Piñera said public investment in 2020-2022 will reach $34bn, of which $4.5bn had not previously been announced. The centre-right leader warned against populist solutions to Chile’s economic woes, which include huge inequalities and a recession worsened by the impact of Covid-19. “The entire world is being threatened by populism, which always offers the easy path of rights without duties, of achievements without effort,” he said, according to Reuters, warning against “promises of easy solutions to difficult problems”. This is Luke Henriques-Gomes returning to the blog. Thanks to Matilda Boseley for stepping in just now. This news is in from AAP: A man has been arrested at a NSW-Victoria border checkpoint after allegedly providing false information to police and then punching an officer in the face. The man and two women in their 20s were on Saturday morning in a car seeking to cross into NSW at Corowa when they were pulled over by police and defence personnel. Police say the two women presented valid permits and identification but the man, sitting in the back seat, did not follow suit. Subsequent checks found the man was wanted on seven outstanding warrants including one revoking his parole. The 21-year-old man then allegedly attempted to flee the vehicle and punched a senior constable in the face, causing bruises. He was arrested by other officers and defence personnel and taken to Corowa hospital due to suspected drug ingestion, with authorities seizing drug paraphernalia from the car. The man remains in hospital and is yet to be charged. My colleague Matilda Boseley will be taking over the blog for a short while. The latest case of Covid-19 in the Australian state of Queensland is a woman who may have been infectious while working at a Brisbane nursing home. The facility at Pinjarra Hills in Brisbane’s west had already been locked down after the woman’s husband tested positive on Friday, reports AAP. The health minister, Steven Miles, said extra nurses had been provided to the facility. All 150 staff and the residents at the home are being tested. “We are working with them to keep all residents safe,” Miles said. The woman is the wife of a 27-year-old Bellbird Park man who was confirmed to have the virus on Friday. We will have more on the situation in the Philippines later today. Doctors’ groups held a press conference just now begging the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, for stricter lockdown for two weeks as they warned of the risk of health system collapse. “We are losing the battle,” one doctor said. Forty organisations nationwide signed on, including the Philippine Medical Association, and are calling for a “timeout” to fix systems. A second person died of coronavirus complications in Vietnam, officials said on Saturday, a day after it recorded its first-ever death as it struggles with a renewed outbreak after 99 days with no local cases. Both men died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week, more than half of them patients, Associated Press reports. The Health ministry said a 61-year-old man died on Friday evening of septic shock and chronic kidney failure. The country’s first fatality was a 70-year-old who was being treated for a kidney illness. Da Nang is Vietnam’s most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city. Fifteen other patients with Covid-19 are in critical condition, officials said. All have other underlying illnesses. On Saturday morning, the health ministry confirmed 12 more cases, all linked to the hospital. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro told a crowd in the state of Rio Grande do Sul on Friday to accept they would probably all catch the coronavirus one day. Bolsonaro, who has previously tested positive for Covid-19, said in an online video on Thursday he was being treated with antibiotics for a lung infection. According to the Brazilian newspaper Folha, the president told the crowd on Friday: Sadly, I think you almost all of you will catch it one day. What are you afraid of? Face it. Brazil has recorded 92,475 deaths from the virus, according to the latest statistics. US deaths from the novel coronavirus rose by at least 1,453 on Friday, the biggest one-day increase since 27 May, to reach a total of 153,882, Reuters reports. Cases rose by at least 66,986 to a total of 4.58 million, with some local governments yet to report. The rise in deaths was the biggest one-day increase since fatalities rose by 1,484 on 27 May. The death toll in Australia has exceeded 200 after three further deaths were recorded in Victoria and one person died in New South Wales. There have been 201 deaths in the country since the pandemic began. Those who died in Victoria were: a man in his 80s, a woman in her 80s and a woman in her 90s. The state’s death toll is now 116. In NSW, an 83-year-old man connected to an outbreak at a popular pub, the Crossroads Hotel in south-west Sydney, died on Saturday, taking the state’s death toll to 52. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has faced a grilling over reports that the families of people in aged care homes stricken by the coronavirus are unable to find out which hospitals their loves ones have been moved to. Andrews said the federal government was working hard to resolve the issue. I raised this matter with the PM, he is actioning this. I have not got an update today, this was yesterday or maybe the night before. I know they are working hard to try to have better call centre arrangements. We know there are cultural and language issues at play. That is not all of it, but that is a lot of the challenge. In the Australian Capital Territory, there have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the past 24 hours, authorities have announced. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said authorities are a “united team” after he was quizzed about a shake-up of the state’s public health team. The restructure includes Annaliese Van Diemen, the deputy chief health officer, returning to “her former duties”, while three new officials have joined as deputy chief officers. The Northern Territory in Australia has recorded one new coronavirus case, the health department has said. The woman is the partner of the man who tested positive to coronavirus Covid-19 yesterday. She is in isolation at the Royal Darwin hospital. In response to a call from the Australian Medical Association from all businesses except essential services to close, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says only that various options are being considered. What we have at the moment are numbers that are too high of community transmission and that is a concern to us. Andrews says authorities are working through what steps, if any, to take next. Victorian authorities are putting the focus on what the police minister, Lisa Neville, calls “appalling behaviour” from residents who have been found breaching the rules. Neville cites three cases: a person who drove from Melbourne to Wodonga on the NSW border “to buy a Big Mac”; a person who travelled from Melbourne to Ballarat for “fresh air”; and a person who drove across Melbourne, from Werribee to Springvale, to “buy groceries”. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he will not be announcing “further steps” today to curb the pandemic, but “we are giving due consideration to a whole range of different options”. When I am in a position to announce decisions, I will do that and I will take questions at that time. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has also confirmed there are now 5,919 active cases in the state, with 379 patients in hospital. There are 41 people in intensive care units, including 24 who are on ventilators. Andrews says the situation in the state’s aged care system is “very serious”. The biggest challenge is the growing number of “mystery cases”. There are 49 of those, he says. You cannot be certain if there is even more further community transmission, more mystery cases out there. That is in some respects our biggest challenge. Of the 397 new cases in Victoria, premier Daniel Andrews says are 37 links to outbreaks and other complex cases, and 360 are under investigation. The 397 new infections are a marked drop from the more than 600 reported on Friday, but Andrews warns it is still a significant number. While there is always a temptation to try and read trends into these numbers, there is a growing concern in relation to the number of community transmission cases within that data. Victoria has recorded 397 new cases of coronavirus over the past 24 hours, premier Daniel Andrews has announced. He says three further people have died: a man in his 80s, a woman in her 80s and a woman in her 90s. There are two new cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, the health ministry announced on Saturday. Both cases are in managed isolation. The country has a total of 22 active cases, while there have been 1,212 infections since the start of the pandemic. California and Florida, two of the most populous US states, reported record increases in Covid-19 deaths on Friday, Reuters reports. Florida reported 257 deaths and California 208. In numerical terms, the loss of life in each state is roughly equivalent to the number of passengers on a single-aisle airplane. For Florida this is the fourth day in a row with a record rise in deaths and for California the second this week. Mississippi, Montana and Nevada also had a one-day record increase in deaths on Friday. Overall US deaths have increased by more than 25,000 in July to 153,000 since the pandemic started. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to give an update at 11.30am, so in less than 10 minutes’ time. The government is considering imposing tougher restrictions after a horror week, including a record 732 new cases on Thursday. In New South Wales, the 17 new cases included three cases in return travellers in hotel quarantine and one NSW resident returning from Victoria. There were also two cases among people who attended at the Apollo restaurant in the Sydney suburb of Potts Point and two cases from the Mounties Club in Mount Pritchard. Officials said they had used the Australian government’s Covidsafe app to link one of the cases to the Mounties Club. Seven cases were close contacts of known cases, one case was locally acquired with its source unknown, and two cases were under investigation. The Australian state of NSW recorded 17 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, NSW Health said on Saturday. An 83-year-old man has also died, authorities confirmed. The man contracted the virus from an outbreak at the Crossroads Hotel, a popular pub in south-western Sydney. Devastating economic data poured in on Friday as nations counted the cost of efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic, even as fresh spikes forced countries including Britain to put the brakes on a return to normality. Six months after the World Health Organization declared a global emergency, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 17 million people and killed nearly 674,000, reports Agence France-Presse. As global daily cases approach 300,000, the impact is being felt in every sphere of life, with elections postponed in Hong Kong – the latest blow to its democracy activists – and the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia performed with radically reduced numbers. In a sign of the trade-offs being forced on governments, Britain imposed new lockdowns in several northern counties Friday, just as Western Europe announced historic economic slumps that would have been nightmare scenarios at the start of the year. France’s economy contracted by 13.8% in the April-June quarter, mirroring similar devastation in Spain (18.5 %), Portugal (14.1%) and Italy (12.4%). Europe as a whole saw gross domestic product fall by 12.1% in the eurozone and by 11.9% across the EU bloc. Mexico’s confirmed coronavirus deaths rose to 46,688 on Friday, health ministry data showed, placing the country’s death toll from the pandemic at third-highest in the world, overtaking Britain, Reuters reports. The health ministry registered 8,458 new cases, a record for a single day, as well as 688 additional deaths, bringing the total to 424,637 cases and 46,688 fatalities. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. Residents of the Australian state of Queensland have been put on alert about a string of locations around greater Brisbane that a man visited before testing positive to Covid-19. The 27-year-old Bellbird Park man is believed to have caught the virus when he ate at the same restaurant as an infected woman charged with illegally entering the state, reports AAP. The man is a direct contact of one of three women returning from Melbourne who allegedly lied on their border passes. He is believed to have caught the virus when dining with his family at the Madtongsan IV Korean restaurant at Sunnybank on 23 July. A Queensland Health spokesperson said in a statement: Along with five others who are being Covid-19 tested, they dined on a table adjacent to one of the recently identified cases who returned from Victoria. The premier of the Australian state of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, will hold a press conference at 11.30am local time. Andrews will report the number of new infections and any deaths over the past 24 hours and he is also likely to be asked about plans for further restrictions in Melbourne. Anaesthetists in the Australian state of Victoria are calling on the government to enforce “fit testing” for personal protective equipment, citing concerns that not enough is being done to protect health workers from coronavirus. Victoria reached 5743 active cases on Friday and deaths rose to 113, with three doctors among those reportedly in intensive care. Anaesthetists are commonly called on to intubate patients needing help to breathe, and so they are among those face-to-face with the most severe Covid-19 cases, reports AAP. The Australian Society of Anaesthetists says it has made “numerous approaches” to federal and state health departments asking that fit testing of PPE become mandatory in all hospitals. ASA president Dr Suzi Nou said federal and state health authorities had not been receptive to her recommendations for mandatory fit testing, despite the practice being widespread in other states. They’d say we don’t have the resources. Nou likened the lack of fit testing to former attitudes to seatbelts, which are now universal. Guatemala’s congress has extended a state of calamity for 30 days. The measures have been in place since March. The Latin American country has recorded 49,789 infections and 1,924 deaths since the start of the pandemic. In Australia, the state of Victoria is mulling further restrictions to curb the rise in case numbers. The state has recorded more than 1,300 new infections over the past two days, including a record 732 cases from Thursday. The state government is yet to announce new measures, but options could include the lockdown of certain industries where outbreaks among workers have been common, such as abattoirs, or a wider shutdown of all but essential industries, modelled on steps taken in New Zealand. Cedar Meats, an abattoir in Melbourne linked to a major outbreak earlier in the pandemic, has placed all staff in isolation after an employee tested positive. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is scheduled to hold a press conference in the next few hours, though any new measures may not be announced for a few days. In NSW, an exclusive members only venue, the Australian Club, was among the locations forced to close due to a positive case. The Bavarian, a popular pub on Sydney’s northern beaches, also shut following a hosting a Covid-infected patron. From 1am on Saturday, the Queensland border was shut to Greater Sydney. Two major drug companies will supply the US government with 100m doses of an experimental coronavirus vaccine, the Trump administration said on Friday, as the nation’s top health agency predicted that fatalities would rise in the coming weeks. The agreement calls for the US government to pay French drug maker Sanofi and British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline up to $2.1bn to supply it with enough vaccines for 50 million people, with the option to buy another 500m doses. The purchase falls under the Trump administration’s so-called Operation Warp Speed, intended to rush a Covid-19 vaccine to the market by the end of 2020, Reuters reports. Researchers have raised fears that “systematic racism” in the provision of protective equipment is putting minority health workers at greater risk, as a study showed higher coronavirus infection rates among British and American medical staff. The report, published in the Lancet Public Health journal, found that frontline healthcare workers were over three times more likely to test positive than the general population early in the pandemic, with the rate rising to five times for ethnic minority medical staff. Researchers from the US looked at data from almost 100,000 healthcare workers in Britain and the United States taken from self-reported information on the Covid Symptoms Study smartphone app between 24 March and 23 April, Reuters reports. They found that the prevalence of infection among frontline care workers was 2,747 per 100,000 app users, compared with 242 per 100,000 in the general community, Agence France-Presse reports. When they took into account the health workers’ greater access to testing, the researchers estimated that frontline medical workers were around 3.4 times more likely to test positive for Covid-19 than app users in the wider population. After accounting for pre-existing medical conditions, researchers estimated that healthcare workers from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were almost five times more likely to report a positive Covid-19 result than somebody from the general community. The study also found that frontline healthcare workers who said they did not have sufficient protective equipment – such as masks, gloves and gowns – were 1.3 times more likely to test positive than those who said they had the proper equipment. US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said talks with the White House on a coronavirus aid bill were far from a deal on Friday, as federal unemployment benefits that have been an essential lifeline for millions of Americans expired. Asked why she rejected a proposal from president Donald Trump’s administration for a one-week extension of the $600 weekly jobless payment, Pelosi said a short-term fix would be appropriate “if you are on a path” towards a deal. “We’re not,” Pelosi told a news conference. Negotiations were to continue on Saturday between White House officials and congressional Democrats, reports Reuters. Pelosi will host a meeting with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, an aide familiar with the planning said. Pelosi, the nation’s top elected Democrat, said she thought Congress and the White House would eventually come together on legislation,but gave no timetable. Referring to the mounting cases and deaths from Covid-19, Pelosi said: This is a freight train that is picking up steam. ... It must be stopped. In some of her toughest criticisms so far, she said Republican delays on legislation and “distortions” about the pandemic “has caused death unnecessarily”. White House officials took their own hard partisan line, accusing Democrats of refusing Trump’s proposals to extend the jobless benefit that expired on Friday and a moratorium on evictions that ended last week. Vietnam’s health ministry has reported 12 new local coronavirus cases linked to the recent outbreak in the central city of Danang, taking total infections to 116 since the virus resurfaced last week. The new patients, with ages from two to 78, are linked to Danang hospital, the ministry said on Saturday in a statement reported by Reuters. Vietnam has registered a total of 558 coronavirus cases and recorded its first two deaths on Friday after months of successful curbs. Peru’s housing minister, Carlos Lozada, said on Friday the government will extend the country’s state of emergency and quarantine measures until 31 August after infections rose, according to Europa Press. The ministry of health said on Thursday there were 6,809 new cases in the past 24 hours. Peru has so far seen 407,492 people test positive to Covid-19, including 19,021 deaths. The country has been in lockdown since March. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has put a scheduled easing of coronavirus restrictions on hold in England, as he also raised the prospect of a second lockdown. At a hastily arranged press conference at Downing Street on Friday, Johnson said he was pausing the reopening of leisure businesses, such as casinos and bowling alleys, and preventing beauty salons resuming close-up treatments, for at least two weeks. Rules on face coverings would also be extended for indoor venues such as museums, galleries and cinemas from 8 August. You can read a full report on the surprise announcement at the link below. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the continuing coronavirus pandemic, with me, Luke Henriques-Gomes. If you’d like to get in touch, you can do so by email via luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter @lukehgomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Friday, with the total rising by 292,527. WHO warned the pandemic’s effects would be felt for decades as its emergency committee assessed the situation six months after sounding its top alarm over the outbreak. The death toll globally from coronavirus has surpassed 675,000, according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker. The figure is now at 675,167, with the US having the most deaths at 152,074, followed by Brazil with 91,263. Dr Anthony Fauci, America’s top infectious disease expert, has told Congress he is “cautiously optimistic” that a “safe and effective” coronavirus vaccine will be available to the public by the end of 2020 during a hearing in Washington marked by testy exchanges between Fauci and senior Republicans loyal to Donald Trump. Brazil’s death toll has reached a total of 92,475, compared with 91,263 yesterday, according to the country’s health ministry. The country has registered 2,662,485 confirmed cases of the virus, up from 2,610,102 yesterday. Jair Bolsanaro, who has previously tested positive to Covid019, said he was taking antibiotics for a lung infection. Health authorities in France reported 1,346 new confirmed coronavirus infections on Friday, which took the total to 187,919. New cases are above 1,300 per day for the third day in a row, the highest since late April. In Australia, authorities are mulling further restrictions in the state of Victoria, which has recorded more than 1,300 new infections over the past two days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2016/oct/24/hinkley-c-shows-the-value-of-social-science-in-the-most-toxic-public-debates","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-24T06:30:07Z","webTitle":"Hinkley C shows the value of social science in the most toxic public debates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/oct/24/hinkley-c-shows-the-value-of-social-science-in-the-most-toxic-public-debates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2016/oct/24/hinkley-c-shows-the-value-of-social-science-in-the-most-toxic-public-debates","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley C shows the value of social science in the most toxic public debates","bodyText":"It’s been another turbulent month in the long-running saga over the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Having looked as if she might be contemplating a rethink, Theresa May unveiled an apparently decisive approval just before the Conservative Party conference. But with longstanding issues still unaddressed – and new problems emerging even since the PM’s announcement – the debate over Hinkley is far from over. Now might be a good moment, then, to reflect on the contribution that social science can make to these kinds of controversies over science and technology. Of course, what counts as useful in any given controversy will depend on your perspective. It is inherent to democracy that different values and interests yield contrasting conclusions. This is especially so over deeply-fractured faultlines like those which run through the UK’s commitments to nuclear power. Social science can provide a better understanding of why different perspectives disagree – and help (when possible) to identify common ground. Hard-pressed policymakers often find it useful to understand how to foster trust, confidence and “acceptance” of their institutions and procedures. For powerful interests in any setting, social research can also play a useful role in helping to justify, present or implement favoured policies. Here, social science can be part of the closing down of debate – helpfully enabling political attention to move on. But what if, on deeper reflection, powerfully-backed policies are a bad idea (perhaps as with the Hinkley decision? History is replete with examples – like asbestos, heavy metals, carcinogenic pesticides, chlorine bleaches, toxic solvents and ozone depleting chemicals – where it only emerged in retrospect that the pictures being given of “sound science” or the “evidence base” at the time were unduly shaped by vested interests or constrained imaginations. It is here that social science can play a further crucial role: helping to open up policy debates where they are being prematurely “locked-in”. This focuses less on society as a target for policymaking, and more on the processes of policymaking themselves. The production and interpretation of evidence is, after all, as much a social phenomenon as public attitudes or political mobilisation. It is a striking feature of the Hinkley example that even the government’s own evidence base is strikingly damning. The assessment of value for money itself acknowledges Hinkley C to be more expensive than other low carbon energy strategies. And the picture in other official sources is even more negative. With nuclear costs rising and renewable costs falling – and a worldwide turn towards wind and solar power – global trends compound the picture. With the UK enjoying the best renewable energy resource in Europe and holding a competitive advantage in offshore industries, industrial policy arguments are also manifestly stronger for renewables. The same applies to prospective jobs. Compared to nuclear safety and security challenges, renewables are less vulnerable. And simplistic “baseload” arguments are shown by numerous official reports to be superseded by technology – and repudiated even by the National Grid. So the officially-stated reasons for nuclear enthusiasm simply don’t stack up. The contrast with Germany is especially strong. Here, arguably the world’s most successful industrial power had a nuclear sector far larger and more successful than that of the UK, and a much less attractive renewable resource. Yet it is Germany – with a record of far-sighted industrial policy decisions in the past – that has made the opposite move to the UK: an “Energiewende” towards renewable energy, in contrast to the British “nuclear renaissance”. So, here emerges another role for social science: critical interrogation of what lies behind the official picture. Our own recent research on the Hinkley question suggests the best way to understand this continuing commitment – and the contrast with Germany – lies in the relative qualities of the two democracies. The post-war German constitution, and a more critical political culture, makes it easier for Germany to resist incumbent industrial interests and ease itself out of lock-in. And our research suggests there is a further – seriously neglected – factor that may underlie the intense attachment of successive UK governments to civil nuclear power. This involves parallel UK commitments to maintain nuclear submarine capabilities. Without the cover provided by lower-tier contracts in civil nuclear construction, the diminished UK nuclear manufacturing sector would simply not be able to build these formidable technological artefacts. Nor could they easily be operated without civil infrastructures for nuclear research, design, training, maintenance and regulation. So a consequence of withdrawing from nuclear power might also be very serious for a particular version of British identity – especially in the coming post-Brexit era. It is nuclear military prowess that supposedly allows the UK to “punch above its weight” on the world stage. Yet, although this rationale for continued UK nuclear commitments is clearly documented on the military side, it is unmentioned anywhere in official civil nuclear policy statements – and in energy debates more widely. What this might mean for policy is a moot point. But by opening up this kind of wider discussion, social science can undertake its trickiest – but arguably most useful – task in any controversy. The stakes in this particular case transcend nuclear debates alone – and raise questions about the overall health of British democracy.

The consequence will be hardship, eviction and, for many, homelessness. They will be victims both of high private rents and of government restrictions on benefit, both of which stem from the failures of housing policies for more than 30 years. Rents are high because housing is scarce and property values high, and because millions excluded from both owning homes and living in social housing have nowhere to go but the private rental sector. Benefit is being restricted not only because of generalised austerity but also because the total housing benefit bill has been pushed up by the reduction of publicly-owned housing, thanks to the right-to-buy policy introduced under Margaret Thatcher and by restrictions on local authorities’ ability to replenish their stock. The result is that they have to pay market rates to private landlords, when they might have housed them in their own properties. The victims of this failure of policy are those least able to afford it. This is one manifestation of a housing market which, as a government white paper said earlier this year, is “broken”. In last week’s Queen’s speech, Theresa May announced that the government would “promote fairness and transparency in the housing market”and “help ensure that more homes are built”, which meant that the white paper will be made into policy and law. But, even as it announces the “dysfunctional” nature of housing and calls it “a problem that won’t solve itself”, the document does offensively little truly to address it. While it offers some practical suggestions for improving the supply of housing and a sop to renters with the banning of letting fees, it does little more than twiddle the knobs on a vast, floundering machine. It labours under the delusion that the private sector can address housing need largely alone and that, therefore, the problem is only one of supply. Ease planning restrictions and other regulations is the reasoning, and the market will be un-broken. Even though it says that supply is the only problem, this future act of parliament does nothing to address one of the biggest issues of contemporary planning, which is the sacred status of the green belt at the expense of both other forms of green land and cities. More importantly, it ignores decades of evidence that significant public intervention is an essential part of meeting housing need. In 2015/16, a good year, 189,650 net additional homes were provided, against an estimated need of 225,000 to 275,000. Post-Brexit restrictions on labour and a cooling housing market are likely to reduce output without greatly improving affordability. The role of government in housing is partly planning, to encourage new homes to be built in the places where they are needed, to use land well and create neighbourhoods rather than assemblages of units, to make garden cities rather than sprawl, and tall buildings that are landmarks rather than eyesores. It is also to build when private companies won’t. This is not a radical socialist agenda but established policy of different administrations, both in Britain and elsewhere, for more than a century. The most effective way to address housing need would be to allow local authorities to borrow to build, which is constricted here but is common in many European countries. This is not throwing money away, as it goes into a long-term asset that delivers returns into an indefinite future. It should also be noted that austerity is relaxed when it comes to building an £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point or the £56bn HS2 railway, even though the latter is as damaging to the green belt as any housing proposal. Housing is at least as vital as these other forms of infrastructure. If something good is to come of the Grenfell Tower disaster, it will be the attention it brings to the current state of housing in Britain, in particular for people on low incomes. Politicians should also be motivated by the role housing played in mobilising young voters in the general election. But it seems that the current government still hasn’t got the memo."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/04/after-north-koreas-denuclearisation-has-failed-who-can-bring-it-back-to-the-negotiation-table","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-04T05:34:25Z","webTitle":"After North Korea's denuclearisation has failed, who can bring it back to the negotiation table? | Jiyoung Song","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/04/after-north-koreas-denuclearisation-has-failed-who-can-bring-it-back-to-the-negotiation-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/04/after-north-koreas-denuclearisation-has-failed-who-can-bring-it-back-to-the-negotiation-table","fields":{"headline":"After North Korea's denuclearisation has failed, who can bring it back to the negotiation table?","bodyText":"Pyongyang claims that it’s had a “complete success” for its testing of hydrogen bombs, the sixth nuclear test. Seismologists detected 5.7-6.3 magnitude of a man-made earthquake on Sunday. Both South Korean and US government sources confirmed that there was an underground test near Kilju, Punggye-ri in North Hamgyong where the last five nuclear tests were conducted. This is less than a week after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan and three weeks after it threatened to attack the US territory Guam. Pyongyang’s aim is to complete its nuclear status by the end of the year. The regime says its nuclear power would protect the country from the US aggression. The North’s nuclear program, according to them, is for their self-defence and deterrence from US invasion. North Korea is not a democratic country and its human rights situation is not up to any post-war international standards. There are historical reasons for it. The country has never experienced a peaceful transition to modern democracy. It was a feudal dynasty until 1910 when Korea was forcibly annexed by Japan. The 1919 Korean Independence Movements were severely crushed by the Japanese. There were systematic discrimination against ethnic Koreans during the colonial period. At the end of the second world war in 1945, it was not Japan but Korea that the USSR and the US decided to divide. After the Korean war ended with the 1953 armistice, signed by North Korea, China and the UN led by the US, North Korea has been under the Kim family dynasty. Since the end of the cold war, North Korea lost all its socialist allies whose systems then all collapsed. Moscow and Beijing shifted its policy more towards being part of the international market economy. North Korea has never had that chance because of the very fundamental regime survival and national security issues they have. Isolating itself from the rest of the world and creating external threats and inter-Korean conflicts have been the regime’s means to survive. The denuclearisation of North Korea has failed. The 1994 Geneva framework between the US and North Korea didn’t deliver its promises. The six-party talks initiated by Beijing ended with Pyongyang’s second nuclear test in 2009. The North did demolish its Yongbyon nuclear reactor and allowing IAEA inspectors to pursue “complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation” (CVID). But the light water reactor, a peaceful use of nuclear energy, and lifted sanctions Pyongyang wanted never arrived. In the meantime, North Korea had leadership change from Kim Jong-il to his third son, Kim Jong-un. For the first five years, he purged all his political opponents including his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, and the half-brother, Kim Jong-nam. He is relatively young and loves emulating his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, who invaded South Korea at the age of 38 in 1950. Kim Jong-un has been developing nuclear weapons programs as he thinks it’s the only way to deter the US invasion and regime change he’s seen in Iraq and Libya. US president Trump’s blasting rhetoric like “fire and fury” or “locked and loaded military solution” only justified Kim’s narrative about the US aggression. Kim unites his generals, nuclear scientists and millions of foot soldiers who are ready to go to war with the US. There is no appetite for peaceful dialogues with North Korea internationally. South Korea’s new president Moon Jae-in was the only party that proposed talks with Pyongyang which then ignored this good gesture and bypassed its fellow Koreans in the South over to the US. China and Russia joined the latest UN security council sanctions against North Korea. For them, Pyongyang is doing all the verbal fighting and military provocation against Washington that they want but choose not to. The current debates on the North Korean nuclear program are limited to security: North Korea should stop developing its nuclear program and in return, the US must stop or downgrade joint military exercises, reduce the US troops in South Korea and establish a peace agreement with North Korea. Here is one big elephant in the room. To borrow Clinton’s campaign strategist’s term, it’s “the economy, stupid!”. Any state that doesn’t want North Korea to be a nuclear state must pay. Victor Cha, the potential appointee for the next US ambassador to Seoul, argues that China should pay. Otherwise, we might have to live with nuclear North Korea. None offered carrots yet to North Korea for giving up their weapon-grade nuclear program. Who is willing to pay? It’s definitely not the US under Trump, who is likely to buck-pass to China, which then would blame and threaten South Korea to pay. What’s likely to happen after the recent series of heightened military provocation is a relatively quiet period. During this time, Pyongyang will wait and see any offers from its neighbours. At the moment, everyone has different interests in mind. Seoul is willing to accept the US-North Korea bilateral talks, in close coordination with South Korea. Beijing is busy with its own party congress, not keen to talk to Pyongyang and certainly not happy with Seoul’s sovereign decision to deploy the US missile defense system, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). Tokyo wants to make sure Pyongyang’s missiles won’t fly over its head again. Moscow wants to exert its influence in its far east. It’s an opportunity for any aspiring great power to make Pyongyang give up its nuclear program and bring it to peace negotiation. Unfortunately, currently there is a significant vacuum.

It’s that the Tories aren’t much cop at it","bodyText":"Damn the British people, for they have let down Theresa May again. The prime minister could once count on voters to back free markets. But, she sniffs to supporters in Manchester, “Jeremy Corbyn has changed that.” So goes the refrain of this Tory conference. “A new generation is being tempted down a dangerous path,” warns Philip Hammond: the feckless youth are seduced by visions of North Korea, Zimbabwe and Cuba. Nor is the chancellor alone. The bloviators in our thinktanks and media agree that British politics is suffering what Nick Robinson yesterday on BBC Radio 4 termed “a crisis of belief in capitalism”. Add it all up, and the Conservative frontbench and their interlocutors now have three propositions. First, the government of which they are either members or supporters is widely unpopular because the public have fallen out of love with capitalism. Second, this discontent can be localised to the young. And, finally, the alternative they prefer is the Venezuela-lite offered by Corbynism. This is the biggest load of tripe since … well, the last time the Westminster establishment agreed on all the same talking points. Each and every one of the above arguments – which will be spewed out of Manchester all week and dutifully repeated across the comment pages and studio sofas – is wrong. Let’s work backwards through those charges. A spectre is indeed haunting the Tory party, but it is the spectre of moderate social democracy. Labour went into the last election on a manifesto of a bigger public sector, higher taxes and a promise to borrow more to invest. That is capitalism, of a kind that Angela Merkel would know. If the Tories believe their problem lies with the young, they must have missed the YouGov finding that they are losing voters under 47 years old. Or the one about how they lag behind Labour among every segment of the workforce – unemployed, part-time, full-time. In the election in June, the Tories only came out ahead among retirees. The most important point, though, is this. It suits May to make out that a vote cast against her is a vote against capitalism, but the truth is modern-day Conservative leaders aren’t much cop at capitalism. Whether David Cameron or May, George Osborne or Hammond, they pursue policies almost guaranteed to make Britain’s market economy perform less well. The result is that we have suffered the most miserable recovery in well over a century, that the average British worker is still earning less than he or she was before the banking crash of 2008, and that the deficit reduction strategy that voters were assured would end in 2015 is now set to drag on until around 2025. The Britain that voted for Brexit last year, or which is signing petitions in defence of Uber this autumn, has not lurched towards socialism. Rather, voters have been failed by the form of capitalism offered to them – one that cannot provide them with wage rises, secure homes or decent care for their loved ones. If they are now rejecting that malfunctioning economic system and the party that is its chief vehicle, their response is not ideological but entirely pragmatic. You can pin a large part of the blame on the complete fiasco of austerity. That’s one reason why I’m confident Osborne will go down as the worst chancellor in postwar Britain, whatever fees he currently commands on the after-dinner circuit. But austerity grew out of the belief system that the Tories inherited from Margaret Thatcher. She championed the notion that assets should be handed to individuals rather than entrusted to society, and that the only tolerable benefit was a means-tested benefit. What we are witnessing now is the slow collapse of that system. For most of the 20th century, the Conservative party knew the best way to keep voters true to capitalism was to allow them some share in its dividends. It was in the name of a “property-owning democracy” that Thatcher privatised the utilities and encouraged council tenants to buy their own homes. The effect of her regime, as largely accepted by her successors Tony Blair and Cameron, was to concentrate wealth and assets in fewer hands. Look at the results. Thatcher’s capitalism has ended up breaking every one of its big promises. Home ownership in England has slumped to its lowest point since the mid-1980s. Share ownership among individuals is below where it was when Thatcher entered No 10. Thatcherism was meant to help those who wanted to get on in life; the Resolution Foundation now forecasts that those aged between 15 and 35 could earn less over their entire lifetimes than their parents. Yet even four decades on, the Conservatives remain entirely in Thatcher’s shadow. She could have written Cameron’s austerity programme, with its belief that the public sector crowds out the private sector. The same goes for Osborne’s plans to privatise whatever assets he possibly could – even down to old student loans. And she would certainly have recognised May’s stupid gambit this week that the best way to deal with a housing bubble is to underwrite it with more public money. All of this is Thatcherism redux, only this time the Treasury cupboard is bare, the ideas are old and the fireworks have gone damp. The big problem with Thatcherite economics is that it’s a trick you can only pull off once. To keep doing it 40 years on is to face an audience that has seen too many failures. Too many regions left for dead, even while the City of London booms. Too many promises of creating national champions, when now Beijing funds France to build Britons a nuclear power station. Too many failures of the private sector, from the operators of our trains to the boardrooms of our banks. All those 1980s jibes against supposedly incompetent public servants ring hollow in an era when Britons know the 11 most terrifying words in the English language are: “I’m from a Virgin call centre and I’m here to help.” The result, as the political economist Will Davies observes, is that the Conservatives have ended up defending capital rather than capitalism. They have championed finance and pretended it stands for all business. They have preached book-keeping when they needed to wield economics. The Tories can obviously reverse out of their current ideological dead end. But that would require them first to recognise Thatcherism as being a dead end, which they show little sign of doing. Yet it most certainly is. What Thatcher once said of socialism goes for her own brand of economics: you eventually run out of taxpayer money to give to the rich and public assets to privatise. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-timeline-all-the-key-moments","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T17:23:25Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C timeline: all the key moments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-timeline-all-the-key-moments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-timeline-all-the-key-moments","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C timeline: all the key moments","bodyText":"Nov 2005 UK energy policy review launched by Tony Blair May 2006 Blair declares that failing to take action on the UK’s nuclear plants would be a “dereliction of duty” July 2006 Energy review states that nuclear power can make a “significant contribution” to UK’s energy needs.

The announcement comes a day after Volvo said it would only make fully electric or hybrid cars from 2019 onwards, a decision hailed as the beginning of the end for the internal combustion engine’s dominance of motor transport after more than a century. Nicolas Hulot, the country’s new ecology minister, said: “We are announcing an end to the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040.” Hulot added that the move was a “veritable revolution”. He said it would be a “tough” objective for carmakers but France’s industry was well equipped to make the switch. “Our [car]makers have enough ideas in the drawer to nurture and bring about this promise ... which is also a public health issue.” Hulot insisted that the decision was a question of public health policy and “a way to fight against air pollution”. The veteran environmental campaigner was among several political newcomers to whom Macron gave top jobs in his government. Pascal Canfin, the head of WWF France and a former Green politician who served in François Hollande’s government, said the new policy platform to counter climate change went further than previous administrations in France. “It places France among the leaders of climate action in the world,” he told France Inter radio. Prof David Bailey, an automotive industry expert at Aston University, said: “The timescale involved here is sufficiently long term to be taken seriously. If enacted it would send a very clear signal to manufacturers and consumers of the direction of travel and may accelerate a transition to electric cars.” Norway, which has the highest penetration of electric cars in the world, has set a target of only allowing sales of 100% electric or plug-in hybrid cars by 2025. Other countries have floated the idea of banning cars powered by an internal combustion engine to meet air quality and climate change goals, but have not yet passed concrete targets. The Netherlands has mooted a 2025 ban for diesel and petrol cars, and some federal states in Germany are keen on a 2030 phase-out. India, where scores of cities are blighted by dangerous air pollution, is mulling the idea of no longer selling petrol or diesel cars by 2030, and said it wants to introduce electric cars in “a very big way”. The UK has an aspiration of all new cars being electric or ultra low emission by 2040, but has been criticised by campaigners and politicans for being slow to act on air pollution. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “I welcome the strong leadership the French government has shown by making the decision to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040. “This radical step shames the timid and insufficient response of our own government to the health threat posed by poor air quality.” France’s announcement came as Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicted electric cars would come to dominate the automotive market more quickly and dramatically than previously thought. Electric vehicles will make up 54% of all light-duty vehicle sales by 2040, up from the 35% share Bloomberg was forecasting just last year, according to a new report by the research group. Bloomberg said such a widespread uptake of electric vehicles would globally reduce oil demand by 8m barrels a day and increase electricity consumption by 5% to charge all the new cars. But Tony Seba, a Stanford University economist who has published research predicting electric cars will even more rapidly take over from conventional cars, said of France’s plan: “Banning sales of diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2040 is a bit like banning sales of horses for road transportation by 2040: there won’t be any to ban.” French car manufacturers Peugeot, Citroën and Renault ranked first, second and third on a 2016 list of large car manufacturers with the lowest carbon emissions, the European Environment Agency said. Just 0.6% of new car registrations across the EU last year were for pure electric vehicles, compared with 1.1% of new cars sold in France. French-Japanese carmaker Renault-Nissan has been an enthusiastic early advocate for the vehicles, taking 14.6% of the EU market share for battery-powered vehicles. The firm has built 425,000 of the more than 2m electric cars sold globally. France’s reliance on nuclear power stations for 80% of its electricity supply means that a shift to electric vehicles rather than oil-powered ones would dramatically cut its remaining carbon emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/14/signs-of-hope-in-the-european-gloom","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-14T18:28:23Z","webTitle":"Signs of hope in the European gloom | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/signs-of-hope-in-the-european-gloom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/14/signs-of-hope-in-the-european-gloom","fields":{"headline":"Signs of hope in the European gloom","bodyText":"Under Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has pursued a policy of “social democratisation”.

So far, this strategy has succeeded. But now SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz has been campaigning with the old slogan of “social justice” to win back precisely this group. That the CDU could not prevent the election of SPD candidate Frank-Walter Steinmeier to the presidency of the Federal Republic of Germany (Report, 13 February) could well be a portent for the Bundestag elections this year. The CDU now faces a difficult task. Being clamped between a re-emerging SPD and the rightwing Alternative for Germany, it has to find its place in the party system anew.

However, that does not mean that every sector and every company will have a trouble-free year. Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary will need to repair staff relations, jobs will leave the City of London and inequality will widen. Our financial and economic specialists predict the big stories in 2018. A good year overall … The global economy is set fair in 2018. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently upgraded its forecast for global growth to 3.7%, to reflect the return to health of manufacturing in most of the developed world and China. Manufacturing growth was at a standstill in 2014, as China stemmed the flow of unprofitable cheap exports and the eurozone wrestled with the Greek debt crisis. This year has proved more buoyant. A dramatic rise in global trade pushed factories across the world to their highest output for decades during November. It is a trend that forecasters expect to continue into 2018. Donald Trump’s tax cuts, which were pushed through Congress at breakneck speed, are another shot in the arm – even if the only effect is to raise business and consumer confidence levels over the next year. Oil prices have risen sharply to more than $60 a barrel from a low point below $40 last year, but analysts expect further rises to be muted, allowing growth to continue without an increase in fuel costs putting on the brake. The IMF highlighted Brexit as a possible drag on the prospects for growth, along with high levels of global debt. But with stock markets hitting new highs at the end of the year, the picture remains quite rosy. Phillip Inman … but shares might ease off After a year of booming stock markets around the globe, commentators are virtually unanimous in predicting that returns in 2018 won’t match those of 2017. The S&amp;P 500 surged 20% this year to a new record high, the Dax index in Germany jumped 13% and, in Paris, the market was up 10%. The FTSE 100 has also reached record territory, moving above the 7,600 level for the first time just before Christmas. But its year-on-year gain is only 7%, reflecting widespread concerns over Brexit, the economy and feeble wage growth. It remains only a few per cent above its previous high of nearly 7,000 in the final days of the tech boom of 1999-00. Wall Street, by contrast, has risen 75% since then. Could 2018 be the year the FTSE’s relative underperformance improves? If Brexit negotiations go more smoothly than predicted, interest rates remain low and wages pick up, then domestically focused UK stocks could be the surprise winners (with foreign buyers taking advantage of sterling’s weakness). How to play it? After his annus horribilis, fading star fund manager Neil Woodford could see his fortunes recover – but he’s still very concerned about overvalued markets globally. Patrick Collinson Netflix and Amazon on the up By the end of next year, services such as Netflix and Amazon will have become as popular with British TV viewers as “traditional” pay-TV companies such as Sky and BT. The number of pay-TV customers signed up to the main UK providers – Sky, Virgin Media, BT and TalkTalk – is expected to reach almost 16.8 million by the end of next year. By then, the number of people paying for subscription video-on-demand services (SVOD) – Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video being by far the most popular – is forecast to hit about 16.7 million. When the margin for error in the forecasts is factored in it is possible that SVOD services, which include Sky’s Now TV and smaller fare such as family-focused DisneyLife, could prove even more popular than pay-TV. “In a few short years, Brits have flocked to these new streaming services, which have become a household staple,” says Richard Broughton of Ampere Analysis. “The UK is one of a handful of markets around the world leading the charge, embracing online viewing.” However, Sky and friends won’t be fearing for the future of their business models just yet. Largely, consumers are taking services like Netflix alongside pay-TV packages from businesses like Sky, with only 29% saying they choose SVOD specifically over pay-TV. Mark Sweney City jobs on the move Next year is key for the City and banking. Brexit-related job moves are expected as banks begin to implement plans to keep doing business once the UK leaves the EU. The speed and scale of the Brexit moves – which, says the Bank of England, could affect 10,000 jobs by “day one” in March 2019 – will depend on whether a transition period can be agreed and what sort of trading arrangements are made after Brexit. Many regard Goldman Sachs as a barometer: its new £350m European headquarters in London is due for completion in March 2019. Decisions about how many of the 10 storeys it will fill could be taken in 2018 – signalled, perhaps, though Lloyd Blankfein’s active Twitter feed. The Goldman boss taunted the City last year by praising Frankfurt and Paris – the bank’s preferred post-Brexit hubs. More institutions will follow. Jill Treanor Ryanair still battling with staff The no-frills airline has already moved to placate disgruntled pilots, at least for the time being, by agreeing to discuss union recognition. It has now promised to sit down with cabin crew, who will have been emboldened by the pilots’ success in holding chief executive Michael O’Leary’s feet to the fire. After decades of refusing to recognise unions, it seems unlikely that Ryanair will yield easily to the every demand of either pilots or cabin crew. Should major points of disagreement arise, that could scupper any chance of a swift rapprochement that allows Ryanair to focus on what it does best: flogging more airline tickets than anyone else in Europe. After the embarrassment of two successive waves of flight cancellations in winter 2017, Ryanair will be desperate to stick to its knitting now. That gives cabin crew and pilots more bargaining power than ever before. Rob Davies Nuclear sector in cash struggle The new year will see the backers of new UK nuclear power stations scrabbling for ways to raise the finance for their enormous upfront costs. The first new plant to start construction in more than two decades, Hinkley Point C, loaded all the upfront cost and risk with the developer, EDF. But it’s becoming increasingly clear that a new financing model will be needed if the government is to get the new nuclear energy it wants. The use of government equity, or a loan, has already been discussed by Tokyo and London for one such plant, on the Welsh island of Anglesey. Horizon, the Japanese venture behind the project, is in talks with officials and has signalled it wants a decision on financing by mid-2018. And with a new boss at the helm of French state-owned EDF, which has ambitions to build a second plant, Horizon is unlikely to be the only nuclear builder testing the appetite for public finance. Adam Vaughan Global wealth gap to widen The gap between the super-rich and everyone else – which is already at the widest it has been since the turn of the 20th century – will continue to widen in 2018 as rich Americans benefit from Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful Christmas present” tax cuts. This month, the US president celebrated achieving Congress’s approval for “the largest tax cut in our history”. Corporation tax will be slashed from 35% to 21%, and the top tax rate cut from 39.6% to 37%. The Tax Policy Center calculates that 62% of the benefits of the tax changes would go to the richest 1% of Americans. The poorest Americans, who don’t earn enough to benefit from the tax cuts, will benefit by about $60 a year – a 0.4% income boost. The top 0.1% can get their annual incomes to increase by about $190,000 on average – or a 2.7% increase. The US is already the world’s most unequal society, with four out of five of the globe’s richest people and 41 million officially in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. The World Inequality Report, produced by French economist Thomas Piketty, warned this month that unless there is globally coordinated political action to increase taxes on the super-wealthy, the richest-of-the-rich will continue to “capture” more and more of the world’s income at the expense of the poor. “The global top 1% income share could increase from nearly 20% today to more than 24% by 2050,” the report said. “In which case, the global bottom 50% share could fall from 10% to less than 9%.” Rupert Neate"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/30/hinkley-point-c-developers-face-72bn-cleanup-bill-at-end-of-nuclear-plants-life","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-30T10:03:33Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C developers face £7.2bn cleanup bill at end of nuclear plant's life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/hinkley-point-c-developers-face-72bn-cleanup-bill-at-end-of-nuclear-plants-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/30/hinkley-point-c-developers-face-72bn-cleanup-bill-at-end-of-nuclear-plants-life","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C developers face £7.2bn cleanup bill at end of nuclear plant's life","bodyText":"The French and Chinese companies that are to build the £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will have to pay up to £7.2bn to dismantle and clean it up. Documents published yesterday reveal for the first time how much the developers, EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), will have to pay to decommission the plant, beginning in 2083. The new reactors in Somerset will be unique in British nuclear history, as they are the first for which the operator will have to pay to make good the site afterwards. “Waste transfer contracts signed today mean that, for the first time in the UK, the full costs of decommissioning and waste management associated with the new power station are set aside during generation and are included in the price of the electricity,” EDF said in a statement. Decommissioning costs ate up around half the budget for the now-disbanded department of energy and climate change, after the liabilities for cleaning up old nuclear plants were effectively nationalised in 2004 and 2005 when two companies faced financial problems. The Hinkley Point C decommissioning costs are estimated at £5.9bn to £7.2bn, with the dismantling of the plant expected to begin in 2083. The government, EDF and CGN anticipate the winding up of the new reactors will continue well into the 22nd century. The plant is expected to be fully decommissioned “from 2138” when the final spent fuel is disposed of. Experts said the cost estimate was likely to be on the low side. “The reality in terms of decommissioning is that it always costs more than people say,” said Dr Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute at University College London. He claimed that the precedent of the government taking ownership of the liabilities of British Nuclear Fuels Limited and British Energy more than a decade ago showed that the government would be forced to shoulder the costs if Hinkley’s developers had a shortfall. The body charged with dismantling 17 of Britain’s old nuclear power plants puts the cost of cleanup at £117bn over 100 years in its latest annual report, more than twice the cost estimated a decade ago. A large proportion of the cost is due to the complexity of Sellafield. The business department also admitted that large scale solar power and onshore windfarms could produce electricity for less than the price agreed for Hinkley, as the National Audit Office said in the summer. But officials suggested there would be additional costs to the renewable alternatives. “There would be significant upgrades to the grid required (such as connection and planning costs) as well as increased costs to keep the system in balance,” said the ‘Value for money assessment’. Greenpeace UK executive director, John Sauven, said: “We now have it straight from the horse’s mouth. Increasingly cheaper renewable energy sources do indeed offer better value for money to British bill-payers than Hinkley. “The government tries to obfuscate the advantages of solar and wind by throwing in extra costs for grid upgrades and balancing the energy system. But there’s no evidence anywhere in the documents to back up their assumptions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2017/jul/21/concorde-was-the-flying-brexit-a-different-era-but-the-same-mistakes","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-21T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"Concorde was the flying Brexit: a different era but the same mistakes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2017/jul/21/concorde-was-the-flying-brexit-a-different-era-but-the-same-mistakes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2017/jul/21/concorde-was-the-flying-brexit-a-different-era-but-the-same-mistakes","fields":{"headline":"Concorde was the flying Brexit: a different era but the same mistakes","bodyText":"The idea that we now live in an age of ‘post-truth’ implies that once-upon-a-time politics was guided by objective reality. Clearly, this is nonsense. We shouldn’t mistake a period in which the media and political establishment offered more coherent stories for a time when politics was truthful. In the recent past, politics could be astonishingly dishonest, especially when it came to supporting national machines. Concorde, the fastest lame duck ever built, was a flying Brexit. The political establishment privately despaired about its costs, whilst knowingly pretending that the project would improve Britain’s place in the world. Few politicians actually believed in the Concorde project. It was accepted inside Whitehall that the scheme would be an economic disaster. After Harold Wilson came to power in 1964, the Anglo-French supersonic airliner only survived because the government was concerned that unilaterally cancelling the project would lead the French to sue them for more than it would cost to continue to develop the machine. Edward Heath, the Conservative prime minister, also wanted to cancel Concorde. Heath even personally stopped Prince Phillip flying it on the grounds that it would be quite embarrassing for the government to scrap the aeroplane soon after it had been treated to a royal pilot. Concorde only continued because Heath wanted to enter the European Economic Community. Annoying the French was to be avoided. Once Britain was in the Community, the unions kept Concorde afloat. The second Wilson administration, a minority government, could not risk killing off Concorde for fear that the resulting the outcry in the labour movement would endanger their fragile political position. What, then, did politicians say about Concorde? Well, Concorde was not only going to bring supersonic speed to civil air travel, but also ensure that Britain could capture a crucial new export market and create a world-beating aviation industry in the coming supersonic revolution. In this bright future, Britain’s technology would be bought across the world. Most of the politicians who made these arguments knew better. Michael Heseltine is a crucial case in point. In the early 1970s, he emerged as the key Concorde salesman, tasked with going on a world-wide sales tour with the aeroplane to attract foreign buyers. In his memoirs, Heseltine is remarkably open about his two conflicting ministerial duties: to honestly inform parliament about the sales prospects of Concorde and to sell the aeroplanes to foreign airlines. Heseltine decided to do the latter: “It was not credible for an aerospace minister to separate himself from the sales campaign.” Only the Shah of Iran was thought to be a likely purchaser, and even he did not buy a Concorde. But surely journalists were speaking truth to power? Well, no. The newspapers were saying what the powerful wanted them to say. Optimistic estimates about the future profits Concorde supplied by the British Aircraft Corporation filled the pages of the broadsheets and tabloids. The only journalist who called for Concorde to be cancelled with any persistence was the much-derided Andrew Wilson of the Observer. Other media voices were aware of the flaws in the project, but found their efforts to expose them hampered. In the late 1960s, the BBC reached a compromise with the BAC: the broadcaster could question the project as long as they gave Concorde’s manufacturers the right to reply. “You may not realise it but this was a very considerable movement forward”’, wrote a BBC news journalist. Even when the unprofitable nature of Concorde was in plain sight, the public discourse around the aeroplane continued to celebrate its commercial viability. As secretary of state for industry, Tony Benn revealed to parliament in 1974 that Britain would not recover any of the £600m that the government spent on Concorde. Putting sixteen Concordes into production would also cost another £200m, at the very least. Due to their high running costs, Concordes could not be sold for more than a fifth of the price of manufacturing, so the cost could never be recouped. But, still, newspapers continued to talk of Concorde’s profitability. When the government announced its decision to go ahead with sixteen Concordes, the press and politicians were jubilant. But the celebration was delusional. Only the captive national airlines of Britain and France ever operated Concorde. It was to be described by one economist as among the three worst decisions in civil investment in the history of humanity. Much of the Brexit project is a Concorde: bold projections of a future defined by great British export strength built on shaky presumptions and perhaps even knowing deceit. The aeroplane is a reminder of how nationalistic fantasies, an ill-informed public debate and a lack of government transparency can mask a coming economic disaster.

Of course, they’ve always been there. Although the stockpiles were whittled down following the end of the cold war, the United States and Russia have each retained an arsenal big enough to destroy human civilisation, if not human life. It’s just that after their 40-year standoff wound down from the late 80s on, nukes seemed a less urgent danger. Over time, they faded as an issue in the news and as a preoccupation in the culture. By contrast, during my own childhood in the early to mid 1980s, the culture was constantly referencing the looming threat of annihilation. So much so that it made it all seem inevitable. My primary school years in Australia roughly coincided with the so-called “second cold war”. This was after a newly elected Ronald Reagan began adopting increasingly strident rhetoric about the Soviet Union, stepped up the arms race and initiated the “Star Wars” program, which threw an uneasy detente out of balance. This led to increased tensions, and as it turns out, we all came close to destruction several times in those years. During this period, pop culture – even the stuff aimed at kids – took a dark turn, and often frankly canvassed the consequences of nuclear war. Raymond Briggs’s 1982 graphic novel, When the Wind Blows, was one thing I recall reading obsessively then. It tells the story of a lovably drawn elderly British couple, Jim and Hilda Bloggs, who had survived the blitz and take the same dutiful cheer into the lead-up to a nuclear attack. We witness their pitifully inadequate preparations – like painting the windows – which they glean from government pamphlets. And then we see their heartbreaking, inexorable descent into radiation sickness and death. The comic made it clear, without anything like overt sloganeering, that in the event of a full scale nuclear war, millions of ordinary people – everyone – would die, and anything any government said to the contrary was a lie. (They made a film from the book which I could never bring myself to see). In the arcades at the time, there was a game that functioned as a kind of embodied parody of Reaganite missile defence. Atari’s Missile Command had the player defending cities against incoming ICBMs whose pixelated vapor trails charted their trajectory. It’s said that its designer, Dave Theurer, suffered nightmares of nuclear war as he was working on it. Small wonder. The game is unwinnable, and eventually the player, and all that he is defending, will succumb. A lot of golden age games were effectively endless in this manner, but at a time when governments were proposing Missile Command as policy, the game’s minimalism and futility had a special resonance. There was apocalyptic material for the whole family to enjoy. The Day After, televised in the United States in November 1983, and in Australia a little later, was a telemovie that showed the US devastated by nuclear war and collapsing into anarchy and misery in its wake. Once again, it proceeded by focussing on the suffering (and death) of ordinary people – the group depicted lived in and around Lawrence, Kansas. It terrified millions, including my eight year old self. 100 million Americans watched it, high level debate ensued, and it arguably changed the whole discourse around nuclear war. For Ronald Reagan, however, it just confirmed everything that he was already doing. As Gizmodo reported earlier in the year, Reagan’s diary records that “My own reaction was one of our having to do all we can to have a deterrent &amp; to see there is never a nuclear war”. In other words: stay the course. Later he called it “‘anti-nuke’ propaganda”. There was a pervasive post-apocalyptic aesthetic in the cinemas and video stores of early to mid 1980s, many strongly influenced by Mad Max. George Miller’s film, its sequels and knock-offs (like Battle Truck) promised a Hobbesian nightmare of warlords and intense resource competition in a world destroyed by war. Other films explored the same subject matter more obliquely. From New Zealand, The Quiet Earth shows the last survivors of human race destroyed by science run amok. In music, apocalyptic bangers were almost too numerous to count. They were by no means confined to underground protest music – frequently they were world-conquering monster hits. Suddenly, we find ourselves in a situation where Australia’s most important ally is led by a man who is threatening another nuclear power, and whose rhetoric on nukes is far more bellicose even than Reagan’s. We may be due for a revival of this anxious sensibility, but the art that is made may not have the broad effects it once did. In part that is because of the structural changes that put Trump in the White House. There is far less shared cultural space, and no network broadcast, or film, could hope to reach such a broad demographic chunk as did The Day After. There is no large, united peace movement to amplify its message. And we all know that were it made today, the president would not confine his protest to his diary. More likely he would dismiss it in a mid-broadcast tweet as “fake news”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/21/how-do-the-four-main-parties-compare-on-the-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-21T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"How do the four main parties compare on the environment?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/21/how-do-the-four-main-parties-compare-on-the-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/21/how-do-the-four-main-parties-compare-on-the-environment","fields":{"headline":"How do the four main parties compare on the environment?","bodyText":"Labour bring in a Clean Air Act to deal with illegal air quality safeguard habitats and species in the blue belts of seas and oceans ban on fracking set guiding targets for plastic bottle deposit schemes prohibit neonicotinoids as soon as our EU relationship allows us to do so plant a million trees of native species to promote biodiversity and better food management ensure that 60% of the UK’s energy comes from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030 establish a science innovation fund, working with farmers and fisheries, that will include support for our small scale fishing Verdict: John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace: “Far stronger on vision than on policy detail. Ambitious targets for renewable energy and home insulation have huge potential to create jobs, cut emissions, and lower bills. Along with banning unpopular fracking, they indicate Labour are serious about their commitment to tackle climate change. The promise to retain our vital environmental safeguards after Brexit will be welcomed by many, as will the proposed Clean Air Act. The destination is clear: now Labour need to show us how they plan to get there. Dominic Hogg, chair of environmental consultants Eunomia: “Interesting commitments on low carbon energy and a statement to the effect that a Labour government is determined to lead, internationally, on climate change: the party would ban fracking, and recognises the economic potential of the low-carbon economy. Proposal to introduce a new Clean Air Act is not backed up with much detail where the pressing matter of air pollution is concerned, although there is a commitment to retrofit ‘thousands’ of diesel buses in the most polluted areas. On the natural environment, there is not much by way of discussion of the nature of farm support in a post-Brexit world: it is not really clear what the ‘science innovation fund, working with farmers and fisheries’ would aim to achieve. Says little about waste and resource use, though the strangely worded intention to introduce a deposit scheme is welcome. Despite the commitment to a fair taxation system, there is little to suggest that polluters will pay.” Conservatives develop the shale industry in Britain, allowing major fracking decisions to be made by a national planning body aim to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and use aims for almost every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050 – will invest £600m by 2020 to help achieve it support for off shore wind industry invest in more low-emission buses energy policy post Brexit: we will form our energy policy based not on the way energy is generated but on the ends we desire – reliable and affordable energy … meeting our global commitments on climate change plant a million trees in towns and cities to improve air quality post Brexit we will continue to commit the same cash total in funds for farm support until the end of the parliament pledge to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we inherited it – will produce a 25-year environment plan Verdict John Sauven: “True mixed bag. Strong support for offshore wind can boost jobs, energy security, and trade opportunities, but the emphasis on fracking is a dangerous distraction. The commitment to lead on global climate action comes at the right time but needs to be demonstrated in practice. Aiming for every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050 is a good end goal, but we need some milestones along the way. The promise of leaving a better environment to our children tomorrow is worthless if we can’t stop them being harmed by air pollution today. Dominic Hogg: “There’s no room for anything environmental in the five giant challenges that the Conservatives have identified in their manifesto. There’s also a contradiction apparent in the commitment to meet global commitments on climate change, and the determination to develop the shale gas industry (ie support fracking) in the UK on the basis that it ‘is cleaner than coal’, conveniently forgetting that coal is being phased out anyway, so the comparator is nonsense: the proposed changes to the Shale Wealth Fund will be seen by some as a means to bribe host communities. The commitment to an additional 1 million trees in towns and cities isn’t going to change the fact that the plan for air quality, released a few weeks ago, is woeful. There is nothing meaningful on waste. On the more positive side, the mention of a new agri-environmental scheme could be of interest, and the plan to expand Natural England’s provision of expertise to farmers feels like a welcome reversal. The emphasis on environmental matters is weak, and the danger is that environmental issues will continue to be pushed aside.” Liberal Democrats 5p charge on disposable coffee cups to reduce waste diesel scrappage scheme, and a ban on the sale of diesel cars and small vans in the UK by 2025. extend ultra-low emission zones to 10 more towns and cities, generate jobs and exports by supporting green industries that manufacture electric and low-emission vehicles, Zero Carbon Britain Act to set new targets to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2040 and to zero by 2050 oppose fracking suspend the use of neonicotinoids until proven their use does not harm bees or other pollinators establish a statutory waste recycling target of 70% in England Verdict John Sauven: “A number of strong proposals. Targeting diesel is the most effective way of tackling air pollution, but the party stops short of an actual phase-out plan. Their strong commitment to cutting carbon emissions is matched by good policies on renewable energy, warmer homes, and community run schemes. A robust recycling target is crucial to stop the mountain of plastic sliding into our oceans. But whether it’s waste or energy, setting targets is a lot easier than hitting them.” Dominic Hogg: Contains some of the most advanced thinking. It is the only manifesto that has much emphasis on making polluters pay, with commitments regarding waste, vehicles and disposable coffee cups. The emphasis on delivering on greenhouse gas emissions reduction is strong, with a range of measures proposed, including on buildings. Like the Labour party and the Greens, the Lib Dems would not support fracking. On air quality, the manifesto mentions reform of vehicle taxation and a scrappage scheme. It also envisages a ban on sales of diesel cars and small vans by 2025. Overall, the impression is that environmental issues run fairly prominently through the manifesto. There are also positive recommendations regarding the natural environment (and the Lib Dems win the battle of the tree-planters, going for one for every citizen over the next 10 years). The manifesto is the strongest of the main parties in the extent to which environmental issues, and the contribution to health and wellbeing, permeates the whole document.” Green Party protect the natural world in the wake of the EU referendum by creating a new Environmental Protection Act and a new environmental regulator and court. end the monopoly of the Big Six energy companies by creating democratic, locally owned alternative energy suppliers end plastic waste by introducing a bottle deposit scheme to stop 16m plastic bottles ending up in the environment every day a Clean Air Act, including a new diesel scrappage scheme, a levy on emissions-cheating car manufacturers and a strengthened Clean Air Zone network across the country. End the reliance on fossil fuels with a ban on fracking and pledge to bring forward the coal phase out by two years to 2023. Scrap plans for all new nuclear power stations, including Hinkley Point C, with an alternative strategy to “harness the dramatically falling costs of renewable energy”. Verdict: John Sauven: “Many solid ideas but no great surprises. Prioritising renewable energy over expensive nuclear and unproven fracking makes economic as well as environmental sense. The combination of a diesel scrappage scheme and more clean air zones offers a practical and fair way to tackle air pollution. Tackling plastic waste is rightly recognised as a priority, and bottle return schemes are a tried and tested solution to this growing problem. The Greens have done their homework, but they’ll have to persuade people they can deliver on their promises.” Dominic Hogg: “The Green party’s commitments are much as one might expect. The ban on fracking is as expected. Also, we would expect to see a corresponding emphasis on promoting renewables, given the Green party’s opposition to nuclear power, and its intentions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed levy on ‘cheating car manufacturers’ is interesting, but the detail is not available. The commitment to a deposit scheme is also interesting. The proposals for a new (presumably revised) Environmental Protection Act and a new environmental regulator and court do seem eye-catching, but the details of this are not yet clear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jul/16/groundbreaking-cornwall-geothermal-project-seeks-funds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-16T14:38:25Z","webTitle":"'Groundbreaking': Cornwall geothermal project seeks funds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/16/groundbreaking-cornwall-geothermal-project-seeks-funds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jul/16/groundbreaking-cornwall-geothermal-project-seeks-funds","fields":{"headline":"'Groundbreaking': Cornwall geothermal project seeks funds","bodyText":"A pioneering project to produce power from hot rocks several kilometres under the ground in Cornwall will begin drilling early next year, if a multimillion-pound fundraising drive succeeds. Abundance, a crowdfunding platform overseen by the main City regulator, will this week launch a bond to raise £5m for the UK’s first commercial geothermal power station, located near Redruth. Iceland is the world leader in geothermal power, where deep holes are drilled to reach hot rocks, water is pumped down, heated and returned to the surface to generate electricity or provide heating. Cornwall’s extensive granite means it has long been seen as the most promising part of the UK for the technology, which one study found could provide a fifth of the country’s power. However, previous plans for geothermal plants in the county have faltered because of problems with financing and risk-averse investors. The Eden Project, for example, has wanted to exploit the rocks beneath it since 2009, but failed to win European funding. The £18m United Downs Deep Geothermal Power project near Redruth, by contrast, has already secured £13m in public funding, £10.6m from the European Regional Development Fund and £2.4m from Cornwall county council. Ryan Law, managing director of Geothermal Engineering Ltd, the UK company behind the project, said: “The big problem is because nothing has been done in the UK before, it’s quite high risk. Finding funding for that risk is extremely difficult.” Abundance is confident it will raise the final £5m needed, having raised £50m from individuals for renewable energy projects since it started five years ago, and £7m in the last two months alone. Investors can expect a 12% return on the bond, which has an 18-month term, and will have their capital returned to them if the geothermal plan does not go ahead. Bruce Davis, the investment platform’s managing director, said: “Geothermal technology is proven to work in Italy and Iceland but hasn’t so far been used in the UK to generate electricity. This is a groundbreaking project.” Drilling should begin in the first quarter of 2018 and take around five months as Geothermal Engineering Ltd drill a well 2.5km down, followed by a second deeper one of 4.5km, creating a circuit for water to be pumped down the shorter well and return up the other. If all goes as planned, the Redruth operation could be operational in 2020. The amount of power the wells are expected to produce will be small, at a capacity of 1-3 megawatts (enough to power 1,500-4,500 homes), similar to a single onshore wind turbine, but geothermal has one big advantage: unlike wind and solar, it can provide constant power if needed, like a nuclear power station. Chris Goodall, an energy expert and author, said that geothermal would add to the rich renewable energy resources that the county already enjoys. “Energy independence for Cornwall is a realistic, cost-effective objective for the county council. This is a first-rate project,” he said. Perhaps most importantly, the project, if successful, could pave the way for geothermal power finally taking off across Cornwall. Tony Batchelor, known as the grandfather of geothermal in Cornwall for his test research and drilling in the county during the 1970s and 1980s, told the Guardian: “This £18m is basically our chip in the game. Then we look at delivering bigger and better projects.” Ultimately, geothermal could provide as much as 1,000 megawatts of capacity, said Batchelor, an adviser to Geothermal Engineering Ltd and chairman of Earth sciences consultancy Geoscience. While not a huge amount nationally, it would be significant for Cornwall. “It’s great that geothermal in Cornwall can at last get going,” a spokesman for the Eden Project said of the United Downs project. Previous efforts by the council and the Department for Communities and Local Government had put in place the conditions for several Cornish geothermal plants, the visitor attraction said. Eden said that several plants would “greatly reduce risk” and added that it hoped to make an announcement of its own within two months. However, Goodall cautioned that this latest effort at making geothermal work in Cornwall was by no means guaranteed. “Pretty much everyone agrees there is a lot of heat down there. But one of the reasons projects have struggled to get funding is that it’s highly fractured and it’s not a given [that it will work]. No one has yet been prepared to put in the highly risky capital to do this,” he said. Bob Egerton, a Cornwall councillor, said he was sceptical about how big the resource actually was – but it was important to try to exploit it. “It is a bit of a gamble, but ultimately we hope it will pay off,” he said. “The more we can produce from these sort of resources rather than hydrocarbons has got to be a good thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/28/edf-and-uk-government-set-to-sign-contract-on-hinkley-point-c","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-28T14:51:38Z","webTitle":"EDF and UK government set to sign deal on Hinkley Point C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/edf-and-uk-government-set-to-sign-contract-on-hinkley-point-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/edf-and-uk-government-set-to-sign-contract-on-hinkley-point-c","fields":{"headline":"EDF and UK government set to sign deal on Hinkley Point C","bodyText":"The contract giving Hinkley Point C the formal go-ahead is to be signed this week, with the UK government and its commercial partner, EDF, putting pen to paper on the £18bn nuclear power project. EDF will sign a “contract for difference” on Thursday, an agreement governing the amount of money that the French state-owned energy company will receive for electricity produced by Britain’s first new nuclear power station in a generation. The signing will mean that the controversial project, the approval of which was delayed by Theresa May after she became prime minister in July, is all but certain to go ahead. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy refused to confirm that a signing ceremony would take place on Thursday. But well-placed sources said arrangements were being put in place for an official announcement. Representatives from the government, EDF and China General Nuclear Power (CGN) – the French firm’s 33.5% partner in the mammoth construction project – are expected to attend. The Green party’s co-leader Caroline Lucas has written to business secretary Greg Clark, objecting to the sign-off on the basis that the National Audit Office has said public subsidies for electricity from Hinkley could rise from £6.1bn to £29.7bn. In the letter, Lucas says the change is a “significant deviation” on the cost of the project and that there is a “strong case” for a revised estimate to be put before parliament. The plant, which will meet 7% of the UK’s energy needs, is to be built near the existing Hinkley Point B station in Somerset and will run for 60 years. The project is set to cost £18bn and is scheduled for completion in 2023. EDF will earn a guaranteed price for its energy of £92.50 per megawatt hour, a sum that some opponents of the project say is high compared with other nuclear projects around the world. Security concerns have been raised about the role that CGN, a Chinese state-backed company, will play in the project and future nuclear reactors. Those fears were thought to have been behind a surprise decision by May to delay approval on the project. Hinkley Point C has faced fierce opposition from EDF union leaders, while the company’s finance director resigned amid fears that the project would cripple it financially. Projects in France and Finland using the same technology – the European pressurised reactor – have also faced cost overruns and lengthy delays. It emerged on Wednesday that Areva, the EDF-owned firm due to build the reactor, was facing court action over the EPR it is building in Finland, which is a decade behind schedule. Finnish utility Teollisuuden Voima said it was seeking legal assurances that the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor would be completed on schedule in 2018. The executive director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, said: “On the eve of the official signing of the Hinkley agreement, this is a cautionary tale that should make our government think twice before putting pen to paper. The UK government is about to sign away billions of pounds of billpayers’ money to a project bedevilled by legal, financial and technical hurdles. “Theresa May cannot build a 21st-century industrial strategy around an outdated, dodgy, and ludicrously expensive technology.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/may/19/europes-defence-minister-roles-become-female-stronghold-sylvie-goulard","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-19T16:09:16Z","webTitle":"Europe's defence minister roles become female stronghold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/19/europes-defence-minister-roles-become-female-stronghold-sylvie-goulard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/may/19/europes-defence-minister-roles-become-female-stronghold-sylvie-goulard","fields":{"headline":"Europe's defence minister roles become female stronghold","bodyText":"When Europe’s defence ministers gathered in Brussels this week, all eyes were on the newcomer: Sylvie Goulard, the former liberal MEP who had been appointed France’s armed forces minister less than 24 hours earlier. But the meeting – to discuss ways of boosting EU-Nato cooperation and the use of joint EU battle groups – was remarkable for more than that. All five of the bloc’s largest economies, apart from Britain, were represented by women. Besides Goulard, Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert of the Netherlands, Italy’s Roberta Pinotti and María Dolores de Cospedal of Spain topped a table chaired by the EU foreign affairs and security chief, Federica Mogherini. “I’d like to think the glass ceiling has been broken,” said Alexandra Ashbourne-Walmsley, an associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute. “It shouldn’t be a thing any more. But actually it will be until the US has a female defence secretary.” Indira Gandhi became the first high-profile female defence minister in 1975. The first in Europe was Finland’s Elisabeth Rehn in 1990. Since then 18 European countries have followed suit, including Sweden three times and Norway five. Few have direct military experience: of the current crop, Von der Leyen is a medical doctor by training, Goulard and Hennis-Plasschaert have spent years in Brussels, Cospedal is a career diplomat and Pinotti has a literature and politics degree. But in a field traditionally dominated by men, the growing prevalence of women could reflect both their capacity for “multitasking and thinking on their feet” and the changing nature of the portfolio, Ashbourne-Walmsley said. “Defence is a complex and fast-moving job,” she said. “Unexpected things happen. It will include, for example, cyber-warfare and other less conventional forms of warfare. It’s also often about finding consensus, building alliances.” Nor can it realistically be seen as less of a top-tier job than other cabinet posts, like foreign or economic affairs. “That may have been the case even five years ago, but it certainly isn’t any longer,” Ashbourne-Walmsley said. “If you look at the multiplication of potential threats many countries face – the thinking now about Russia, the terror threat – and general world instability right now … Defence is really no longer down the agenda.” The new French president, Emmanuel Macron, was criticised when it was pointed out that although, as promised, he appointed as many women as men to his government, only one of the top five jobs went to a woman. But Ashbourne-Walmsley said that in the case of France in particular, defence was “really a very senior job indeed. With the UK leaving the EU, France will be Europe’s defence heavyweight. It’s a nuclear power, it has a very significant military.” Goulard will be a key figure in European defence at a time when the continent is moving steadily towards closer cooperation in the light of the uncertainty triggered by the election of Donald Trump and doubts about US commitment to Nato. Her fellow EU defence ministers are also significant domestic players. Von der Leyen, a mother of seven, is often mentioned as a potential successor to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Hennis-Plasschaert, who said on taking office in 2012 that “it doesn’t matter if you have a willy or not”, has frequently denied women have a common way of doing politics just because they are women. The increasing number of female defence ministers has attracted the attention of academics. In a 2015 study, US researchers Tiffany Barnes and Diana O’Brien studied the more than 40 countries that have so far appointed women to the post. They found that equality between men and women in a country was a good predictor of when it would appoint a female defence chief – but that military dictatorships and countries with big defence budgets tended not to. “Large military expenditures suggest a political climate that is not conducive to changing norms of female exclusion,” the academics concluded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/mar/13/uk-households-unnecessary-power-capacity-energy-climate-intelligence-unit-report","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-13T06:01:24Z","webTitle":"UK households spent £180m on 'unnecessary' power capacity – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/13/uk-households-unnecessary-power-capacity-energy-climate-intelligence-unit-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/mar/13/uk-households-unnecessary-power-capacity-energy-climate-intelligence-unit-report","fields":{"headline":"UK households spent £180m on 'unnecessary' power capacity – report","bodyText":"Households have spent £180m over the past three years on spare power capacity that was never used, according to a report that comes as MPs prepare to debate what can be done about rising energy bills. Power stations have been put on standby over the winter since 2014 as part of the National Grid’s supplemental balancing reserve but the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) has found that the scheme, which closed in February, was never used. The thinktank said a new scheme to be introduced this winter would see the annual cost jump to £387m. Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU, said: “The clear message from this report is that paying to boost spare capacity in Britain’s electricity system can be very expensive and potentially unnecessary.” He calculated that increasing the capacity margin, the percentage difference between electricity supply and demand, would be extremely costly. The margin was 6.6% last winter, prompting a Lords committee last month to call for it to be boosted to 10%. But Marshall found that the cost of building enough capacity for a 10% margin would reach £12.4bn with nuclear power, and even cheaper gas power plants would hit £1.7bn to 2.1bn. The ECIU said that reserves could be more affordably secured through energy storage, greater interconnectivity with Europe and smart technology to help reduce demand from big energy users at crunch times. The National Grid defended the reserve scheme as a cost-effective insurance policy, and added that the winters had been mild. “We believe the supplemental balancing reserve was a prudent and efficient use of money to ensure we had extra power available to us in all eventualities,” a spokeswoman said. The Met Office said the last three winters had seen above average temperatures. But Marshall said the standby scheme was about coping during dark, windless cold snaps, so temperatures across the season were not key. Over the weekend, the National Grid and Google’s Deepmind confirmed they were in early talks about how artificial intelligence could be deployed to more efficiently manage power supply and demand. Last year Deepmind said it had cut total energy use at its data centres by 15% by using machine learning. The row over how much spare capacity the UK should have to pay for comes ahead of a House of Commons debate about energy bills on Thursday. Four of the big six energy suppliers have announced price rises over the winter including E.ON, which last week announced it was hiking dual fuel prices for 2.5 million customers by 8.8%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2016/feb/06/new-york-city-groundwater-radioactivity-investigation-indian-point-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-06T23:24:14Z","webTitle":"New York investigates radioactive leak in groundwater near city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/new-york-city-groundwater-radioactivity-investigation-indian-point-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/new-york-city-groundwater-radioactivity-investigation-indian-point-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"New York investigates radioactive leak in groundwater near city","bodyText":"Radioactive material has leaked into the groundwater below a nuclear power plant north of New York City, prompting a state investigation on Saturday and condemnation from governor Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo ordered an investigation into “alarming levels of radioactivity” found at three monitoring wells at the Indian Point energy center in Buchanan, New York, about 40 miles north of Manhattan. “Our first concern is for the health and safety of the residents close to the facility and ensuring the groundwater leak does not pose a threat,” Cuomo wrote in a letter that directed health and environmental officials to investigate. In one location radioactivity levels rose nearly 65,000%, from 12,300 picocuries per liter to over 8,000,000 picocuries per liter. The Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum contaminant level for tritium in drinking water is 20,000 picocuries per liter, though Entergy, the company that owns the plant, emphasized that only groundwater, and not drinking water, were contaminated. The governor’s office said the contamination had not moved offsite. Cuomo has encouraged Entergy to shut down Indian Point, but to keep its other plants further upstate open. He directed health and environmental officials “to determine the extent of the release, its likely duration, cause and potential impacts to the environment and public health”. “While elevated tritium in the ground onsite is not in accordance with our standards, there is no health or safety consequence to the public,” Entergy said in a statement released late Saturday. “Releases are more than a thousand times below federal permissible limits. The tritium did not affect any source of drinking water onsite or offsite.” The plant supplies roughly 30% of the electricity consumed by New York City. Indian Point had three emergency shutdowns in December, prompting the governor’s office to launch, and then expand, an inquiry into operations and safety standards at the facility. There have been many tritium leaks at the plant in recent years, though Saturday’s leak appears to be the most serious so far. Public service commission chair Audrey Zibelman faces a deadline for the results of the pre-existing investigation by President’s Day, 15 February. “This latest failure at Indian Point is unacceptable,” Cuomo said in a statement. “This is not the first such release of radioactive water at Indian Point,” he said, adding: “this failure continues to demonstrate that Indian Point cannot continue to operate in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment.” Tritium is a radioactive hydrogen isotope that cannot penetrate the skin; however, it is considered a health risk for illnesses, including cancer. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to request for further comment on the beginning of the leak and its duration."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/aug/04/lab-notes-doyouthinkhesaurus-a-great-week-for-dinosaur-camouflage-jokes","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-04T12:33:12Z","webTitle":"Lab notes: doyouthinkhesaurus?

We’ll never tackle climate change if academics keep the focus on consensus | Political science If so few Americans appear to know the exact level of scientific consensus, why do so many of them think climate change is real and worrisome? The simplest explanation is that the public have already heard enough about the scientific evidence to make up their mind, without being fed increasingly esoteric information about levels of scientific agreement. The real question is not whether the US public think climate change is a problem (most of them do), but what should be done about it. Here it is the crucial non-scientific issues around climate change that should take centre stage. Instead, valuable media and political attention has been expended on boosting the 97% meme, crowding out deeper conversations about policy framing, coalition building, public values and morality which do not lend themselves to headline numbers.

However, this assumption made for an inflexible negotiating position. Although officials and ministers stressed to the cabinet that they ‘accepted the terms of the Euratom treaty’, British negotiating briefs contained over 150 pages of red lines, clarifications and modifications. Some officials were concerned that such an inflexible position gave the impression that they were assessing Euratom’s case to join the UK and not the other way around.

The shame was not, of course, hers. She had absolutely nothing to be ashamed about. She was simply a teenage girl in a part of rural Nepal still practising a tradition known as chhaupadi, or the isolation of girls and women during menstruation because they were believed to be somehow unclean and toxic. When they had their periods, girls would be banished from their homes at night and made to sleep alone in outhouses, where they were vulnerable not only to attack from snakes and other wild animals but also from predatory humans. Roshani, however, is thought to have suffocated to death in the tiny, cold hut after lighting a fire for warmth. Shami Chakrabarti tells the story in her new book in a slightly more matter of fact way than this, but a more thought-provoking one. It’s part of a chapter that leaps from this extreme and almost medieval form of taboo to the modern western lament about why TV ads for sanitary products have to be so twee, featuring soothing blue liquids rather than shocking red ones. For a reader who knows all about the fuss over Bodyform ads but has never heard of chhaupadi, this chapter engenders its own twinge of shame; a realisation of how astonishingly lucky western women are, if coy tampon marketing strategies are as bad as it gets for us. But Chakrabarti doesn’t labour the point or turn it into a lecture, beyond gently pointing out in her conclusion that anyone reading this book is fairly privileged by global standards (for a start, they can read, which isn’t to be taken for granted elsewhere). It’s easy to feel sad and angry about the barbaric things still inflicted on girls in some parts of the world, she says, “but it is important nonetheless to look at all of our somewhat strange and warped attitudes to the biological cycle of women, without which none of us would exist”. Women may be suffering to a greater or lesser extent in different cultures but these are all points on the same spectrum. It’s not about playing one more privileged set of women off against the other, but illuminating the underlying question: why on earth is something that happens to half the planet a taboo in the first place? And that’s the strength of this book, though it is rather dry in places, written almost in the style of an academic essay. There is no exciting new clickbait theory of feminism here, and there’s not much in her final chapter of recommendations that hasn’t been said a thousand times before: more free childcare, challenge gender stereotyping, do something about the tide of misogynistic hate speech on the internet. The world doesn’t need another feminist book to tell us that. What we do badly need, however, is a reminder to step back and look at the global picture. Too much of what is written and published about women in Britain is really written about and for a certain kind of woman – middle class, reasonably well educated, quite often white, fascinated by culture wars and symbols but rather less so by gritty economic issues – and makes only guilty passing acknowledgment of everyone else. But Chakrabarti (right) draws in every chapter on stories from India or Kenya or Latin America as well as home. While these examples don’t necessarily lead her to any radically different conclusions about what’s wrong with the lot of women, at least for once we are seeing the problem in 3D. This book is likely to appeal to people who have frankly had enough of reading about the politics of waxing or the deeper meaning of Beyoncé, and who worry that western feminism is in danger of disappearing up itself in pursuit of rather glossy and superficial concerns, but still don’t for one minute think the battle is won. Anyone who previously enjoyed On Liberty, Chakrabarti’s story of running the civil liberties organisation through a series of epic battles over human rights law, will find this a rather different book. There is an obvious connecting thread. She maintains gender injustice “may be the greatest human rights abuse on the planet”, given it targets half the population and isn’t limited to any one country or period. She is unashamed about coming at it from a human rights perspective, but this feels like a new direction for the author. That may partly reflect her transition from running Liberty to being a card-carrying Labour frontbencher and supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. Here she embraces more radical ideas such as a universal basic income from the state, allowing both men and women to spend more time caring for children or elderly people if that’s what they want. Disappointingly, she doesn’t address the question of whether that might lead to women being sidelined into care while men carry on working, nor whether directing generous benefits towards the poorest, who are disproportionately likely to be women, would actually be a more feminist use of the cash. The story of Liberty, with both a big and small “l”, was one Chakrabarti had lived professionally for years and on which she was a confident voice of authority. In this book, she is sometimes a little too anxious to show she’s done the homework properly. At times the thread of an argument is lost in a wealth of examples, or the argument itself is made too sketchily in the rush to take on the next big issue. Readers could perhaps have done with a bit less exhaustive quotation from UN reports, and more of her own voice. The book is at its best when she goes somewhat off piste. There is an unexpected and absorbing chapter on the rarely discussed topic of how feminists reconcile their views with various religious faiths (more easily, it turns out, than you might think). And for every time she is trotting out a routine argument about, say, the importance of sex education in British schools there’s a vignette from outside Britain that brings you up short. In the 10 countries scoring worst on female education – which range from Afghanistan to Ethiopia – the poorest young women had spent less than a year in school, and most of those had never been to school. Pakistan is a sophisticated nuclear power but still doesn’t seem able to ensure that even half of its women can read. Why are so many of us who wouldn’t even hesitate to call ourselves feminists not more aware of this stuff, more agitated by it, more willing to give it the same space and attention we give to episodes of sexist mansplaining on Twitter? Which is not to say the latter doesn’t matter. But there is a whole wide world out there of things that matter, and most of what we read is barely showing us the half of it. • Of Women: In the 21st Century is published by Allen Lane.

And people do. In line with the regime’s tradition of obsessive secrecy, firm facts about the 33-year-old who rules the world’s last Soviet-style totalitarian state are as rare as a Pyongyang apology. Thus one of the most chilling tales about Kim is also largely unsubstantiated: how the young dictator, having inherited power and determined to be his own man, deliberately set about eliminating the senior apparatchiks who had grown rich and powerful under the tutelage of his late father, Kim Jong-il. As if unwitting actors in a devious, internecine plot from a Godfather movie, the pall-bearers who carried the elder Kim’s coffin during an elaborate state funeral ceremony in the capital in December 2011 have disappeared, died of unknown causes, or been purposefully eliminated, one by one, in the past five years. One of them, Jang Song-thaek, Kim’s uncle, former mentor and reputedly the second most important official in the country, was denounced, publicly humiliated and put to death in 2013. State media condemned Jang as a “traitor to the nation for all ages” and “despicable human scum”. Chinese newspapers reported gleefully that he was stripped naked and thrown into a cage with 100 starving dogs. It now seems more likely that he was shot by firing squad. Exactly what he had done wrong was never explained – except that perhaps, like Fredo Corleone, he was a holdover from the dead patriarch’s time and his presence was no longer congenial to the tyrant’s tyrannical successor. A defector to South Korea later said Jang’s wife, Kim’s aunt, was also executed. Other pall-bearers met similarly unpleasant fates. Hyon Yong-chol, head of North Korea’s military, was supposedly cut to bits by blasts from an anti-aircraft gun last year. The reason, again according to hearsay, was that he dozed off during one of Kim’s speeches. Kim Chol, a vice-minister in the army and a Jang associate, is said to have been forced to walk across a shooting range during a live-fire mortar exercise. He was, unsurprisingly, “obliterated”. Another supposed coup-plotter was incinerated with a flame-thrower. Such gruesome stories of expedience and vengeance have proliferated as fast as North Korea’s missile programmes during Kim’s five-year reign. They are complemented by rumours of his monstrous behaviour, lascivious sexual preferences, indulgence in drugs and alcohol, chain-smoking, bizarre illnesses, love of western rock music, and his unstable mental state. In the Alice Through the Looking Glass world of Pyongyang, it is all but impossible to tell truth from fiction. Some tall tales may be wholly or partly true, others are almost certainly fabricated by the regime’s many enemies. But neither can such colourful accounts of life and death in modern North Korea be entirely discounted. Claims that Kim has repeatedly shown a ruthless, even homicidal, streak when dealing with perceived rivals have more than a germ of truth. They fit with his continuation of the regime’s systemic human rights abuses, its pitiless prison labour camp system including enslavement, forced abortions and systemic rape, its abductions and foreign hostage-taking, and its aggressive defiance of its neighbours. According to the South Korean intelligence agency NIS, as of last year about 70 top officials have been purged and killed since 2011. It is an appalling record for a partly Swiss-educated, un-academic political neophyte who, in another life, and coming from a more normal family, might happily have spent his time eating too much fast food, playing computer games and cheering on his favourite basketball team. Without slipping into psychological analysis, it seems plain that Kim’s need to establish himself as a worthy, and possibly superior, heir to his father and his grandfather, North Korea’s “founding father”, Kim Il-sung, is key to his behaviour. Having been handed power unexpectedly early, Kim may have felt conflicting emotions: one, the urge to be as good or better than his unyielding taskmaster dad; the other, a crippling fear of failure, of being inadequate to the task. For five years Kim has been trying to prove himself. This weekend marks the culmination of that dangerous process. Proving Kim’s leadership and power, regional analysts say, is exactly what the rare – the first in 36 years – national Workers’ party congress that opened on Friday in Pyongyang is principally about. The congress may, to a degree, be about economic reform, as signalled in advance. North Korea’s mainly agrarian economy is in a parlous state, famine is a recent memory, and the country’s financial indebtedness to its only real ally, China, is significant. Kim has talked about reform in the past, although his limited measures, such as allowing workers on collective farms to keep part of their harvest and giving autonomy to some state enterprises, have not amounted to much. The congress may also focus on expanding the public sphere in North Korean life, and supporting the needs and aspirations of the people, as pre-congress state media reports suggested. But any hopes that Kim might inaugurate a Gorbachev-style period of perestroika and glasnost, or relax state controls after the manner of Deng Xiaoping, should be set aside. He has shown no interest in liberalisation. More likely, the four-to-five day meeting will primarily be about cementing his unchallenged leadership role, and entrenching the personality cult in which he has cloaked himself like some kind of paunchy, latterday Superman. Insecure he may be, and vicious to boot, but it would be foolish to under-estimate Kim. This Kim is not his father, the much lampooned skinny figure in a badly-cut Mao suit with weird hair and a dose of gout. This Kim is not the satirised buffoon whose submarines sink and whose favourite dancing girls defect at the first opportunity. This third-generation Kim already holds the titles of supreme leader, first secretary of the party, chairman of the military commission and supreme commander of the army – but he wants even more. This Kim wants recognition, vindication and authentication. He wants to be loved and feared, all at the same time. This Kim, as Dear Leader redux, is intent on strutting his stuff before a captive nation and the entire world. This makes him a very dangerous young man indeed. Kim has coined a word for his new era: byungjin, meaning the parallel development of the economy and nuclear weapons. If the experts are correct, he will elaborate this homespun philosophy before a necessarily adoring congress, confirming that it replaces his father’s songun (“military first”) mantera. Kim can be expected to continue to pay obeisance to North Korea’s original governing concept of juche, self-reliance. But his audience will be left in no doubt that his updated outlook represents the national way forward. Economic development is not something Kim can much influence without abandoning the Marxist-Leninist tenets of centralised control and direction dating back to North Korea’s post-1945 beginnings as a Soviet satellite. This seems an improbable leap. If the pre-eminence of the military really is in question, this could explain internal opposition to Kim that resulted in the purges of people like Uncle Jang. The expensive militarisation pursued by Kim Jong-il has made North Korea ever more dependent on Beijing, undermining the concept of self-reliance. Yet, given Kim’s behaviour in recent months, the more probable shift he envisages is not of a pacific nature. It means putting more resources into North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, its long-range ballistic missiles and its submarine launch capabilities, and less into conventional military forces. Almost everything he says and does comes back to this single overriding ambition: to confirm and proclaim North Korea’s “eternal” status as a nuclear weapons state. This, it seems, is both his holy grail and his would-be legacy. In pursuit of this aim, Kim has defied the UN security council again and again, not least through multiple illegal weapons tests. He has alarmed Beijing, which, while it resents US regional meddling, is deeply uneasy about his direction of travel. In conducting a fourth nuclear test in January and promising another soon, in repeatedly firing missiles over the Sea of Japan, and in practising submarine launches that could one day threaten California, Kim has provoked the normally unflappable Barack Obama to palpable anger. In doing all this and more, he has dragged inter-Korean relations down to a new low, set Japan racing to build missile defences, and alienated the Russian government, historically North Korea’s oldest friend. What is Kim trying to prove? The answer seems straightforward, if disturbing. He wants recognition and respect from the international community, just as he wanted it (and probably did not get it) from his overbearing father and dysfunctional mafia family. He wants to prove that he really is as special as, from a very early age, everybody told him he was. Kim wants the world to make him whole inside, to make him feel better about himself. But it cannot. And that, in a nutshell, is his and his country’s tragedy – and the genesis of the rapidly growing North Korean nuclear threat. THE KIM FILE Born Kim Jong-un, 8 January 1983 to Ko Yong-hui, Japanese-born Korean dancer, and Kim Jong-il, supreme leader until his death in 2011. Attended Kim II-sung University, a prestigious officer-training school in Pyongyang. In July 2012 state media announced he was married to Ri Sol-ju. He is thought to have a daughter. Best of times Taking on the mantle of North Korea’s supreme leadership – one of his brothers could have been the choice.

The low-carbon economy in the UK employs at least 432,000 people, with a turnover of more than £77bn in 2015. This is larger than industries such as car-making and steelmaking, which are frequently given the spotlight when politicians discuss industry and jobs. Growth in green business is also expected to outstrip other sectors of the economy, as international opportunities open up for low-carbon goods and services. Investments by major developing countries alone are projected to be $23tn by the end of the next decade, with green business’s supporters arguing that the UK is well placed to take a share of the burgeoning market. In a letter to the Guardian, a group representing more than 30 of the UK’s green and low-carbon companies forecast that the low-carbon economy would rocket from 2% of the UK’s GDP today to 13% in the next three decades, boosting both manufacturing and services, but only with government support. The business leaders urged politicians across the spectrum to respond, as the policies of the next government will play a major role in determining how the sector develops and whether job opportunities are realised. They wrote: “Stable policies to grow the UK’s low-carbon market will be essential to turn this potential into reality and ensure our economy remains competitive on the global stage.” Green businesses have been disappointed by the apparent lack of interest in the sector during the general election campaign, and by the absence of strong public commitments in the manifestos. The signatories to the letter concluded: “We call on the new government to put in place ambitious and long-term policies to tackle climate change and improve the state of the environment at the heart of its industrial strategy and vision for the UK.” The letter was coordinated by the Aldersgate Group and also signed by 11 companies including Kingfisher, Aviva Investors, Anglian Water, Siemens, and Scottish and Southern Energy. Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, said the decision by US president Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change would not make a major dent in the prospects for growth. He noted that the shift to a more efficient and lower carbon economy is well under way across the globe, with the cost of clean technologies, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, falling rapidly, and investment growing strongly. “Following the commitments made by six world leaders at the recent G7 summit, and the news of greater cooperation between China and the EU on climate change, major global players like the UK must continue to build competitive, low-carbon economies and honour their commitments under the Paris agreement.” Environmental businesses in the UK have been hit in recent years by swings in government policy that have led to job losses and uncertainty among potential investors. These swings include the scrapping of subsidies and harder planning requirements for onshore wind farms; the slashing of support for solar panels and restrictions on solar farms; the abandonment of the “green deal”, which was intended to boost home insulation; the removal of the promised £1bn funding for carbon capture and storage facilities; and the scrapping of the target to make new homes zero-carbon. Last week, Labour accused the Conservative government of failing to come up with plans on how to achieve the statutory targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, set out under the Climate Change Act. Green groups fear that a new Conservative government under Theresa May could scrap the Climate Change Act, leaving the UK without firm targets on cutting greenhouse gases. However, the government has pointed to increased investment for electric vehicles, support for new nuclear power stations, and a boost to offshore wind as evidence of its commitment to low-carbon infrastructure. Since May 2010, the UK has installed more than 11GW of wind power, generating enough electricity for more than 7.8m homes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/jan/24/scotland-renewable-energy-north-sea-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-24T18:49:30Z","webTitle":"Scotland eyes 50% renewable energy by 2030 in shift away from North Sea oil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/24/scotland-renewable-energy-north-sea-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/jan/24/scotland-renewable-energy-north-sea-oil","fields":{"headline":"Scotland eyes 50% renewable energy by 2030 in shift away from North Sea oil","bodyText":"The Scottish government has taken the first steps to heavily cutting the country’s reliance on North Sea oil and gas after calling for 50% of Scotland’s entire energy needs to come from renewables. In a subtle but significant shift of emphasis for the Scottish National party after decades championing North Sea production, ministers unveiled a new energy strategy intended to push motorists, homeowners and businesses into using low- or zero-carbon green energy sources for half their energy needs by 2030. Currently, 47% of Scotland’s total energy use comes from petroleum products largely extracted from Scotland’s North Sea oil platforms, and 27% from domestic and imported natural gas needed for home heating. With opposition parties and environment groups expressing scepticism about a lack of detail in the new strategy, Scottish ministers privately admit cutting oil use is their biggest challenge in hitting far tougher targets unveiled last week to reduce Scotland’s total greenhouse gas emissions by 66% by 2032. While North Sea oil and gas production is in decline as reserves run dry, the new strategy implies Scotland will need to accelerate its transition to a low-carbon economy faster than reserves run out to hit both targets. Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, told MSPs on Tuesday that the new energy target was intended to directly support that climate target. Scottish renewables already supplied nearly 60% of Scotland’s domestic electricity use, Scottish islands were pioneering energy self-sufficiency, and community-owned renewable schemes now had an installed capacity of 595mw, he said. Wheelhouse said: “We can all take pride in such successes, however, it is clear that more progress will be required – particularly in the supply of low-carbon heat and transport – if we are to remain on track to meet our ambitious climate change goals.” It would put pressure on onshore windfarm operators to make their wind energy so cheap that it would not require a subsidy. Bus companies would be asked to invest in hydrogen-powered buses, and motorists expected to shift to electric cars. Renewables industry sources say hitting that much higher target could be slower and harder than Wheelhouse admitted because the Scottish government is expected to miss its target of supplying 100% of Scotland’s domestic electricity needs from this source by 2020. Industry analysts believe 87% will be renewable by 2020, in part because offshore wind power projects have been slower than expected. Wheelhouse pointed out, however, that the cost of offshore wind had fallen faster than expected, by 32% since 2012. The draft energy strategy, released for public consultation on Tuesday, failed to deal with substantial questions about the costs of meeting the new target, sidestepped Scotland’s continuing use of nuclear energy and also the exact mix and quantity of green energy schemes now needed by 2030. The paper also again sidestepped a decision on the future of fracking of Scotland’s large shale oil and gas reserves, with ministers are at odds over allowing it or banning it on climate and environmental grounds. Environmentalists, opposition parties and SNP activists are putting the Scottish government under heavy pressure to convert an existing moratorium on fracking into a permanent ban. Wheelhouse said ministers were taking an “evidence-based and measured approach” and would soon launch a new public consultation on whether to allow fracking. And despite standing for election on strong anti-nuclear platforms, Scottish ministers have admitted they are content to see the life of Scotland’s two nuclear power stations at Hunterston and Torness to be extended further, beyond their current contracts that run until 2023 and 2030 respectively. Nuclear power provided 35% of Scotland’s electricity in 2015. EDF, the French-owned utility that operates the two stations, is building up a technical case to win support from the UK’s nuclear regulator to extend both stations’ operating lives by several years each. That strategy is supported by Scottish ministers. Wheelhouse’s energy paper had very little detail on what power sources would provide the remaining 50% of Scotland’s energy needs but it said “thermal energy” – power provided by conventional nuclear or gas-fired stations – would be a significant part of that. While all opposition parties welcomed Wheelhouse’s overall 50% target, they were immensely critical about the lack of detail in the paper, particularly on the costs and funding of the strategy. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s energy spokeswoman, said the SNP often set targets it failed to meet. “Scotland has previously been required to import energy from elsewhere in the UK, particularly baseload power from England,” she said. “Yet the SNP’s energy strategy provides little detail about how to keep the lights on.” Mark Ruskell, a Scottish Green party MSP, said it remained unclear how the target for 80% of homes to use low-carbon heat by 2032 would be delivered, since the 2025 target was just 18% and current funding levels were inadequate. “Warming our homes affordably and with low-carbon power is a priority but the Scottish government’s targets don’t make sense,” he said. “There’s too much trust in a technological miracle in the future and not enough action on fuel poverty today.” Gina Hanrahan, the climate and energy policy officer at environmental group WWF Scotland, said the strategy “fails to put enough meat on the bones of the commitment to transform the energy efficiency of existing homes”. She added: “With 1.5m cold homes in Scotland, these proposals are too slow and underfunded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/jan/26/edf-struggling-to-fund-new-hinkley-point-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-26T18:55:18Z","webTitle":"EDF struggling to fund new Hinkley Point nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/edf-struggling-to-fund-new-hinkley-point-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/jan/26/edf-struggling-to-fund-new-hinkley-point-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"EDF struggling to fund new Hinkley Point nuclear reactors","bodyText":"The UK’s first new nuclear power plants for decades face fresh delays amid reports that French energy giant EDF is unsure it can finance the £18bn project.

A final decision has been on the cards since October, when China’s state nuclear firm CGN announced that it would take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by the premier, Xi Jinping. But executives at state-owned EDF, which owns the rest of the project, have delayed a final decision amid funding problems, according to French financial journal Les Echos. It said EDF was putting pressure on the French government to help find new backers to come on board alongside CGN. While directors are due to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, Les Echos reported, no decision will be made until the next board meeting, which will happen before final results are released on 15 February. EDF did not return requests for comment.

It took scarcely three months to take it apart. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has officially confirmed what had become apparent over the past few days, that Iran had fulfilled its obligations under the international deal agreed in Vienna in July at a surprising speed. It dismantled 14,000 centrifuges – two-thirds of its total capacity – and put them into storage under IAEA seal. It shipped out or diluted 98% of its stockpile of low enrichment uranium, which had been the main source of concern for the international community, as it could be relatively quickly turned into highly enriched (weapons grade) uranium. In the past few days, technicians yanked the core out of its heavy water reactor in Arak (a potential source of plutonium – the second big proliferation worry) and filled it with concrete so it could not be used again. These are very physical actions that the very many sceptics of the Vienna nuclear deal said would never happen. In the sceptical view, the Tehran regime was wedded to its nuclear programme and was playing for time. The speed with which the president, Hassan Rouhani, has acted suggests the opposite is true. His is a government in a hurry. It is clear that the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, took a strategic decision to sacrifice the overwhelming bulk of his flagship nuclear programme to win respite from international sanctions and to help get the Iranian economy off its knees – where it had been left in by Rouhani’s predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The fact that Revolutionary Guards did not attempt to use the freak arrival in Iranian territorial waters of 10 US sailors with poor navigational skills on Tuesday to slow down or torpedo the deal’s implementation points to a pragmatic consensus within the regime as a whole. From now, Iran will be able to sell its oil again, and buy new airliners to update its ageing and increasingly dangerous fleet. It will get back $30bn (£21bn) of its frozen assets around the world. It will soon get resumed access to the Swift electronic banking system. There are many caveats. Residual US sanctions for human rights abuses and other non-nuclear issues will remain. The Iranian military has shown its determination to move ahead with missile development and testing, in violation of UN resolutions. The persistent uncertainty about what is and what is sanctioned will mean that risk-averse banks and companies will prefer to stay away from Iranian transactions to be on the safe side. There are also many things that still cause friction over the nuclear dossier, such as the question of future IAEA inspections of suspect nuclear facilities, and future efforts by a hostile US Congress to torpedo the deal. It has recently passed legislation that makes it compulsory for third-country nationals who have visited Iran to get a visa to go to the US, even if they would not normally require one, yet another disincentive for the world’s businessfolk to trade with Iran. But the literally concrete moves Iran has made cannot easily be unmade. Before the deal, the country had the capacity, if it so chose, to enrich enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb in a matter of weeks. As things stand now, it would probably take more than a year. That removes what was once a likely cause of another major war in the Middle East. It is a big change. For the time being, the Iranian nuclear question has been settled. The key questions hanging over Vienna are more about the knock-on effects of the deal. The principal reason Rouhani has been in a hurry is his wish for the feelgood factor, if not the cash, from sanctions relief to suffuse the electorate before the Majlis (parliamentary) elections due in late February, thus boosting the political muscle of the reformists. The extent to which that plays out the way the president hopes will dictate the speed and direction of transformation in Iranian society. There are already signs that the regime is seeking to keep a firm grip on the pace of change. On Saturday, two-thirds of Majlis candidates were disqualified by the Guardian council, a body of 12 legal and theological elders. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, clearly hopes the consummation of the Vienna agreement (known as the joint comprehensive lan of action) would strengthen the hand of his ministry when it comes to the rest of foreign policy. In a tweet on the dawn of “implementation day”, Zarif said: “It’s now time for all – especially Muslim nations – to join hands and rid the world of violent extremism. Iran is ready.” However, the very modest hopes towards the end of 2015 of a Saudi-Iran rapprochement as a basis for a possible peace agreement in Syria were shredded at the beginning of this year, by the Saudi execution of a prominent Shia cleric, the subsequent ransacking of the Saudi embassy by a Tehran mob, and the severing of diplomatic ties by Riyadh and its allies. Throughout the two years of serious talks that followed Rouhani’s election in 2013, the negotiators on all sides insisted publicly they were focused exclusively on nuclear issues, while privately hoping it would bring movement in other realms. Now, it is those public declarations, rather than those quieter aspirations, that are being fulfilled now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/30/wylfa-nuclear-plant-closes-in-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-30T18:15:32Z","webTitle":"Wylfa nuclear plant closes in Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/30/wylfa-nuclear-plant-closes-in-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/30/wylfa-nuclear-plant-closes-in-wales","fields":{"headline":"Wylfa nuclear plant closes in Wales","bodyText":"Britain’s oldest nuclear plant closed on Wednesday, leaving in its wake a £700m decommissioning bill and further questions about the UK’s ability to keep the lights on. The closure of the Wylfa plant in Wales after 44 years of service puts more pressure on EDF Energy to take a final investment decision for new reactors at Hinkley in Somerset. The station on the island of Anglesey generated enough electricity to power 1m homes, and with a capacity of 1,000MW was once the largest facility of its kind in the world. But after an earlier life extension scheme expired, the last of the 26 British-designed Magnox reactors was switched off by the private consortium that manages the plant for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). The site was due to close in 2010 but it was kept open for a further five years as fears mounted that Britain would face an electricity shortage because new atomic and gas-fired power plants were not being constructed. “Wylfa has been a terrific success story for Anglesey and the UK nuclear industry. We have generated safely and securely for many years, which is an excellent achievement,” said Stuart Law, the site director. It will take another 10 years for the basic decommissioning to be undertaken at a cost of about £700m but the site cannot be redeveloped before the end of the century. High-level waste from Wylfa will remain on Anglesey until a national nuclear waste disposal facility is finally developed. Britain still has a fleet of advanced cooled atomic reactors run by EDF but most of these will be retired by 2023 just as the government has also promised to halt all coal-fired power stations. Hitachi of Japan is leading a Horizon Nuclear Power project to construct a new power plant at Wylfa, with a second earmarked for Oldbury in south Gloucestershire alongside a third facility planned in Cumbria. But the atomic industry’s revived fortunes ride primarily on the Hinkley C plant, which is expected to be the first new site since the Sizewell B station was completed in 1995. The £18bn Somerset project has been repeatedly delayed but Chinese investors finally gave their support in the autumn while the government promised the latest in a series of subsidies. EDF signalled in October that it would start work at Hinkley and it is expected to give the formal investment the go ahead within weeks before later saying it may not come until after Christmas. Hinkley Point C, intended to provide about 7% of the UK’s total electricity, was originally scheduled for completion by 2018 but the latest date is 2025. Sceptics still question whether it will make that later date given the experiences of delays and cost overruns with a similar power project at Flamanville in Normandy, northern France. There have also been problems at the new Olkiluoto nuclear plant in Finland which is using the same plant design provided by EDF’s engineering partner Areva at Flamanville and planned for Hinkley. National Grid, Britain’s electricity network operator, has played down the significance of the Wylfa closure and says it has put special measures in place to meet any mid-winter peaks in power demand. Another milestone in the change of Britain from a high to a lower carbon energy producer came two weeks ago when the country’s last deep coal mine, at Kellingley in North Yorkshire, closed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jun/19/uk-government-should-have-a-nuclear-plan-b-tim-yeo-hinkley-point-bradwell-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-19T15:10:33Z","webTitle":"UK government needs a nuclear plan B, says Tim Yeo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/19/uk-government-should-have-a-nuclear-plan-b-tim-yeo-hinkley-point-bradwell-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jun/19/uk-government-should-have-a-nuclear-plan-b-tim-yeo-hinkley-point-bradwell-scheme","fields":{"headline":"UK government needs a nuclear plan B, says Tim Yeo","bodyText":"Ministers need to talk to the Chinese about fast-tracking the planned reactor at Bradwell in Essex because the future of the £18bn Hinkley Point project is so uncertain, according to a leading pro-nuclear campaigner. Tim Yeo, a former chair of the energy and climate change committee, said the government should also consider whether the Russian state operator, Rosatom, or the British state could build new atomic plants. The Hinkley project in Somerset has been hit by a series of delays, with its developer, EDF, recently postponing a final investment decision until September. Yeo said continuing opposition from EDF unions to spending huge sums of money in Britain and political uncertainty ahead of the French elections next spring could hold up the project further. “There is a risk of further delays at Hinkley and, because of that, Decc (the Department of Energy and Climate Change) should have a plan B. “If another two to three years had passed before progress had been made [at Hinkley], it would have an impact on our ability to meet carbon targets and on our energy security,” said Yeo, who is the chairman of pressure group New Nuclear Watch Europe. Yeo, who was deselected as an MP at the 2015 general election, said the government needed to see whether it was possible to speed up other nuclear projects in the pipeline, such as China’s Bradwell scheme and the Horizon consortium project at Wylfa on Anglesey. The former Conservative MP suggested that talks could take place with the Korean industry, which is building in the United Arab Emirates, and Rosatom, which is constructing a new plant in Finland and has new, proven reactor technology up and running in Russia. Yeo acknowledged that unions and others have expressed concern about the plan by China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) to use its own reactor technology at Bradwell. CGN’s involvement with EDF at Hinkley has been less controversial because the scheme is to use a European pressurised water reactor (EPR). Yeo said the Russian political situation made it harder for the UK government, but Russian nuclear sources have previously said Rosatom would like to talk. In 2014, a senior Decc official confirmed that there had been serious contact between the two sides. Yeo said the use of Russian or Chinese reactor technology, if agreed following a generic design assessment by British nuclear safety authorities, might be more acceptable to the public if it were built by a UK-based consortium. “The Great British public is cautious and the unions sceptical of China, but if there was a UK/EU-based group involving say, Rolls Royce, it might reduce concern about where the technology came from,” he said. The pro-nuclear campaigner said the total cost of any new reactor to energy billpayers could be reduced if the British government became directly involved, as some City analysts have claimed. “Nuclear projects involve huge upfront costs. If you can shave off 1% from the cost of capital, that will go straight through to the cost of energy,” Yeo said. “The UK government has one of the best credit ratings in the world. There is an opportunity there, despite the Treasury’s almost Jesuitical opposition to borrowing.” Yeo said the Korean nuclear developer Kepco had built a range of reactors on time and on budget. It signed a contract in the UAE in 2010 and will deliver it on time next year. “What have we done (in the UK) over those seven years apart from talk?” he asked."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/01/beijing-tells-theresa-may-not-to-close-door-on-china-amid-hinkley-point-tensions","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-01T04:36:53Z","webTitle":"Beijing tells Theresa May not to close door on China amid Hinkley Point tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/01/beijing-tells-theresa-may-not-to-close-door-on-china-amid-hinkley-point-tensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/01/beijing-tells-theresa-may-not-to-close-door-on-china-amid-hinkley-point-tensions","fields":{"headline":"Beijing tells Theresa May not to close door on China amid Hinkley Point tensions","bodyText":"Beijing has urged Theresa May to make “wise” choices that help write “a new chapter” of UK-China relations when she flies into Hangzhou later this week for the G20 summit amid tensions over the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear project. The so-called “golden era” of UK-China ties - sealed under her predecessor, David Cameron - has threatened to unravel since May took power in July. Shortly after taking office the British Prime Minister angered Beijing by announcing that approval of the £18bn ($23.5bn) nuclear plant, in which China was to hold a one-third stake, would be delayed, apparently as a result of security concerns over Chinese involvement. The simmering Hinkley row will be hanging over May’s first trip to China for the two-day gathering of the world’s major economies, which begins on Sunday. In a prominent opinion piece published in the state-run China Daily newspaper on Thursday, ahead of her arrival, China’s ambassador to London urged the Prime Minister to make “wise strategic choices” over Britain’s future relationship with China. Liu Xiaoming made no direct reference to Hinkley but said “a number of steps need to be taken in order to maintain the momentum in the relationship” between London and Beijing. The diplomat said those steps included building “stronger political mutual trust” and increased cooperation. “In today’s world, no country can develop by itself behind closed doors,” Liu argued. Noting that the G20 would see May’s first “face-to-face communication with Chinese leaders”, Beijing’s ambassador added: “I hope both sides will seize this opportunity to forge stronger trust and closer friendship”. Whether the Prime Minister’s first encounter with Chinese President Xi Jinping will prove so friendly remains to be seen. Nick Timothy, May’s influential joint chief of staff, lambasted the “golden” relationship with China last year in an article for Conservative Home website. Timothy argued that Beijing had tried to buy British silence on its human rights abuses “with their gold”. “And [David Cameron’s] government has been only too happy to oblige.” Timothy also questioned the wisdom of allowing Chinese involvement in sensitive sectors such as nuclear power, arguing there was no justification for giving “a hostile state easy access to the country’s critical national infrastructure”. Reports emerged earlier this week that May was considering a proposal to detach the development of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station from an agreement allowing China to build a nuclear reactor in Bradwell, Essex. That decision would be likely to infuriate Beijing which saw the Bradwell plant as a means of showcasing its nuclear technology to the rest of the world. “[The] Chinese would never agree to it,” Paul Dorfman, a former government adviser on nuclear power, told the Times, which reported the proposal on Monday. Dorfman suggested Downing Street’s attempt to separate the projects could in fact be “a strategy to torpedo the whole thing”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/may/18/national-grid-boss-criticises-labours-plan-for-renationalisation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-19T06:05:43Z","webTitle":"National Grid boss says Labour plan will stall green energy drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/national-grid-boss-criticises-labours-plan-for-renationalisation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/may/18/national-grid-boss-criticises-labours-plan-for-renationalisation","fields":{"headline":"National Grid boss says Labour plan will stall green energy drive","bodyText":"Labour’s plan to take the National Grid back into public ownership would harm the UK’s switch to green energy, the grid’s chief executive has said. John Pettigrew said renationalisation was “the last thing the industry needs” as it invests to accommodate more wind and solar power on the UK’s power grids. “Clearly, on nationalisation, we do not think it is a good idea,” Pettigrew said, as the company reported operating profits up 14% to £4.7bn for 2016-17. Its market capitalisation is about £38bn, including its US business. “To spend tens of billions of taxpayer money on nationalisation I’m just not convinced would be in the interest of taxpayers nor of energy consumers going forward,” he told the Guardian. Labour’s manifesto promised to take energy back into public ownership in order to deliver more renewable energy and cut costs for consumers. But Pettigrew said the grid had coped with the rapid growth in variable power from windfarms and solar panels in the past five years, and argued that such technologies would be hit by instability from the party’s proposal. “What industry needs to take advantage of all these clean energies is stable regulation and stable policies,” he said. “The last thing they need is renationalisation.” A Labour spokesperson said: “Britain is going backwards in low-carbon energy and infrastructure. Our national and regional grids are outdated, and are failing to incorporate renewable energy sources quickly enough. Nor are they investing in a smarter grid able to balance more volatile sources of renewable energy and deliver flexible capacity.” Pettigrew, who joined National Grid shortly after it was privatised in 1990, said the costs of transmitting power across the UK had come down 40% since public ownership. Private companies would be better suited than the public sector to paying the £230bn-£462bn annual investment needed globally to switch to clean energy, he claimed, citing a figure from a recent report. National Grid spent a record £4.5bn on capital expenditure for its UK and US businesses last year, up from £3.9bn for the previous financial year. Analysts broadly welcomed the company’s “solid” performance and profits on Thursday, which were slightly above expectations. “For those wanting a reliable income from their investments, National Grid can’t be far from the top of the list,” said George Salmon, equity analyst at investment adviser Hargreaves Lansdown. Separately, investors in two of the UK’s biggest energy companies appear to have shrugged off the impact of Theresa May’s price cap on the energy bills. The share price of British Gas owner Centrica was up by 2% and SSE was up 1% on Thursday after the Tory manifesto included only a woolly promise to protect “more customers on the poorest-value tariffs”, compared with the 17m households the party had pledged before. The Conservatives also said they would remove the need for planning permission for companies undertaking exploratory shale drilling, and create a new shale regulator to speed up development. With public opinion mostly against fracking, the local planning system has caused long delays for the industry, even after ministers attempted to fast-track the process, so the move would be a significant change. Onshore windfarms, which the Tories campaigned hard against in the 2015 general election, were still considered unacceptable in England, but would get support in remote Scottish islands. One notable omission was nuclear power, compared with the 2015 manifesto, which promised a “significant expansion in new nuclear”. “The lack of any mention of nuclear energy is telling: it’s clear May doesn’t want to be associated with a beleaguered industry at a time when alternatives like wind and solar are getting ever cheaper,” said Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, who was also critical of the support for shale gas. One right-leaning thinktank said the manifesto oversold the benefits of fracking. Sam Hall, a senior researcher for Bright Blue, said: “While stringently regulated fracking could meet the UK’s demand for gas for a couple more decades, the Conservatives’ priority should be incentivising cheap renewables, which are attracting the majority of new energy investment worldwide, as part of its modern industrial strategy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/05/north-korea-crisis-donald-trump-options","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-05T12:20:03Z","webTitle":"What are Donald Trump's options for solving the North Korea crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/05/north-korea-crisis-donald-trump-options","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/05/north-korea-crisis-donald-trump-options","fields":{"headline":"What are Donald Trump's options for solving the North Korea crisis?","bodyText":"In the wake of North Korea’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date, the US has called for the toughest possible sanctions at the United Nations and said there are ample military options on the table. Experts warn that there are few good options the US can take without assistance from China, which has been wary of pushing the North Korean regime to the brink of collapse. China has advocated a freeze on development of the North’s nuclear program in return for an end to joint US-South Korea military exercises, an idea the US has rejected. Donald Trump has floated three ideas as a candidate and later US president to deal with the crisis: military strikes, punishing China economically and direct talks. War US defence secretary James Mattis warned earlier this week of “a massive military response” to any threat from North Korea against the US or its allies, and Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the UN, accused leader Kim Jong-un of “begging for war”. “Kim Jong-un doesn’t want to talk: he wants to develop the economy and a nuclear arsenal, not one or the other but both at the same time,” said Park Byung-kwang, director of centre for north-east Asia at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul, a thinktank affiliated with the country’s intelligence agency. “The crisis on the Korean peninsula is getting worse, which means the likelihood of Trump exerting more pressure and even [a] military strike is becoming more feasible.” According to Park, Trump has three options: ratcheting up pressure through sanctions, starting a direct dialogue with Kim or considering surgical strikes on North Korean military facilities. But it remains uncertain if Trump would coordinate with South Korea and Japan, two important US allies in the region, ahead of a military strike. Both countries would likely vehemently oppose attacking North Korea, Park said, given that their citizens are most likely to die in any conflict. Talk of war could bolster Kim’s position in the short term. “Donald Trump’s sabre-rattling plays into Kim’s logic of domestic power that positions the US as a dire threat, justifying the regime’s political repression,” according to Benjamin Habib, a politics professor at La Trobe University. “One could be forgiven for observing the current US-North Korea standoff as a game played by privileged men in suits on either side, gambling with the lives of ordinary citizens,” he added. “Millions of lives on both sides of the demilitarised zone and beyond are placed at unnecessary risk through such high-stakes brinkmanship. “Trump’s penchant for military posturing does little to increase the likelihood of denuclearising North Korea.” Military action could also draw China into a conflict. Beijing is opposed to North Korea’s nuclear program but does not want to see the Kim regime collapse. China sent more than a million troops to fight in the 1950-1953 Korean war, which is still officially known there as the “war to resist US aggression and aid Korea”. Tariffs on China China is North Korea’s most important ally and largest trading partner, accounting for 90% of its foreign trade. The isolated country exported $2.3bn in goods to China in 2015, while the second biggest destination – India – bought only $98m, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Imports into North Korea follow a similar pattern. But despite Trump’s threat to stop “all trade with any country doing business with North Korea”, China is also the US’s largest trading partner, and banning trade with the country would likely require an act of Congress. Trump does have the power to impose tariffs that would make importing Chinese goods prohibitively expensive, but experts warn that could set off a trade war that ultimately harms US consumers. “It may be that [Trump] thinks that being able to say that such tariffs have been imposed for reasons of national security, such as a response to the threats posed by North Korea, it will mean that they will be subject to less criticism,” said Saul Eslake, an independent economist who has consulted the Australian government on trade. “Other options include denying access to the US capital markets, or to the use of the US dollar, or to travel to the United States, and exerting pressure on US allies, including Australia, to impose similar measures,” he added. “Like tariffs, though even more so, measures such as these would cause more harm to the US than to China.” Tariffs would increase the cost of goods almost overnight, hitting low-income and industrial consumers the hardest. “There are very few avenues for the US to exert pressure on North Korea, other than to make threats of military action, and perhaps even to carry them out,” Eslake said. China is also the largest holder of US debt, giving it significant leverage if it decides to sell en masse. “Risking global recession through a foolish protectionist spiral or forcing China to drop the ‘dollar bomb’ is not a credible strategy for soliciting Chinese assistance with handling North Korea,” Habib has written. Direct negotiations Most experts agree that North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons. Kim is aware that Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi relinquished his nuclear programme in 2003 only to have US and European forces aid an insurrection against him less than a decade later. Shen Dingli, head of the Centre for American Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University, said he believed both China and the US now needed to accept North Korea’s status as a nuclear power and normalise relations with Pyongyang. Shen pointed out that Richard Nixon had reestablished ties with Mao Zedong during the early 1970s, just a few years after China’s first nuclear test, and said Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping now needed to do the same with Kim. “Nixon hated China, he never liked China. It was a Communist country staging the Cultural Revolution. But Nixon was smart. He needed China to counter the Soviet Union,” Shen said. “The US had to live with China’s nuclear weapons peacefully. China has to live with North Korea’s nuclear weapons peacefully, rather than opposing it, which is destined to fail.” Shen predicted Trump would soon realise he had no choice but to sit down with Kim just as Nixon sat down with Mao. “Trump is a smart man … He will be the first US president to accept North Korea.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/worlds-biggest-grave-robbery-asias-disappearing-ww2-shipwrecks","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-03T01:22:57Z","webTitle":"The world's biggest grave robbery: Asia’s disappearing WWII shipwrecks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/worlds-biggest-grave-robbery-asias-disappearing-ww2-shipwrecks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/worlds-biggest-grave-robbery-asias-disappearing-ww2-shipwrecks","fields":{"headline":"The world's biggest grave robbery: Asia’s disappearing WWII shipwrecks","bodyText":"Dozens of warships believed to contain the remains of thousands of British, American, Australian, Dutch and Japanese servicemen from the second world war have been illegally ripped apart by salvage divers, the Guardian can reveal. An analysis of ships discovered by wreck divers and naval historians has found that up to 40 second world war-era vessels have already been partially or completely destroyed. Their hulls might have contained the corpses of 4,500 crew. Governments fear other unmarked graves are at risk of being desecrated. Hundreds more ships – mostly Japanese vessels that could contain the war graves of tens of thousands of crew killed during the war – remain on the seabed. The rusted 70-year-old wrecks are usually sold as scrap but the ships also contain valuable metals such as copper cables and phosphor bronze propellors. Experts said grave diggers might be looking for even more precious treasures – steel plating made before the nuclear testing era, which filled the atmosphere with radiation. These submerged ships are one of the last sources of “low background steel”, virtually radiation-free and vital for some scientific and medical equipment. The Guardian revealed last year that the wrecks of some of Britain’s most celebrated warships had been illegally salvaged, leading to uproar among veterans and archaeologists, who accused the UK government of not moving fast enough to protect underwater graves. Three ships – HMS Exeter, HMS Encounter, and HMS Electra – contained the bodies of more than 150 sailors. All sank during operations in the Java Sea in 1942, one of the costliest sea skirmishes for the Allies during the war. In 2014, the wrecks of the HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales and the graves for more than 800 Royal Navy sailors were found to have been damaged by scavengers. The UK’s Ministry of Defence demanded Indonesia protect the ships in its waters. “A military wreck should remain undisturbed and those who lost their lives onboard should be allowed to rest in peace,” a ministry spokesperson said. Since then, divers in Malaysia have sent photos to the Guardian showing the destruction of three Japanese ships that sank off the coast of Borneo in 1944 during the Pacific War. And one of Australia’s most treasured ships, light cruiser HMAS Perth, has also been ripped up. Dan Tehan, Australia’s minister for veterans’ affairs, told the Guardian: “The HMAS Perth is the final resting place for more than 350 Australians who lost their lives defending Australia’s values and freedoms, so reports the wreckage has been disturbed are deeply upsetting and of great concern.” James Hunter, from the Australian National Maritime Museum, was one of the divers who discovered the Perth was “60 to 70% gone”. Born in the mid-western US, he had been diving with his father since he was nine and worked as a maritime archeologist for close to two decades, including on the archaeological team that investigated the American civil war submarine H L Hunley. Throughout his career, Hunter had heard of piecemeal salvaging of wrecks – stealing propellers and guns, or sometimes personal items of the crew. But last year, the museum heard stories from the diving community in Indonesia that ships were being destroyed whole-scale. “I’ve been in this field for 20 years, and I have never heard of a historic wreck, especially a large 8,000-tonne steel hull, being completely removed. I couldn’t believe it. I almost refused to believe it,” he said. But a month later, staring through the silty water in the Java Sea, Hunter saw how the salvagers had “ripped [the Perth] from one end to the other”. “You may as well just go into a war cemetery and dig it up. It’s no different to me, at all,” said Hunter, who comes from a military family. “I was completely horrified.” The US military has sent several delegations to Indonesia to try to protect its wrecks, several of which have been targeted. Thousands of sailors rest at the bottom of the sea, and veterans argue that the vessels must be preserved as underwater war graves. Large “crane barges” have been photographed above wreck sites, often with huge amounts of rusted steel on their decks. At the seabed, divers have found ships cut in half. Many have been removed completely, leaving a ship-shaped indent. Cambodian, Chinese and Malaysian-registered vessels have been spotted above shipwrecks. In some cases, their crews have been arrested. In one case, the looters had acquired a letter from a Malaysian university which said the work was authorised as “research”. The illicit business, which appears to have rocketed in the past 18 months, remains shrouded in mystery, with some archeologists suggesting selling corroded scrap metal was not worth the costly process of removing it from the sea bed. “If you look at the amount of money you would be spending to salvage on this scale, the return you would get just to get a bunch of corroded metal, it just doesn’t seem like it adds up,” said Hunter, the marine archeologist. Another point of confusion is the fact that plenty of accessible modern wrecks in the area have not been targeted. “If you’re simply looking at steel to melt down, go after a modern wreck ... I don’t understand why you would target a ship that is 75 years old and has got marine growth all over it and the metal is all corroded.” Salvaging can take several weeks for larger ships. Here is how it’s done. Archeologists believe the criminals might be turning a profit because the hulls are one of the world’s few remaining deposits of “low-background” metals. Having been made before atomic bomb explosions in 1945 and subsequent nuclear tests, the steel is free of radiation. This makes even small quantities that have survived the saltwater extremely useful for finely calibrated instruments such as Geiger counters, space sensors and medical imaging. Some ancient ships, often centuries-old Roman vessels in European waters, have also been salvaged for their lead, which is also low-radiation and is used in nuclear power stations. Martijn Manders, the head of the maritime programme at the cultural heritage agency of the Netherlands, has been looking at mystery of three Dutch wrecks that disappeared in the Java Sea. “We still have people who are living and served in the Battle of the Java Sea or were directly involved in other ways. They see that the ships are being torn apart, which is very painful.” While there might be small amounts of lead on the second world war wrecks, looters appeared to be more interested in the thick steel hulls, he said, pointing to the fact that salvagers dumped a large part of one ship, the HNLMS Kortenaer, back on the seabed. That vessel was a lighter destroyer type and its hull was much thinner and more corroded. “All the iron in that ship was extremely rotted and of no value whatsoever,” Manders said. Others said a booming demand in China for scrap metal might make the salvaging profitable without selling low-background metals. Even poor quality steel can bring in about £1m ($1.3m) a ship, according to some estimates, especially with the added brass from pipework, valued at about £2,000 a tonne, and copper wiring, roughly £5,000 a tonne. Whatever the motives for destroying historical treasures, hundreds more wrecks that sit in south-east Asian waters are at risk from illegal salvaging. Many ships from the second world war – some with possibly up to 5,000 dead sailors entombed inside – lie several hundred metres down, way below safe diving limits and have not been assessed since the new wave of salvaging started. But Hunter warned equipment was becoming available to remotely salvage these ships. “Now we’ve got technology that is enabling people to find and potentially salvage wrecks in extremely deep water. This threat is getting bigger,” said Hunter. “And as the technology develops and as it gets cheaper and as it gets more accessible, I honestly believe this going to become a bigger problem.” Sources: US Navy, Royal Navy, Australian Department of Defence, Dutch Ministry of Defence, wrecksite.eu, combinedfleet.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/aug/02/what-we-learned-summer-holiday-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-02T10:23:49Z","webTitle":"‘We took acid and got scared of the pillowcases’: what we learned from our holiday jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/aug/02/what-we-learned-summer-holiday-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/aug/02/what-we-learned-summer-holiday-jobs","fields":{"headline":"‘We took acid and got scared of the pillowcases’: what we learned from our holiday jobs","bodyText":"Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, believes young people taking a summer job is “connected to having a successful future … They can help people develop their customer service and problem-solving skills, build their resilience and attitude to work, as well as improve time management and the ability to juggle different priorities.” Last week, she launched a campaign “to make the case for part-time, Saturday and summer jobs”. She fondly recalled her own student holiday job as a waitress, and said it had directed her away from the law and towards a job in the media. McVey has been under a cloud recently, accused of misleading parliament on the rollout of universal credit, so may be hoping for some good publicity. Unfortunately, her Telegraph article announcing her jobs-for-students campaign is, rather like her initial statement on universal credit, disingenuous. She says that “the percentage of young people working while studying has more than halved, falling to 18% in 2014 from 42% in 1997”. Readers would probably take this to include university students, but it is only the proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds holding down a part-time job that has halved. By contrast (and not mentioned by McVey), the proportion of university students who work while studying has risen, and is now almost eight in 10.I was at university in the 1970s, when people were less likely to have a holiday job. I remember signing on but never got offered any work – thank God, I thought at the time. Reading about the summer jobs recalled here makes me feel I missed out – I could have done with a few of those life-enhancing experiences rather than lying on the sofa watching cricket on TV or idly flicking through textbooks on Anglo-Saxon history. I comprehensively failed the McVey initiative test. Even if you hate your holiday job, it’s still worth doing because, as one student about to embark on his second vacation job told me recently: “Holiday jobs might not be good at showing you what you want to do in life, but they can be brilliant at showing you what you don’t want to do.” As some of the writers below discovered. Alex James Musician and cheesemaker I had dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station. I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact. My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months. It was incredibly hard, repetitive work. The manager was an ex-army major: very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing. There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for “shoplifter spotted”, at which point all the male floor staff were required to assemble at till No 1 to tackle the suspect – who would sometimes become violent. I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle – a project I’m still working on. Owen Jones Guardian columnist Ah, the unforgettable summer of 2003, which I spent working for a hearing-aid company on an industrial park on the outskirts of Stockport. I remember my induction well. My line manager cheerfully handed me a box of rejected hearing aids, a pair of latex gloves and a bottle of disinfectant: I had to clean the earwax from them. If you’re feeling slightly nauseous at this image, try doing it. Phone calls with would-be customers were a challenge, what with them ringing for assistance with their hearing. Somewhat bleaker was that these cheap aids were pretty rubbish and it was all just a data-farming exercise to try to rip off mostly ageing consumers with more expensive products. Widows would ring, tearfully begging me to stop sending their late husbands promotional material for useless gadgets. So what did I learn from this particular summer job? Not much, other than confirming my suspicion that late-capitalism sucks. Zoe Williams Guardian columnist In 1991, it was perfectly possible to finish your A-levels, walk into a restaurant on Chancery Lane with just about enough experience to tell a bread roll from a complicated napkin, and score a job as a waitress – but it came at a price. Any demeaning wheeze they cooked up would fall to the idiot, and so it was that at precisely 3pm, I had to go from table to table, asking QCs whether they wanted a dessert wine. It had to be dessert wine. I wasn’t allowed to say: “Anything else to drink?” In the history of the rule of law, there has never been a professional in it who wanted a tokaji and hadn’t already asked for one. You cannot upsell to these people. You would be brave to even try to take their coat. They would look at me as though I’d tried to sell them some weed in a petrol station. “No” was as polite as it ever got, and often they would just stare, as if I’d made a catastrophic mistake that I would, by the grace of the system, soon pay for. The following summer I worked in an industrial launderette, which was so boring that every Friday everyone took acid and got scared of the pillowcases, and I learned something interesting about comradeship overcoming meaninglessness. I also learned silver service one summer, and still astonish associates with how many plates I can carry at once. On Chancery Lane, I only learned that you expect drunk people to be cheerful, which they are, right up until you imply that they are pissheads who will drink anything; then they become exaggeratedly haughty. But this insight has been moderately useful. Coco Khan Guardian columnist Music festival bar staff sounded like the ultimate summer job. Rather than work behind a bar for minimum wage to pay for one festival, work the festival itself. Pull pints in full view of the main stage. Spend free time checking out other stages. Pitch up in a cleaner field for staff. Make friends, and leave with some pocket money. I signed up to as many festivals I could; a full of summer of love. At the smaller events, that dream was fulfilled. But as the summer progressed and the events grew bigger, the tenor changed. Shifts were long and exhausting, and the weather had turned. Far from a sweet deal where everyone’s a winner, I had been ferried to a distant corner of the UK to work night shifts for minimum wage and shiver in a tent. One particularly awful gig was at a dance music festival where half the punters were high on (presumably) ecstasy and I had to refuse to serve swathes of them unless the order was water. In the mayhem, one punter pointed out that I hadn’t given him a receipt. He said: “It says here that if you forget the receipt, I get these for free.” “Sorry,” I replied, “it’s been a long shift and to be honest that money will come out of my wages.” “Not my problem,” he said. And I thought ecstasy was meant to make you love everyone. Did it help me toward my career? Not at all, although it gave me a profound respect for bar staff and taught me a life lesson: never mix business and pleasure. Jess Phillips MP for Birmingham Yardley Every summer while at school and university, I worked in local pubs. I collected glasses, and worked in kitchens and behind the bar. No other job I ever had better trained me for the world of politics. Working behind a bar teaches you to talk to anyone, especially those you really cannot stand. It taught me to hold my own in a masculine environment and not to take any crap from people who deemed me inferior. In one pub, there was a huge mirror behind the bar, and I would constantly get caught out by it as I turned away from customers who I was placating with fake laughter, only to pull a face or roll my eyes as soon as my back was turned. Working in the pub was where I fell in love with my husband, who was also a seasoned barman. One day, when I give up the world of politics, we dream of buying a little pub and going back to one of the best jobs we ever had. David Lammy MP for Tottenham My dad left when I was young, leaving my mother on a very low income to support the family. Understandably, she was constantly fretting about money. So from about the age of 12, I was aware that I had to work every holiday. I did so many different jobs that it’s easy to lose track. One of my longest-lasting jobs was the paper round. I delivered the Haringey Advertiser to what must have been half of Tottenham for several years. My mother and sister would muck in when necessary. I was paid by the batch, so it was vital to deliver every paper. Another summer job was at KFC. As well as showing me how to fry chicken, Bibi Pillay, my brilliant West Indian boss, taught me how to be nice to people, even when I wasn’t in the mood – a great lesson for politics. It was the people I worked with who made my summer jobs worthwhile. Missing a father figure, I sometimes looked to them for guidance. In summer 1988, I worked at the Windsmoor clothing company. My role involved boxing and stacking clothes, which sounds repetitive, but for me it was a fascinating job. This was mostly because of the brilliant conversations I had with my supervisor, Simon, who was three or four years older, and had a cool, cockney, Danny Dyer-type demeanour. Later, in my university holidays, I worked night shifts as a security guard on the construction site of the Goldman Sachs building on Fleet Street. Most of the men I worked with were first-generation immigrants in their late 40s. As a young student, I surely stood out. But they were not afraid to share their rich stories about the bars, bazaars, alleyways and women in Nigeria, Egypt, Ghana, Turkey, Iran and beyond. They taught me so much about the world. My summer jobs made me an adult. Michael Rosen Children’s writer I had a deal with my mum that over the school and university holidays, wherever I went, she would pay for my upkeep, but anything else I had to work for. Travel costs and camping gear was my affair. In the 1960s, you could work “on the post” doing delivery rounds over Christmas, but there was more cash moving mailbags. I landed up in the Kentish Town depot with a political activist called Rashmi from what was then Rhodesia, who was planning to topple the white regime; an antisemitic old boy who had worked for the Post Office all his life; and a Jamaican bloke who said, as we were washing our hands in the Portakabin, a white guy had once asked him how he knew if his hands were dirty or not. I eventually got fired for taking the mick out of the foreman. I’ve still got the hiking rain gear I bought from what I earned, and these fragments of racialised and politicised London from 50 years ago have survived, too. Magid Magid Lord mayor of Sheffield For about 10 weeks in 2009, I worked 12-hour shifts at the Next distribution centre in Wath-upon-Dearne, just outside Sheffield. I used to get the bus to the station, the train to Swinton, then another bus to the warehouse. It was the year before I went to university and I needed money to do some travelling – I wanted to climb Kilimanjaro and travel around the Middle East and Europe. The job involved the most mundane tasks – picking the orders out and putting them in boxes. What was great about it was the people: I worked with quite a lot of Indian international students who I bonded with. And I got a 20% discount. The canteen was really good, too – dinner was the main event. You used to be able to listen to music while you worked. I was listening to a lot of Black Eyed Peas; I would transport myself to a different world in my head and fantasise about my travels, what I wanted to do and how I was going to do it. It used to carry me through. Then they banned headphones – a lot of people were kicking off. It gave me discipline. I always think that if I want something, then I’m willing to really graft for it. It also gave me the skill of dealing with really boring stuff, of just getting on with things. That helps now when I’ve got lots of emails that need responding to – sometimes people ask the same questions again and again, but I know it needs to get done. Tamal Ray Doctor, baker and Guardian columnist I did my six years of medical school in London, which basically ended up as six years of financial struggle. My student loan was only enough to cover my rent for the year and, as my parents couldn’t afford to help support me, it meant that all my living money came from my summer and part-time work. During term time, I worked evenings in a clothes shop on Oxford Street. But during the summer, I worked as an office temp for a big mobile phone company. The work was the usual office spreadsheet juggling, but the people I worked with were a lot of fun. The company had a real ethos of treating its staff well and was always putting on after-work drinks. It was also sponsoring a big reality show at the time, so we would get visits to the office from some of the contestants. I had a slightly awkward moment when my dad found pictures I’d had taken with some of them and thought I’d been going to strip clubs. Working in the corporate world of mobile phones hasn’t got much in common with what I do now as an anaesthetist in the NHS. But that summer job still has an impact on how I think about work. It showed me what a large organisation can do when it has the resources; striving for efficiency in the NHS is pretty meaningless when you don’t even have functioning IT. It also taught me that poor work conditions and low morale aren’t things that should be allowed to perpetuate; they harm the individual and the organisation. I’m so grateful to have had the job. I met some amazing people and the money was a life-saver. Am I a more rounded person, though, for having worked during my summer holidays? I have no idea. Would I have learned as much if I’d spent my summers vomiting cocktails up on a moonlit Thai beach? And here is a selection of our readers’ responses … Mark, 56, consultant for a global software and analytics company, Northamptonshire From the age of 16 I was an ice-cream man. Compared to what my friends were doing, I counted this as a wonderful job. I benefited from being multi-skilled – which meant being able to produce a respectable cornet from either the harder “pre-frozen” product or from the soft-whip product. I was treated very well by the family firm I worked for. I’m sure this shaped my philosophy when I ended up being responsible for managing people. Having experience of direct interaction and service provision to the Great British Public opened my eyes in many ways – some positive, some less so. Above all, it helped teach me not to make assumptions. Jennifer Macaire, artist and writer, Mantes la Jiolie, France Since the age of 12, I had summer jobs. The first one was babysitting; the next year, I got a job at the state fairground. My best job was when I decided to sell my own artwork at a beach one summer. I got permission from a local restaurant to sell my drawings and watercolours from their veranda. I was 16 and saving money – I wanted to go to New York City to live after graduation. My part-time and summer jobs helped get me off the island (St Thomas, in the US Virgin Islands) where I was living. But low pay, long hours, no contract and no insurance also taught me about how hard it is to earn money. Suzanne, 26, working in children’s publishing as an editorial assistant, London I had a wide variety of holiday jobs from summer camp leader to Christmas elf, but my most memorable one was a holiday I spent working in a factory. All I had to do was pull a lever to put foil on small plastic plaques – over and over and over again. The pay was awful (about £2.50 an hour) – I mostly took the job to prove a point to my parents that I could survive in the world of work – but it made me extremely disciplined. I kept one of the small plaques to remind me of the experience and to encourage me to work hard so that I didn’t end up with a job like that for ever. I now have a great work ethic and appreciate any job that doesn’t involve pulling levers all day!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/17/mersey-wind-turbines-liverpool-uk-wind-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-17T05:30:46Z","webTitle":"Mersey feat: world's biggest wind turbines go online near Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/17/mersey-wind-turbines-liverpool-uk-wind-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/17/mersey-wind-turbines-liverpool-uk-wind-technology","fields":{"headline":"Mersey feat: world's biggest wind turbines go online near Liverpool","bodyText":"The planet’s biggest and most powerful wind turbines have begun generating electricity off the Liverpool coast, cementing Britain’s reputation as a world leader in the technology. Danish company Dong Energy has just finished installing 32 turbines in Liverpool Bay that are taller than the Gherkin skyscraper, with blades longer than nine London buses. Dong Energy, the windfarm’s developer, believes these machines herald the future for offshore wind power: bigger, better and, most importantly, cheaper. Each of the 195m-tall turbines in the Burbo Bank extension has more than twice the power capacity of those in the neighbouring Burbo Bank windfarm completed a decade ago. “That shows you something about the scale-up of the industry, the scale-up of the technology,” said Benjamin Sykes, the country manager for Dong Energy UK. The project is the first time the 8MW turbines have been commercially used anywhere in the world, which Sykes hailed as a “very important milestone” for the sector. Subsidies, friendly regulation and a maritime past have helped the UK install more offshore wind power than any other country in the world. Collectively they now have a capacity of 5.3GW, generating enough electricity to power 4.3m homes. Eight further projects already under construction will add more than half that capacity again. But ministers have made it clear that the industry must keep cutting costs if the technology, the only large renewable energy source backed by the Conservatives, is to continue earning taxpayer support. While a recent study showed the cost of offshore wind has fallen a third since 2012, a key litmus test will be the results of a government auction this summer for £290m of renewable energy subsidies. “I wouldn’t be at all surprised if it comes in below Hinkley,” said Sykes of the prices offshore windfarms might reach, compared to £92.50 per megawatt hour that France’s EDF has been guaranteed for electricity generated by the nuclear power station it is building in Somerset. Previous offshore windfarm subsidy deals have cost well above £100 per megawatt hour. “This and other projects have been crucial for driving costs down for the whole industry,” said Skyes, pointing to the Burbo Bank extension. Building fewer but more powerful turbines like these is cheaper because each tower and its blades need a foundation, the “transition piece” that goes atop that, plus the cables to connect it to a nearby substation, and ongoing maintenance. In Germany, Dong recently made waves when the electricity grid regulator approved its bid to build the world’s first subsidy-free offshore windfarm. While Skyes will not be drawn on when UK windfarms might do the same, he describes this one off Liverpool as “part of the journey to a zero-subsidy windfarm”. Dong thinks that by the time that German windfarm begins construction, there will be turbines as powerful as 13MW or 15MW. “There’s every reason to think they will arrive,” said Sykes, although he acknowledged eventually they will hit a theoretical limit. The majority of turbines in UK waters today are between 3.0MW and 3.6MW, with a smattering at 5MW to 7MW, but the Burbo Bank extension is a herald of things to come. Most of the 16 projects which have a planning green light but have not started construction yet will use turbines of at least 8MW. While the UK benefits from the power from those windfarms, the industry has been criticised in the past for not ensuring enough parts are made in Britain. Dong does not put a figure on what percentage of the Burbo Bank extension is UK built but half the blades are made at MHI Vesta’s Isle of Wight factory; the bits that sit on top of the foundation are built at Teesside. For people such as Justin Donaghan, the industry also means skilled jobs and a long-term career. The 34-year-old former Royal Navy engineer never saw himself working in green energy before he started working on the original Burbo Bank windfarm seven years ago. He is now a turbine supervisor, looking after the small teams that service the turbines. “I don’t even think there was a renewable energy sector when I was younger,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/28/a-short-history-of-nuclear-fission","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T19:15:43Z","webTitle":"A short history of nuclear fission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/28/a-short-history-of-nuclear-fission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/28/a-short-history-of-nuclear-fission","fields":{"headline":"A short history of nuclear fission","bodyText":"It began in 1789 when a German chemist named Martin Klaproth discovered uranium but it was not until 1934 that nuclear fission was first achieved following a series of experiments by Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist. The discovery opened the door to research by scientists around the world and in 1942 the first nuclear reactor was successfully tested at the University of Chicago. Most early atomic research was focused on developing weapons for the second world war, under the code name Manhattan Project. On 6 August 1945 an American B-29 bomber dropped the world’s first deployed atomic bomb over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. The bomb immediately killed about 80,000 people and tens of thousands would later die of radiation exposure. After the war, the US government backed the development of nuclear energy for civilian purposes. The Atomic Energy Commission was created in 1946 and approved the construction of an the experimental breeder reactor I in Idaho. The reactor generated the first electricity from nuclear energy on 20 December 1951. The UK’s first nuclear reactor was built in 1947 at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, to demonstrate the viability of commercial reactors. In 1954 Britain established its own atomic energy authority, to carry out nuclear research, develop nuclear deterrents and reactor technologies. The UK’s first commercial reactor, Calder Hall in Cumberland, was opened by the Queen in 1956 and the UK government claimed it was “the first station anywhere in the world to produce electricity from atomic energy on a full industrial scale”. But since then a number of nuclear disasters around the world have blighted the industry. On 28 March 1979 a reactor was damaged at Three Mile Island nuclear power station near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and radiation leaked from water that spilled out of the primary cooling system. The accident was caused by a combination of mechanical failure and human error. It triggered fear and confusion but no one was hurt. Less than a decade later, however, disaster struck in Ukraine at Chernobyl power station. In the early hours of 26 April 1986 one of four nuclear reactors exploded. The fallout forced tens of thousands from their homes and many were killed at the time and in subsequent years by radiation. It was the only event classed as a “major accident” by the International Atomic Energy Agency until the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011. A powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Japan’s north-east coast and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Almost 19,000 people died in the tsunami, while 160,000 people fled radiation in Fukushima. Afterwards Germany decided to end all nuclear power generation. In the 32 years before Chernobyl, 409 reactors were opened but only 194 have been connected in the three decades since. EDF’s decision to press ahead with the £18bn Hinkley Point C project means Britain will get its first new nuclear power station in a generation. It took a decade of debate to reach this point and will be another decade before the project on the Somerset coast is complete."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2020/sep/22/coronavirus-australia-latest-updates-victoria-hotel-quarantine-inquiry-daniel-andrews-nsw-health-business-scott-morrison-qld-annastacia-palaszczuk","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-22T08:39:50Z","webTitle":"Victoria reports 28 new cases and NSW two as Queensland relaxes border restrictions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/sep/22/coronavirus-australia-latest-updates-victoria-hotel-quarantine-inquiry-daniel-andrews-nsw-health-business-scott-morrison-qld-annastacia-palaszczuk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2020/sep/22/coronavirus-australia-latest-updates-victoria-hotel-quarantine-inquiry-daniel-andrews-nsw-health-business-scott-morrison-qld-annastacia-palaszczuk","fields":{"headline":"Victoria reports 28 new cases and NSW two as Queensland relaxes border restrictions – as it happened","bodyText":"Let’s take a look at the main developments of the day.

See you tomorrow. Wild winds are continuing to wreak havoc on Covid-19 testing centres in Melbourne’s south-east, with a third site forced to close. Peninsula Health confirmed on Tuesday afternoon its clinic outside the Frankston Basketball Stadium in Seaford had shut temporarily due to strong winds, AAP reports. “We’ll reopen this testing location, as soon as it is deemed safe for our staff and our community,” it tweeted. Two other test sites, drive-through setups at Casey Fields and Pakenham Recreation Reserve, were shut earlier on Tuesday. The Department of Health and Human Services said the sites’ open marquees made the structures potential hazards, while staff could also struggle to write notes in the blustery conditions. Nearby sites in Clyde, Berwick and Beaconsfield were kept open to allow residents to be tested, the department said. Australian shares and the Aussie dollar both took a hit as global markets fretted over a potential second coronavirus wave, particularly in Europe, adding to the already unsettling backdrop of a US presidential election, AAP reports. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed 38.5 points down, or 0.7%, to 5784.1 on Tuesday, but managed to recover from a three-month low of 5763.2 earlier in the day. The All Ordinaries index fell 40 points, or 0.7%, to 5973.5. The Aussie dollar also sank to a one-month low just below 72 US cents at one stage, before partially recovering to 72.09 US cents at 1615 AEST. That was down from 73.14 US cents at the close on Monday. Morrison tells Kenny: I know a lot of people on your program talk about Sweden. Well, Sweden has had a bigger fall in their economy and they’ve had almost 20 times the number of deaths. I don’t really see that as a model to follow. I see Australia as a model to follow. Kenny says he understands the need to flatten the curve but puts it to Morrison that young people essentially are not affected by the virus, and that this means we can “get smarter” about restrictions. Morrison says: We’ve also got to remember the virus moves most quickly among young adults. He notes that this then puts older people at risk. Morrison says he knows “there is a sense of security people feel from being behind a border”, but that it is not a replacement for a good testing and tracing regime. He says NSW is the example. On Victoria, including the curfew which Kenny was also been panning before the interview started, Morrison says the lockdowns have been very hard for Victorians. He notes his comment a few weeks ago on the Andrews government’s roadmap. “I hope that’s the worst-case scenario.” Morrison says there have been some changes, but “I hope we can see more”. And he says the federal government will “encourage further changes along the way”. Scott Morrison is on Sky News with Chris Kenny. He is pleased with South Australian premier Steven Marshall’s decision today to open the state’s borders to NSW. Asked about “border belligerence”, an apparent reference to the Queensland premier, who Kenny spent the first five minutes of the show criticising, Morrison compares Queensland’s jobs growth to NSW’s, which has been more significant. He suggests the border closures have had an impact on Queensland’s economy, which he says relies on tourism, including domestic tourism, and hospitality. The coronavirus recession’s disproportionate impact on women has fuelled fresh calls for an urgent rethink of pandemic recovery, reports AAP. Sally Moyle of the National Foundation for Australian Women said changes to the jobkeeper wage subsidies due to come into place next week would hit women harder than men. She told a Senate inquiry on Tuesday: Twice as many women as men will now have their wage subsidy payments halved because of the cuts for part-timers. At the same time, new stimulus proposals would have men gain twice as much as women from tax cuts. Payments for full-time staff are being cut from $1,500 to $1,200 per fortnight, while people who usually worked less than 20 hours a week before the coronavirus pandemic will receive just $750. Associate professor Moyle said childcare workers - 95% of whom are female - were the first to be excluded from jobkeeper. The government prioritised assistance to the construction industry. So it is regrettable to say the least that - despite women bearing the brunt of the pandemic - men are being increasingly targeted for government stimulus support. Asked about reports the government will bring forward its income tax cuts plan (an idea Labor previously supported), Chalmers says: I certainly think that just bringing forward the tax cuts wouldn’t be a substitute for some of those proposals that you have talked about and some of the other respected commentators and economists have talked about. I think it would be very troubling if the government thought that bringing forward some tax cuts was a substitute for a comprehensive jobs plan, it clearly isn’t. You ask me about our previous view on stage 2. We still maintain the view that people need help. The economy needs spending power. Chalmers is critical of the government’s decision to taper the jobkeeper wage subsidy from next week. Host Patricia Karvelas notes that Chalmers himself had called for the rate to fall and asks him why Labor has changed its mind. But Chalmers says that’s wrong. The same point that we have been making throughout still stands today, and that point is, that at some future point, jobkeeper will be tapered away. Ideally it won’t be a feature of the economy down the track. But we have always said, at every point, that the jobkeeper payments need to reflect the economic conditions, they need to be tailored to what is actually happening in the labour market and in the broader economy. We have been entirely consistent on that point and in pointing out that we think next Monday, when all of this money is pulled out of the economy, that that will have very damaging consequences for workers and businesses and communities. Labor’s treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, is next up on the ABC. He is happy to point out how Malcolm Turnbull had essentially panned the government’s energy roadmap just before. I think the most important point that he made, and I agree with him 100%, is that the absence of a coherent, overarching energy policy is costing Australia jobs, when jobs aren’t exactly thick on the ground. But also costing us the opportunity to get more, cheaper and cleaner energy into the system, which would be good for the economy, good for employment, good for investment. It ticks a lot of boxes. The prudential regulator has warned banks over the practice of telling customers they can dip into their super if they are struggling to repay their home loans. In a letter to banks, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority warned that doing so could amount to providing unlicensed financial advice – which is a crime. Near the start of the coronavirus outbreak, sister regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued a stern warning against telling tenants who can’t pay the rent to use their super. Apra was a little less forthright in its letter to banks, sent on Tuesday. It said that some of the plans drawn up by banks to deal with delinquent loans “included reference to borrowers accessing their superannuation as an option that could potentially be considered if borrowers are unable to resume repayments”. ADIs [Apra-speak for banks] should have appropriate controls in place to ensure that if they are informing borrowers about their ability to access superannuation, they are not providing unlicensed financial product advice and are ensuring compliance with requirements for giving financial product advice. Malcolm Turnbull has added his voice to calls for an increase to the unemployment benefits, which are set to drop back to $40 a day when Covid supplements are withdrawn. The government has confirmed it won’t make a call on the rate of the jobseeker payment in the budget, but is open to further extending the coronavirus supplement beyond Christmas. Turnbull says: I think it is very widely accepted that the level prior to all of the Covid-19 supplements, [jobseeker] was too low, and I think that needs to be enhanced. How much, I don’t have the data in front of me to give a view on that, but I think the fact that you have seen people from right across the spectrum recognising that, I think it is something the government should do. Because we have got to recognise that, thanks to this pandemic, we are likely to have high levels of unemployment for quite a while ... We don’t want to be complacent about that. We’ve got to do everything we can to fire up the economy and that is why a green new deal, renewable-led economic stimulus, would be much more effective than focusing on what is a very expensive fuel in gas. It is worth noting there were calls for the rate to be increased from many of the same groups – Acoss, the Business Council, Deloitte – while Turnbull was PM. Turnbull is asked about Angus Taylor’s suggestion the government will set a post-2030 emissions target at the next round of climate talks. The whole expectation in Paris was that every five years or so we would have to set new targets, and that they would be of increasing ambition. So that is the whole point, that nobody imagines the cuts and emissions we have to date are going to be adequate. We only have one planet, and surely we recognise that we’ve got to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and the good thing is, that we can do so in Australia and at the same time have cheaper electricity and cut our emissions. So we can have our cake and eat it too. If we de-carbonise our electricity sector, which we can do with renewables and storage, if we then electrify as much of our economy as we can, say from moving from liquid fuels in vehicles to electric vehicles, we can effect a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and have an abundance of cheap energy. The cheapest energy today is coming from renewables. Everybody knows that, but for reasons that I’ve always found hard to understand – they are cultural, ideological, whatever. There is a body of opinion on the right of Australian politics in the Liberal party and the National party, the Murdoch press, which still clings to this fantasy that coal is best and if we can’t have coal we will burn gas. I mean, it’s bonkers. The way to cheaper electricity is renewables plus storage, which is why the big storage plan that we got started – Snowy 2 – is so important. Some more choice words for Angus Taylor from Malcolm Turnbull. Does he give Taylor credit for moving the government away from coal? I think that misses the point. What I don’t give them credit for is most of what Angus says on energy is he doesn’t believe. Angus has got quite a sophisticated understanding of the energy market and he is speaking through the political side of his brain rather than the economic side. Scott [Morrison] absolutely understands the importance of the Neg and is a keen supporter of it. ... Now is the time to deliver an integrated, coherent energy and climate policy which is what the whole energy sector has been crying out for four years. If you like, you can assume that a bunch of politicians know all about the energy market and the people in the energy sector don’t know anything and are all imbeciles. I don’t think that’s right. Turnbull says “the government is intervening in the market”, which is “crazy” and “needs to stop”. The whole announcement last week was, I’m not going to sing the song but ‘it’s gas, gas, gas’. It was crazy. Seriously, we have got to stop this mad ideology, ideological approach to energy. It’s not a question of whether you are for gas, against gas, for coal, they are all physical things with certain characteristics, some of them high-emission, some are low-emission, some variable and some dispatch for, and you have to get the right mix. When the government starts saying this fuel is the one to go with, and the energy sector, people are just, they are punch-drunk with these random interventions from government. It’s got to stop. We need a coherent energy and climate policy. We had that with the NEG – sadly that was blown up in 2018, but that is what we need to get back to and then, I promise you, the market will do its work, and we will have affordable, reliable and low-emission energy. Malcolm Turnbull agrees with Patricia Karvelas when she asks if the government’s rejection of a 2050 emissions target was at odds with the Paris agreement. He says: Absolutely, that was the part of the deal. And the idea that you crash the economy by cutting your emissions is, just again, that’s ideology taking the place of what should be sound environmental and economic policy. There is a reason just about every other developed country in the world is taking a very different approach, besides Trump’s America. Turnbull is not alone in that view. Asked about Scott Morrison’s threat to fund a gas-fired plant if the market fails to replace Liddell, Turnbull says: This is crazy stuff. I mean, seriously. There is an argument for the government to invest where there is an overall public benefit, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing pollution. Government subsidies have been found in areas like that and been accepted for a long time. But gas is a very mature sector, and expensive fuel does have a role ... Some gas plants in Australia – big ones that operate for only a couple of per cent of the year – the capacities factors are to, five a bit higher than that present but they are important. To say that will lead your energy revolution and cheap energy is a fantasy, and the reason it is a fantasy is because there is not cheap gas on the east coast because it costs too much to extract, that’s just a fact of geological life. Turnbull also says he spoke to an investor before coming on air who told him he viewed the Australian energy sector as “an investable because of random government interventions, coupled with the absence of any coherent climate change and energy policy integrating the two”. Malcolm Turnbull is on the ABC responding to the Morrison government’s energy roadmap. Asked if the governent had the right priorities, he says: What the big priority should be is to have a coherent national energy policy that integrates climate and energy – that’s what the national energy guarantee did which Angus Taylor helped wreck. This is very hard to follow – what is emerging is this energy roadmap and it’s gas one minute, carbon capture and storage the next. What you need is to set out some basic parameters which deal with reliability, affordability and emissions reduction, and then let the market get to work. That’s what Liberal governments should do. Unfortunately, it’s just one random intervention after another. The Reserve Bank has warned that the unemployment rate could still rise despite the recent unexpected fall, while presenting four policy options the central bank has available should the economy need a further lift. Deputy central bank governor Guy Debelle says that while the drop in the unemployment rate to 6.8% in August was unforeseen, the recovery in the labour market was likely to be “bumpy and uneven”. “We still expect the unemployment rate to rise from here,” he told the Australian Industry Group on Tuesday, according to AAP. His comments came as new data on Tuesday showed payroll jobs fell 0.7% for the month ending 5 September. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has responded to the Morrison government’s technology roadmap. Here is some of his statement: This technology list is a fig leaf for the continued expansion of the fossil fuel industry. This roadmap contains no plan to phase out coal and gas. In fact, the roadmap bakes in coal and gas for years to come, subsidising the coal and gas cartels from the public purse. Carbon capture and storage is unicorn technology that has already had millions of dollars of public money poured into it. This is corporate capture and profit as the coal and gas cartels get access to billions of dollars meant for renewables. We already have the technology we need to move to a clean energy economy that exports hydrogen to our neighbours. He said the roadmap “doubles down on last century’s technology, all to suit the coal and gas corporations, whose fingerprints are all over this roadmap”. The summer bushfires are the most costly national disaster in Australia since 1980, with more than $2.3bn in insured losses claimed to date, the bushfire royal commission has heard. The royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements is holding its last week of hearings before delivering its final report next Month. It recalled witnesses from the Csiro, the insurance industry and security risk experts, with the senior counsel assisting, Dominique Hogan-Doran, saying there was “good reason” to consider climate and security risks together. Dr Bruce Buckley, the principle climate research analyst at Insurance Group Australia, said that according to an update on severe weather risks in a changing climate, released this month, the best analogue for the upcoming summer was the summer of 2010-2011, which saw cyclone Yasi, the Queensland floods and a hail storm that caused $1bn damage in Melbourne. So what this is telling us is that we have seen connected extremes recently where we have had a dry series of connected extremes [the drought and black summer bushfires]. Here, the prediction is for a series of wet connected extremes. Insurance experts said that Australia would experience “compound disasters” at an increased frequency. That’s things like fires, severe storms and a pandemic all at once – as experienced in the first quarter of this year. The chief commissioner, Mark Binskin, thanked the actuaries then remarked: Gentlemen, you are depressing. Today’s NDIS update has arrived. There are currently 24 active cases within the NDIS; 12 participants and 12 workers. It is a one-case increase among participants while the worker figure is unchanged. All cases are in Victoria. Prominent legal figures want the Victorian government to change its controversial Covid-19 omnibus bill, calling some of the provisions “unprecedented, excessive and open to abuse”, reports AAP. The Reason party MP Fiona Patten also will not vote for the bill unless there are amendments. The 14 retired judges and QCs have published an open letter, saying they are “deeply concerned” that the bill went through state parliament’s lower house last week. The bill is due to go before the upper house next month. The list of QCs putting their names to the letter include retired high court judge Michael McHugh and former federal court judges Peter Heerey and Neil Young. You can read more about the proposed laws here. Hi everyone, Luke Henriques-Gomes here, taking over from Amy Remeikis. Thanks to Amy for her work today. We should have a national Covid update coming up. So I’ll bring that to you when it arrives. That’s where I will leave you for today º Luke Henriques-Gomes is standing by to take you through the rest of the afternoon. Thank you so much for joining me today. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning. In the meantime, take care of you. Ax The bureau of statistics has released its payroll data: Between the week ending 14 March 2020 (the week Australia recorded its 100th confirmed Covid-19 case) and the week ending 5 September 2020: Payroll jobs decreased by 4.5% Total wages decreased by 4.3% Since the week ending 14 March 2020, the largest changes across industry were: ● Payroll jobs: accommodation and food services decreased by 21.9% and arts and recreation services decreased by 14.1% ● Total wages: mining decreased by 15.7% and accommodation and food services decreased by 13.8% You can find more information here. Victorian police have released their latest fine information: In the last 24 hours, Victoria police have: Issued a total of 92 fines to individuals for breaching the chief health officer’s directions, including: 9 for failing to wear a face covering when leaving home for one of the four approved reasons 11 at vehicle checkpoints 36 for curfew breaches. 26,623 vehicles checked at the vehicle checkpoints Conducted 1,965 spot checks on people at homes, businesses and public places across the state (total of 452,852 spot checks conducted since 21 March). Please find below examples from the last 24 hours of breaches: Four people were located in the carpark of Mernda railway station. When asked for their reason for being out, they stated they just wanted to catch up with their mates. All four people received fines. Five people were located having a party in a short-term rental apartment on City Road in Southbank. All five people were issued with fines. Three males were located in the carpark of a shopping centre in Casey, which was more than 5km from all of their addresses. The reason given for being out was that it was one of the males’ 20th birthday and they wanted to get a feed. All three were issued with fines. The Business Council of Australia’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, is happy with the South Australian decision to open its border to New South Wales from Thursday: It is good to see South Australia and NSW learning from our experience managing this virus throughout the pandemic, putting in place the systems to manage it locally, keep people safe and get their economies open again. This will be welcome news to families hoping to reunite, for workers who can now cross borders to get to their jobs, and for businesses like retailers who can look towards the critical Christmas period and plan with optimism. The economy doesn’t stop at state borders. Every artificial barrier to doing business hurts people and puts jobs at risk. If NSW and South Australia can get the systems in place that manage the virus, keep people safe and open their borders up, then there is no reason other states can’t do the same. We congratulate the South Australian premier for his leadership putting the people of South Australia and the national interest first. We continue to urge all state and territory leaders to take a common-sense approach, manage outbreaks locally, open the country back up and adopt a nationally consistent scheme to manage border closures only as a last resort. This will certainly set the cat amongst the pigeons. Kim Carr has some thoughts: Unions representing members of Virgin Australia’s 6,000-strong workforce have warned new owners Bain Capital not to undermine a “culture of collaboration” at the airline. Ahead of a meeting with the US private equity group tomorrow, the unions have laid out a long list of concerns about the future management of the airline. These include a claim that there’s a shortfall of planes ready to fly. The unions say Bain promised there would be 75, but just 56 are ready to run. In addition, they say Bain is using negotiations for a new enterprise agreement to drive down working conditions. Pilot unions “are concerned that the change of culture, combined with savage reductions terms and conditions, will lead to an erosion of training and safety standards”, the group said in a statement. One of the main concerns unions have is the involvement of former Jetstar boss Jayne Hrdlicka. Officials at Jetstar’s biggest union, the Transport Workers Union, associate her with Jetstar’s hardline approach to labour negotiations, and the establishment of a workforce paid less than the budget carrier’s full-service parent, Qantas. The unions said: Workers stand ready to negotiate cooperatively but they will not accept a coarse plan to drive down labour, safety and service standards in the medium- to long-term. It is clear that there is a lack of knowledge at Bain Capital on Virgin’s culture and brand among the Australian public. It is incumbent on Bain to show it can listen and learn from workers who have helped build Virgin up. Bain must show it can focus on maintaining the community trust that Virgin has created over the years, rather than morphing into a dictatorial culture. Unions signing on to the statement were (deep breath): TWU, ASU, VIPA, FAA, ALAEA, AFAP, ETU and AMWU. Mark Butler, Labor’s climate and energy spokesman, is responding to Angus Taylor’s speech. Butler says the roadmap is a “road to nowhere”: None of the policy announcements will deliver a single new job in the time frame Australia requires, which is now, in the middle of the deepest recession in almost a century, not off in the never-never. We have no plans to create jobs, no plans to bring down power bills, nothing from Scott Morrison except spin. ... The roadmap contains some unusual features. Nuclear power is in there, but bio energy is not. Energy efficiency is described as an emerging technology ... The first thing we should be doing is to bring down power bills and emissions and create extraordinary numbers of jobs, that is what every other country is doing. This plan has nothing about electric vehicles. We heard overnight the United Kingdom’s electric and hybrid vehicles, car sales, overtake diesel vehicles for the first time – a revolution sweeping the global car industry that this government has nothing to say about. There are some things in this roadmap to be welcomed, there is no doubt about that. Glad they got onboard on hydrogen and some other things like that, where they were previously opposed. But there is still some major deficits, measure blindspots, by this government on technology. And again I will say: no energy policy. And without energy policy, you won’t see things change on the ground. And without that, you won’t see new jobs created, and you won’t see power bills come down. The Western Australia premier, Mark McGowan, has reported three new cases in the state. All are in hotel quarantine. He was then asked about WA upping its returned traveller intake: Obviously we are sympathetic to everyone who is overseas who wants to come home. From whatever environment today we had three people come back to Perth and are now in hospital quarantine. What you saw in Melbourne is when the system overloads and Covid-19 gets out, mass outbreaks and massive debts. I don’t want to see that happen here so what we have agreed with the commonwealth government is over the course of the next three or four weeks we will double the number of Australians coming home who can hotel quarantine in Perth. This will mean per capita, per capita, Western Australia is taking the largest number of returning Australians from overseas. But we have to be able to manage it, we have to be able to manage the hotels, so we will just work to make sure we have a steady flow of Australians coming home and we can manage the load safely and securely to prevent what happened in Melbourne happening here in Perth. Another independent MP, Helen Haines, has also made her thoughts clear: Zali Steggall, who won her seat on a climate-change platform, also has some thoughts on the energy “roadmap”: The government is taking us on a detour. The roadmap is not the most efficient or economic way of reducing emissions, and not the way that delivers the most jobs. There is no net-zero goal in this announcement, and the government won’t commit to such a goal because they know their current policy won’t get us there, despite all the science indicating we need to get there asap. This is not a roadmap but a historical sightseeing tour of technologies, like carbon capture and storage, that have cost a lot and delivered little. We know what is delivering emissions reduction and that is renewables. Just last year the cost of renewables dropped by 26%. They are the cheapest and most effective way of reducing emissions, but the government has overseen a flatlining of investment that is likely to continue with this announcement. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, renewable investment has fallen from $4.12bn in 2018 to just $549m this year - well short of what we need to transition away from coal and gas.” And one of the early responses: Angus Taylor finishes up. Murph will have more for you soon, but ... sigh. Question: Two years ago, your predecessor stood here giving the national energy guarantee, saying we must not miss this opportunity to deliver a more affordable, more reliable and lower-emission energy system for Australia. This is a very glossy, 46-page document. You have spoken about more affordability and reliability, and outcomes. How can you convince the Australian public that this is now the way forward, given the national energy guarantee couldn’t get past your own party? Angus Taylor: Let’s be clear about the national energy guarantee. Parts of that are in place. We have only done it. It’s important because that will drive the incentive for dispatch ability. To balance out the deficiency in our grid, and the target of 26% reduction in the national energy market, will achieve that in the next 12 months, if not sooner. This is another policy ... Let me finish. We are focused on outcomes. The relentless focus in this area of the government’s outcomes. We have achieved those outcomes. In terms of achieving outcomes with this, we put in, I think, $18bn behind it, we’re serious about it, we’re already seeing the private sector and state governments matching significant funding in critical area. We have seen the New South Wales government state deal, they are matching our funding in many areas, and we have seen the private sector go there ... The CFC is getting a ratio of three to one – for every dollar they put in, we get $3. So we have a track record on this, we have the delivery and achievements. There is much more work to do in the coming years.This document lays out how we’re going to achieve that, and coming back to your original question, we have already achieved those outcomes the treasurer described. Question: There are concerns that carbon capture is an unproven technology. Even the facility that you mentioned earlier, when in full swing, will still leave around 5 million tonnes of CO2 going into the atmosphere annually. Why are you gambling taxpayer money on unproven technology? Angus Taylor: Because it’s not. Let’s go to the facts: there’s 58 carbon capture and storage projects in the world, either in development or in operation. Nineteen of them are in operation right now. The biggest one is Gorgon, which is taking 4 million tonnes annualised a year. It’s based on a technology that has been used for decades in the oil and gas industry and is being used now to store that carbon under the ground. Now, this is a technology that is recommended by the IPCC, the International Energy Agency. It is part of the plans for the UK, for Europe, for both sides of politics in the United States. Both sides. Biden has said in recent weeks that he will double down on carbon capture and storage and invest in R and D in carbon capture and storage. So you know, it is somewhat odd that in this country, it seems where we are a leader in this technology and playing a leadership role, it appears to me that in some quarters at least, it’s more controversial than it is almost anywhere in the world. But it is an accepted technology across large swathes of the world. It’s part of the answer. It’s not the whole answer. It requires balance. Q: Still a lot of CO2 going into the atmosphere, though? Taylor: It goes into the ground, whether it is biological. Biological, which we talked about earlier with soil capture. Taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through pasture growth, for instance, and that’s becoming soil carbon. And in the case of geological, we’re putting it in cabins under the ground. They are taking carbon dioxide out. They’re out of the atmosphere. That’s the objective here. That’s what the goal is. That’s what we say: we are relentlessly outcome focused. Technologies just deliver outcomes. They’re only interesting because they can deliver outcome and that’s what we’re focused on. Question: Nev Powell couldn’t guarantee that no one on the commission stood to gain from the gas fired recovery plan. Given the role with Strike Energy and the role on the board of the Saudi oil and gas company, can you tell Australia that no one on the commission stands to personally gain from the plan that they recommended to you? Angus Taylor: I should tell you that the plan that we have announced today is our plan. It’s our plan. The government makes the decision. Yes, we get advice from the technology investment advisory committee. Yes, we get advice from the NCCC. Yes, we get advice from departments and agencies. We’ve gone to Arena and CFC ... We’ve had hundreds of people engaged in every step of the way. But ultimately, the decisions that we’ve announced this week and last week are our decisions – the decisions of the government, based on what we believe is right for this country, is right for job creation, is right in a coronavirus environment where we want a strong economy more than ever. And they’re decisions that we stand by, and we are confident will deliver the outcomes that Australians want and deserve. Q: Will they personally benefit from it? Taylor: The decisions are ours, not theirs. That’s the point we’re making. It’s our decision. We’re the government. We’ve made these decisions. We’ve made the announcements. They’re our decisions. And that’s our job and that’s what we’re doing and we’ll take advice from many people. We take advice from people in business all the time. We take input. We talk to them. We talk to people outside of business, NGOs, all the time. They all have various interests. But we make the decisions. And that’s what we’ve done here. They have to be the right decisions for Australia and we’re very confident that they are. Q: It’s a simple yes or no. Do you know that or not? Taylor: Well, it’s not something that I’m even focused on. I’m focused on delivering a plan that is right for the country and we make the decisions. We made the decisions here that I’ve announced. We made the decisions that I announced last week. That’s the role of government. We take input from lots of people along the way. Question: You said earlier that we are placing a bet on the portfolio here when it comes to your picking winners approach. But in practice, how will it work? Take, for example, low-carbon steel. If you won’t have a carbon price, would you simply just have to mandate a proportion of steel being used, being produced through green steel, which is hydrogen? Won’t that just simply put the price of steel up? Angus Taylor: We already have the price that matters and that’s the price of steel. And that’s why we’ve set our target as the price of steel. We want green steel, low-emissions steel, to be produced at the same cost as the current cost of producing steel. The price of steel. So that’s already there. That’s the goal. And the whole point about this is that we don’t want to raise the costs of existing higher-emitting technologies and fuel sources. We want to reduce the cost of low-emission alternatives. And the only way to do that is for the technologies to get to the point where their cost of production for steel or aluminium or electricity, whatever it might be, is lower than the current higher-emitting alternatives. That way we deliver prosperity, jobs and all of that. Q: Just repeating the question: without a carbon price, how do you get low-carbon steel? You would have to mandate steel being made in a green way? Taylor: No, people adopt new technologies because of the economics of those technologies. Q: Or they’re being told to? Taylor: You know what, I know on the other side of politics, there’s always been an instinct to tell consumers what to buy, always been an instinct to tax them in order to make them buy what they want. We’re not going to do that. We’ve been clear about this at all times. We were clear about it before the last election and we’re clear about it now. So the way through, and this is true just for Australia, this is true for developing countries, for New Zealand, for Canada. If you want to get emissions down, you’ve got to make sure those low-emissions technologies come in and can produce whatever good it is they’re producing – whether it’s aluminium or steel or electricity – at a lower cost than, or at least equal, to their higher emitting alternatives. And that way, you don’t have to impose a tax. That way, you don’t have to make things more expensive for people. That’s what we’re seeking to do. We’re seeing that now. We’re seeing that solar is producing energy. It’s not dispatchable, but energy, at a low cost. That’s a great thing. And that is resulting in very significant investment of household solar on people’s roofs and large-scale solar as well. So we know that this works. We know that it works because this has been the history of technology through the world, that new, lower-cost technologies emerge that offer consumers great advantage over the existing alternatives. We want to see that with a lower-emitting alternatives, whether it is aluminium, steel, transport, you name it. Question: The government has been very prescriptive with private enterprise about building a new power station in the Hunter region. The prime minister has also indicated that you’re ready to go if private enterprise doesn’t step up. Therefore, can I ask you, if you have to carry through that threat, how big would the power station – the gas power station that you’re talking about – be? How much would it cost? How would it be financed? And when would construction start? And it be ready to produce? Angus Taylor: So there’s a bunch of questions there. Q: All related. Taylor: All related, I understand! The situation is this: when Liddell closes, we lose an effective 1,000 megawatts of capacity from the market. Economics says you lose a big chunk of supply without replacing it, the price goes up. So we’ve given the private sector until April next year to get to financial close with capacity that can replace that 1,000 megawatts that’s leaving the market. We will fill whatever gap is left. Now, we have some projects that are on the books, but none have reached financial close. We have Energy Australia, potentially a great project, but it’s got to get to financial close. We have AGL working on a gas [investment] in Newcastle, but it has to get to financial close. We have others in recent days who said that they can invest. Yes, great, but it’s got to get to financial close. It’s got to deliver power 24 hours a day, 365 day as year. And we’ll step in and fill the gap. Now, the cost of it and size of it will depend on the remaining gap. We’ll do it through Snowy Hydro and finance it, and Snowy already has a gas generator in the Hunter Valley, so this is not new for them. We’ll finance it. We’ll fill that gap. We would prefer the private sector get to financial close, but if they don’t, we’ll step up and we’ll make sure that it happens. Q: And what’s the timeline? Taylor: The timeline is April. Q: No, the timeline – if you have to step in, when would construction start and be producing power? Taylor: In early 2023. So that’s when it’s got to be completed by when Liddell closes. That’s why April next year is such a critical date, because that’s about as short a time as we can contemplate would be needed in order to get that replacement capacity in place. Let’s be very clear about this: this is partly about reliability, but it’s primarily about affordability. If you take that much capacity out of the market, it’s a huge amount in a short period of time. We saw what happened with Hazlewood. We saw very, very sharp increases in prices. We’re not prepared to accept that. But we are asking the private sector to step up. The rules are very clear and we want them to get to financial close by April this year. Q: I have a question about the soil carbon option. From my quick read of the book, it’s the only option where the potential reduction of carbon is actually stated. It says that improving agricultural practices in 25% of Australia’s agricultural land could result in up to 90 million tonnes a year and it says, “being drawn from the atmosphere”. Ninety million tonnes, that’s almost 20% of our annual. So that’s serious. Now, what does it mean: “drawing Co2 from the atmosphere?” Is this just about farmers managing their spent crops? Or is it about actively processing fossil fuel emissions and taking it in a truck to the farm? Angus Taylor: So, it is essentially photosynthesis; what photosynthesis does. And people understand it from high school science – takes Co2 and puts it into the plant and much of the organic Co2 remains in the plant afterwards. Now, farmers know how to do that. That’s what they do. Particularly on pastures. The big job of a farmer is to grow more pasture, and some of that pasture stays in the ground and some of it gets buried very deep, as much as a metre deep. So the job is to get more of that to happen. As I say, farmers already know a lot about how to do that. The great challenge is to measure it at low cost. Because if we can measure it at low cost, we can actually verify that it is happening. Farmers are paid for the work that they do, and we can improve the techniques and reduce the costs of storing that soil carbon in the soil. And traditionally, the way that we tested soil carbon, and we still do, is we put a probe a metre deep down into the ground and do it in lots and lots of areas, even in an individual paddock. And that gets expensive. But we also know that satellite imagery offers us the opportunity to dramatically reduce that cost if we can actually see from satellite imagery, that goes over from a regular basis, how much soil carbon is being reduced and how much is being stored in the soil. If we can get that technology really working – it already works – but really working as a way of measuring soil ... we can go down to $3 per hectare per year, which is what we’re targeting. And we see the opportunity here. They’re big numbers there. Ninety million tonnes a year is about 20% of our emissions. Because we have so much agricultural land in Australia relative to our population, it is a big number and it’s a big opportunity and that’s why we’re pursuing it. (That investment he was talking about was mostly solar and wind.) Question: Energy policy has probably been the single greatest policy failure over the last decade and that’s probably why no one has built anything, because they don’t know if things will change if [there’s a] change in government. You today are picking winners in the emerging technology space. As you said, you’re going to throw a ton of money behind the chosen technologies to the private sector to do the same. Why would someone look at that and with a change of government and work against that? Would you work constructively with the ALP in a proper bipartisan basis to ensure that some, if not all, would survive a change of government? If not we’ll be back to where we are now. Angus Taylor: There’s a couple of parts to your question. The first is, you made the statement that people haven’t built anything. Well, they have. They spent $9bn on energy generation in 2019 and we’re on track to a similar $9bn in energy generation this year. That’s 6.3 gigawatts a year in a grid of about 50 gigawatts. That’s not growing in demand. That’s an extraordinary investment. It’s completely unprecedented. Now, the challenge with it, and I’ve made this point in the speech, is it’s got to be balanced. So the private sector invests. We have to make sure that we have the right balance and the right technologies coming through, and of course, I made the point about hydrogen investment, and there’s other areas with very significant investment that we’ve seen in there. Carbon capture and storage. We’ve got the biggest carbon capture and storage project in the world in Australia. So the investment is happening. We have to make sure that it is balanced. We have to make sure that the signals are strong about that balance, and we’re sending very, very strong signals. As you said, with $18bn, that’s a strong signal to the private sector. Your point about picking winners: the nature of R and D portfolios is that you have to place bets. We’re placing a bet on a portfolio here. And that’s what companies do. That’s what nations do. That’s what universities do. That is how R and D investment works. It has to evolve, but as you said, it should evolve in a gradual way, in a very well-informed and well thought through way, which is why we’re locking in this advisory panel. The private sector can have confidence, whilst we’re in government, we will always maintain that principle of continuing to focus on those priority technologies that are going to bring down emissions. In terms of bipartisanship, we’ve laid our plan out here very, very carefully. I don’t know what Labor’s plans are. I don’t know what their target is for 2030. I don’t know how they’re going to achieve that target that they don’t have. They’re questions for them. Do we want to work with them to get this agenda implemented? Absolutely. And I think that there’s much in this for all of us to agree on. So we would very much like Labor to engage with us to deliver this agenda, and there will be opportunities through legislative changes which we’ve outlined here today for Labor to work with us to do exactly that. I’ll let Murph clear that one up: Question: We have no clarity on 2030. Could we get clarity on definitions. I can’t find in the road map any definition of low or green or clean technologies, ... What is it, the amount of abatement that the technologies drive? And leading from that question, how were the five priorities determined? Down the list, you’ve got technologies like generation enablers that drive renewables into the power grid. Energy efficiency which is a proven, cheap; abateful of fugitive methane emissions which, given the profile of Australia’s emissions, would seem a pressing priority right now. How did you determine the top five? Angus Taylor: Because they are the technologies that can move the dial in a significant way in reducing the emissions, helping to achieve the 2030 target and helping us to achieve reductions beyond 2030. Each one of them backs in technologies that play a significant role in the economy, whether it’s agriculture, whether it’s electricity, whether it’s manufacturing. If you look at aluminium – I don’t need to tell many in this audience, aluminium is one of our highest-emission industries. If we are to have an aluminium industry that succeeds into the future, we need to work out how to bring emissions down. So we’ve targeted those areas where we can really move the dial, but there are also those areas where Australia has natural advantage. Now we’ll deploy other technologies. You know, EVs are going to grow in Australia in the coming years and ... we’ve announced last week investment in over $70m in infrastructure support to enable that technology into Australia in a significant way – particularly for fleets, we’ll receive the first big opportunity. So there’s many other technologies that will play a role in this, but what we’ve done is pick the ones that can move the dial, where we have advantage, where we can build industries, where we can create jobs and drive investment – and we can, importantly. And this is a crucial point: where we can support a global outcome of emissions reduction while strengthening prosperity. And this is the great challenge that the world has to overcome. It’s not just an emissions reduction challenge. It’s an emissions reduction challenge that’s consistent with enabling countries, particularly in the developing world, to grow their prosperity and decarbonising, finding ways to reduce emissions in industries like agriculture, aluminium and steel, is absolutely crucial to achieving that. Q: That’s the five, but what’s the definition of green? Taylor: The definition: what will bring down, what will move the dial in bringing down our emissions. Q: So there isn’t a specific definition in terms of emissions intensity? Taylor: That’s pretty specific. Bringing down emissions is the goal here. And this is the point: questions are goal-orientated. We want to do stuff that works, do stuff where we can make a difference and bring emissions down, that’s the goal. That’s how the technologies were chosen. Question: Is that, in short, “trust us we are the government”? Angus Taylor: No, trust us we’re doing it. The whole point about what I’m talking about here is, we have a track record. We’re doing it, it’s building on our strengths and achievements. If you look at hydrogen, we’re already doing it. If you look at each of these technology areas, I can tell a story about Australia’s achievements to date, and why continuing to push down that path is a great prospect for this country. Not just for domestic emissions reduction, but for jobs, for growth, for export and for developing world-leading technologies. And we’ve picked those priority technologies on that basis. That was not clear. Question: I’m wondering about telling investors, now we’ve got both Germany and France investing huge amounts of money on hydrogen as part of their Covid recovery programs – 100bn euros in France’s case and 9bn euros in Germany. The problem, it strikes me, in a capital-constrained world, we’re going to be competing for that private sector money with countries like Germany and France and others. And to do that, we’re going to have to be really competitive and people have to be very confident about the outlook. And investors say that they need that emissions reduction target to know what the plan is. It’s fine to have these priorities, but they need to know what the plan is. So how do you reassure investors and drag that capital in, particularly when they’re investing so much more than Australia? Angus Taylor: Well, let’s be clear here: we have an emissions reduction target for 2030. It’s a 26% reduction on the baseline of 2005 levels, and we’ll meet and beat that. And we’ve done it before. We have form. We have the track record and we’ll do it again. But what we’ve also done here is made very clear where our technology priorities are, and we’re putting money where our mouth is – $18 bn of investment. You know, you take hydrogen, which you mentioned – we’ve already committed over $500m. We committed another $70m last week for a new hydrogen export hub. I’m sure that that won’t be the end of the investments. And that is a very significant amount for Australia. But if you look at Australia, as a smaller country than Germany or France, we have to focus on where we have an advantage. If I look at hydrogen, we are extraordinarily well positioned. Why? Because we’re one of the biggest energy exporters in the world. We’re the biggest LNG exporter in the world. We opened up the markets into Korea, Japan, China. It was Australia who did it. We led the way. And we’re the biggest in the world as a result. We can do exactly the same with hydrogen. And we’re saying to investors: we’re putting our money where our mouth is and we’re going hard. Now, we’re already seeing the results. If you take the La Trobe supply chain project – where we’re working through how best to transport hydrogen up into Asia, and north Asian countries want access to hydrogen – we’ve invested $50m. The total investment in that is times 10, it’s over $500m – $500m. Now, if we can get times 10, I can tell you, $18bn becomes a very, very big number. We’re not planning on times 10 on every project, but we will see projects like that. And hydrogen is one of those areas where we’re signalling very strongly to the private sector: come with us, invest and we see the opportunity. I’m very confident. Others see the opportunity. We’ve had a phenomenal response to that, which is running on R and D investment in hydrogen. And these other areas of technology that I’ve described, I am very confident that the private sector will follow the very strong signals we’re sending. OK, we get to the questions for Angus Taylor: Question: You’ve outlined a plan that will basically guide $18bn in taxpayer money pouring into energy. It’s a huge amount of money. But it’s not clear to me what the benchmark is for success. There’s no net-zero target by 2050, so taxpayers are being asked to accept $18bn in outlay without a benchmark that they can use to tell whether you succeed at your job or not. Now, globally, you have a 2030 target. You say you’re reaching it in a canter. But globally, talks are moving ahead of that. We’re going to see at the United Nations summits in the future, talk about 2035, talk about 2040. Now, if, as you say, you’re getting to 2030 in a canter, and if, as you say, you have the good plan to spend $18bn, isn’t it now time for you to say what your 2035 or 2040 target is, and to actually come clean with the Australian voters now about the fact that you’ll have one and how ambitious you can be with it? Taylor: Well, we’re very clear with the Australian voters. And you know, I’d highlight the fact that the Opposition isn’t. We have a very clear 2030 target. If we look at the Paris agreement, the naturally determined contributions are the 2030 target. In a few years’ time, they will extend out to 2035 – that’s how the Paris agreement works. And we’re unambiguous in seeking to not just meet that but to beat it. Just as we’ve met and beaten our 2020 target, despite much scepticism about whether we would. To put this in perspective – in 2013, when Labor was still in government, they made a forecast for emissions in 2020 that was 100 million tonnes higher than what we’ll achieve – almost 20% higher than what we’ll achieve, and that was with a carbon tax. What we’ve achieved in the last 20 years, we’ll do again. We’ll meet and beat the target and create a platform for emissions targets well beyond 2030. The goals are clear. We have to bring those technologies that can really move the dial into parity with the high-emitting alternatives. That way, it’s just straight economics. We will ensure that we have a strong economy, strong job growth, strong there. Q: When will you then have a 2035 target? Taylor: As it’s required by the Paris agreement – in a couple of years’ time, we will have to extend. Q: Why not before the next election? Taylor: It keeps extending out every few years and that’s the way that it will continue on. But the crucial point here is that you’ve got to focus on the stuff you can do today that works, that we can do now, to set yourself up for that emissions reduction trajectory – not just through to 2030, which we’ll meet and beat, but beyond. And that’s exactly what we’re describing today. Q: Why not before the next election? Why won’t you tell the voters what the 2035 target is? Taylor: We’ll keep telling voters about what we’re doing and how well we’re doing many times between now and the next election. As you say, I note that the opposition doesn’t have a 2030 target. That is the primary target of the Paris agreement. Let’s be clear: that is what we have to focus on. We have to meet and beat that and we have to set ourselves up. Not just in Australia. The Paris agreement is about global outcomes. And we have to set ourselves up to achieve those global outcomes. Not just through to 2030 but beyond. And technology is the key. We have had “partisanise” from Scott Morrison, now we have “enablement” from Angus Taylor: Last week, you saw our R and D investment framework in action with $1.9bn including baseline funding. The technology investment fund that will support green steel, green aluminium and carbon. The future fuels fund that supports EVs, high general in a technology-future approach to transport. Our first hydrogen export hub. Investment to scale carbon capture and storage and investment in energy efficiency and outcomes. Our second, alongside investment, we have a legislative lever that is about flexibility and accountability. We’ve already announced legislative reforms to the mandates of Arena and CFC. These reforms will give their boards the flexibility to respond to our technology priorities. We don’t currently have that. Our agencies are restricted by legislation and regulation to invest in the new technologies of 2010, not the emerging technologies of 2020. These reforms will enable them to support the technologies that reduce emissions across all sectors of our economy. On an annual basis, we’ll review legislation that’s a barrier to achieving our stretch goals. We’ll table the low-emissions technology statement in parliament each year. Future statements will highlight the impact it is having, the progress against stretch goals and offer a frank assessment of legislative and regulatory barriers. Our third: we have a regulatory lever that’s about enablement. We’ll provide just over $40m to the clean energy regulator to take responsibility for developing and streamlining emissions reductions fund methods. The regulator already has a target of halving the time it takes to develop new methods and will work closely with industry in doing so. We won’t mandate the deployment of technologies. We’ve seen the unintended consequences of mandated volume targets for specific technologies and we won’t repeat that. But our regulatory changes will be focused on removing barriers to deployment of these priority technologies. And the final leaver is international engagement and collaboration. And here is why he thinks Australia is doing so well (which it is, if you consider all the accounting tricks Australia is deploying to get to its figures). Angus Taylor: To that end, we have four core principles behind our work. The first: a relentless focus on it. The second: the deployment on activity, not taxes. Third: respect for consumer choice. And fourth: a goal to maintain a balance of fuel and technology sources. We need more horses in the race, not less. Angus Taylor has laid out the government’s main point when it comes to its energy policy: In emissions reduction, it’s the race for cost-effective, low and negative cost reductions to strengthen our economy, not weaken it. That’s why the government has undertaken to develop, fund and drive a low-emissions technology road map. History has also shown us that you don’t tax your way out of a challenge like this. Let’s be clear: there are only two ways to suppress emissions. Either through some form of taxation, or you improve the activities. There is no third way. Australia can’t and shouldn’t damage its economy to reduce emissions. We forget that when developing countries ... were asked to sacrifice for the environment, they’ve typically prioritised prosperity. That was the lesson of Copenhagen. We can’t ask them to make the trade-off. We should also remember the global emissions reduction is the ultimate goal here, with the Paris agreement seeking to achieve net zero in this century for the globe, or preferably sooner. Now, the only pathway to global emissions reduction while strengthening prosperity is through developing low-emissions technologies at lower cost than higher-emitting alternatives. Angus Taylor has started his address to the press club. Murph is there, so we will bring you regular reports. Melbourne’s weather has now impacted testing sites. From Victoria Health: Two outer eastern suburbs coronavirus testing sites have been closed today due to high winds. The drive-through sites at Casey Fields and Pakenham recreation reserve are open marquees, with potential hazards due to wind dislodging the structures and the problems of staff trying to take down written details in the open. There are alternative sites nearby for people seeking a test. The walk-through site at Clyde recreation reserve football pavilion in Pattersons Rd, Clyde, is open daily from 9am to 4pm. A walk-through site at 7 Gibb St, Berwick, is open from 9.30am to 4pm, and a drive-through site at 20 Woods St, Beaconsfield, is open from 8am to 5pm. Further details on other available coronavirus (Covid-19) testing site locations can be found on the testing site map at www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/where-get-tested-covid-19 The Victorian hotel quarantine inquiry has been hearing today from the secretary of the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions, Simon Phemister. It was his department that was tasked with recruiting security firms for the hotel quarantine inquiry. Phemister told the inquiry it was not until after the 4.30pm state control centre meeting on 27 March that his department began recruiting security firms. And although the department bears operational responsibility for the use of security guards, Phemister said it was not his decision to use security guards for hotels. Phemister’s submission to the inquiry states: DJPR went into the first SCC meeting not knowing whether, and to what extent, private security would be required at hotels, and emerged with a direction: to engage private security to act as frontline security at quarantine hotels. Phemister, as with every other witness before the inquiry so far, said he was unaware of who made the decision. Victoria police has denied that former chief commissioner Graham Ashton’s preference for security expressed in the SCC meeting led to the decision. A late-night WhatsApp group chat between Victorian government officials on the day hotel quarantine was announced revealed concern about recruiting security firms to guard returned travellers. The Covid committee is hearing some very depressing news on how this pandemic has impacted women: NSW has reported two new cases of Covid today, but both are in hotel quarantine. From NSW Health: There were 7,616 tests reported in the 24-hour reporting period, compared with 7,765 in the previous 24 hours. Testing numbers have declined in recent weeks. NSW Health is appealing to the community to come forward for testing right away if you have a runny nose or scratchy throat, cough, fever or other symptoms that could be Covid-19. If people don’t come forward and get tested, we can’t keep the pandemic at bay. We would like to see testing levels above 20,000 as achieved last week, particularly in south-western Sydney, and ahead of school holidays. For the sake of your friends and family, get a test. And if symptoms recur even a few days later, test again. It’s free. While there were no locally acquired cases recorded in the past 24 hours, the virus is likely still circulating and it is imperative anyone displaying mild symptoms get tested immediately and not delay their test. NSW Health has been and continues to strongly encourage people to wear masks when unable to physically distance, particularly in indoor settings and on public transport, to keep everyone safe. As previously advised, when taking taxis or rideshare commuters should sit in the back and wear a mask. South Australia will allow people from New South Wales to enter the state from Thursday on the condition there is no further community transmission that occurs in NSW “between now and midnight tonight”. The premier, Steven Marshall, acknowledged the case of a taxi driver who drove across Sydney over a span of 11 days while believed to be infectious, but said health officials had made the decision to remove the self-isolation requirement based on health advice received this morning. Anyone entering SA from NSW up until midnight tomorrow night will still need to self-isolate for 14 days. On Tuesday morning, NSW Health revealed two new cases in the state, both in hotel quarantine, suggesting that the cases will not impact SA’s decision. Marshall said: We are now in a position to advise the people of South Australia that, subject to no community transmission occurring in New South Wales between now and midnight tonight, we will reopen the border with NSW from midnight tomorrow. So that means that people from NSW wanting to come into SA from Thursday onwards will be able to do that without doing the 14 days of self-isolation. This will be a massive, massive relief for people who have been dislocated from friends, from family, from business opportunities. The Australian bourse has fallen 0.85% this morning after overseas markets tumbled overnight. Markets in both Europe and the US were down by more than 3% on Monday after fears of a new coronavirus wave smashed travel and tourism stocks and reports of trillions of dollars in suspect transfers took a chunk out of the banks. In Germany, home to the troubled banking giant Deutsche Bank, the Dax index plunged 4.4%. On the ASX this morning, the UK lender Virgin Money was the biggest loser among top 200 stocks, falling by 5.5% shortly after the market opened. News Corp was the second biggest loser, shedding 4.5%. That’s about it for the Victorian press conference today. Let’s catch up on what happened in that hour in other areas. That then leads to this exchange: Q: Would you wreck or jeopardise the economy of the state to save lives? Daniel Andrews: Well, that’s a choice that we have made as a national cabinet from day one. Q: [That doesn’t answer the question.] Andrews: Well, that’s the choice the national cabinet has made from day one. Q: If you would answer that ... Andrews: How I choose to answer your questions is, with respect, a matter for me. And the national cabinet has made a decision that instead of allowing this virus to spread throughout the entire Australian community, much like it is in Europe, killing many tens of thousands of people, we would fix the health problem first, and then we would all, in a unified way, set about repairing the economic damage this pandemic has done. No one is denying that. That is a feature of this virus. That’s perhaps another wicked part of the virus. You can do very little for livelihoods until you prioritise saving lives and defeating this virus. That’s the path we’re on. Six weeks ago there were 725 cases – 725 cases. Today we are at a much lower number. We can be pleased that this strategy is working and the only steps to take, the only steps to take, are safe and steady ones. Yes, we acknowledge there is significant economic impact but we just can’t get to repairing that. We can’t repair that in a meaningful and lasting way until we have dealt with the health challenge. This is a public health emergency. It’s called that for a reason. And that’s what is driving all of our response. There is an economic crisis out there as well, of course. But you have got to deal with the health one first. There is a back and forth about the economy, and when Victoria opens up, and who is responsible for the federal government subsidies: That ends with this answer from Daniel Andrews: We know and understand there is very significant economic damage and financial hardship and pain as a result of this global pandemic. However, if you start trying to use economics to solve a health problem, it won’t work. If we could do the economic repair first and deal with the virus later, then that would be a choice we would probably make. But this is essentially – ought we be opening up faster because jobkeeper is going to be reduced? The relevant factor here is that’s not unimportant. It’s not – but it’s not a health issue. The virus has no awareness of the level of jobkeeper. It will continue to spread. It will continue to spread and it will continue to infect people, and hold us back from opening up, the longer we fail, if we were to fail, to focus on the health issue. That’s what we are focused on. But beyond that, though, there have been substantial financial supports providing to business – record levels of support there. Are substantial boosts in funding for a whole range of services that are critically important at the moment, whether it be mental health support, family violence support, homelessness support – the list goes on and on. We will have a budget later this year that will detail a massive program of investment and support for jobs, for livelihoods, for profitability, for confidence, for infrastructure, large and small, all of those things will be a massive feature. Indeed, there is a federal budget very soon. And I would, from my conversations with the prime minister, I would anticipate that there will be very significant investment – very significant investment – in that budget. Victoria will benefit from that. Just as Victoria will benefit from us using the state’s balance sheet in our budget and the state’s budget to protect household budgets. Daniel Andrews finishes that answer with: I wish I could provide an absolutely definitive answer today what was going to happen, you know, very, very soon. That is not the nature of this thing. There is many wicked thing to this virus. The infectivity, the fact it is silent, very, very mild symptoms that is when you are most infectious. The fact that there is that two-week lag, where decisions today – you don’t see what the impact is for couple of weeks. All those things. Then there’s the terrible tragedy of a mortality rate that far exceeds the seasonal flu. Is there a chance regional Victoria could take its own steps towards Covid-normal, without Melbourne doing the same? (under the roadmap, it’s both at the same time). Daniel Andrews: I couldn’t rule that out. Because we will be based on evidence and data … The point I would make to you is that – getting the whole state to a unified position is important. There is movement. There are contacts of Melbourne who live in regional Victoria, close contacts – active cases. Of course, not everyone who is asymptomatic gets tested. There will be more cases than we think. That is the nature of the virus. Getting everybody on equality footing is important. But at the same time, I think what we have shown in regional Victoria, taking two steps and being at step three, when –which is a different position to metropolitan Melbourne – we are prepared to have the rules in regional Victoria reflect the way the virus is actually presenting in regional Victoria. I’m not making announcements today about that. But we will always be guided by the data. And we will always be guided by the science of it. And what’s actually coming through. And what we think is safe. So we have got regional Victoria in a different place now. That is a testament to how hard regional Victorians have worked. But to be honest, I cannot today. I cannot today confirm for you the announcements I will make on Sunday. I’m not in a position – I think you’d understand – not in a position to be able to announce what will be today what will be decided and announced toward the end of October. I simply don’t have enough data. I would be speculating. It’s not safe to do that. You have got to be – you have got to be guided by the science of this. Back to Victoria, questions have turned to how NSW is handling the pandemic. Daniel Andrews: It is very important to acknowledge that New South Wales and Victoria, from an epidemiological point of view, are in vastly different places. New South Wales has not had the amount of community transmission that Victoria has. New South Wales has not had the extent of the [infections] between large households and high-risk workplaces. The virus presented differently. Some community seeding, some chains of transmission, are different in Victoria – certainly in metro Melbourne – different than what occurred in Sydney. I’m not for a moment making the point that Sydney’s job has been easy. They’re doing a good job. We’re doing ... the best we possibly can to drive numbers down. That’s the only way you will keep them low, to get them low. But we have always said – we have always said – that data trumps any assumption. The actuals always beat the assumptions. And that’s why modelling gets rerun. That’s why there is a constantly evolving picture where we add in what’s actually occurred to replace some of the well-founded but there’s always – it is always speculative, because they are by their nature – they are not facts, they’re our best estimate of what will occur. There is more than a thousand of them gone into this model. Some of those are absolutely replaced by the actuals. The South Australian committee dealing with the state’s Covid response has met and decided to open its border with NSW from Thursday. Yesterday Steven Marshall had said he was watching the Sydney taxi driver case – but they must be assured it is all cool beans. Will some people only get 24 hours notice that they can open their business? Daniel Andrews: We’re in deep conversations, for instance, with supermarkets, deep conversations and ongoing conversations with the meat processing industries. Some restrictions are not necessarily apparent to customers or to the general public. So they’re not operating nowhere near 100%. Some are 66%. We are in conversations with them. There are different options. What we have spoken to them, tried to share, is a sense of we will have to pick one of these options. They know and understand and can plan accordingly for what each option means. Which one we choose in each of those sectors will be a product of numbers, as they present throughout the week. But also the narrative that sits behind the numbers. Is it a contained case? A mystery case? How many cases are there? All of those things. If I can call Sunday right now, I will. But I can’t. I have to wait and see what the data yells us over the rest of the week. Victorians can be confident the strategy is working, the numbers are coming down, and I think we are ahead of where we thought we would be. Q: Is there any more detail about who might be able to open come Sunday? Daniel Andrews: I don’t want to be coy in any way. Sunday is some days off. That isn’t settled. That is a matter that will be informed by the data I have just reported, plus tomorrow’s numbers, and so on and so forth. We will have – accompanying that, on every conceivable platform – we will have as much information out there as possible. If there is any specific questions you want us to chase up, I am happy to do that. We can chase up specific issues. Back to the roadmap. Q: In regards to the roadmap, why is it that your contact tracing teams can’t handle more than the five cases? Why is that number so low? Daniel Andrews: I don’t accept your conclusion. That’s not what the roadmap says at all. It is, however, I think a statement of logic that unless you get numbers low, you have very little chance to keep them low. That’s the experience if other states. It’s the experience, sadly, the other end of that, in so many countries around the world. While we’re reporting our last four days, 21, 14, 11, 28, that’s less than 20. That is our four-day average. Victorians can be optimistic that the strategy is working. We’re chasing an average of 30. We have still got the rest of the week to go and we’re almost at that now. All things being equal we are going to meet the target. We will be able to stake some steps – albeit cautious steps – on Sunday. As for how October unfold will have more to say as data comes in, as assumptions are replaced by data. Things that have happened. Case numbers. And the narrative that sits behind it. Our contact tracing meets all benchmarks and exceeds some of them … Other states will be implementing many of the changes that we have made. So I don’t accept the conclusion you have drawn. Daniel Andrews will now appear at the hotel quarantine inquiry on Friday (he was slated to appear tomorrow). He was asked a little earlier in this press conference if he had heard of any delays for witnesses appearing and whether he would be appearing tomorrow and said he had been notified of a different date: That’s entirely a matter nor the inquiry. It’s not for me to make announcements about their schedule … It’s not for me to make announcements. I’ll be appearing as the board pleases and that’s a matter for the board. He’ll now be appearing at 2.15 on Friday and says he had no input on when he would appear: It’s entirely a matter for the board. They have made a decision. They’re running a schedule. They’re hearing from witnesses. They will make their arrangements. Why are gyms still closed? Prof Allen Cheng: We are meeting with representatives from the gym industry. I would point out, gyms are relatively high- risk. There have been lots of outbreaks across the world, in Victoria, even despite gyms being closed. Obviously recently. We had an outbreak that had 27 cases linked to it. In New South Wales, even with their relatively low numbers of community cases, gyms have featured prominently in their outbreaks. So, it is unfortunately a high risk – relatively high-risk setting. That said, there are things that can be done. So, particularly outdoor settings are things that – is much safer. So, for example, there’s a plan for – you know, boot camps that can be done outside, in a more safe environment to be done. The deputy CHO, Prof Allen Cheng, is up now, talking about the infection numbers and why, given that infection numbers are down in regional Victoria, the regions have to wait until the whole state is under control before moving to Covid-normal. The answer is because there are still close contacts in regional Victoria: I haven’t got the exact figure. Of those 1,173 close contacts, some of those are in regional Victoria. And there is always the possible that people move across from metropolitan Melbourne to regional Victoria for all sorts of legitimate reasons, working and so on. So, it is a cautious approach to make sure that we don’t seed regional Victoria. And just as an example, Colac – this is going become a number of weeks ago now – one case resulted in more than 30 secondary cases at that time. Even under those settings. So, it’s very important that we make sure that we have a very quick response to anything that happens out there, but there is always the potential that regional Victoria will be seeded. That is – you know, important to just keep that in mind. Back in August, this is what Daniel Andrews told a parliamentary committee: I don‘t believe ADF support was on offer. It’s been provided in limited circumstances in New South Wales, not to provide security as such but to provide transportation from the airport to hotels. I think it is fundamentally incorrect to assert that there was hundreds of ADF staff on offer and somehow someone said no. That’s not, in my judgment, accurate. Then we get to this exchange, over comments Daniel Andrews has previously made on the ADF offer for support for Victoria’s hotel quarantine program. Andrews does not want to repeat his statement. I imagine because it was carefully worded at the time for a reason, and he probably can’t remember those exact words. Q: Do you stand by your statement that the ADF never made [an offer of] support [for hotel quarantine]? Andrews: That’s not exactly the statement that I have made. But I can confirm if you the statements I have made I stand by. Q: Can you clarify those again for us on the record? Andrews: No, I will not be doing that, as I have made very clear to you ... Q: Just to refresh everyone’s memory before ... Andrews: No, because where you stopped in your question, you kind of answered your question. Given you’re about to – that’s the key point. I’m about to speak to the inquiry. Q: On the record. Let’s ... Andrews: It’s already on the record. I have sufficient confidence in your research skills, you’ll be able to go and look – listen, you and I both know what I have said. I’m not going to speculate on what I might or might not say. Q: I’m trying to get clarification on your position once and for all before we go ... Andrews: Everyone gets a go. You can all have a go at once if you like. That’s not the way this normally works. I am not going to speculate about what I’ll be asked or the answers I’ll provide later in the week. That’s the first point. On the second point – my public comments are on the record and I stand by them and I am not going to run through them from A to Z today. I’m not doing that. Q: From one of those comments you told the parliamentary accounts committee that it was fundamentally incorrect to assert that ADF was on offer. So do you now know that – do you now know given the evidence that’s come before the inquiry that to be an incorrect statement in … Andrews: No, I’m not making that judgment at all. I made comments on these matters. Q: What allows you to make that judgment? Andrews: I made comments on the matters and I stand by the comments I made and, again, I’m not interested in adding to those comments. Q: If the inquiry doesn’t determine who hired the private security, has it done its job? Daniel Andrews: You’re asking me to predict or forecast. That’s entirely an hypothetical matter ... You’re asking me to comment on what might be my response if it did happen. That the definition of any fair-minded definition of what hypothetical is. I’m not criticising you for asking the question, I’m saying it is a hypothetical matter and all of those matters can be settled one way or the other when the final report is handed up and then we can have a discussion then. Q: How important is accountability in your view, because the public feels there is none? Andrews: Well, having established an inquiry to get answers that are necessary, I think my views on that are very well known. Q: If the inquiry is not delivering answers? Andrews: You’re drawing a conclusion there which I don’t think is necessarily a fair one. We can leave that debate to one side – the inquiry is not finished. So trying to predict or hypothesise or opine what will be at the end of the process, I don’t think is a helpful process. It is speculation and nothing more than that. Q: [There does seem to be] a lot of memory loss, doesn’t there? Andrews: You’re free to draw any conclusions you want to. But don’t expect me to provide ... the process is not finished. When the process is finished, we’ll be able to speak not about what might happen, but what indeed has happened and that I think is a much more productive discussion. That will be a conversation based in fact and finding rather than the obvious speculation that you’re inviting me and, again, you’re entitled to do that and I’m also equally entitled to say that’s not something I’m going to get into. Q: Will your memory be as vague tomorrow as your bureaucrats seem to have been? Andrews: You can make judgments about the memories of others. When I’ll appear before the inquiry I’ll answer the questions as honestly, frankly, clearly, directly as possible. Q: There has been a lot of questions and top bureaucrats seem to have a “I don’t recall” response. Do you think that it is OK for people like Chris Eccles to not really say that they remember what happened in decisions? For example, hiring thousands of people worth of millions of dollars and how that happened? Have you got confidence, if no one is being held accountable? Daniel Andrews: The inquiry has not concluded its work and the answers that we need are answers we don’t have is exactly why the inquiry set up. Not for the avoidance of those answers but to get them. Obvious, the fullest and most detailed way in which we’ll get those answers is when the inquiry has concluded its work. Q: Do you expect at the conclusion of the inquiry Victorians will actually know who was responsible for those crucial decisions? So far in the inquiry, we have just heard a lot of people saying it wasn’t me? Andrews: My only expectation is this the inquiry will do its work without fear or favour. As to what’s in their report, what findings they make, that’s entirely a matter for them. And the final report is still some way off. But I’m very confident that they’re thoroughly examining all the issues they believe are relevant and set out in the terms of reference. Daniel Andrews is then asked about Chris Eccles, his department head, being “unaware” of who decided to use security guards in hotel quarantine: Andrews: As I said consistently there’s a process going on at the moment. It’s important that process runs to its logical conclusion and that will be findings, guidance, all sorts of material that will come out of that, they’ll make recommendations, I would think, about what next steps should be and I’ll leave it to the inquiry which I’m assisting later this week to do that important work. Q: Will you answer those questions tomorrow if asked? Andrews: Well, what I’m asked is a matter for counsel assisting. I can confirm to you that I’ll be truthful. Absolutely honest and direct. Q: Obviously you’re not answering the question in this forum. Andrews: This is not the forum to do it, with the greatest of respect. There’s a process going on and I’ll be part of that process. And it is not appropriate for me to be essentially duplicating that process from this podium. Daniel Andrews is asked about comments from the University of Melbourne professor Tony Blakely, who helped shape the Victorian modelling, about taking “cautious” steps to lifting restrictions (as well as the calls from federal government MPs to lift restrictions): He remains someone who is advising the government but today’s not the day to be announcing what would be occurring in October because we have many days to go where we need to drive these case numbers down. In terms of the federal government, our partnership is a strong one. It’s very important that we’re not – any of us – playing politics with these things. It’s all about making sure we defeat this virus and popularity or pride or politics is not a vaccine against this virus. Only getting the job done with an absolute determination to make sure that everything that every Victorian has given, everything that every Victorian has done, must count for something. And if we don’t do this properly, if we open too much too soon, as many other experts today have spoken about, then we will be pinballing in and out of restrictions all through 2021. I don’t want that. We’re going to do everything we can to avoid that. Victoria will spend an additional $30m on aged care, updating facilities. There are 32 active cases in Victoria’s aged care facilities. There are four cases in NDIS settings. There are 83 Victorians in hospital with Covid – eight are in intensive care and five of those people are on a ventilator. Daniel Andrews says testing rates increased in the last 24 hours, which is a good thing – there were 11,123 tests, which, for a Sunday, is great news. Andrews: If I can just pause on that point for a moment – that for a Sunday, and these will be almost exclusively from Sunday – is a result that is higher than recent weekends that we have seen. So I want to thank each and every one of those 11,123 Victorians who on Sunday got and get tested just as we asked them to do. The key point here is, if you got any symptoms, any symptoms whatsoever, please don’t put off going and getting a test. Don’t wait an hour, don’t wait a day, please go and get tested as soon as you possibly can. It’s a simple thing but a massive contribution to our fight against this virus. I have made this point a few times but I want to make it again – extra positive cases because of a higher testing rate will not hold us back from taking safe and steady next steps. But a low testing rate could – if authorities aren’t confident they are receiving enough data about how much virus is still in the community – that could be enough to hold back the lifting of restrictions. OK, six of Victoria’s 28 cases are under investigation (mystery cases, usually meaning community transmission). All three people who died – a woman in her 70s, a woman in her 90s and a woman in her 100s – were linked to aged care. Daniel Andrews is about to stand up for his 82nd consecutive press conference. Dr Jeannette Young says she is watching the case of the NSW taxi driver to see whether that has spread the virus within the Sydney community, before she makes any decisions about opening the border to the rest of NSW. That is also the line South Australia was taking yesterday. Queensland is about to enter its caretaker mode – the election will be held on 31 October, but that won’t impact Young’s decision-making too much. Under the Queensland Public Health Act, the CHO is the designated decision-maker, not the executive. (Which is different to other states, hence some of the confusion when Young was making the decisions on quarantine and exemptions, not the premier.) Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says the low number of cases north of Sydney has given her the confidence to extend the border zone into northern NSW. Queensland police are also investigating a man from Victoria who has popped up in Townsville. He has been charged for breaching restrictions and has a date with a Townsville magistrate. (There is no suggestion he has Covid) So, recapping, from 1 October, at 1am, if there are no changes or outbreaks, the Queensland border zone will include: Byron Shire Ballina Shire Lismore Council Richmond Valley Council Glen Innes Shire Queensland is adding five new areas in northern NSW to its border zone, which means people can travel between the areas – which includes Byron Bay – without quarantining. You’ll still need a border pass though. That will come into effect on 1 October (all going well). Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid - I think that makes about 11 days since the last community transmission case was reported A thought to keep in mind ahead of Angus Taylor’s energy policy ‘roadmap’ speech today: So what is the all-important rolling 14 day averages? For 8 Sep – 21 Sep 2020: Metropolitan Melbourne Total cases: 459 Average per day: 32.8 Regional Victoria Total cases: 23 Average per day: 1.6 Overseas, interstate or no fixed address Total cases: 2 Average per day: 0.1 Total cases: 485 Average per day: 34.6 Daniel Andrews will hold his press conference at 10am today. Victoria health has reported the data collected over the last 24 hours: The Senate committee looking at the government’s Covid response is meeting today. On the agenda: how the pandemic has impacted women. If my eye twitch is anything to go by, it hasn’t been the best of times, let’s put it that way. We knew this from the Australian Bureau of Statistics data, but it is worth pointing out again, especially in light of the tax cuts which are about to be brought forward. We, on the whole, are not spending any extra money we get, we are saving it. Which is not great in a capitalist system, because you know, money has to keep flowing to keep those wheels greased. But you know who does keep money pumping in the economy, on local goods and services, even in a recession? Low-income earners. That’s the reason the government gave two lots of $750 payments, as well as boosted the unemployment payment with a supplement payment. And now that supplement has been cut. Anyway, here is what IbisWorld, who are paid to watch these trends had to say this morning: The savings rate among Australian households has surged in 2020, as a collapse in consumer sentiment has driven consumers to retain cash and cut back on retail spending. In 2019-20, household savings as a share of gross disposable income reached a high of 7.9%, relative to only 2.7% in the prior year. At the same time, Australian household indebtedness is among the highest in the world, with the ratio of household debt to assets expected to surge in 2020-21, to total 21.1%. Several factors have contributed to the increased savings rate of households. “The largest component of household expenditure is rent and other housing costs such as mortgages. Rent and mortgage relief provided by landlords and banks since April 2020 has constrained spending in this area, which accounts for 20% of total household spending,” said IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst, Matthew Reeves. Spending on recreation and culture declined by 15.7%, as Covid-19 restrictions have forced event cancellations and forced consumers to remain at home. Spending on health also declined by 20.2%, as people avoided medical premises for fear of infection. State and territory governments have also heavily restricted the ability of hospitals to carry out elective surgeries. To be fair, the government do seem to want to announce something in this space – Scott Morrison tried multiple times, almost defying the Speaker’s ruling, to get out “good news” in response to an unrelated question in question time last month, but there has been no actual announcement as yet. Pension rates have not increased with indexation, because the economy is in recession – there is no indexation increase. Bill Shorten and colleagues want you to know what that will mean for people on the disability pension: On Sunday, for the first time in 23 years, the pension was not indexed. The pension is typically indexed twice a year on 20 March and 20 September. The freeze will impact over 754,000 disability support pensioners and almost 295,000 carers: In New South Wales – over 239,000 DSP pensioners and over 108,000 carers; In Victoria – almost 184,000 DSP pensioners and over 72,000 carers; In Queensland – over 158,000 DSP pensioners and over 59,000 carers; In South Australia – over 66,000 DSP pensioners and almost 23,000 carers; In Western Australia – almost 57,000 DSP pensioners and almost 19,000 carers; In Tasmania – over 27,000 DSP pensioners and over 9,000 carers; In the Northern Territory – over 8,000 DSP pensioners and over 1,800 carers; In the Australian Capital Territory – over 8,400 DSP pensioners and almost 1,800 carers. We are going to get the payroll figures today. But if you are still trying to make sense of the August unemployment figures, which showed an improvement, despite, you know, a pandemic, Greg Jericho helps explain what happened: By this time yesterday, Victoria Health had released the daily tally of Covid-19 cases. I wouldn’t start worrying just yet though – if we don’t know by 9am, something is up. But it usually takes a bit of time to collate all the data. The Newspoll, first published in the Australian, has also shown a majority of Queensland voters – 68% – think Annastacia Palaszczuk has managed the virus response well. It also shows 53% agree with the border closure. The Queensland election will be held in 39 days. You can also listen to our Full Story podcast today, where Guardian Australia’s Queensland correspondent Ben Smee outlines the potential pitfalls of running a presidential-style campaign during a pandemic. There are a lot of deadlines coming up at the end of the year, when it comes to government subsidy programs running out – including the Covid supplement for the unemployment payment. That supplement gets cut at the end of this week – losing it altogether would be a blow not many people will recover from. Labor’s Jason Clare and Kristy McBain want the home-building subsidy deadline extended for people who lost their homes in last summer’s bushfires: At least 750 families in Eden-Monaro had their homes burn down over summer. Those that can’t sign a contract for the rebuild by December 31 will not be able to access the $25,000 homebuilder grant. “If anyone deserves help to rebuild, it’s people who had their homes burn down,” Clare said. “We’ve had feedback from a number of local people keen to access the homebuilder scheme that the prime minister trumpeted during the byelection,” McBain added. “The timelines around accessing these funds are just too tight for people rebuilding their homes and lives.” And you can catch up on what has happened this week at the Victorian hotel inquiry, with Josh Taylor’s report here: Guardian Australia’s political editor Katharine Murphy has the latest on the Essential poll (you know the drill). Australians are sceptical that bringing forward tax cuts in the October budget will stimulate the economy, while two-thirds of voters would prefer the Morrison government to support renewables rather than new gas plants, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. While voters in the survey continue to give the prime minister the thumbs up for his management of the pandemic, there is less enthusiasm for the general direction of the Coalition’s much-vaunted “gas-led recovery”, or for bringing forward tax cuts that benefit high-income earners. According to the latest survey of 1,081 respondents, 61% of the Guardian Essential sample rates Scott Morrison’s handling of the coronavirus crisis as very good or quite good, which is up from 59% in the previous survey. But only one in five people (21%) believe that tax cuts for higher income earners will be very effective as economic stimulus. A further 41% says the strategy will be moderately effective while 38% says it won’t be effective at all. It’s Gladys Berejiklian’s birthday today. The NSW premier received an early birthday present yesterday, when a Nationals MP quit the party and joined the Liberals. I hope she grabs an extra Cheds in celebration. While New South Wales authorities keep a watchful eye on any cases linked to a taxi driver who worked while infectious with Covid, Victorian authorities are still working their way through the hotel quarantine inquiry. The Victorian health boss, Kym Peake will front the inquiry today. The main event in that inquiry though, will come tomorrow, when premier Daniel Andrews will appear. Victoria has had two days of case numbers in the 10s, which is excellent news given where we were, but the number of community transmissions is still high enough to create cause for concern. The latest Newspoll (usual poll caveat etc, etc) has Andrews approval rating for handling the crisis up by five points to 62%. We should have the latest case numbers soon, as well as the news as it happens, from the hotel quarantine inquiry. In political news, Angus Taylor is at the press club, talking gas. We’ll have that for you too. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day.

His brand of environmentalism was driven by his socialist principles. He was international in outlook, pragmatic about what could be achieved politically, and technologically optimistic. He was successful as a leader, first in government and then outside it. Heading Greenpeace from 2001 until 2006 was Stephen’s most public-facing role, at a time when the organisation was at its noisiest. In 2005 he was arrested during direct action at Range Rover’s SUV plant in Solihull. Greenpeace planted a flag subverting the company’s logo and proclaiming “Land Rover: Climate Criminals”. Stephen was proud of this act of civil disobedience and a framed image of his arrest adorned his wall. But his strength as an environmentalist – his ability to question perceived wisdoms, his intellectual curiosity and his desire to come up with a nuanced solution – did not always sit well with Greenpeace’s opposition to entire sectors or technologies. Stephen was uncomfortable with the reliance on scare tactics used to gain attention, rather than putting forward a positive vision for sustainability. He was proud that during his tenure Greenpeace played a critical role in the birth of the offshore wind industry in the UK. In later years, he became best-known for breaking with positions he had held in Greenpeace. Stephen argued that since the principal problems with nuclear power were nuclear waste and weapons proliferation, the solution was advanced reactors that could mitigate these. In a similar spirit, he argued that genetically modified organisms should not be rejected en masse – some genetic alterations to crop or bacteria were benign and would lead to environmental improvement and better food security. These stances won Stephen many new supporters, but hurt relationships with some of his environmentalist peers and friends. He made these changes based on principles he always held dear, inspired by the urgent need to prevent climate change. He was born in Baghdad, the son of Sonia and Gordon Tindale. His father worked for the British Council and Stephen’s early childhood was spent in the Middle East and Africa. He went to the Leys school in Cambridge and studied philosophy, politics and economics at St Anne’s College, Oxford, then took a master’s in politics and administration at Birkbeck College London. He joined the Foreign Office in 1986, but gave up the security and prestige of this job to work on environmental issues. He worked for Friends of the Earth and at the Fabian Society, led the energy team at the Institute for Public Policy Research (1994-96), and was director of the Green Alliance (1996-97). Many of his colleagues went on to become government ministers in the Blair-Brown era. This creative period incubated much of the Labour party’s thinking on renewable energy, and on green taxation, such as carbon taxes, the escalation of fuel duty and landfill tax. Stephen worked for the party’s shadow environment secretary, Chris Smith, on the strategy In Trust for Tomorrow, published in 1994. This set the tone for Labour for the next decade, outlining the right to roam, justice for future generations and the creation of the environment audit committee. After the 1997 general election, environment was subsumed into a sprawling department that combined local and regional government, transport and environment. Stephen joined as adviser to the environment minister Michael Meacher. His role was to represent Meacher within the department, to be his “vicar on earth”. Meacher was not always on the same page as his civil servants and sometimes only accepted advice once Stephen had persuaded him about the idea’s merits from first (socialistic) principles. Over three fruitful years, Britain signed the Kyoto protocol, launched the climate change levy and passed right-to-roam legislation despite vociferous opposition from landowners. Stephen was invariably witty and charming in explaining and defending policy decisions. The climate change levy, a tax on energy rather than carbon, emerged as a political compromise between the ideals of environmental taxation and the realities of trying to get such a market-based approach to be adopted by a Labour party with deep political roots in the coal industry. Stephen left government in 2000 to join one of its staunchest critics – Greenpeace – and a year later he became executive director. But he found leading Greenpeace’s passionate but vociferous staff, and implementing its global campaign priorities, exhausting. Stephen suffered from depression all his adult life, and when, in 2006, he left Greenpeace, it was after an attempt to take his own life. His physical recovery took a year and his health was never fully restored. After Greenpeace, Stephen could voice his views more freely. He set up a website, climateanswers.info; he and I wrote a book, Repowering Communities (2011), advocating small-scale and local energy solutions; and he wrote on environmental issues for the Centre for European Reform. He also campaigned tirelessly for renewables, including novel technologies such as the Swansea tidal lagoon. Friends remember Stephen’s friendliness, his gentlemanly charm, his approachability, his warmth, his self-deprecating humour, his blokeish passion for Spurs and his love of debate, preferably over a pint of bitter, or better still while hiking on a Munro. Stephen was twice married and divorced. He is survived by the son and daughter of his first marriage, and by his sister, Helen, and his parents. • Stephen Christopher Tindale, environmentalist, born 29 March 1963; died 1 July 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/13/protest-persist-hope-trump-activism-anti-nuclear-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-13T10:00:29Z","webTitle":"Protest and persist: why giving up hope is not an option","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/13/protest-persist-hope-trump-activism-anti-nuclear-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/13/protest-persist-hope-trump-activism-anti-nuclear-movement","fields":{"headline":"Protest and persist: why giving up hope is not an option","bodyText":"Last month, Daniel Ellsberg and Edward Snowden had a public conversation about democracy, transparency, whistleblowing and more. In the course of it, Snowden – who was of course Skyping in from Moscow – said that without Ellsberg’s example he would not have done what he did to expose the extent to which the NSA was spying on millions of ordinary people. It was an extraordinary declaration. It meant that the consequences of Ellsberg’s release of the top-secret Pentagon Papers in 1971 were not limited to the impact on a presidency and a war in the 1970s. The consequences were not limited to people alive at that moment. His act was to have an impact on people decades later – Snowden was born 12 years after Ellsberg risked his future for the sake of his principles. Actions often ripple far beyond their immediate objective, and remembering this is reason to live by principle and act in hope that what you do matters, even when results are unlikely to be immediate or obvious. The most important effects are often the most indirect. I sometimes wonder when I’m at a mass march like the Women’s March a month ago whether the reason it matters is because some unknown young person is going to find her purpose in life that will only be evident to the rest of us when she changes the world in 20 years, when she becomes a great liberator. I began talking about hope in 2003, in the bleak days after the war in Iraq was launched. Fourteen years later, I use the term hope because it navigates a way forward between the false certainties of optimism and of pessimism, and the complacency or passivity that goes with both. Optimism assumes that all will go well without our effort; pessimism assumes it’s all irredeemable; both let us stay home and do nothing. Hope for me has meant a sense that the future is unpredictable, and that we don’t actually know what will happen, but know we may be able write it ourselves. Hope is a belief that what we do might matter, an understanding that the future is not yet written. It’s informed, astute open-mindedness about what can happen and what role we may play in it. Hope looks forward, but it draws its energies from the past, from knowing histories, including our victories, and their complexities and imperfections. It means not being the perfect that is the enemy of the good, not snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, not assuming you know what will happen when the future is unwritten, and part of what happens is up to us. We are complex creatures. Hope and anguish can coexist within us and in our movements and analyses. There’s a scene in the new movie about James Baldwin, I Am Not Your Negro, in which Robert Kennedy predicts, in 1968, that in 40 years there will be a black president. It’s an astonishing prophecy since four decades later Barack Obama wins the presidential election, but Baldwin jeers at it because the way Kennedy has presented it does not acknowledge that even the most magnificent pie in the sky might comfort white people who don’t like racism but doesn’t wash away the pain and indignation of black people suffering that racism in the here and now. Patrisse Cullors, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter, early on described the movement’s mission as “rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams”. The vision of a better future doesn’t have to deny the crimes and sufferings of the present; it matters because of that horror. I have been moved and thrilled and amazed by the strength, breadth, depth and generosity of the resistance to the Trump administration and its agenda. I did not anticipate anything so bold, so pervasive, something that would include state governments, many government employees from governors and mayors to workers in many federal departments, small towns in red states, new organizations like the 6,000 chapters of Indivisible reportedly formed since the election, new and fortified immigrant-rights groups, religious groups, one of the biggest demonstrations in American history with the Women’s March on 21 January, and so much more. I’ve also been worried about whether it will endure. Newcomers often think that results are either immediate or they’re nonexistent. That if you don’t succeed straight away, you failed. Such a framework makes many give up and go back home when the momentum is building and victories are within reach. This is a dangerous mistake I’ve seen over and over. What follows is the defense of a complex calculus of change, instead of the simple arithmetic of short-term cause and effect. There’s a bookstore I love in Manhattan, the Housing Works bookshop, which I’ve gone to for years for a bite to eat and a superb selection of used books. Last October my friend Gavin Browning, who works at Columbia University but volunteers with Housing Works, reminded me what the name means. Housing Works is a spinoff of Act Up, the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power, founded at the height of the Aids crisis, to push for access to experimental drugs, bring awareness to the direness of the epidemic, and not go gentle into that bad night of premature death. What did Act Up do? The group of furious, fierce activists, many of them dangerously ill and dying, changed how we think about Aids. They pushed to speed up drug trials, deal with the many symptoms and complications of Aids together, pushed on policy, education, outreach, funding. They taught people with Aids and their allies in other countries how to fight the drug companies for affordable access to what they needed. And win. Browning recently wrote: “At the start of the 1990s, New York City had less than 350 units of housing set aside for an estimated 13,000 homeless individuals living with HIV/Aids. In response, four members of the Act Up housing committee founded Housing Works in 1990.” They still quietly provide a broad array of services, including housing, to HIV-positive people 27 years later. All I saw was a bookstore; I missed a lot. Act Up’s work is not over, in any sense. For many groups, movements and uprisings, there are spinoffs, daughters, domino effects, chain reactions, new models and examples and templates and toolboxes that emerge from the experiments, and every round of activism is an experiment whose results can be applied to other situations. To be hopeful, we need not only to embrace uncertainty but to be willing to know that the consequences may be immeasurable, may still be unfolding, may be as indirect as poor people on other continents getting access to medicine because activists in the USA stood up and refused to accept things as they were. Think of hope as a banner woven from those gossamer threads, from a sense of the interconnectedness of all things, of the lasting effect of the best actions, not only the worst. Of an indivisible world in which everything matters. An old woman said at the outset of Occupy Wall Street “we’re fighting for a society in which everyone is important”, the most beautifully concise summary of what a compassionately radical, deeply democratic movement might aim to do. Occupy Wall Street was mocked and described as chaotic and ineffectual in its first weeks, and then when it spread nationwide and beyond, as failing or failed, by pundits who had simple metrics of what success should look like. The original occupation in lower Manhattan was broken up in November 2011, but many of the encampments inspired by it lasted far longer. Occupy launched a movement against student debt and opportunistic for-profit colleges; it shed light on the pain and brutality of the financial collapse and the American debt-peonage system. It called out economic inequality in a new way. California passed a homeowner’s bill of rights to push back at predatory lenders; a housing defense movement arose in the wake of Occupy that, house by house, protected many vulnerable homeowners. Each Occupy had its own engagement with local government and its own projects; a year ago people involved with local Occupies told me the thriving offshoots still make a difference. Occupy persists, but you have to learn to recognize the myriad forms in which it does so, none of which look much like Occupy Wall Street as a crowd in a square in lower Manhattan. Similarly, I think it’s a mistake to regard the gathering of tribes and activists at Standing Rock, North Dakota, as something we can measure by whether or not it defeats a pipeline. You could go past that to note that merely delaying completion beyond 1 January cost the investors a fortune, and that the tremendous movement that has generated widespread divestment and a lot of scrutiny of hitherto invisible corporations and environmental destruction makes building pipelines look like a riskier, potentially less profitable business. Standing Rock was vaster than these practical things. At its height it was almost certainly the biggest political gathering of Native North Americans ever seen, said to be the first time all seven bands of the Lakota had come together since they defeated Custer at Little Bighorn in 1876, one that made an often-invisible tribe visible around the world. What unfolded there seemed as though it might not undo one pipeline but write a radical new chapter to a history of more than 500 years of colonial brutality, centuries of loss, dehumanization and dispossession. Thousands of veterans came to defend the encampment and help prevent the pipeline. In one momentous ceremony, many of the former soldiers knelt down to apologize and ask forgiveness for the US army’s long role in oppressing Native Americans. Like the Native American occupation of Alcatraz Island at the end of the 1960s, Standing Rock has been a catalyst for a sense of power, pride, destiny. It is an affirmation of solidarity and interconnection, an education for people who didn’t know much about native rights and wrongs, an affirmation for Native people who often remember history in passionate detail. It is a confirmation of the deep ties between the climate movement and indigenous rights that has played a huge role in stopping pipelines in and from Canada. It has inspired and informed young people who may have half a century or more of good work yet to do. It has been a beacon whose meaning stretches beyond that time and place. To know history is to be able to see beyond the present, to remember the past gives you capacity to look forward as well, it’s to see that everything changes and the most dramatic changes are often the most unforeseen. I want to go into one part of our history at greater length to explore these questions about consequences that go beyond simple cause and effect. * * * The 1970s anti-nuclear movement was a potent force in its time, now seldom remembered, though its influence is still with us. In her important new book Direct Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism, LA Kauffman reports that the first significant action against nuclear power, in 1976, was inspired by an extraordinary protest the previous year in West Germany, which had forced the government to abandon plans to build a nuclear reactor. A group that called itself the Clamshell Alliance arose to oppose building a nuclear power plant in New Hampshire. Despite creative tactics, great movement building, and extensive media coverage against the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, the activists did not stop the plant. They did inspire a sister organization, the Abalone Alliance in central California, which used similar strategies to try to stop the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. The groups protested against two particular nuclear power plants; those two plants opened anyway. You can call that a failure, but Kauffman notes that it inspired people around the country to organize their own anti-nuclear groups, a movement that brought about the cancellation of more than 100 planned nuclear projects over several years and raised public awareness and changed public opinion about nuclear power. Then she gets into the really exciting part, writing that the Clamshell Alliance’s “most striking legacy was in consolidating and promoting what became the dominant model for large-scale direct-action organizing for the next 40 years. It was picked up by … the Pledge of Resistance, a nationwide network of groups organized against US policy in Central America” in the 1980s. “Hundreds more employed it that fall in a civil disobedience action to protest the supreme court’s anti-gay Bowers vs Hardwick sodomy decision,” Kauffman continues. “The Aids activist group Act Up used a version of this model when it organized bold takeovers of the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration in 1988 and the National Institutes of Health in 1990, to pressure both institution to take swifter action toward approving experimental Aids medication.” And on into the current millennium. But what were the strategies and organizing principles they catalyzed? The short answer is non-violent direct action, externally, and consensus decision-making process, internally. The former has a history that reaches around the world, the latter that stretches back to the early history of European dissidents in North America. That is, non-violence is a strategy articulated by Mohandas Gandhi, first used by residents of Indian descent to protest against discrimination in South Africa on 11 September 1906. The young lawyer’s sense of possibility and power was expanded immediately afterward when he traveled to London to pursue his cause. Three days after he arrived, British women battling for the right to vote occupied the British parliament, and 11 were arrested, refused to pay their fines, and were sent to prison. They made a deep impression on Gandhi. He wrote about them in a piece titled “Deeds Better than Words” quoting Jane Cobden, the sister of one of the arrestees, who said, “I shall never obey any law in the making of which I have had no hand; I will not accept the authority of the court executing those laws …” Gandhi declared: “Today the whole country is laughing at them, and they have only a few people on their side. But undaunted, these women work on steadfast in their cause. They are bound to succeed and gain the franchise …” And he saw that if they could win, so could the Indian citizens in British Africa fighting for their rights. In the same article (in 1906!) he prophesied: “When the time comes, India’s bonds will snap of themselves.” Ideas are contagious, emotions are contagious, hope is contagious, courage is contagious. When we embody those qualities, or their opposites, we convey them to others. That is to say, British suffragists, who won limited access to the vote for women in 1918, full access in 1928, played a part in inspiring an Indian man who 20 years later led the liberation of the Asian subcontinent from British rule. He, in turn, inspired a black man in the American south to study his ideas and their application. After a 1959 pilgrimage to India to meet with Gandhi’s heirs, Martin Luther King wrote: “While the Montgomery boycott was going on, India’s Gandhi was the guiding light of our technique of non-violent social change. We spoke of him often.” Those techniques, further developed by the civil rights movement, were taken up around the world, including in the struggle against apartheid at one end of the African continent and to the Arab spring at the other. Participation in the civil rights movement of the early 1960s shaped many lives. One of them is John Lewis, one of the first Freedom Riders, a young leader of the lunch counter sit-ins, a victim of a brutal beating that broke his skull on the Selma march. Lewis was one of the boldest in questioning Trump’s legitimacy and he led dozens of other Democratic members of Congress in boycotting the inauguration. When the attack on Muslim refugees and immigrants began a week after Trump’s inauguration, he showed up at the Atlanta airport. That’s a lot to take in. But let me put it this way. When those women were arrested in parliament, they were fighting for the right of British women to vote. They succeeded in liberating themselves. But they also passed along tactics, spirit and defiance. You can trace a lineage backward to the anti-slavery movement that inspired the American women’s suffrage movement, forward right up to John Lewis standing up for refugees and Muslims in the Atlanta airport this year. We are carried along by the heroines and heroes who came before and opened the doors of possibility and imagination. My partner likes to quote a line of Michel Foucault: “People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don’t know is what what they do does.” You do what you can. What you’ve done may do more than you can imagine for generations to come. You plant a seed and a tree grows from it; will there be fruit, shade, habitat for birds, more seeds, a forest, wood to build a cradle or a house? You don’t know. A tree can live much longer than you. So will an idea, and sometimes the changes that result from accepting that new idea about what is true, right, just remake the world. You do what you can do; you do your best; what what you do does is not up to you. * * * That’s a way to remember the legacy of the external practice of non-violent civil disobedience used by the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s, as with the civil rights movement of the 1960s, which did so much to expand and refine the techniques. As for the internal process: in Direct Action, Kauffman addresses the Clamshell Alliance’s influences, quoting a participant named Ynestra King who said: “Certain forms that had been learned from feminism were just naturally introduced into the situation and a certain ethos of respect, which was reinforced by the Quaker tradition.” Suki Rice and Elizabeth Boardman, early participants in the Clamshell Alliance, as Kauffman relates, were influenced by the Quakers, and they brought the Quaker practice of consensus decision-making to the new group: “The idea was to ensure that no one’s voice was silenced, that there was no division between leaders and followers.” The Quakers have been since the 17th century radical dissidents who opposed war, hierarchical structures and much else. An organizer named Joanne Sheehan said, “while non-violence training, doing actions in small groups, and agreeing to a set of non-violence guidelines were not new, it was new to blend them in combination with a commitment to consensus decision-making and a non-hierarchical structure.” They were making a way of operating and organizing that spread throughout the progressive activist world. There are terrible stories about how diseases like Aids jump species and mutate. There are also ideas and tactics that jump communities and mutate, to our benefit. There is an evil term, collateral damage, for the people who die unintentionally: the civilians, non-participants, etc. Maybe what I am proposing here is an idea of collateral benefit. What we call democracy is often a majority rule that leaves the minority, even 49.9% of the people – or more if it’s a three-way vote – out in the cold. Consensus leaves no one out. After Clamshell, it jumped into radical politics and reshaped them, making them more generously inclusive and egalitarian. And it’s been honed and refined and used by nearly every movement I’ve been a part of or witnessed, from the anti-nuclear actions at the Nevada test site in the 1980s and 1990s to the organization of the shutdown of the World Trade Organization in late 1999, a victory against neoliberalism that changed the fate of the world, to Occupy Wall Street in 2011 and after. So what did the Clamshell Alliance achieve? Everything but its putative goal. Tools to change the world, over and over. There are crimes against humanity, crimes against nature, and other forms of destruction that we need to stop as rapidly as possible, and the endeavors to do so are under way. They are informed by these earlier activists, equipped with the tools they developed. But the efforts against these things can have a longer legacy, if we learn to recognize collateral benefits and indirect effects. If you are a member of civil society, if you demonstrate and call your representatives and donate to human rights campaigns, you will see politicians and judges and the powerful take or be given credit for the changes you effected, sometimes after resisting and opposing them. You will have to believe in your own power and impact anyway. You will have to keep in mind that many of our greatest victories are what doesn’t happen: what isn’t built or destroyed, deregulated or legitimized, passed into law or tolerated in the culture. Things disappear because of our efforts and we forget they were there, which is a way to forget we tried and won. Even losing can be part of the process: as the bills to abolish slavery in the British empire failed over and over again, the ideas behind them spread, until 27 years after the first bill was introduced, a version finally passed. You will have to remember that the media usually likes to tell simple, direct stories in which if a court rules or an elective body passes a law, that action reflects the actors’ own beneficence or insight or evolution. They will seldom go further to explore how that perspective was shaped by the nameless and unsung, by the people whose actions built up a new world or worldview the way that innumerable corals build a reef. The only power adequate to stop the Trump administration is civil society, which is the great majority of us when we remember our power and come together. And even if we remember, even if we exert all the pressure we’re capable of, even if the administration collapses immediately, or the president resigns or is impeached or melts into a puddle of corruption, our work will only have begun. That job begins with opposing the Trump administration but will not end until we have made deep systemic changes and recommitted ourselves, not just as a revolution, because revolutions don’t last, but as a civil society with values of equality, democracy, inclusion, full participation, a radical e pluribus unum plus compassion. As has often been noted, the Republican revolution that allowed them to take over so many state houses and take power far beyond their numbers came partly from corporate cash, but partly from the willingness to do the slow, plodding, patient work of building and maintaining power from the ground up and being in it for the long run. And partly from telling stories that, though often deeply distorting the facts and forces at play, were compelling. This work is always, first and last, storytelling work, or what some of my friends call “the battle of the story”. Building, remembering, retelling, celebrating our own stories is part of our work. I want to see this glorious resistance have a long game, one that includes re-enfranchising the many millions, perhaps tens of millions of people of color, poor people, and students disenfranchised by many means: the Crosscheck program, voter ID laws that proceed from the falsehood that voter fraud is a serious problem that affects election outcomes, the laws taking voting rights in most states from those convicted of felonies. I am encouraged to see many idealistic activists bent on reforming the Democratic party, and a new level of participation inside and outside electoral politics. Reports say that the offices of elected officials are swamped with calls and emails as never before. This will only matter if it’s sustained. To sustain it, people have to believe that the myriad small, incremental actions matter. That they matter even when the consequences aren’t immediate or obvious. They must remember that often when you fail at your immediate objective – to block a nominee or a pipeline or to pass a bill – that even then you may have changed the whole framework in ways that make broader change inevitable. You may change the story or the rules, give tools, templates or encouragement to future activists, and make it possible for those around you to persist in their efforts. To believe it matters – well, we can’t see the future. We have the past. Which gives us patterns, models, parallels, principles and resources, and stories of heroism, brilliance, persistence, and the deep joy to be found in doing the work that matters. With those in our pockets, we can seize the possibilities and begin to make hopes into actualities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/shortcuts/2017/jan/08/colour-changing-cats-warn-radioactive-waste-nuclear-plants-distant-descendants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-08T16:30:22Z","webTitle":"How colour-changing cats might warn future humans of radioactive waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/jan/08/colour-changing-cats-warn-radioactive-waste-nuclear-plants-distant-descendants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/jan/08/colour-changing-cats-warn-radioactive-waste-nuclear-plants-distant-descendants","fields":{"headline":"How colour-changing cats might warn future humans of radioactive waste","bodyText":"Plans for a new fleet of UK nuclear power plants are under way. Last month, for example, Hitachi and the Japanese government confirmed a plan to construct 5.4 gigawatts of generating capacity at UK sites. But what about the waste? And what happens when, in thousands of years, our descendants – who may not read any current human language – find a store, and put themselves in danger? A panel of scientists and linguists asked this question in 1981 when the US Department of Energy commissioned them to find a method of ensuring that whatever is left of humanity in 10,000 years’ time is warned off the sites we’ve been filling with radioactive sludge. The panel reasoned that since few people can read texts that are only 1,000 years old, written warnings guaranteed to be understood by future humanity could be difficult to create. The answer may lie in “nuclear semiotics” – future-proof signs. Other options include hostile architecture, obelisks – or cats. In 1984, writer Françoise Bastide and semiotician Paolo Fabbri suggested the answer could lie in breeding animals that “react with discoloration of the skin when exposed” to radiation. “[Their] role as a detector of radiation should be anchored in cultural tradition by introducing a suitable name (eg, ‘ray cat’).” In short: cats that turn, say, green when near radioactive material. A legend, passed on through the millennia, would trigger a response in humans to get out as soon as possible. The idea has recently gained fresh traction: the Ray Cat Solution movement, formed in 2015, is working to “insert ray cats into the cultural vocabulary”. They say it may be possible to harness some animals’ innate capacity to become fluorescent, or to absorb and emit light – but cats don’t have the physiology to do that. Another way would be to engineer cats to glow using enzyme interaction – a mechanism used to study cellular activity. Far fetched, but it could just work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/30/bigger-threat-russia-isis-john-mccain-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T12:56:01Z","webTitle":"Which is the bigger threat, Russia or Isis? | Mary Dejevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/30/bigger-threat-russia-isis-john-mccain-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/30/bigger-threat-russia-isis-john-mccain-putin","fields":{"headline":"Which is the bigger threat, Russia or Isis?","bodyText":"It is a brave critic who takes on the veteran US senator John McCain, doubly so if the argument has to do with the military or defence. A Vietnam war hero, with decades under his belt on the Senate armed services committee, he is someone you challenge at your peril. A Republican of a traditional stamp, he has been one of Donald Trump’s doughtiest adversaries in Washington. For all the personal and professional respect McCain inspires, however, he has just come a bit of a cropper. His assertion – during a tour of Australia – that he regards Vladimir Putin as more dangerous than Islamic State prompted an outcry among experts and social media mavens alike. Many found his argument absurd. How could it be that Putin, or anyone for that matter, could present more of a threat than the savage theocratic fighters running rampage across the Middle East, beheading those who get in their way? But is he right? Or even a bit right? Much depends, of course, on the context, and who or what is considered under threat. Is it western civilisation as we know it – the presumed target of Isis’s depredations – or something else? In fact, McCain’s statement was qualified twice. In the first instance he was talking about global security; in the second, about western democracy, in the light of how Donald Trump may or may not have won the US presidency. Now, I happen to disagree with McCain both on his view of Russian democracy and on how far Putin harbours malign intentions towards democracy elsewhere. Putin’s Russia is nothing like even the last decrepit years of the Soviet Union in terms of what its citizens can freely say and do. Travel and the internet have opened Russia to the world in a way that will be hard to reverse – even if you think that this is what Putin intends (which I don’t). And if Putin is not the big enemy of democracy at home, why would he be trying to subvert it abroad – or even imagine he could? Despite the charges raging in Washington, actual proof that Russia has tried to manipulate other people’s elections rests on belief and fear far more than evidence. On the other hand, if there was collusion to secure Trump’s election, McCain would be right: rigging an election in the world’s most powerful democracy would indeed be a bigger danger than anything Isis could pose. McCain is on much safer ground with global security. Here, Russia’s superiority over Isis is surely incontrovertible. Even if its armed forces are still not quite up to date, Russia is a nuclear power, with a vast military reach. Its capability is beyond anything Isis could deploy. Even if you focus on the particular hazards of asymmetric warfare, in a match between Russian forces and Isis, Russia is going to prevail. Indeed, even in its depleted post-Soviet state, Russia is likely to prevail in a match with almost any enemy, except the US and perhaps China. So why the outcry when McCain described Russia as a bigger threat than Isis? The indignation, I suspect, has little to do with any friendly feelings towards Russia – though some may reject McCain’s cold war-era assumptions (as I do). It reflects far more the way in which the power of Isis has been exaggerated in our western minds. Isis’s combination of 21st-century PR savvy with the barbaric methods of the distant past have given its “brand” an intimidating significance far beyond anything it should have had. Even if Isis has extended its tentacles as far as Libya and points south; even if its agents can, on occasion, penetrate the defences of western cities to murderous effect, the territory it actually controls is shrinking. Iraqi forces backed by the US may be making heavy weather of recapturing Mosul, but Isis’s sweep across the Middle East has been stalled – thanks in part to the joint efforts of western countries and Russia, but in part, too, to the savagery with which it exercised its power. It should be obvious that Russia represents an infinitely bigger potential threat than Isis – or it would do, if you were its enemy and it was minded to fight. The coincidence of a Russia that is for the most part not in fighting mood, and a self-publicising Isis which certainly is, has skewed our perceptions of comparative threats. John McCain was wrong to impute necessarily malign aims to Russia, but in trying to put Isis in proportion, he was absolutely right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/28/hinkley-point-c-edf-boss-vincent-de-rivaz-government-approve-plans-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-28T12:18:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point: EDF boss calls on government to look at 'bigger picture'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/28/hinkley-point-c-edf-boss-vincent-de-rivaz-government-approve-plans-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/28/hinkley-point-c-edf-boss-vincent-de-rivaz-government-approve-plans-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point: EDF boss calls on government to look at 'bigger picture'","bodyText":"The head of the energy company behind the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors has called on the government to authorise the project after its approval was unexpectedly delayed last month. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said critics of the planned Somerset reactors risked “losing sight of bigger picture by overlooking the positive impact and importance of this investment for Britain”. The nuclear power plant was approved by the EDF board in late July, but in a surprise move shortly after becoming prime minister, Theresa May postponed a decision to proceed with the plant and ordered a review of the £18bn project. The delay was a shock to investors and after it was announced De Rivaz wrote to employees to reassure them that the project was still on track, saying: “Our journey is a long one and there is a further stage. Our job now is to maintain the courage, patience and dedication that have served us so well.” After May announced a further investigation into Hinkley Point C, the former business secretary Vince Cable claimed that, as home secretary, May had raised objections to the nuclear power deal during coalition government and had been unhappy about George Osborne’s “gung-ho” attitude to Chinese investment. On Sunday, De Rivaz addressed criticism of the involvement of the state-owned Chinese nuclear company China General Nuclear Power (CGN), the joint investor with EDF in the project, saying: “We know and trust our Chinese partners.” He said there were “enormous benefits for the UK” from the project being jointly run by China, which has the largest civil nuclear programme in the world. On the issue of cost, he said that instead of comparing the value of electricity produced by the £18bn plant with “today’s depressed wholesale prices” they should be compared with future prices, against which he said electricity generated at Hinkley Point was competitive. The Hinkley Point development has been heavily criticised over the large cost of building it and setting it up. De Rivaz discussed other forms of power, including renewable options such as wind and solar, which some critics have claimed are better alternatives to nuclear, saying that wind energy presented problems of space, intermittency and cost, and that solar was problematic because peak electricity demand in Britain falls in the winter “when there is almost no solar electricity generated”. “There is no single technology which offers a panacea for our future needs. We need them all, including new nuclear,” wrote De Rivaz. “We can’t afford to cross our fingers and muddle through in the hope that a new technology will meet all our needs at the right price.” De Rivaz also pointed to the jobs and apprenticeships likely to be created, saying that “billions of pounds will be invested into the economy of the south-west of England”. The building of the power plant has the support of the GMB union, with Justin Bowden, its national secretary for energy, previously urging the government to stop searching for “get-out clauses”. “The government must get on with building Hinkley Point C as the only carbon-free show in town to keep the lights on during the one in six days when there is no wind or sun,” said Bowden."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/dec/02/nuclear-fusion-combatting-air-pollution-and-attenborough-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-02T15:55:31Z","webTitle":"Nuclear fusion, combatting air pollution and Attenborough – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/nuclear-fusion-combatting-air-pollution-and-attenborough-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/dec/02/nuclear-fusion-combatting-air-pollution-and-attenborough-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear fusion, combatting air pollution and Attenborough – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news Four of world’s biggest cities to ban diesel cars from their centres The $40m ‘magic pipe’: Princess Cruises given record fine for dumping oil at sea Quitting UN climate change body could be Trump’s quickest exit from Paris deal Climate change will stir ‘unimaginable’ refugee crisis, says military Trees may increase air pollution on city streets Megacity planning must change in four years to limit global warming US businesses push against Trump’s attempts to dismiss climate change French nuclear power in ‘worst situation ever’, says former EDF director EU targets energy waste and coal subsidies in new climate package Great Barrier Reef scientists confirm largest die-off of corals recorded South Pacific island ditches fossil fuels to run entirely on solar power Features and comment After 60 years, is nuclear fusion finally poised to deliver?

What blackouts? How National Grid keeps the lights on","bodyText":"Despite claims that Britain is on the brink of blackouts and amid forecasts of a looming cold snap, all is calm inside the room where a score of engineers and analysts work to ensure the lights stay on. Below a huge, illuminated map of the UK’s electricity network and myriad displays, a gentle hubbub of conversation washes over the desks of the control centre in Berkshire, the chief site of three run by National Grid. “It should look like a swan paddling across the pond,” says Nick Easton, one of the grid’s power system managers who sit at the back of the windowless room with six screens of their own, overseeing three teams around the clock in eight- and 12-hour shifts. The day is a relatively easy one for the team. For every 1C the temperature falls, electricity demand goes up 0.5 gigawatts, and on this evening – in the first week of February – demand is expected to peak at 48GW compared with a typical 52GW on a winter evening. However, the calm on show belies the huge changes in the energy market that serves the grid. The way that the UK maintains its electricity reserves is evolving, with a new system for subsidising backup power being brought in next winter. Last Friday £378m worth of contracts were awarded for the capacity market, most of which will be paid to old gas, coal and biomass power stations that will be ready to provide power at short notice if there is a surge in demand or dip in supply. But the sources of the UK’s power are changing fast, from a small number of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants to a greater reliance on renewable providers such as windfarms, backed up by gas power plants and undersea power lines connected to continental Europe and Ireland. The grid says the transformation does not make its job harder – just different. “The summer of 2015 was the last time we ran the grid in the summer the way we had done for the last 70 years, with large generation churning out our everyday power,” says Duncan Burt, who manages the operation of the grid from day to day. “The growth in solar and the continuing reduction in demand meant 2016 really was fundamentally different, the first year of the new power grid.” Solar power has grown from a tiny presence before 2010 to more than 11GW out of the UK’s total capacity of about 80GW, driven by subsidies for householders and the construction of large solar farms. Burt says the intermittent and sometimes unpredictable power from all those solar panels has not increased the cost of fine-tuning electricity supply and demand. The grid spends £850m each year to keep the two in balance, paying power generators to fire up in the face of an unexpected event or a large power user such as a factory to switch off. An increasing amount of that power is also coming from windfarms, in particular from Scotland. Two transmission lines running alongside the M6 and M1 have been upgraded in recent years to export wind power to England, and capacity will leap again when a new undersea cable carrying more Scottish renewable energy comes ashore on the Wirral, Merseyside, later this year. “It’s huge, a tripling in the capability in the network’s capacity [from 10 years ago], and that’s because of the enormous amount of wind in Scotland,” says Burt. The other big swing last year was away from coal, as three major power stations closed in the face of lower gas prices and a carbon tax. For the first time, there were several days without coal power, and gas and solar took up much of the slack. “The grid was fine. Gas or coal doesn’t necessarily feel any different, but it’s a big moment, a watermark. We’re really comfortable about coal going,” says Burt, referring to the UK government’s pledge to phase out coal by 2025. What does worry him is the threat of Britain’s ageing network of nuclear power stations closing down from the middle of next decade as it reaches the end of its life. “That’s very much something we’ll watch closely. If nuclear went for safety [inspection] reasons, we would get weeks rather than years of notice,” he said, pointing to the nuclear outages in France this winter because of safety checks. The changing way the UK generates electricity is throwing up some unusual market quirks too. On weekends last year when electricity demand was low and solar generated a lot of power, wholesale electricity prices went negative. Under this scenario, instead of power station owners selling their electricity to the energy companies who supply UK homes and businesses, the generators actually paid the suppliers to take their power. It is not an an attractive situation for generators. “We think that if solar keeps growing, by 2020 [negative prices] will be a very regular occurrence in the summer and we want the market to be ready to balance that,” says Burt. His answer to that balancing challenge is to persuade big industrial and commercial energy users – water companies, supermarkets, the NHS – to shift their power consumption to the times of day when the sun is shining, the wind is blowing and demand is lower. “What you really want to do is consume power when the renewables are there, and you need to price to signal that.,” he says. But while Burt must juggle those longer-term concerns, the control centre has more pressing problems right now: balancing the supply and demand of electricity, second by second. The grid has not called on any of its emergency 3.5GW of capacity this winter, which has seen temperatures on a par with the long-term average. But the Met Office expects south-easterly winds later this week to bring drier, colder weather, with the possibility of snow on the east coast. Half of the UK’s electricity interconnector – or sub-sea cable – to France is also out of action and being repaired following storm damage last year, adding extra pressure. Easton, who is not on shift and looks more relaxed than the control centre manager, admits the job carries a lot of responsibility. “Sometimes you stop and think: ‘I’ve got the nation’s transmission systems in my hand’ – and the implications of a blackout are quite profound. But you don’t necessarily stop to think about that. You have a role to do, and you’re surrounded by knowledgeable people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2016/nov/21/japan-earthquake-tsunami-warning-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-22T07:43:53Z","webTitle":"Japan earthquake: tsunami warning lifted after 7.4 magnitude quake – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/nov/21/japan-earthquake-tsunami-warning-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2016/nov/21/japan-earthquake-tsunami-warning-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Japan earthquake: tsunami warning lifted after 7.4 magnitude quake – as it happened","bodyText":"A magnitude 7.4 earthquake has struck off the coast of Fukushima – the site of 2011’s devastating 9.0 quake and resulting tsunami – at Tuesday 5.59am local time (Monday 8.59pm GMT). The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake was an aftershock to the 2011 earthquake, the largest since that quake’s immediate aftershocks. The JMA warned that another large quake could be expected within the next few days, and people in the region have been advised to “remain cautious” for the next week. Tsunami warnings were issued for the Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, with waves at Sendai port recorded at 1.4m high. The warnings have since been downgraded, before being cancelled, although residents are still advised to avoid the shore. At the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant, the reactor number 3 spent fuel pool pump stopped operating at 6.10am as a result of the quake. Operation resumed at 7.49am and the plant is reported to be safe and “intact”. So far, at least people are reported to have suffered minor injuries in the quake. No deaths have been reported. Nissan is suspending work at its Fukushima factory, while flights to and from Sendai airport have been disrupted. Decommissioning work at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, destroyed in the 2011 quake, has been temporarily suspended. This graphic shows how shaking from the magnitude 7.4 quake rippled across Japan from 5.59am local time: Tsunami waves were filmed surging up the Sunaoshi river in Tagajo city after a quake of magnitude 7.4 shook Japan’s eastern coast, prompting evacuation warnings: Today’s quake was an aftershock of the 2011 magnitude 9 earthquake, the Japan Meteorological Agency has said. But what is the difference? Here’s a handy explainer from the Southern California Earthquake Center: Seismologists label an earthquake as an aftershock using two guidelines. First, the earthquake must occur within an ‘aftershock zone’, which is usually defined as the region within one fault-rupture length of the mainshock rupture surface or the area defined by seismologists based on previous aftershock activity. Second, it must happen within this zone before the seismicity rate in the area returns to its pre-mainshock level. An earthquake that meets these two specific criteria is considered an aftershock. Pointing out that Tuesday’s quake was an aftershock of the 2011 earthquake, the Japan Meteorological Agency also warned that another large quake could be expected within the next few days. People in Japan have been warned to “remain cautious” for the next week. The magnitude 7.4 quake was the largest earthquake in the region since the magnitude 9 quake in 2011 and some of its immediate aftershocks. The Japan Meteorological Agency has said that Tuesday’s earthquake was an aftershock of the enormous, magnitude 9 quake in 2011, which killed more than 15,000 people and sent the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into meltdown. New Zealand also experienced an earthquake on Tuesday, just over a week after a 7.8 magnitude quake rocked the South Island. Tuesday’s was a magnitude 5.6 quake, which hit off the coast about 200km (120 miles) northeast of Wellington, the capital, at around 1.20pm local time (00.20 GMT). There were no reports of injuries or serious damage, and no tsunami warning was issued. There have been no reports of deaths or serious injuries caused by the earthquake, with Japanese media reporting around six people have suffered minor injuries. All tsunami warnings have now been cancelled for Japan’s Pacific coast. The Japan Meteorological Agency has confirmed: Tsunami advisories have been lifted for the following coastal regions of Japan: Iwate prefecture, Miyagi prefecture, Fukushima prefecture, Ibaraki prefecture. Slight sea-level changes may be observed in coastal regions, but no tsunami damage is expected. Pay attention when fishing, swimming or engaging in other marine activities, as there may still be slight sea-level changes. No major tsunami warnings, tsunami warnings or advisories are currently in effect. Stock markets have rebounded after an early wobble, Agence France-Presse reports: Asian markets rose Tuesday with energy stocks tracking a surge in oil prices, while Tokyo recovered an early sell-off caused by a huge earthquake off Japan’s northeast coast. The yen strengthened against the dollar after the quake as investors sought out safe haven assets but gave up most of the gains as it emerged there was no major damage. The dollar fell to as low as 110.27 yen before bouncing back to sit at 110.70 yen, with expectations it will extend gains on bets for higher US interest rates under Donald Trump’s presidency. Japan’s Nikkei rebounded to end the morning slightly up and at its highest mark since January. Japan has downgraded tsunami warnings issued after a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit off the country’s east coast, as the risk of major damage appeared to pass. The quake, which struck east of Fukushima prefecture at about 6am on Tuesday, prompted urgent warnings for people to leave low-lying areas in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures as a series of tsunami waves hit the shore. The warnings allowed for the possibility of waves of up to 3m (10 feet) along the country’s north-east Pacific coast, but the highest recorded wave, of 1.4m (4.6 feet), was observed at Sendai port shortly after 8am. The tsunami warnings in Fukushima and Miyagi were downgraded to the less severe status of advisories nearly four hours after the initial quake, although people were still urged to stay away from coastal areas. Similar tsunami advisories also remained in place in Iwate and Ibaraki prefectures. There were no reports of severe injuries from the quake, which struck at a depth of 30km (18.6 miles), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The same region was hit by a series of weaker quakes in the following few hours. While immediate fears around the quake and tsunami appear to have calmed, many people in Japan have been shocked by the morning’s events, Agence France-Presse reports: Residents along the coast were badly shaken. “It was huge and lasted so long,” Akemi Anzai, from the city of Minamisoma which lies north of the Fukushima plant, said of the quake. “The tsunami siren warning can be heard from the coastline,” she told AFP. “The ground is still shaking. I’m so scared. But my concern is rather the situation at the nuclear plant.” Some evacuees took to Twitter to express their fears. “I’m at a cultural centre where I evacuated during the previous disaster [in 2011],” one person tweeted in Japanese. “This reminds me of that.” Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, has spoken about the earthquake from Buenos Aires, which he is visiting after attending the Apec summit in Peru: A strong earthquake was observed off the coast of Fukushima a short while ago and the tsunami alerts were issued. From my side, to the nation, we asked that proper and accurate information over the tsunami and the evacuation should be issued, and also to grasp and understand the condition of the damage as quickly as possible, and also to take proper emergency measures. I called the chief cabinet secretary directly. I would like to join hands closely with the local governments … and do our best to take appropriate emergency measures. (Thanks to NHK for the translation.) A magnitude 7.4 earthquake has struck off the coast of Fukushima – the site of 2011’s devastating 8.9 quake and resulting tsunami – at Tuesday 5.59am local time (Monday 8.59pm GMT). Tsunami warnings were issued for the Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, with waves at Sendai port recorded at 1.4m high. The warnings have since been downgraded, although residents are still advised to move to high ground and avoid the shore. At the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant, reactor number 3 spent fuel pool pump stopped operating at 6.10am as a result of the quake. Operation resumed at 7.49am and the plant is reported to be safe and “intact”. So far, five people are reported to have suffered minor injuries in the quake. Nissan is suspending work at its Fukushima factory, while flights to and from Sendai airport have been disrupted. Decommissioning work at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, destroyed in the 2011 quake, has been temporarily suspended. Paul Somerville, chief geoscientist with risk frontiers at Australia’s Macquarie University, says: This earthquake was a normal faulting earthquake that occurred at a shallow depth within the plate that overlies the Tohoku subduction zone, which generated the 2011 Mw 9.0 event. It indicates east-west extension within the overriding plate, presumably due to the relaxation of horizontal stress that built up before the 2001 event. It occurred about 30km offshore of Fukushima. It is very unlikely that this earthquake will have a large impact on Japan. Transport has been affected by the quake and subsequent alerts. Sendai port and Suma port have been affected by tsunami waves, although the warning has now been downgraded to an advisory. Flights to and from Sendai airport have been delayed or cancelled. Associated Press has more on that incident – now resolved – at the Fukushima power plant: A utility official says he believes a cooling water pump that stopped working at a Japanese nuclear power plant after a strong earthquake was shut off automatically by a safety system as the water in the pool shook. The utility says a backup pump was launched to restore cooling water to spent fuel storage pool at the No 3 reactor of the Fukushima Daini plant. The plant is close to the Fukushima Daiichi plant that went into meltdown in 2011 after a tsunami swamped the plant, knocking out power to the cooling systems. Both plants are operated by Tokyo-based Tepco. Naohiro Masuda, head of Tepco’s decommissioning unit, said decommissioning work at the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant has been temporarily suspended because of the earthquake. Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary, also addressed reporters’ questions about the Fukushima power plant. He confirmed the affected reactor had resumed cooling function after a temporary stoppage. Japan’s nuclear power plants have the most strict regulations in the world. We always think of the worst-case scenario … safety is the utmost priority. Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary, is speaking at a press conference. He says tsunami warnings have been lifted and downgraded to “advisory”, adding: Residents, please continue to evacuate … and please always listen to the latest information. Suga says a 1.4m tidal wave was observed at Sendai, and tsunami waves were observed to the Izu Islands. He says it is hard to say exactly whether another quake would occur but the decision to downgrade the alert was based on information from the Japan Meteorological Agency. Suga says the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is overseas, “directly called me” to instruct the government to take adequate measures: The government will continue to address how many people have sustained injury. Tsunami warnings for the Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures have been downgraded to alerts, a lower level of risk. People in those areas are still advised to avoid the shore. Tsunami advisories have been lifted entirely for some coastal regions: the Pacific coast of Aomori prefecture; the Kujukuri and Sotobo area and the Uchibo area of Chiba prefecture; and the Izu islands. The epicentre of the earthquake is off the coast of Fukushima. The magnitude 7.4 quake hit at a depth of around 20km, according to latest reports. The earthquake shook buildings in Tokyo, 240km (150 miles) southwest of the epicentre. Kirsty Brown is an Australian who has been living in Tokyo with her husband and 18-month-old daughter for just seven weeks. The family lives 20 minutes from Shinkjuku, and woke up to the earthquake early this morning: I’d experienced a small quake here on one of our visits several years ago. I thought my husband pushed me out of the bed that time, but this was quite a good deal stronger, and you could feel the whole house wobble. The sensation was similar to your bed suddenly deciding to zig-zag, and it lasted for around 90 seconds. No alarms went off, no alerts came to our phones. My dog and husband rolled over and went back to sleep, but I immediately took to my phone to see if I should be getting us ready for a bigger quake. On moving here we were told about earthquake preparedness – similar to prepping for bushfires back home – so I was thinking about getting our backpack with water and clothes ready, and whether or not I needed to switch off the mains in the house. But nothing happened, and there was no commotion outside, so within 30 minutes we were peacefully back to sleep – and have just now woken up again to the sounds of the junior school across from us starting their day as usual. And another reader tweets me to say: Nissan is suspending work at its Fukushima factory, Reuters reports: Nissan Motor Co said it would suspend work at its engine factory in Fukushima at least until a tsunami warning is lifted after a powerful earthquake rocked northern Japan early on Tuesday. A spokesman said there were no injuries or damage at the plant, which was badly damaged in an earthquake and tsunami disaster in March 2011. Separately, Toyota Motor Corp said all its factories in northeastern Japan were operating as usual. Japan’s National Police Agency has said two people were slightly injured during the quake. NHK News reports that one woman in Yabuki, Fukushima prefecture, was hurt when a cupboard fell over. A man in Fukushima city is also reported to have suffered minor wounds. Experts in Australia have been assessing today’s earthquake against the devastating 2011 quake and tsunami: Professor James Goff, director of the Australia-Pacific tsunami research centre and natural hazards research laboratory, University of New South Wales, says: In general, with the size of the earthquake experienced, I would not expect any wave to reach the heights of those experienced in 2011, but that does not mean that this event will not be damaging. Tsunamis as small as 90cm can be extremely damaging and so in a sense, we are ‘watching this space’… One concern is not necessarily the size of the earthquake itself but whether or not it might generate submarine landslides that can themselves generate large tsunamis. Associate professor Dale Dominey-Howes, disaster risk management expert at the University of Sydney, says: Today’s event is much smaller than the 2011 catastrophic event. The earthquake maybe an aftershock of the 2011 event. It has affected the same region as the 2011 event. A regional tsunami has been generated – smaller than 2011 but still potentially dangerous. People who live in the region have been advised to evacuate, with authorities taking no chances after the 2011 disaster. Residents in the region are still struggling to recover from the 2011 event resulting in compound socio-psychological impacts on survivors. Aftershocks will continue in the region for days to weeks to come. A 1.4m-high tsunami wave has been observed in Sendai, Miyagi prefecture, at 8.03am. It’s the highest so far recorded, although officials stress that second and subsequent waves could be higher, and are still urging people in affected areas to move to higher ground. Other high waves recorded include: Soma Port, 90cm, at 7.06am. Ishinomaki Ayukawa, 80cm, at 7.39am. Kuji Port, 80cm, at 7.54am. Onahama Port, 60cm, at 6.49am. It’s currently 9am in Japan. There have so far been reports of only minor injuries following the magnitude 7.4 quake, which struck just before 6am local time at a depth of 25km. Some photos from Kyodo, via Reuters, which are being circulated to news agencies. They show a traffic jam and concerned onlookers. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has issued a statement: I have ordered government officials to provide the public with up-to-date and accurate information concerning tsunami evacuation. Tepco says the Fukushima power plant “remains intact” and safe. The company confirms the reactor number 3 spent fuel pool pump tripped and stopped operating at 6.10am. Operation resumed at 7.49am. Tepco says the stoppage was caused by the tremor and “strong acceleration” at the power plant. The quake also caused the temperature inside the reactor to increase to 29.5C from 28.7C over 90 minutes. At 6.38am, the Fukushima Daiichi and Daini plants had a tsunami wave about 1m high. A second wave was “not very high”. There have been no casualties at the Fukushima plant. The Fukushima Daini reactor 3 cooling system, which had stopped operating, has been restored. The operator of the plant said no abnormalities have been observed. Power was temporarily lost for cooling water for a spent fuel pool at the Fukushima Daini plant, but has been restored, broadcaster NHK reports. A tsunami warning has now been issued for the Miyagi prefecture, expanding the zone believed to be under threat. Residents are told to evacuate their homes for higher ground. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is holding a news conference. It says the initial quake, recorded at 5.59am, has been revised up to magnitude 7.4. A tsunami alert has been issued, centring on Fukushima. There is also a warning that landslides may occur. The tide level is still rising along the coast, with waves as high as 1m now reaching the shore. Residents are being instructed to stay away from the water. There are warnings that second and subsequent waves can be higher than the initial tsnuami waves. Residents of Japan’s northern Pacific coast are still being told to leave their homes and seek higher ground via televised tsunami advisories: NHK reports from Fukushima that the Fukushima Daini Reactor 3 cooling system has stopped operating, but “no abnormalities have been observed”. Tepco, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, says cooling water has not leaked and it is preparing to resume operation within one to two hours. Broadcaster NHK reports that it does not seem tanks have been affected by the quake and the power plant buildings are above water level. Earthquakes are a familiar experience for Japan, as AFP details: Japan sits at the junction of four tectonic plates and experiences a number of relatively violent quakes every year. A massive undersea quake that hit in March 2011 sent a tsunami barrelling into Japan’s northeast coast, leaving more than 18,000 people dead or missing, and sending three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. In April this year, two strong earthquakes hit southern Japan’s Kumamoto prefecture, followed by more than 1,700 aftershocks, leaving at least 50 dead and causing widespread damage. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog coverage. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is currently in in Buenos Aires, after attending the Apec summit in Peru. Speaking there, he said the government would do its utmost to respond to the quake. The first tsunami waves to reach the coast of Fukushima, Japan have ranged between 30 and 90cm, much lower than the three metres that was at first predicted. However, Japanese media warn that the tsunami’s waves can increase over time as it continues to strike the coast. The coolant pool at one of the reactors at Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant, one of two in the region, has been turned off, according to NHK World. There is no danger at this time at the site of the plant, and there is plenty of time before the reactors get dangerously warm. Today’s tsunami will not be nearly as large as 2011’s disastrous wave, according to Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist and scientist emerita at the US Geological Survey. Japanese officials are still urging people to evacuate the affected area. At Fukushima’s two nuclear power plants, Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima Daini, external power sources and coolant water have not been affected so far by the earthquake, according to NHK World. “Now staff are watching closely to see any abnormalities.” In this video you can see water rushing out of the harbor at Iwaki City. Water levels typically go down just before a tsunami strikes the shoreline. Onohama Port is now reporting a tsunami height of 90cm, according to NHK World. Japanese broadcaster NHK world is reporting that waves are beginning to arrive. 60cm tsunami waves have been observed offshore, and the waves are expected to be as high as three metres when they reach the shoreline, NHK reports. You can watch the live broadcast, which is being live-translated into English, here. This is the full text of the tsunami warning issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (note that the strength of the earthquake was at first reported to be 7.3 magnitude but was later downgraded to 6.9, according to the US Geological Survey). A tsunami warning has been issued in Fukushima Prefecture after an earthquake struck off the East coast of Japan in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The earthquake measured 6.9 magnitude, according to the US Geological Survey. Japanese media are reporting that a tsunami as large as three metres high could be about to strike the coastline, and are urging everyone to evacuate coastal areas. The evacuation warnings are urging residents to remember the “great earthquake” of 2011, which measured 9.1. That earthquake and the tsunami that followed killed more than 15,000 people, injured more than 6,000 more, and left nearly quarter of a million people without homes, and also caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiishi nuclear power plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/28/im-not-scared-by-nuclear-locals-divided-over-hinkley-point-c","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T17:23:11Z","webTitle":"'I'm not scared by nuclear': locals divided over Hinkley Point C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/28/im-not-scared-by-nuclear-locals-divided-over-hinkley-point-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/28/im-not-scared-by-nuclear-locals-divided-over-hinkley-point-c","fields":{"headline":"'I'm not scared by nuclear': locals divided over Hinkley Point C","bodyText":"The EDF Energy visitor centre at the Angel Place shopping centre in Bridgwater was doing brisk business. A group of pensioners waited for a coach to take them for a tour of Hinkley Point B nuclear power station 10 miles away on the Somerset coast while children played with displays explaining how electricity is created. Teenagers dropped in to jump on to a static bike and power up their mobile phones. Opinions about the wisdom of building a new power station, Hinkley Point C, on the Somerset coast, were many and varied. “I think we need it to make sure the lights stay on,” said Richard Smart, 65, a retired builder who had come for the Hinkley B tour. “I don’t like the look of all those wind turbines on the hills though I wouldn’t mind wave power. I’m not scared by the idea of nuclear. I think they know what they’re doing.” Businesswoman Fay Gregory, who was with her 13-year-old son Max, was not so sure. “I’ve brought Max here so he can try to understand nuclear power” she said. “It’s his future we’re talking about. We’re creating something that he and his generation will be dealing with for many years to come.” Seventeen-year-old Steve Moss said Hinkley Point C would provide an economic boost for the whole of the south-west of England. “A lot of people think they have to move away from here to find a good job. I know some people are worried about the dangers of nuclear power and the problem of dealing with the waste but this will be massive for opportunities here.” That argument is made forcefully by EDF and by the politicians – local and national – who are backing the vast building project. EDF says that over the 10-year construction period, 25,000 new “employment opportunities” will be created and at the peak there will be 5,600 people working at the site. Once built, the company says, it is estimated that 900 people will be employed at Hinkley C at any one time during its 60 years of operation. For decades, nuclear power has been a big employer in north Somerset. French-owned EDF has been at pains to claim that – wherever possible - it will use local people and companies to build and operate Hinkley C. Hinkley supply chain project manager, Chris Langdon, of the Somerset chamber of commerce, has spent the last five years making sure local and regional businesses are “Hinkley-ready.” He said: “When most people think of a nuclear power station they think of the technical bit in the middle. But 80% of this is a big civil engineering project. You have to assemble the equivalent of a small town to build it and the range of businesses involved is huge from the folks who help feed the workforce – the butcher, the baker – right through to the manufacturers and construction guys. Then there’s the people who run the buses to the site, the highway maintenance crews, the teams who keep the power, water and drains working.” Husband and wife butchers Malcolm and Julie Pyne are among the suppliers who saw the opportunities offered by the plans for a new power station. They expanded their business from a high street shop into an out-of-town store with kitchen and takeaway close to the M5. They supply local beef, pork and lamb to the existing Hinkley site and are building a new meat-producing plant to cope with the extra demand Hinkley C would create. “We’ll also be increasing our staff from 40 to 60,” said Pyne. “Hinkley provides fantastic business opportunities.” Schools and colleges have been planning for years for the project. Liz Redwood, the executive director for apprenticeships and commercial strategy at Weston College, said education providers were creating a “pipeline” of people with suitable skills. The first tranche will be involved in the initial groundworks, then a second will be ready five years down the line to undertake, for example, electrical and technical tasks. Weston College is also opening a future technology centre that will offer university-level engineering courses and a business enterprise centre to produce some of the accountants, managers and lawyers whom they hope will eventually be employed at Hinkley C. Redwood believes a nuclear industry “cluster” in the south-west will provide exciting jobs for the sort of talented young people who might previously have had to leave the area to further their careers. “That is good for local people, good for the region,” she said. Not everyone is a fan. Amy Granville, 78, was among a group of churchgoers in Bridgwater town centre waving a Jesus flag and inviting shoppers to stop and say a prayer. “We’ve been doing this for 17 years and I must admit nobody has asked to pray about Hinkley but I do worry about things like cancer if anything went wrong, if there was a leak. Will the new power station be safe?” Allan Jeffrey, a former science teacher and a spokesperson for the Stop Hinkley campaign group certainly does not believe Hinkley Point C would be secure. “We’re told nuclear power is safe but we’ve had terrible accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima,” he said. His terraced house in Bridgwater is the antithesis of the EDF visitor centre in the town centre. The front windows are adorned with anti-nuclear posters, the shelves inside heaving with files documenting Britain’s nuclear history. No matter the detail of the EDF announcement this week, Stop Hinkley says the fight is not over and remains deeply sceptical over whether Hinkley Point C will ever actually take shape. Another campaigner, Roy Pumfrey, argued that the project was beset by financial problems and legal challenges and called on the government, even now, to focus on renewable rather than nuclear energy. “We could replace Hinkley much more quickly and cheaply without the safety fears and without producing dangerous waste we don’t know what to do with,” he said. “The government’s nuclear delusions are standing in the way of the west of England joining the renewable revolution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/24/brexit-overburden-civil-service-warns-spending-watchdog-nao","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-24T06:00:25Z","webTitle":"Brexit will overburden civil service, warns spending watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/24/brexit-overburden-civil-service-warns-spending-watchdog-nao","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/24/brexit-overburden-civil-service-warns-spending-watchdog-nao","fields":{"headline":"Brexit will overburden civil service, warns spending watchdog","bodyText":"Britain’s departure from the EU will put extra strain on a civil service already struggling to cope with a series of major projects, the National Audit Office has found. The spending watchdog said weaknesses in Whitehall’s capability undermined the government’s ability to achieve Brexit, with about a third of staff positions unfilled in the Department for Exiting the EU and the Department for International Trade. As Theresa May prepares to trigger article 50 on 29 March, the report said leaving the EU would “further increase the capability challenges” facing the government as officials took on responsibilities previously handled in Brussels. The pressures of Brexit come on top of a “challenging portfolio” of major projects such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, HS2 high-speed rail and renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent. “Government projects too often go ahead without government knowing whether departments have the skills to deliver them,” the report said. It suggested projects should be prioritised, with the government halting schemes that it is not confident it can deliver. The report said that although there had been improvements in how some departments manage programmes, “we continue to report regularly on troubled projects” and “many delivery problems can be traced to weaknesses in capability”. The NAO said the government needed to show greater urgency in filling skills gaps in Whitehall. “Government is facing ever-increasing challenges in providing public services. Continuing budgetary restraint is putting pressure on departments, which are already managing important reforms with fewer staff and smaller budgets,” it said. “The decision to leave the EU also means government will have to take on tasks previously undertaken by others, requiring the development of skills not previously planned for.” A thousand new roles had been created in the Department for Exiting the EU and the Department for International Trade, but by February only two-thirds of the roles had been filled, mostly by transferring staff from elsewhere in government, the report said. It estimates the government will need to spend at least £145m a year to hire the 2,000 additional staff with digital skills required within five years. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: “Government has gaps in its capability and knows it must do more to develop the skills it needs. It is making plans to do so but the scale of the challenge ahead means greater urgency is needed. “Without a short-term solution to its capability gaps, government must get better at planning and prioritising its activities and be prepared to stop work on those it is not confident it has the capability to deliver.” Each department is developing its own Brexit plan as well as supporting Downing Street, the report points out. In response, Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, said the UK was well placed to deal with the challenges ahead as it prepared for Brexit. “We are focused on delivering this government’s commitment to leave the EU and get the very best deal for the UK. We are equipping ourselves with the right people and the right skills across government to make this happen,” he said. “At the same time, the civil service is also working hard to make sure that all the priorities of the government are being delivered.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2017/aug/02/our-60-year-relationship-with-euratom-offers-hard-lessons-for-brexit-negotiators","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-02T07:00:40Z","webTitle":"Lessons for Brexit negotiations from 60 years of Britain and Euratom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2017/aug/02/our-60-year-relationship-with-euratom-offers-hard-lessons-for-brexit-negotiators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2017/aug/02/our-60-year-relationship-with-euratom-offers-hard-lessons-for-brexit-negotiators","fields":{"headline":"Our 60-year relationship with Euratom offers hard lessons for Brexit negotiators","bodyText":"Until recently, few of us were familiar with the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), the international organisation that governs many aspects of nuclear energy activity in member states. Brexit, and the rapidly retracted “leak” that Britain may seek “associate membership” of Euratom has suddenly brought Euratom to the fore. The precise legal situation regarding the UK’s continued membership of Euratom is contested, but there is much to learn from the history of this relationship: over the past six decades the UK has attempted to become an associate member or full member of Euratom five times. First of all, we might ask whether associate membership of Euratom is politically feasible? Whilst there are a number of Conservative MPs poised to vote against leaving Euratom, Theresa May’s Article 50 letter specifically noted that the UK would trigger Article 106a of the Euratom treaty and withdraw from Euratom. There may not be a way to withdraw Article 106a notification for Euratom without withdrawing Article 50 notification as well. It is hard to see the UK withdrawing Article 50 in order to achieve associate membership of Euratom. But that aside, the idea that the UK can quickly and easily become an associate member is not supported by history. Every time that British politicians have negotiated to join Euratom they have expected the debate to be over quickly. Indeed, in 1970, the foreign secretary thought negotiations would be completed so quickly that he would be able to formally announce success before Christmas that year. But things were not that simple. By May 1971, the best that could be announced was that there were “no major difficulties” left (which was a very diplomatic way of saying that they had finished arguing about difficult bits of the treaty and were ready to start arguing about the rest). From 1957 right up to the UK finally joined in 1973, the fundamental miscalculation was to assume that “they needed us more than we needed them”. Governments of both colours expected that, as the first nation to commercialise nuclear power, the UK would be welcomed with open arms. However, this assumption made for an inflexible negotiating position. Although officials and ministers stressed to the cabinet that they “accepted the terms of the Euratom treaty”, British negotiating briefs contained over 150 pages of red lines, clarifications and modifications. Some officials were concerned that such an inflexible position gave the impression that they were assessing Euratom’s case to join the UK and not the other way around. Such rhetoric is not quite being repeated now. The UK does not have the same active nuclear research base that it once had. Although the UK has more extensive experience of decommissioning than its European partners, this is not uniquely specialised knowledge, and most of the private companies involved are multinational. In spite of this the debate on potential associate membership still hinges on the assumption that Euratom will be grateful to keep the UK a member. The belief that the UK was (and would be) doing Euratom a favour by joining (or staying) neglects the fact that British membership would involve difficulties for Euratom as well. In fact, the fact that many aspects of Euratom are now governed through EU institutions means that associate membership will be difficult for Euratom and for the UK. For instance, Euratom research is increasingly linked with research funded through grants administered by the EU. If the UK remains in Euratom, but not the EU, will it be able to receive research funding? If the UK remains in Euratom but not the EU, will it still contribute to the ITER fusion reactor project in the south of France, and if so will it have any rights to the design if it works? Britain has long been one of the most consistent supporters of fusion research, and the work of the Joint European Torus project near Oxford has been vital in developing ITER. If the ITER reactor and its successor work successfully they could herald a new era of electricity generation. If Britain remains in Euratom but not the EU, will it retain access to the European Electricity Single Market? This doesn’t entirely exist yet, but will be the mechanism through which Britain can trade for European electricity through its “interconnectors” to France, the Netherlands, and Ireland. If Britain is not in the single market, its ability to trade in the Electricity Single Market will need to be specially agreed. The interconnectors are vital for “keeping the lights on”. On an average week the UK gets between 5% and 10% of its electricity through these imports. One thing that associate membership would make easier is the most important and most overlooked difficulty of withdrawal from Euratom. Since joining in 1973, any nuclear treaties with other nations (including any signed before that date) were placed under the aegis of Euratom. This means that if Britain leaves Euratom, all its complex nuclear treaties with the United States, the rest of Europe and many other nations across the world will need to be re-ratified in national legislatures before Britain is no longer a member. This is a large international legislative task, and requires quick action before the Article 50 process ends in just over a year. If the treaties are not re-ratified by national parliaments, then, depending on the treaty, the UK could be in breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and a worst-case scenario could have a variety of very serious consequences including: stopping work on Hinkley C, halting the movement of nuclear fuel, and even ending the import of medical isotopes for cancer treatments. This is not to argue that re-ratification of these treaties, or that associate membership is impossible. However, our relations with Euratom have always proven more difficult to negotiate than expected. Whatever our position on Brexit, Euratom does not need Britain more than Britain needs Euratom, and this is what the government must remember as it negotiates a vital new relationship. Stuart Butler is a Research Fellow at the Science Museum in London working on the History of Nuclear Energy and Society (HoNESt) project.

The issue is of extreme political sensitivity because George Osborne has already faced criticism for providing huge subsidies to Hinkley, which is being developed by EDF Energy of France. “It will be seriously tough for British manufacturers to meet the needs of EDF in line with the commitment that 60% of the value of the project will remain in this country,” said Sir Keith Burnett, who is a member of the Council of Science and Technology reporting to the prime minister, David Cameron. Burnett, the vice-chancellor of Sheffield University, said that 40% of the total value of the work at Hinkley Point atomic plant would largely go to French firms. At least £4bn worth of spending on items such as pipes and pumps – around 15% of the project by value – will be up for grabs for the UK but only if local companies can provide the higher specification supplies required by EDF. Burnett thinks that will be difficult to achieve. “The British government needs to continue with the help it is giving through the Innovate UK and other publicly funded organisations which help support supply companies. Without concentrated effort there are still going to be difficulties [for suppliers],” he added. Burnett’s concerns were echoed by Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. She said there was a potential shortage of skilled personnel and a lack of clarity over the exact timing of Hinkley and other energy infrastructure projects. “There is definitely a nervousness in the industry about whether companies coming into these jobs have the quality standards necessary. We do have the basic engineering skills but can we grow the specialist knowledge quick enough to meet the procurement process and timetable?” Part of the problem is that small and medium-sized British firms have not had the opportunity to supply equipment to a new nuclear power station since Sizewell C in Suffolk was completed in 1995. The Hinkley Point C facility in Somerset is still awaiting the final investment decision from the largely state-owned EDF and its Chinese partners, although ground preparation is already under way. The basic earth moving, road construction and erection of buildings will be carried out by British contractors such as Balfour Beatty and Laing O’Rourke but the high-end pressure vessels and turbines will be provided by the likes of Areva of France. It is the middle-end work which Burnett is worried about, with the added possibility that UK companies cannot take advantage of other planned UK nuclear projects by companies such as Hitachi of Japan. EDF insisted it was still confident that Britain would win more than £14bn worth of contracts in line with its target, indicating particular confidence in those areas such as pumps and pipes highlighted by Burnett as a worry. “Work to enable the British supply chain to compete for contracts means that more than 60% of the project by value will be spent in the UK. The project will strengthen British industry, jobs and skills with 25,000 job opportunities during its construction. “National, local and international supply chain events over the last six years have helped UK businesses understand the requirements necessary to join the project which will restart new nuclear construction in Britain after a 20-year pause. “This has resulted in the creation of joint ventures which could lead to further opportunities for participation in successive nuclear projects in the UK and globally.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/may/02/nuclear-industry-uk-brexit-euratom-hinkley-point-c-nia","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-02T14:44:23Z","webTitle":"Nuclear industry warns UK must avoid 'cliff edge' over Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/02/nuclear-industry-uk-brexit-euratom-hinkley-point-c-nia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/may/02/nuclear-industry-uk-brexit-euratom-hinkley-point-c-nia","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear industry warns UK must avoid 'cliff edge' over Brexit","bodyText":"The UK nuclear industry has issued its strongest warning yet to ministers on the problems it faces if the government is unable to strike new international atomic power deals during Brexit talks. Failure to put in place alternative arrangements to replace the existing European nuclear treaty, Euratom, which the UK is quitting as part of the article 50 process, would have a “dramatic impact” on Hinkley Point C and other new power stations around the country, the industry said. Ministers must avoid a “cliff edge” when the UK exits Euratom or face “major disruption to business across the whole nuclear fuel cycle”, the Nuclear Industry Association will warn the government on Wednesday. The stark briefing to officials, seen by the Guardian, comes just a day after MPs said the continued operations of the UK nuclear industry were at risk from exiting the Euratom treaty. A Lords committee on Tuesday also said the UK risked losing access to markets and skills when leaving Euratom. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the NIA, said: “We’ve had today two select committee reports that have both touched on this. The industry has been and is clear to government we are ready to do what we can – but it needs the government to get on with this and engage now, regardless of all the other issues they have to deal with.” Theresa May’s decision to call a general election had made matters worse, he added, because it had squeezed the time available to establish alternatives to the treaty. Euratom was first signed in 1957 by Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and covers nuclear power station inspections, trade of materials and research. The UK’s departure will mean the government needs to agree a new inspections regime with the International Atomic Energy Agency to replace Euratom inspectors. “If the UK has not replaced the Euratom safeguards regime with its own system by the time it left Euratom, normal business could be disrupted right across the nuclear industry,” the NIA paper said. Falling back on World Trade Organisation standards would risk putting the UK in breach of its obligations in international nuclear law, the organisation added. Nuclear cooperation agreements (NCAs) would also need to be put in place with key nuclear countries outside the EU, including the US, Japan and Australia, because the UK’s agreements with those governments are currently based on its membership of Euratom. The report said: “Leaving the Euratom treaty without alternative arrangements in place would have a dramatic impact on the nuclear industry including the UK’s new build plans, existing operations and the waste and decommissioning sector which all depend, to some extent, on cooperation with nuclear states.” Greatrex said that matters were complicated by the fact that things had to be done in sequence, rather than in parallel. The new safeguards and inspection regime needed to be in place before the NCAs were struck, for example. Nuclear experts said that despite the dire warnings, the industry was not exaggerating the risks. Dame Sue Ion, honorary president of the Nuclear Skills Academy and former chair of the Nuclear Innovation Research Advisory Board, said: “It’s absolutely real [the impact if alternatives are not in place]. It literally does mean you cannot move material or IP [intellectual property] or services or components or medical isotopes.” She was echoed by Rupert Cowen, a senior nuclear energy lawyer at Prospect Law. “I don’t think they’re overstating the case,” he told the Guardian. Cowen was critical of officials in government who he called “ignorant” of the impact of leaving Euratom and who “think it’ll be alright on the night. It won’t.” The NIA urged the government to give “strong consideration” to remaining a member of Euratom if it had not thrashed out new deals and arrangements by the end of the two-year window triggered by article 50. A government spokesperson said: “The UK has a world-leading nuclear industry and the government is working to ensure effective arrangements remain in place for nuclear co-operation with both Europe and the rest of the world. We will remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/feb/16/politics-live-readers-edition-thursday-16-february","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T14:49:51Z","webTitle":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Thursday 16 February","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/feb/16/politics-live-readers-edition-thursday-16-february","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/feb/16/politics-live-readers-edition-thursday-16-february","fields":{"headline":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Thursday 16 February","bodyText":"The Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, has been criticised for failing to turn up to a hustings in Stoke-on-Trent, where he is contesting next Thursday’s byelection. How our politics looks from the outside part 2,764: the leader of the socialist group in the European parliament wishes the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was “more European”, reports Daniel Boffey, our Brussels bureau chief. Writing in the New Statesman, Anoosh Chakelian explores whether Jeremy Corbyn’s support for the Brexit vote is impacting his core support. It begins: One thing all of Labour’s factions can agree on is that Jeremy Corbyn faced a tricky dilemma over Brexit. While two-thirds of Labour voters backed Remain, around seven in ten Labour constituencies voted Leave. While a great many of his support base and new party members – urban dwellers, young people, middle-class professionals, people with degrees – are pro-EU, the majority of Labour MPs represent constituents who are in favour of Brexit.

Guardian comment pages are supposed to be a haven from the Twitter/social media rant-orama, not an extension of it. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. And here are some of the main ones on our site this morning. Britain’s top judge has spoken out about media attacks on the judiciary and the failure of politicians to stand up for judges after the Brexit court challenge. The government has named and shamed a record 350 firms for underpaying their staff, with the list of offenders topped by Debenhams after nearly 12,000 of the department store’s workers were short-changed. The hopes of British fishermen that the UK can win its “waters back” after Brexit are expected to be dashed by the European parliament, despite the campaign promises of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, a leaked EU document reveals. The prime minister has been accused of ducking the issue of whether the government supports a new nuclear power station in west Cumbria on a visit to Copeland ahead of the constituency’s byelection. The scale of Britain’s task in negotiating a successful Brexit has been underlined by a cross-party report from the French senate vowing that the UK must not be allowed to leave the EU in a better-off position than it is now, and if necessary a withdrawal without an agreement has to be considered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/01/car-chokehold-britain-polluted-inefficient-transport-system-motor-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-01T15:48:36Z","webTitle":"The car has a chokehold on Britain.

It’s time to free ourselves","bodyText":"We tell ourselves that we cherish efficiency. Yet we have created a transport system whose design principle is profligacy. Metal carriages (that increase in size every year), each carrying one or two people, travel in parallel to the same places. Lorries shifting identical goods in opposite directions pass each other on 2,000-mile journeys. Competing parcel companies ply the same routes, in largely empty vans. We could, perhaps, reduce our current vehicle movements by 90% with no loss of utility, and a major gain in our quality of life. But to contest this peculiar form of insanity is, as I know to my cost, to be widely declared insane. Look at how advertising is dominated by car companies, and you begin to understand the drive to ensure that this counter-ergonomic system persists. Look at the lobbying power of the motor industry and its support in the media, and you see why successive plans to address pollution seemed designed to fail. Suggest a neater system, and you will be shouted down by people insisting that they don’t want to live in a planned economy. But in this respect (and others) we do live in a planned economy. These days transport planners make a few concessions to cyclists, pedestrians and buses, but their overriding aim is still to maximise the flow of private vehicles. Rather than encouraging the more efficient use of existing infrastructure, they keep increasing the space into which inefficiency can expand. The government’s new pollution plan notes that its actions will be limited, as “we must maintain discipline on public spending”. Yet it sustains what the Department for Transport boasts is the “biggest upgrade to roads in a generation”. Launched in 2014, at the height of David Cameron’s austerity programme, this plan promised to “triple levels of spending by the end of the decade”, with £15bn for 100 new road schemes. New roads do not solve traffic congestion. They exacerbate it. By increasing flow in some parts of the network, they generate bottlenecks in others. Governments then seek to bypass the bottleneck, creating a worse one further along the system. It doesn’t matter how often and how powerfully the induction of traffic by roads is demonstrated (the first findings were published in 1937); the programme persists. No holistic solution to the multiple problems caused by this planned chaos can be contemplated, as efficiency would be injurious to special interests. Success is measured by miles travelled, rather than needs met. It’s like measuring the health of the population by the weight of medicines it consumes. No sacrifice, in lives, land or gold, is sufficient to appease the metal god. A new subprime crisis, involving cars rather than houses, threatens to help catalyse another crash, as the personal contract plans under which most cars are now bought load some households with impossible debts. But yet again the government avoids fundamental questions about how and why we use transport, and whether we could do it better, like the plague. It has proposed the narrowest of all possible responses to the high court ruling that obliges it to take action on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions. It claims that “exceedances in NO2 are highly localised – limited, for the most part, to a few problem roads rather than an entire town or city centre.” But given that there are tens of thousands of roads in the UK, and only 300 air quality monitoring sites, not all of which measure NO2, how on earth does it know? Local authorities will be allowed to introduce clean air zones – by far the most effective and cost-efficient measure – only when other (mostly useless) options have been exhausted. Efficiency must in all cases be discouraged. As soon as “legal compliance is achieved”, these zones must be removed. Legal compliance is not the same as public safety, especially if it’s based on limited measurements. NO2 is just one component of pollution. Another is particulates, to which, according to a government paper, “there is no known safe level for exposure”. Shouldn’t the government do everything it can to address the assault on our bodies, rather than the minimum required to avoid another defeat in court? But fear not: by 2040, no new diesel or petrol vehicles will be sold in the UK. This, apparently, is the appropriate timetable for responding to what a parliamentary committee calls a “public health emergency”. A child born today will be 23 by the time this policy matures – by then the damage to the development of her lungs and brain will have been done. And the switch might have happened anyway, without the government’s help. Volvo has announced that it will sell only electric or hybrid-electric cars from 2019 onwards. The Dutch bank ING predicts that all new cars in Europe will be electric by 2035. Let no one accuse this government of ambition. Even if this policy were enacted more swiftly, it seeks to ensure that nothing else in our extravagant system changes. Electric cars solve only part of the problem. They occupy less air, but just as much road and parking space. The resources required to manufacture them – and the volume of mines and ports and processing plants that wreck rare habitats around the world – might even intensify. While the total carbon emissions and air pollution caused by electric cars will be lower than those the fossil system produces, electricity use will have to rise. If you are among those who support electric cars but oppose nuclear power, you may have to reconsider one of your positions. So let’s explore some pollution solutions that change this ridiculous system, rather than extending it indefinitely. Why not – through shifting road space from cars to bicycles in the form of safe cycle lanes – aim to make cycling the main form of urban transport? Why not launch a scrappage scheme that trades cars for public transport tokens? Why not implement the ingenious plan proposed by the economist Alan Storkey, for an upgraded intercity coach service that’s as fast and convenient as private transport, but uses a fraction of the road space? In other sectors, progress is marked by reducing the volume of a system while enhancing its utility. Why does the same principle not apply to transport?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/22/new-coalmines-will-worsen-poverty-and-escalate-climate-change-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-21T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"New coalmines will worsen poverty and escalate climate change, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/22/new-coalmines-will-worsen-poverty-and-escalate-climate-change-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/22/new-coalmines-will-worsen-poverty-and-escalate-climate-change-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"New coalmines will worsen poverty and escalate climate change, report finds","bodyText":"New coalmines will leave more people in poverty, Oxfam has said in a new report, calling on Australia to commit to no new coalmines and to end public subsidies for coalmining. The report comes as the Queensland and federal governments continue to push for the controversial Adani coalmine in the Galilee basin, signalling potential infrastructure support and “royalty holidays”. The government’s support for the mine, which would be the biggest in Australia, has been met with a fierce campaign of resistance from environmental, legal, social justice and human rights groups. The Oxfam report, More Coal Equals More Poverty, says the climate change impacts of coal-fired power will disproportionately affect the world’s poor and – with most of the energy-poor households in developing countries beyond the reach of electricity grids – new coal-fired power plants won’t bring them energy. “Renewables are the clear answer to bringing electricity to those who currently live without it,” the report says. “The real cost of burning more coal will be measured in further entrenched poverty – through the escalating impacts of climate change and humanitarian disasters, increasing hunger and deaths and disease caused by pollution.” The Oxfam report cites the example of the two most populous nations on earth – with emerging middle classes in the hundreds of millions – China and India, which have recently suspended or abandoned plans to build new coal-fired power plants in favour of renewable energy. China has suspended more than 100 planned or partly-constructed coal-fired plants and has earmarked more than $493m for renewables projects over the next three years. India’s draft 10-year energy blueprint, released in December, predicts 57% of the country’s total electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027, far above the Paris climate accord target of 40% by 2030. India and China also have nuclear power. The Oxfam report calls on the Australian government to prohibit new coalmines in the country and to end public subsidies for coalmining. It identified, in particular, the Indian conglomerate Adani’s proposed Carmichael coalmine in the Galilee basin, which would be the largest coalmine in Australia’s history. The state and federal governments are supportive of the mine. The federal resources minister, Matt Canavan, has consistently said the mine is “great news for regional Queensland and ... will boost the Queensland and Australian economies”. The federal government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility is considering funding Adani’s coal rail line to the coast, while the Queensland government has reportedly offered Adani a “royalties holiday” worth more than $300m from state coffers. But the mine faces a financing impasse. Globally 19 banks, most recently Westpac, have either specifically or by way of stated policy committed to not funding the Adani project. Subsidising coal-fired power plants is “clinging to the technologies of the past”, the Oxfam report says. “Australia’s current stance is fundamentally at odds with the global shift to renewable energy and ignores our responsibility to help protect communities from the ravages of climate change, the opportunities for new jobs and prosperity through renewable energy, and the global goals of achieving universal energy access and ending poverty.” Oxfam Australia’s chief executive, Helen Szoke, said the development of renewables in Australia had been hampered by shifting government agenda and a lack of policy certainty over several years. “Against the backdrop of an imperilled Great Barrier Reef and extreme weather disasters, Australia’s carbon pollution is continuing to climb – the tragic consequence of more than a decade of climate policy paralysis and short-term political opportunism,” she said. “Renewable energy is set to power the fair economies of the future and Australia can make a choice to be part of that. Through its 2017 review of climate change policies, the Australian government has the opportunity to set a credible long-term goal and plan of action.” The next round of global climate talks will be held in Bonn in November. But the meeting, COP 23, is being chaired by Fiji, which has said it will bring the concerns of developing and vulnerable Pacific states to the fore of negotiations. The Pacific – which, as a region, has the lowest per capita emissions in the world – has felt the impacts of climate first and most acutely. Pacific states, many of which are low-lying archipelagos, have experienced cyclones and storm surges of increased frequency and power and are losing arable land and, in some cases, whole islands to rising sea levels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/15/tracking-trump-clinton-memoir-daca-democrats-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Tracking Trump: Clinton warns of dystopia and Trump pivots on Daca","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/tracking-trump-clinton-memoir-daca-democrats-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/tracking-trump-clinton-memoir-daca-democrats-deal","fields":{"headline":"Tracking Trump: Clinton warns of dystopia and Trump pivots on Daca","bodyText":"There had been some doubt last week about how significant or long-lasting Donald Trump’s sudden overtures to the Democrats actually were. But after his debt-ceiling and disaster-relief deal with the Democratic leaders he calls “Chuck and Nancy”, Trump decided to repeat the trick this week with a different issue. Last weekend Just as he had for Hurricane Harvey during its march towards Texas last month, Trump spent the weekend tweeting out warnings about the latest forecasts for Hurricane Irma, which rampaged through the Caribbean and was due to strike Florida imminently. In Russia news, the Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert Mueller had notified the White House that his team would try to seek interviews with six current and former Trump aides as part of the investigation into Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election, including former press secretary Sean Spicer, former chief of staff Reince Priebus and interim communications director Hope Hicks. Another former White House fixture, ex-chief strategist Steve Bannon, continued a post-government media offensive with a warning that China – his bête noire – was “Germany in 1930 … It could go one way or the other.” Bannon was fired last month during chief of staff John Kelly’s ongoing attempts to get a grip on a dysfunctional White House, but some observers suggest the Breitbart chief still exerts a strong influence over the president. Chuck Schumer, who along with his fellow congressional Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi struck an unlikely legislative deal with Trump the week before, revealed the president’s reaction to media coverage of their pact. “I got a call early this morning,” Schumer said. “He said, ‘This was so great!’ Here’s what he said: ‘Do you watch Fox News?’ I said, ‘Not really.’ ‘They’re praising you!’ Meaning me. But he said, ‘And your stations’ – I guess meaning MSNBC and CNN – ‘are praising me! This is great!’” Monday Trump commemorated the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington with a speech at the Pentagon “making plain to these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach, no sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large earth”. Also on the warpath was Bannon, who, in a TV interview in which he wore two shirts, accused the GOP establishment of trying to “nullify” last year’s presidential election and called on those in the administration who disagreed with the president to step down. He singled out economic adviser Gary Cohn, who had denounced Trump’s equivocating on neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. “If you don’t like what [Trump’s] doing and you don’t agree with it, you have an obligation to resign,” Bannon said. Tuesday At the risk of turning this column into Tracking Steve, it was notable that Bannon popped up again in Hong Kong, repeating his contention that stopping China’s road to world domination is the defining issue of our era, but more unusually taking care to heap praise on the country’s president Xi Jinping. “I don’t think there’s a world leader that President Trump respects more than the president of China,” Bannon said. “Xi is very impressive.” He added that a “very aggressive” Trump would arrive in China in November determined to “avoid a trade war, which is detrimental to both countries”. As Hillary Clinton’s election memoir hit the shelves, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed her criticisms of the president as an attempt to boost sales and called this a “sad” end to her political career. In the book, What Happened, the former Democratic presidential candidate draws parallels between Trump’s “war on truth” and the Soviet Union and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. In a rare dyspeptic outburst during what was generally a calm week on Twitter, the president lashed out at “people writing books and major articles about me and yet they know nothing about me &amp; have zero access”. (He probably didn’t mean Clinton.) And there were reports the Trump campaign had begun to hand over documents to Mueller, as the special counsel’s investigation continued to tick away. Wednesday The Guardian reported that US congressional investigators were examining whether Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser who is one of the key figures being investigated by Mueller, secretly promoted a plan by private business interests to build US-Russian nuclear power plants in the Middle East while he was serving in the White House. They were also examining whether the proposal was still being promoted by the Trump administration, months after Flynn was forced out of his role. That evening Trump’s newfound love of bipartisanship seemed to bear fruit once more, with Chuck and Nancy leaving a White House dinner to say they had struck a deal to protect the so-called Dreamers the president had plunged into insecurity last week when he cancelled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme that gave them the temporary right to live, study and work in America. In exchange the Democrats had agreed to unspecified border-security measures, they said – but that did not include support for a wall on the Mexican border. Not so fast, interrupted Sanders, tweeting that there had “certainly not” been an agreement excluding the wall. Thursday But before long her boss was awake and contradicting her in true Trump style. On his way to visit Florida, the president told reporters he was “fairly close” to a deal with Democrats along the lines Schumer and Pelosi had suggested the night before. And he confirmed: “The wall will come later.” The reaction from Trump’s most vocal hard-right supporters was furious, with conservative commentator Ann Coulter tweeting: “At this point, who DOESN’T want Trump impeached?” and Bannon’s Breitbart website running the critical headline “Amnesty Don”. It remained to be seen whether Trump’s rank and file supporters were similarly exercised. They may not be. The American public is divided on the issue of immigration, but there is widespread sympathy for the Dreamers, who were brought to the US illegally as children. A Politico-Morning Consult poll last week showed 54% wanting Congress to give them a path to citizenship, while 73% wanted to protect them from deportation. Any deal on Daca would still have to win considerable Republican support to pass, something the neglected Republican leader Paul Ryan pointed out. And the notoriously fickle Trump could always take umbrage at some perceived slight from Chuck and Nancy, or sense that the Democrats had not conceded enough ground, and back out. But for now, at least, it seemed Trump had calculated that he could gain more from reaching across the aisle on popular issues such as Daca and flood spending than from continuing with the frustrating experience of working with his own dysfunctional and disunited party on rightwing issues such as repealing Obamacare. Friday British prime minister Theresa May rebuked Trump for suggesting the people responsible for an explosion on a London tube train were known to the Metropolitan police. Early Friday morning, Trump tweeted: “Another attack in London by a loser terrorist. These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!” The perpetrators were as yet unidentified and it was not clear whether they were known to authorities. “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,” May said. Trump was also sighted congratulating an 11-year-old who was invited to mow the White House lawn. The child runs a lawn service in a nearby neighborhood and had offered to clip the Rose Garden. A mirthful scene ensued when Trump failed in an attempt to greet him owing to the boy’s laser-like mowing focus.

The old certainties of centralised power and fossil fuels are falling apart before our eyes. In Paris last week world leaders set legally binding targets to decarbonise their economies in order to keep temperature rises at a maximum of 2C. The future is almost here. It’s a future that is necessary and one that presents the economic opportunity of the century. Bloomberg NEFs New Energy Outlook for 2015 estimates that renewables alone will see more than $8tn of investment in the coming years with $3.7tn in solar alone. Until recently the UK seemed to understand this, however imperfectly. In the second quarter of this year, the UK got 25% of its electricity from renewables and is aiming for 30% by 2020. The last two governments deserve credit for that. Costs have fallen, with the latest ground-mounted solar and onshore wind now cheaper than new nuclear , and offshore wind – where the UK is a world leader – is not far behind. But with the industry on the cusp of the mainstream, the last six months have seen a radical, dangerous U-turn from the government. Onshore wind and large solar have seen support removed and applications blocked through planning; the climate change levy exemption was removed from renewable electricity scheme; the zero carbon homes target and energy efficiency schemes have been scrapped; the Green Investment Bank is threatened with privatisation, tax relief has been removed from community schemes. And on, and on, and on. The government’s line is that it’s time to pull the plug on supporting renewable energy – as if a few years of vital subsidies can make up for a century of economic and infrastructural support for fossil fuels. Renewable energy, like most industries, needs some government support to get going, and to realise the best results. Think of the tax breaks and research grants still given to oil and gas, the direct subsidies for nuclear, the publicly-funded roads that facilitate cars, or the national space programmes that eventually brought us the mobile phone. The argument that this U-turn is about protecting consumers’ bills simply does not hold. Cuts to rooftop solar announced on Thursday will save just 0.9% off a yearly bill, by 2020. Many of the alternatives the government is turning to are actually more expensive than renewables – Hinkley Point C would cost consumers twice the current wholesale price of electricity. And the single best thing that would cut bills – insulating homes – has seen just about all public support scrapped. Contrast the rhetoric on renewables with the huge support for fracking and nuclear and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the government has its favourites. All this is hurting people, investment and business. About 20,000 people could lose their jobs as a result of the latest changes to rooftop solar. Entrepreneurs and investors may walk away from the sector , and who could blame them? A vast amount of human capital in skills, training and motivation will be wasted. EY has repeatedly warned of the devastation that ministers are causing, deliberately or not, to inward investment. In response to criticism that it has been cutting support for renewables the government is now talking up innovation, highlighting a plan to double investment in clean energy research and development (although much of this seems to be for nuclear). But innovation isn’t what you do instead of supporting investment today. It’s not either/or. It is no accident that those countries with the largest renewable manufacturing industries also have thriving local markets. Innovation comes, in part, from getting on with it. The cost of solar has fallen by 80% in just the last few years – driven in large part by rapid learning and scale deployment thanks to the support of governments worldwide. In the UK researchers across the country are always looking at new ways to make renewables even cheaper and more effective – from super-efficient perovskite solar cells in Bath, to graphene materials in Manchester. In other technologies, from tidal energy in Orkney and new forms of offshore turbine foundations in Glasgow and Blyth – progress is continuing on hundreds of fronts. And the opportunities provided by renewables are much bigger than turbines and panels. These are disruptive technologies that open huge new avenues. The industry that has been born by the smart phone is not just chips and handsets, but in software, services and dating apps. So too with renewables. Businesses that can get the most from the large amount of renewables already in the system could do well. Energy storage and smarter grid management are two of the hottest areas for businesses looking to take advantage of the recent surge in renewables, since they can improve the economics, and store power for those times the sun isn’t shining or the wind doesn’t blow. Schemes are being developed in which people are paid an annual fee for access to a home battery, which when aggregated into their thousands can be used to help balance the grid. Yet these opportunities are only available thanks to the rapid growth we have seen in recent years, and to continue the sector needs stability and political support. If the government really wants innovation continue, it needs to provide both. In the long run? We’ll be green. Solar and its friends will triumph, and one day will undoubtedly to be some of the biggest industries in the world, including in the UK. In meantime businesses will need to be resilient."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/dec/02/hinkley-point-edf-new-crisis-safety-checks-french-nuclear-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-02T19:37:51Z","webTitle":"New blow for Hinkley Point contractor EDF after French safety checks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/hinkley-point-edf-new-crisis-safety-checks-french-nuclear-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/dec/02/hinkley-point-edf-new-crisis-safety-checks-french-nuclear-plants","fields":{"headline":"New blow for Hinkley Point contractor EDF after French safety checks","bodyText":"The company building the UK’s first new nuclear power station for decades is facing questions over the health of its fleet of French nuclear plants after an investigation which has left the country with the lowest level of nuclear power for 10 years and the prospect of power cuts during a cold snap. Thirteen of Électricité de France’s (EDF) 58 atomic plants are offline, some due to planned maintenance, but most for safety checks ordered by the regulator over anomalies discovered in reactor parts. The outages have prompted warnings of potential planned power cuts and pushed up wholesale power prices, boosting coal and gas operators but squeezing small energy suppliers. Carbon emissions will possibly rise too as France, which last year forged a historic climate change deal in Paris, has to import more fossil fuel power. The problems stem from a fault identified last year by the Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) in the as-yet-unfinished reactor at north-western France’s Flamanville plant – the same design approved for Hinkley Point C in the UK. Pierre-Franck Chevet, president of the ASN, told Le Figaro the situation was “very worrying” and the discovery had led to “unprecedented” checks at all the country’s nuclear plants, which provide 75% of France’s electricity and normally help it export power to other countries. The issue is higher than expected carbon concentrations in steel reactor components, which could make them vulnerable to cracking. EDF insist its French fleet, much of which dates back to the 1980s, is safe and that its reactors will start coming back online within weeks. And while experts do not expect the episode to result in a big financial hit to EDF, they believe it could turn up the pressure on a company which is already stretched. “The longer than expected outages at some of EDF’s nuclear plants place additional pressure on the company at a time that it is already under significant financial stress,” said Jim Watson, research director at the UK Energy Research Centre. “It has already taken a big risk in pursuing the Hinkley C project in the UK because other reactors using that design [in Finland and France] have suffered from delays and large cost overruns.” Peter Atherton, associate at analysts Cornwall Energy, said the failure of earlier inspections to pick up on problems was “a very serious thing, a bit of a stain on the whole French programme”. A spokesman for EDF – which has already cut its nuclear electricity output target and its profits expectations for this year – said the company was confident the reactors would reopen by the end of December. “Safety is our top priority,” he said. “EDF as operator is responsible for nuclear safety, and we have the presence of an independent and strong safety authority (ASN).” But the most immediate concern is the possibility of power cuts in the world’s fifth biggest economy. French grid operator RTE said the low nuclear output and France’s unusually high reliance on electric heating meant a cold snap could result in “exceptional measures”. Those include lowering the voltage and, as a last resort, rolling power cuts around the country for two hours or so at a time. The outages have also pushed up European wholesale power prices. Henry Edwardes-Evans, an energy trading expert at Platts Power in Europe, said the reduced nuclear output and rising coal costs over the summer had been a “double whammy” that has driven up wholesale prices, which have been low in recent years. The higher wholesale prices have also caused problems for smaller energy suppliers. “The nuclear outages played a significant role in GB Energy going bust,” said Atherton, referring to the three-year-old UK supplier with 160,000 customers which ceased trading last weekend, blaming “swift and significant increases in energy prices”. Nuclear critics believe the situation shows the need for France to diversify away from nuclear and invest more in renewable sources such as wind and solar power, which account for less than 4% of electricity generation, compared with 25% in the UK. Charlotte Mijeon, of the anti-nuclear group Sortir du Nucléaire (Get Out of Nuclear), said there was a “chain of responsibility” for the crisis in France’s nuclear industry which ranged from the government at the top to subcontracted private suppliers. “The system of nuclear safety in France has always been limited,” she said. “It starts from the premise that the industrials are honest and the moment there is a problem they will flag it up to the safety authorities and it will be sorted out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/feb/27/coalition-handpicks-mining-lobbyist-for-abc-board-position","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-27T06:40:18Z","webTitle":"Coalition handpicks mining lobbyist for ABC board position","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/27/coalition-handpicks-mining-lobbyist-for-abc-board-position","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/feb/27/coalition-handpicks-mining-lobbyist-for-abc-board-position","fields":{"headline":"Coalition handpicks mining lobbyist for ABC board position","bodyText":"The Coalition has handpicked Western Australian mining lobbyist Vanessa Guthrie to sit on the ABC board, bypassing the independent nomination panel. Guthrie is the chair of the Minerals Council of Australia and until December was managing director of uranium developer Toro Energy. Along with Queensland rural leader and businesswoman Georgina Somerset, Guthrie has been appointed by the government to sit on the ABC board for a period of five years. But unlike Somerset who was put on a shortlist by the independent nomination panel, Guthrie was chosen directly by the government, which is allowed under the legislation but is not common practice. “Dr Guthrie also participated in the nomination panel process and whilst not on the panel’s final list of recommendations, was identified by the government as having the requisite skills to be a suitable appointment to the board,” a statement from the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, said. “The government thanks the nomination panel for its work undertaking the selection process and providing a list of nominees for the government’s consideration. “I congratulate Dr Guthrie and Ms Somerset on their appointments and look forward to seeing the valuable contributions they will make to the ABC board.” The managing director of the ABC Michelle Guthrie – no relation to Vanessa Guthrie – is expected to face Senate estimates on Tuesday ahead of a major restructure of the ABC to be announced next week. Last year Vanessa Guthrie told the Australian Financial Review she was concerned about social activists who want to stop development. “[The east coast] is severely under attack from social activism,” she said. “It needs all the help it can get. But it means that the rest of the minerals industry gets somewhat tarnished by the coal debate and I think unfairly. I think coal is under attack unfairly so, even though I am a very strong advocate of clean energy and renewables, but coal has a role as does uranium and nuclear power.” She also targeted activists who used social media to get their message across. “Every social activist uses a mobile phone and tweets,” she said. “Where do you think a mobile phone comes from?” she asks. “Sixty-one minerals are in a mobile phone. Sixty-one different elements that the world mines to produce mobile phones are in there. Without mining you wouldn’t have an iPhone. And how do you think it gets powered?” The nominations panel is appointed by the prime minister’s department and is tasked with conducting a selection process based on merit and providing the communications minister with a shortlist of three candidates for each position. The Australian’s conservative columnist Janet Albrechtsen was replaced on the panel last year by public relations executive Anne Fulwood. The nomination panel is currently working on a replacement for the chair of the ABC Jim Spigelman.

They said the projects, which are key to efforts to keep the UK’s lights on, could be at risk if the energy sector is denied entry to Europe’s internal energy market. That looks increasingly likely, after the European parliament passed a resolution on Wednesday opposing “piecemeal or sectoral provisions” for individual UK industries. Speaking at an event organised by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, experts said plans by French power firm EDF to build two new reactors at Hinkley Point C could be affected. Antony Froggatt, senior research fellow at Chatham House, said EDF was already concerned that Brexit will make it harder to import skilled EU nationals to build Hinkley, which is slated to provide 7% of UK electricity. “I was at a conference recently where EDF were saying their main concern about skills was specialised steel fitters for the construction of Hinkley,” he said. “They said there were not enough in the country to build Hinkley and therefore this is the main area that they’re concerned about.” He added that the staff shortage could be exacerbated by the building of the HS2 high-speed rail link, which will be competing with Hinkley to attract steel fitters. EDF did not return requests for comment. Froggatt and his fellow panellists at the ECIU event also raised concerns about the impact on plans for interconnectors, wires connecting the UK with the European electricity network. Interconnectors are considered increasingly important as Britain turns to renewable energy, because they allow electricity to be imported to make up for shortfalls when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. Plans are in place to build 14GW of interconnectors between the UK and countries including Norway, France, Belgium and Iceland. But building them could prove less attractive to investors if the UK cannot remain part of Europe’s internal energy market. This is because the agreement allows electricity to be automatically traded on a short-term “intra-day” basis, improving efficiency and making it more lucrative to build interconnectors. Energy lawyer Munir Hassan, of CMS Cameron McKenna, said anything that deterred investors from building them could force the UK to spend on other projects to provide electricity at short notice. “We would have to provide for more homegrown capacity, which means more investment in spare idle capacity. That is at a cost and the cost goes to customers,” he said. “It [loss of access to the internal energy market] would tend to have a chilling effect,” added Prof Michael Grubb from University College London. The panellists also warned that an inability to access the lower energy prices offered by intra-day trading, coupled with any new tariffs on energy imports could also drive up energy prices for UK consumers. Grubb said it was vital that Britain’s Brexit negotiators realise the importance of securing energy cooperation with Europe. “The implications of Brexit for energy policy hasn’t so far been a talking point, but it ought to be,” he said. “Get it wrong, bills will rise and energy security could fall; get it right, and UK consumers and businesses can enjoy the benefits of free energy trade with the continent, with Britain playing a key role in the continent’s continued energy development,” he said. Froggatt also stressed the importance of drafting a successor to Euratom, the pan-European agency on nuclear safety. “Achieving a timely but smooth exit from Euratom is essential as there is no ‘WTO’ agreement to fall back on,” he said. “Brexatom without a replacement will lead to cessation of the movement of nuclear materials and no verification for the non-proliferation of nuclear material.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/sep/18/hinkley-point-not-precedent-other-nuclear-bradwell-sizewell-cgn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-18T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Hinkley must not be taken as a precedent for other nuclear stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/18/hinkley-point-not-precedent-other-nuclear-bradwell-sizewell-cgn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/sep/18/hinkley-point-not-precedent-other-nuclear-bradwell-sizewell-cgn","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley must not be taken as a precedent for other nuclear stations","bodyText":"Despite the majority of the British public being opposed to a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C, according to various surveys, Theresa May has approved the £18bn project. The arguments against it are well understood – cost, safety and national security. On the first point, George Osborne, the former chancellor, was on the radio supporting the project last week, claiming that the costs would be borne by French group EDF and its Chinese partner CGN. That is disingenuous at best, misleading at worst. EDF and CGN expect to make a profit from their investment and the National Audit Office has said the project could cost taxpayers almost £30bn in subsidies to these companies. Other factors May had to consider when making a final call about whether to go ahead with Hinkley included the diplomatic repercussions of scrapping a project that was significant to France and China. The shadow of Brexit also hung over the decision: this is not a time to be damaging relationships with two key trading partnerships. EDF and CGN’s reputations were on the line. EDF has lost its finance director and is at war with its trade unions because of the project. China – a country not renowned for taking disappointment well – has said the opportunity to invest in UK nuclear will allow it to advertise its technological expertise to the world. As a result, May faced a decision akin to not inviting your boss to your wedding. It is your day, you are more than entitled to make that decision and you probably shouldn’t have invited them in the first place: but snubbing them is not going to be positive for your career prospects. The government was not overwhelmed by alternatives either. Yes, Rolls-Royce could build smaller nuclear reactors around the country and yes, other forms of renewable energy could help. But Hinkley is scheduled to start producing electricity by 2025 and deliver 7% of the UK’s energy needs. Could the other options really deliver that much electricity in the same time frame? One of the criticisms of Hinkley is that it is an answer to an old question, with energy requirements and technology evolving all the time. Well, yes: that is partly because the project was first dreamt up 10 years ago – and to block construction now would eradicate a decade of work. Taking all this into account, it looks like May and her government have played the percentages. They may not have been excited about the idea of Hinkley, but the cons of scrapping it at this stage probably outweigh the pros. However, Britain’s energy strategy beyond Hinkley is another matter. It was surprising that alongside the government’s announcement that the nuclear power plant would go ahead there were suggestions emanating from Whitehall and Beijing that similar projects in Bradwell, Essex, and Sizewell, Suffolk, were also on track. The Bradwell B project is particularly noteworthy because CGN will design the reactor and own two-thirds of it. The Chinese company plans to submit its design for Bradwell within weeks. May and her government must seriously think about whether they want more nuclear power stations popping up around the country. While the decision on whether to proceed with Hinkley became wrapped up with diplomatic issues, Bradwell and Sizewell must only be approved if the government genuinely believes they are the best solution to Britain’s energy issues. Most experts would say they are not. Stopping Bradwell and Sizewell would not be straightforward: one of the main reasons that CGN supported Hinkley Point was so it could develop its own power station at Bradwell. However, it is possible that the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the government could, for example, reject CGN’s design for the reactor. Or the Chinese could be offered the opportunity to invest in another high-technology project on attractive terms, such as High Speed 2. So, while Hinkley could finally become a reality, the debate about nuclear power stations is far from over. A good start on pay reform Reform is coming to the world of executive pay, or so our new prime minister leads us to believe, but what form should it take? Iain Wright’s business, innovation and skills select committee promised on Friday to lift the floorboards not just on executive pay, but on corporate governance and the composition of boardrooms, including workers’ representatives. That is a very wide brief – possibly too wide to achieve consensus. In the meantime, Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), the fund management arm of the insurance company, put forward two proposals that have the virtue of being easy to understand. First, LGIM said public companies should publish the ratio between the chief executive’s pay and that of the median employee. This idea is so sensible that it is a wonder it is still regarded as vaguely controversial. It is true, as the critics grumble, that ratios are crudely measured and don’t tell the whole story of a company’s approach to pay. But, come on, boards of large public companies have spent 20 years bamboozling the outside world, and their shareholders, with the complexity of their pay schemes. A dose of crudity would be welcome and oblige remuneration committees to look beyond the boardroom. Second, LGIM says directors’ annual bonuses should be capped at two times salary. This idea is more inflammatory because some remuneration committees seem to believe that executives won’t put in a decent shift unless they are chasing bonuses worth up to 500% of salary. Such inflation has served to disguise the truth about bonuses. They have become a form of semi-guaranteed salary supplement: an executive has to mess up monumentally to get nothing. In the process, the original meaning of a bonus – a reward for exceptional performance – has been ignored. A cap at 200% would restore a degree of sanity. LGIM’s proposals should not be regarded as full package. Much more is needed for public’s trust in business is to improve. But they are a start. Sensible boards should comply, rather than a kick up a fuss that will only invite heavy intervention by government. Carney’s schoolboy error Headline writers owe a debt of thanks to the schoolchildren of Coventry. More than three years after he became the governor of the Bank of England, a gentle grilling of Mark Carney at the Whitley Academy winkled out a piece of information that had eluded Fleet Street’s finest in their many interviews and profiles of him. Asked what his nickname had been as a child in Canada, a startled Carney said it had been “carnage”, an admission that will undoubtedly come back to haunt him should the economy go awry under his stewardship. Carnage Carney struggled to explain monetary policy without lapsing into jargon and at one stage felt he had to explain to his teenage audience that John Lennon was a member of a 1960s group called the Beatles. Never work with children or animals, WC Fields once said.

With Labor and the Greens opposed to any such change, the government will likely need the support of the crossbench to overhaul the CEFC’s mandate. Currently, the CEFC cannot invest in any project that does not reduce emissions by 50% or more on the average across the national electricity market. That prohibition is contained in CEFC investment guidelines, which means it may be possible to change without parliament’s support. The CEFC legislation, enacted by the previous Labor government, rules out funding nuclear power and carbon capture and storage and will require Senate support to change. Xenophon told Guardian Australia on Wednesday the government was yet to approach him about the proposal but “instinctively, we’ve got real concerns about it”. “The issue is that funding that goes to a coal generator will inevitably mean that other projects miss out.” The leader of the NXT has been looking at ways to try and convince the government to look again at an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector – a form of carbon trading – which the government ruled out after a brief internal revolt. It is possible Xenophon could use a discussion about the CEFC’s mandate to try and persuade the government to keep an open mind on carbon trading. At a press conference with the International Energy Agency executive director, Fatih Birol, the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was looking at all its options, including changing the CEFC rules, to ensure a “technology-neutral” approach to energy. Guardian Australia understands the government is examining options to change the CEFC’s investment rules on “high energy, low emissions” coal power plants because it may be possible to do so in a way that prevents the Senate disallowing the change. Birol said carbon capture and storage would need to play a “stronger role” if the world was to meet its target of 2C of warming. “For this, there is a need for a greater initiative from countries, maybe such as Australia,” he said. “There is a lot of interest [in CCS] but investment is not appropriately proportional to that interest.” He acknowledged that without taxpayer subsidies it would be difficult to make CCS viable. Birol said CCS did not yet match renewables for the cost of bringing emissions down but suggested further investment and development could change that. Birol said Australia should “definitely” be relying more on gas energy and the IEA saw “huge chances” for it to increase its production of unconventional gas. Asked about bans on coal seam gas, Birol said the IEA’s analysis showed that with companies’ co-operation environmental problems could be reduced to zero. “I don’t see, in general, a reason to ban unconventional gas exploration and production if those measures are taken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/may/06/labour-condemns-waste-of-money-capacity-market-energy-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-06T16:19:21Z","webTitle":"Labour condemns 'waste of money' energy scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/labour-condemns-waste-of-money-capacity-market-energy-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/may/06/labour-condemns-waste-of-money-capacity-market-energy-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Labour condemns 'waste of money' energy scheme","bodyText":"The government has been accused of burying bad news during an election period after publishing a report (pdf) saying an emergency scheme to keep the lights on could add £38 a year to each household bill. The cash is going towards the cost of a “capacity market” scheme, under which energy companies have been paid to keep their power stations on standby for times of peak demand. A new capacity market auction is planned by the government for next year, following two already held, and the impact assessment report suggests that the cost could be as much as £3bn in 2018, or £38 per household. The government has previously slashed subsidies for wind and solar projects on the grounds that they were driving up consumer bills, but it said the latest initiative would guarantee electricity needs for 2017-18, while protecting against price spikes by securing electricity in advance. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: “Our top priority is ensuring that families and businesses have a secure, affordable, clean energy supply, which they can rely on now and into the future.” DECC argues that the £38 figure is a gross one that should be more than compensated for by the rise in overall power prices that would otherwise occur if the capacity market payments were not made. “If only the announced plant closures occur, we estimate the net impact on bills to be between £10 and £21, depending on the clearing price in the auction,” the spokesperson said. But Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said the capacity market scheme was a “massive waste of money” because previous payments ended up going to nuclear facilities and other plants that would have stayed open regardless. “The Tories are trying to bury this bad news. Every family’s energy bill is to shoot up to pay for these gross new handouts to the big energy companies,” she said. “It has been so badly designed, it isn’t getting new power stations built, but instead is just lining the pockets of the big six and investors in highly polluting diesel generators.” Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said the scheme highlighted the shortsighted nature of energy policies. “The capacity market system inherently favours fossil fuel generation, damaging the environment while delaying the widespread rollout of a flexible grid based on renewables, demand management, storage, interconnection and more efficient practices, as the national infrastructure commission and Energy UK have recently recommended,” she said. Independent energy consultants also expressed concern. David Oliver, a senior consultant at Inenco, said the impact of the latest proposals could not be easily predicted. “It remains to be seen whether these changes will ultimately help secure the much-needed investment in new generation to justify the additional cost to homes and businesses,” he said. Energy companies have been closing coal, gas and other power stations because they say wholesale power prices are so low that it is not commercially viable to keep them open."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/mar/27/senior-ministers-at-odds-over-readiness-of-new-coal-fired-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-27T07:53:00Z","webTitle":"Senior ministers at odds over readiness of new coal-fired power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/27/senior-ministers-at-odds-over-readiness-of-new-coal-fired-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/mar/27/senior-ministers-at-odds-over-readiness-of-new-coal-fired-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"Senior ministers at odds over readiness of new coal-fired power stations","bodyText":"Senior Turnbull government ministers are publicly at odds over the timing of new investment in coal-fired power – with the resources minister suggesting Asian and domestic investors “are very interested” and could build a plant within three years, and the energy minister arguing any investment would be “a long way off.” The resources minister, Matt Canavan, told 2GB on Monday that proponents of “clean” coal-fired power had told him a new power station could be operational in Australia within three years. “There are people that are very interested,” Canavan said. “There are people who are interested in selling their technology and there are people that are interested in adopting it and owning a station here.” “They’re not only from Asia, there are some Australian investors interested too, so they’re the people we’re talking to over the next couple of months.” The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, struck a noticeably different tone when addressing the issue at a press conference with the prime minister and treasurer in Canberra on Monday. Frydenberg confirmed that he had met some investors interested in pursuing clean coal in Australia but any such move would be “a long way off.” The energy minister continued to argue the government had to pursue a technologically neutral approach. “We can’t made a single bet because that would be ruling out certain options that would be available to us,” he said. Frydenberg said coal, gas and renewables would all be required. “I am excited what is happening in renewables and also, thermal generation is so important.” Canavan on Monday repeated a previous signal that the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility could co-invest in a new coal-fired power plant. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has issued a number of public warnings that new coal fired power plants will not get off the ground without substantial government guarantees. In late February, the CEFC’s outgoing chief executive, Oliver Yates, said a new coal-fired plant was not “financeable” without the government agreeing to indemnify the project against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced and against the cost of delays in the project prompted by likely community protest action. The government has already indicated that it intends to change the CEFC’s rules to allow for investment in new coal-fired power. Currently, the CEFC cannot invest in any project that does not reduce emissions by 50% or more on the average across the national electricity market. That prohibition is contained in CEFC investment guidelines, which means it may be possible to change without parliament’s support. The CEFC legislation, enacted by the previous Labor government, rules out funding nuclear power and carbon capture and storage and will require Senate support to change. The government met industry representatives, including Manufacturing Australia, Australian Industry Group, the Energy Users Association of Australia and Major Energy Users Association on Monday, as well as representatives of large gas users, Incitec Pivot, Adelaide Brighton, Qenos, Australian Paper and BOC in Canberra. The groups warned the government there was an urgent need to tackle the barriers to domestic gas supply. Monday’s meeting followed an emergency summit convened by the prime minister with representatives of the LNG industry two weeks ago after warnings were issued that Australia could face energy shortages by next summer in the absence of more gas for the domestic market. The government has warned LNG producers it is prepared to use the commonwealth export powers “in the national interest” if the companies did not deliver more supply to the domestic market. Ministers will meet with gas pipeline operators later this this week ahead of further talks between the government and LNG producers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2020/mar/03/super-tuesday-democrat-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-03T23:16:53Z","webTitle":"Super Tuesday: Democrats cast votes on second most important day of 2020 election – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/03/super-tuesday-democrat-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/03/super-tuesday-democrat-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Super Tuesday: Democrats cast votes on second most important day of 2020 election – as it happened","bodyText":"Voters in 14 states are casting their ballots today.

A smattering of voting issues popped up in Texas, California, Tennesee and Minnesota. As voters took to the polls, lawmakers on Capitol Hill fretted about coronavirus. Donald Trump attended a roundtable with the National Institutes of Health to address the outbreak, and the Fed lowered interest rates as a protective measure. We’re closing this blog, and I’m passing the baton to my colleague Joan E Greve, who will report the results and more. Follow her here: Chula Vista, California’s mayor endorsed Mike Bloomberg. The city’s assemblywoman picked Elizabeth Warren. What do the voters have to say? The Guardian’s West Coast reporter Mario Koran brings us this dispatch: On paper, this should be Bernie Sanders country. Sanders, the clear front runner, boasts 42% of the state’s Latino vote. Chula Vista, just a 10-minute trolley ride away from the US-Mexico border, is about 61% Latino; nearly half the city speaks Spanish. But Warren has made significant inroads here, grabbing the endorsement of Lorena Gonzalez, the high-powered, Latina assemblywoman who represents this district. Last month Gonzalez joined Julian Castro as they stumped for Warren at a brewery not far from Chula Vista. Chula Vista’s mayor, Mary Salas, appeared to be swayed by neither: Her endorsement went to Mike Bloomberg, adding to a growing list of major US cities whose leaders have embraced the former NYC mayor. Some of the cities whose mayors have endorsed Bloomberg are also the beneficiaries of hundreds of millions in grant money from Bloomberg Philanthropies — though Bloomberg’s campaign has scoffed at the suggestion that his support is purchased. A visit to the polls proved that the political view in Chula Vista defies a simple narrative. “Mike proved he can run a city. Realistically, he can take on Trump,” said 19-year-old Rosalinda Gomez said outside of her Chula Vista polling place. But her friend, Dafne Ariza, believes Sanders is the better candidate to address the issues that matter most to her. “Sanders is for everything I care about - immigration reform, LGBTQ rights,” Dafne says. Meanwhile, Xochitl, 76, said she wants to see better health care and higher wages — a response that tracks with polling that shows Latino voters prioritize health care and wages even ahead of immigration. As for how Xochitl voted today, “es un secreto”, she said. The issues come as there is heightened scrutiny on the reliability and security of election machines in America. There is no evidence any of the malfunctions or other issues were caused by hackers or bad actors, reports the Guardian’s voting rights correspondent Sam Levine. Texas, a closely-watched state, had several technical glitches. The state’s voter lookup tool briefly crashed Tuesday morning because of heavy online traffic. It was later back up and running. There were glitches with printers in Bexar county, long lines in Dallas, and a shortage of poll workers in Travis county after many poll workers didn’t show up. The Travis county clerk said one of the reasons people didn’t come to work was out of coronavirus concerns. There were also issues with printers in two North Carolina counties that were quickly fixed, the Raleigh News and Observer reported. Democracy NC, a civic group helping to monitor voting in the state, said there were also issues with curbside voting access for people with disabilities. In California, 15 counties had issues connecting to the statewide voter database, making it difficult to update voter information once people cast their ballots, according to the Los Angeles Times. In Los Angeles counties, there were also some long lines as voters cast their ballots using a new election system for the first time. Tennessee voters also faced additional hurdles after tornadoes ripped through the state and killed at least 22 people Tuesday. In Nashville, several polling locations were closed because of the disaster. Civil rights groups asked state election officials to extend voting for several days to accommodate people affected by the disaster. In Minnesota, the secretary of state apologized after a staffer redirected voters using the state’s voter lookup tool to a progressive website. The staffer had a “serious lapse of judgment,” Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said. You can’t walk by a busy intersection on election day in San Francisco without someone trying to hand you a voter guide from the San Francisco League of Pissed Off Voters, writes The Guardian’s Vivian Ho: The progressive group that describes itself as “political geeks in a torrid love affair with San Francisco” has been issuing voter guides since 2004 for local, state and national politics. In November, for the first time in the organization’s history, every item the group endorsed won. But Tuesday’s voter guide had one very prominent item with no position: that of president. Cynthia Crews-Pollock, who is on the steering committee of the League of Pissed Off Voters, explained that at the endorsement meeting in December, the group was of three separate camps: “One camp of the league said we should sole endorse Bernie,” she said. “One camp said we should endorse Bernie and Warren for progressive unity. Another camp said no, we should not make an endorsement - we should focus on local politics only.” Since no camp got a majority, the league took the position of no position - which is different than no endorsement. “I think it’s good because progressive voters are not monolithic,” Crews-Pollock said. “Everybody has a different strategy of how to get a progressive candidate in office.” The position of no position gets tougher, however, with Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar mobilizing their moderate voters behind Joe Biden. But Crews-Pollock is not discouraged. “Forty-six states haven’t voted yet, and the way that Biden wants to spring ahead against Bernie is to have his competition drop out,” she said. “That says that our primary system is broken. So in the primaries, you should vote with your heart.” The Guardian’s West Coast reporter Vivian Ho brings us this dispatch from San Francisco: San Francisco is electric on election days. Volunteers are out before the sun rises, waving signs supporting their candidates and passing out voter guides. Voters walk out of polling stations, proudly wearing their red “I voted!” stickers like badges of honor. “I don’t want to get too overly optimistic because I’ve been a progressive my whole life, but this is the first time that any candidate I’ve voted for has ever had this good of a chance,” said Mokai DePolo, 65, as he balanced two large Bernie Sanders signs against his shoulder. A few weeks ago, Stacey DePolo, 45, registered the website, berniewon.me – it leads back to this New York Times opinion piece. “Because he already won by shifting the possibility of debate, with the movement he’s created, with our revolution,” she said. “Now we have all the candidates fighting over who’s more progressive, whose Green Deal is better than whose Green Deal. Bernie already won, no matter what happens.” Healthcare has been a major – or even the main – issue for voters in the primaries so far and is sure to factor into many Super Tuesday voters’ decisions today. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, even Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are advocating for the sort of public healthcare that all the Democratic presidential candidates are proposing (in varying forms). Representative Ted Yoho, a Republican of Florida who has opposed the Affordable Care Act, nevertheless advocated for free coronavirus testing and treatment for uninsured Americans, according to HuffPost’s Matt Fuller. “You can look at it as socialized medicine, but in the face of an outbreak, a pandemic, what’s your options?” Yoho said. Lawmakers – who skew older, tend to travel a lot – seem to be especially wary of contracting the disease. BuzzFeed News’ Paul McLeod reports that Bill Cassidy, a Republican senator from Louisiana, was generous with his hand sanitizer. The mayor of Richmond, Virginia, said Joe Biden’s South Carolina victory was an “earthquake” in the Democratic primary. The Guardian’s senior political reporter Daniel Strauss reports: “I think in South Carolina there was an earthquake that shook up this race,” said Richmond mayor Levar Stoney. “And it showed that the bedrock of the Democratic, that being African American voters, had a clear choice for the nomination. And his name is Joseph R Biden.” Stoney’s comments come just days after the South Carolina Democratic primary which Biden won by double digits. Since then Biden has enjoyed a wave of endorsements, including from two moderate rivals in the primary, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out and backed him. The victory and endorsements have acted as a jolt of optimism for Biden’s supporters. Asked if Stoney thought former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the remaining other more moderate candidates left in the primary, should drop out, the Richmond mayor said it was up to the mayor. But he said supporters curious about Bloomberg would come to Biden now. “I’m never going to tell anyone to get out of the race,” Stoney said. “That’s for the mayor to choose. But what I recognize that some folks have flirted, dated, dabbled a little with Mike Bloomberg over the last couple months and they’re coming home. They’re coming home to Joe. That is comforting over the last three days, since the Saturday victory in South Carolina. It’s time to stop the flirtation and get serious.” Bloomberg, pressed on his expectations for Super Tuesday voting, claimed that: “If there’s only three candidates, you can’t do worse than that. But, of course, he can, Richard Luscombe reports from West Palm Beach: After a reporter politely reminded him that Elizabeth Warren remained alongside himself, Sanders and Joe Biden, Bloomberg appeared confused. “I didn’t realize she’s still in, is she?” he wondered. He was also prickly when asked if he’d considered withdrawing from the race after two poor debate performances and tepid polling numbers. “Have you asked Joe if he is going to drop out?” Bloomberg responded. “When you ask him, then you can call me.” Next up: Orlando and a rally-the-troops visit to one of 20 field offices statewide that his free-spending Bloomberg campaign hopes to have operational before the primary. Then it was on to the Palm Beach county convention center four miles from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort for the evening rally-cum-watch party. The former New York mayor is picking up the tab for supporters’ parking and refreshments tonight, dipping further into the $500m war chest he has invested into his campaign from his estimated personal fortune of $55bn. Richard Luscombe reports from West Palm Beach: Bloomberg spent Super Tuesday hopping around Florida, a state that does not vote until 17 March, before heading to an evening rally in West Palm Beach – Donald Trump’s back yard – to await his fate. The former New York mayor has already spent about $35m on TV ads in the Sunshine State two weeks before primary day, and his furious criss-crossing today, while his opponents are elsewhere, highlights the importance to his campaign of Florida’s 219 delegates. First up was the politicians’ traditional photo-op stopover in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood, slurping on coffee-flavored ice cream from a Cuban-owned parlor on Calle Ocho. Mindful of his surroundings, he slammed Bernie Sanders’ questionable recent comments praising post-revolution literacy programs on the communist Caribbean island. “We will not win Florida with a candidate who sings the praises of Fidel Castro and downplays the atrocities he has committed in Cuba,” Bloomberg said. “Some of those comments are hurtful and offensive to [those] who have come here to start a new life.” Minnesota’s top election official apologized Tuesday after a staffer redirected voters to a progressive group’s website when they tried to look up their polling locations Steve Simon, Minnesota’s secretary of state, said the staffer had a “serious lapse of judgment”. The staffer linked to the website after the secretary of state’s pollfinder website went down on Tuesday. The office planned to go to a non-partisan backup, but the staffer diverted from that plan and linked to a poll location finder on boldprogressives.org. The website belongs to the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backs Senator Elizabeth Warren. The link was up for 17 minutes, Simon said in a statement. “The moment this error was discovered, we corrected the link,” Simon, a Democrat, said in a statement. “Anyone who knows me knows that I place the highest possible value on the nonpartisanship of this office, and I deeply regret this error.” While Biden was inside meeting with supporters, dozens of Bernie Sanders supporters rallied and chanted outside Buttercup Diner “Bernie has historically been the candidate to fight for the folks that we fight for on a daily basis, sitting across from us in our offices, sitting across from us as we’re doing radical sidewalk therapy,” said Danielle Herrera, an associate therapist at the Harm Reduction Therapy Center. “He’s been working for them since the beginning of his political campaign and we support that.” Herrera and her two coworkers work near Buttercup Diner, and came out when they heard Biden was going to stop by. They joined the Bernie supporters when they saw them rallying, waving “Not Me, Us” signs in support. Leticia Brown, another therapist with the Harm Reduction Therapy Center, said as a Bernie supporter, she has some concern about the recent momentum behind Biden with the Buttigieg and Klobuchar endorsements. “But I’m not worried in the sense that we’ve had folks that we thought were longshots before,” Brown said. “We had Barack Obama in the presidency and I remember when he announced that he was going to run, I thought, this is too soon. This is too early. Bernie, the numbers, the math is behind him. Things are being pulled in ways when it’s not just a fringe movement. People are impacted by all the things that he talks about. For us, if we fall into fear and worry, then we are just going to keep doing the same thing with the same results. Just having hope and believing this can happen needs to be a driving force for people going to the ballots today.” Dozens of Biden supporters squeezed in with members of the press at Buttercup Diner in Oakland, California, for Joe Biden to make his first of two appearances in California today. Capt “Sully” Sullenberger, the pilot who emergency-landed a plane on the Hudson river, and Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf were among the local big names to welcome Biden to Oakland. After ordering a slice of coconut cream pie, Biden shook hands and took selfies with supporters at the diner. “The mayor was like, ‘This is one of our brightest stars, a small-business owner,’ and he was like, ‘What do you sell,’ and I said, ‘I sell sex toys,’ and he was like, ‘I got to come by!’” said Nenner Joiner, owner of Feelmore, the first black-owned sex shop in Oakland. Joiner voted for Biden because “we’re going to make sure that the next candidate that gets in there is actually going to win.” “It’s not just the next person to win – I like his morals, I like his values, I like his judgments,” Joiner said. “Let’s just hope that he also has the relationships to build a better future for us.” In Texas, there were long waits and a few glitches, the Guardian’s voting rights reporter Sam Levine writes: In Dallas, one voter told WFAA he waited for two hours at the Fretz Park branch library. Another voter told the station he was leaving without casting a ballot after waiting an hour in line. In Travis county, home of Austin, the county clerk said voting had gotten off to a “rocky start” because pollworkers hadn’t shown up for work. One of the reasons they weren’t showing up, the clerk said, was out of concerns over the coronavirus. In Bexar county, home of San Antonio, there were issues when voting first started because of difficulties connecting to printers at the precinct, said Jacque Callanen, the county election administrator. One polling location had no power, leaving the machines operating on batteries, KTSA reported. The Guardian’s Los Angeles correspondent Sam Levin has been chatting with voters in Koreatown, where there’s a lot of enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and also some fear about Joe Biden’s recent rise: “I’ve never felt like I trusted a political candidate before,” said Nat Tereshchenko, a 23 year old who works for a union and voted for Sanders. “Our system just doesn’t care about working-class people. To see the way he’s mobilized people who haven’t voted before means so much ... What he is proposing is not all that radical. I want to push his ideas even further.” Tereshchenko said they were worried about Biden and frustrated Warren was still in the race: “It makes me scared. If Biden secures the nomination, we will definitely have Trump.” Nelson Cole, 26, who works for a literary manager and also voted for Sanders, said he was hopeful that Sanders or Warren would win: “Seeing the panic about Bernie shows just how much excitement there is for this new direction. If it’s Bernie or Warren, I think we’ll hear them talk more about the issues and less about the distractions.” He said he was encouraged by the turnout in the voter center: “I’m seeing a lot of young people out here, so I’m hoping for the best.” Pooja Nair, a 32-year-old lawyer, voted for Warren and was once in her class when the senator was a professor: “She has a path forward. I think it’s narrow, but I don’t think it’s out of the question. The field just narrowed. I believe in the primary, you vote for the candidate you believe in.” She said most of her friends were choosing between Biden and Sanders: “Any Democrat will have a much more pro-science attitude. That’s what we need during a global health crisis.” In Oxford, England, Bernie Sanders’ brother Larry has cast his absentee ballot ... the Guardian US chief reporter Ed Pilkington writes: Larry Sanders, a Green Party spokesperson in the UK, has been feeling “the Bernard” today. The Brooklyn-born politician, 84, who has lived in the UK since the late 1960s, has just participated in the Democrats Abroad primary. He voted in Oxford for his younger brother who he calls Bernard, or Bernie to you and me. “Bernard’s policies are very mainstream,” he told the Oxford Mail outside the polling station. Asked whether he’d be tempted to move back to the US were his brother to win in November, he replied: “I’d be tempted to visit a lot”. Though the Sanders brothers have been separated by the Atlantic for more than 50 years, they have a special bond. At the Democratic National Convention in 2016, Larry cast the delegates vote of Democrats Abroad for his brother, giving a tearful speech about how proud their parents would have been of Bernie’s achievements. Joe Biden is hoping his success in South Carolina can spill over into North Carolina, the Guardian’s David Smith reports from Charlotte. But the former vice-president is facing a stiff challenge from Bernie Sanders: David and Lisa Ruch voted for Sanders at a polling place at the Wells Fargo Sense Science Garden in rainy Charlotte on Tuesday. “I just feel we’re in a place where we need a lot of change,” said Lisa, 59, a real estate agent. “We need someone for the people, not a self-promoting president any more. We need change in health care and Bernie can get it done.” Lisa had considered Biden but admitted: “I’m not sure about his capability in the long term. There’s something a little off.” Mike Bloomberg had several signs outside the voting place but Lisa was unimpressed: “I feel like he’s a Republican trying to be a Democrat to win an election. He’s just another Donald Trump buying his way in.” Her husband David, 66, a therapist and life coach, agreed: “I don’t like him. He is certainly a poster child for money in politics.” David explained his vote for Sanders: “I’m charged by his connection with the people and how he’s trying to build a people’s movement rather than a corporate agenda. He’s been in government a long time fighting for the little guy.” The president is attending a briefing and roundtable at the National Institutes of Health vaccine research center. His administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak has come under sharp criticism, as health experts warn that hospitals were ill-prepared to handle the influx of cases. Under pressure from Trump, the US Federal Reserve slashed interest rates in an emergency move to protect the economy. Follow the Guardian’s live coverage of coronavirus and its impact around the world: In Tennessee, the recent tornadoes have disrupted voting... the Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: A civil rights group called on officials to extend primary voting after tornadoes significantly damaged the state Tuesday, killing at least 22 people. The letter from the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law came after 21 election sites were closed because of the tornado, according to the Tennessean. The outlet reported voters were being redirected to other locations to cast their ballots. Some polling sites opened an hour later than scheduled. “Given the devastation and loss of life, we urge you to immediately extend voting in the primaries through at least the end of the week to provide voters a fair opportunity to access the polls,” Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee, wrote in a letter to Governor Bill Lee, Secretary of State Tre Harnett and Mark Goins, the state coordinator of elections. On a call with reporters Tuesday, Clarke said the group was considering additional action, including a lawsuit if the officials did not extend voting. What about Biden and Bloomberg? Biden’s plan calls for $20bn for the National Housing Trust Fund, and Mike Bloomberg’s plan doesn’t specify an amount. All the candidates have pushed for measures to fight housing discrimination. Diane Yentel, president of the NLIHC, said the plans were all significant: “The federal government has for decades turned its back on the funding investments needed to keep the lowest-income people affordably housed. We’ve never had a moment like this where we’ve had housing policy and the discussion of the crisis and the solutions as a major part of the presidential campaigns before.” You can read NLHIC breakdowns of the plans for Biden, Bloomberg, Sanders and Warren. Elizabeth Warren: $500bn toward affordable housing Warren’s plan calls for investing $500bn over the next ten years to build, preserve and rehab units that will be affordable to lower-income families. The senator is focused on the supply of housing and recognizes that if “we solve affordability at the middle-income level, it doesn’t trickle down”, said Noelle Porter, director of government affairs at the National Housing Law Project, who reviewed the candidates’ plans. “She’s talking about extremely low-income renters … If we solve deep affordability, it trickles back up.” The Democrats have all proposed investments in the National Housing Trust Fund, which states currently use to build and rehabilitate affordable housing. Currently, there is roughly $260m available in the fund per year, but the nonpartisan National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) recommends that it is expanded to at least $40bn a year. As senator, Warren pushed legislation that would increase the amount to $45bn. The Sanders campaign’s housing proposal calls for $148bn. Bernie Sanders: A $2.5tn “housing for all” plan Sanders’ plan is in some ways the most radical in terms of the scope of proposed funding and the kinds of regulations he is targeting, according to some tenants’ rights activists and supporters of the Vermont senator. Most significantly, he is the only candidate to propose a national rent control standard, meaning an annual cap on rent increases, and is pushing a policy that would prevent landlords from evicting tenants for arbitrary or retaliatory reasons. It’s a policy that tenant organizers have long pursued at the local level, but has never been pursued by a frontrunner presidential candidate at the federal scale. “It’s what tenants need now to just have the most basic levels of protection,” said Lacei Amodei, an advocate with the Eviction Defense Collaborative in Hayward, California, who endorsed Sanders. “With soaring rents and so many people being evicted … it is one of the most urgent issues.” Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal, a Sanders supporter and co-founder of the LA Tenants Union (a group that has not endorsed a candidate), said it was remarkable to have a candidate acknowledge that the profit motives that drive the housing market are not good for the public. National rent control, she said, could mean “incredible relief for tenants … and more stable communities”. Voters across California say that the most important issue to them is the state’s severe housing and homelessness crisis, and the Democratic presidential candidates appear to be responding. And across the country, there is a shortfall of roughly 7m homes that are affordable and available to the lowest-income people. The 2020 campaigns have all released detailed housing policy plans. Here’s what you need to know about them. In Oakland, California, Joe Biden was joined by mayor Libby Schaaf and hero pilot Sully Sullenberger at Buttercup Diner. The former vice president ordered a coconut cream pie, per the Guardian’s Vivian Ho. Biden, riding high off a wave of endorsements from his former 2020 rivals and Democratic politicians across the country, said he’s “feeling really good today”. The moderate Democrat is divisive in Oakland. As Sanders supporters rallied outside the diner, Biden met with supporters inside. Mario also spoke to several Bernie Sanders supporters: Zaira Martinez, a 24 year-old-student and mental health worker, said the issue she cares most about is healthcare – an answer that tracks with polling which shows health care, not immigrant rights, as the number one priority for Latino voters. “I really appreciate consistency, and Sanders’ record goes back so many years. He doesn’t bend,” said Martinez. And it may be the voice of Latinas, not Latinos, that register a bigger impact. Research shows that Latinas consistently vote at higher rates than men. The Sanders campaign has invested a lot of time and resources to reach Latino voters in this state. Hello! Maanvi Singh, here taking over from the west coast. Our reporters are all over California, covering the elections in the most populous US state. In San Diego, near the US-Mexico border, the Guardian’s Mario Koran brings us a first dispatch: There’s steady foot traffic into the polling place in San Diego’s Barrio Logan neighborhood, a historically Latino neighborhood where murals tell the story of a hard-fought Chicano movement. As Bernie Sanders is slated to run away with California’s delegates, he’ll look to predominantly Latino communities, where polling shows him as the candidate of choice. But even in historically brown neighborhoods, a quick visit to the polls shows no votes can be taken for granted. Augustin, 49, a Barrio Logan resident who preferred not to give his last name, said the last four years that Donald Trump has made him a believer. “I didn’t vote for him in 2016, but he’s done a good job. Against all odds, he’s gotten things done. He’s not always nice, but he says what he believes,” said Augustin, who identifies as Latino. My colleague on the west coast, Maanvi Singh, will take on the blog now as Super Tuesday voting - and related drama - continues. Later, Joan Greve in Washington, DC, will helm the blog as the polls begin to close and the results trickle in tonight. Here’s what’s happened so far today: Former FBI director James Comey just endorsed Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination. Kamala Harris: will she or won’t she? Endorse Biden and, if so, when? Rumors and reports abound. On the second most important voting day of the 2020 election (after election day itself in November), it’s a fierce battle between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, with major efforts at disruption of what could become a two-horse race by Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates in a rare emergency move, to try to mitigate the economic effects of coronavirus. But it wasn’t enough to satisfy Donald Trump. The Trump administration is considering using a national disaster program to pay hospitals and doctors for their care of uninsured people infected with the coronavirus. As concerns rise over costs of treating some of the 27 million Americans without health coverage, the government is looking for news ways to step in, a person familiar with the conversations told the Wall Street Journal. This would certainly be unexpected. The WSJ reports that: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has been in discussions about using that program to pay providers who treat uninsured patients with coronavirus, the person said. Dr. Robert Kadlec, who is the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, also said Tuesday at a congressional hearing that discussions are being held about using the National Disaster Medical System reimbursement program. About 2% of people infected with coronavirus have died and about 5% have developed serious infections that may require oxygen therapy or ventilators, based on research on cases in China. In the U.S., there are more than 100 coronavirus cases, Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at the congressional hearing Tuesday that “we are seeing community transmission in a few places.” The administration is focusing on the costs of caring for uninsured people because individuals otherwise would have coverage through Medicaid, employers, or through private insurance purchased on the individual market, according to the person familiar with the conversations. No final decision has been made. Meanwhile, the Guardian reports on the unpreparedness of the US health system. Just what Joe was looking for, obviously. Kamala? No Comey, James Comey. The former FBI director just endorsed Joe Biden. Comey was fired by Trump in 2017 when, effectively, the FBI director refused to pledge loyalty to the president and extricate him from the Trump-Russia investigation that Comey was in charge of. The move triggered the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to take over the inquiry. Comey has been very outspoken against Trump ever since, but has flaws of his own, having misjudged in the later stages of the 2016 election the situation where the FBI kept secret the fact that they were investigating Trump in what was undoubtedly a huge international scandal - while disclosing a last-minute probe into Hillary Clinton’s emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer (the disgraced ex-congressman then married to Hillary Clinton’s right-hand aide Huma Abedin). The emails turned out to be harmless, in the sense of whether they were a threat to national security, but the very disclosure of the probe at that sensitive time was a serious blow to Clinton. Comey also admitted in December “real sloppiness” over the handling of surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser. California governor votes on Super Tuesday Gavin Newsom’s a fan of Kamala Harris and since the California senator dropped out of the presidential race in early December, it’s been and remains unclear who the governor is backing for the Democratic nomination. Apparently we’ll have to wait a little longer to find out. Regardless of what the next few hours bring in the “will she, won’t she” endorse Biden cliffhanger, surely no-one will think of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris today without their minds flicking immediately back to that pivotal moment in the second Democratic debate last June, in Miami, when Harris scored a bullseye against Biden and her campaign took off like a rocket (until she fell to Earth in December). My politics colleague Lauren Gambino wrote at the time: It was the most dramatic moment of the evening and came in response to a question about race and policing, when Harris interjected, saying that she had a right to respond as the only black candidate on stage. The California senator and former prosecutor then directed her comments to Biden, denouncing his record on race. “I do not believe you are a racist,” Harris said, looking directly at the former vice-president. “But,” she continued, “it is personal. And it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.” She accused Biden of supporting policies that would have prevented young minority students like herself from attending school in majority-white districts. She said when he opposed bussing, there was a little black girl in Oakland, California, who was being bussed to a better school. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” she said. “And that little girl was me.” Growing visibly upset, Biden looked away. “That is a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists. That is not true,” he said. California Senator Kamala Harris, who dropped out of the presidential race in early December, may be ready to endorse Joe Biden.... That would be a huge fillip for Biden, not least in California, where he is extremely keen to spoil a Sanders primary landslide. But it will be a big bonus nationwide as Super Tuesday voters stream to the polls, a terrific last-minute boost for the former VP in his dramatic comeback. NBC’s Bay Area anchor Raj Mathai has just posted a crucial update on his previous news, however. Watch this space. All of the Democrats running for president have pitched substantial climate plans - responding to voters’ increasing concerns about rising temperatures and their widespread effects. Two in three registered voters (66%) are worried about global warming, according to Yale’s climate change communication program. That includes 84% of liberal Democrats, 72% of moderate/conservative Democrats, and about half of liberal/moderate Republicans, but only a quarter of conservative Republicans. In one Super Tuesday state, Texas, two-thirds of voters want to develop more renewable energy. But presidential contenders, particularly the more moderate ones, are cautiously navigating climate politics. Both Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg have refused to commit to banning fracking, which will likely give them an edge in oil and gas states. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would ban the method of extracting oil and gas, which would drastically reduce drilling in the US. Banning fracking, however, would require action from Congress, which seems politically untenable. Supporters of Biden and Bloomberg say they are focused on the actions they can achieve with executive authority. The candidates also split over nuclear power - which provides more than half of zero-carbon electricity in the US. Many experts argue that climate plans that don’t include nuclear aren’t serious. Sanders would prohibit the construction of new nuclear plants and stop renewing licenses for existing ones. Warren said she opposed new nuclear plants and would phase out existing ones, but she has since backtracked. California has already shut down its nuclear plants. It was a scene that was hard to imagine just one week ago. Joe Biden, 77, and until Sunday his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Pete Buttigieg, 38, appeared together before a tiny crowd in the Chicken Scratch restaurant in Dallas, Texas, where Buttigieg endorsed the former vice president, Reuters writes. Fighting back tears, Biden compared the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to his late son Beau, saying it was the highest compliment he could offer any person. Having ditched his own bid for the nomination, Buttigieg, who had spent months calling for generational change, said Biden would “bring back dignity to the White House.” Buttigieg’s endorsement was the most eye-catching among over 100 that flooded in for Biden from mostly moderate Democrats after his dominant South Carolina win on Saturday, narrowly preceded by Amy Klobuchar’s endorsement and followed by former candidate Beto O’Rourke’s last night. Biden’s comeback in South Carolina, after poor showings in other early voting states, was exactly the kind of a victory that Democratic Party officials, alarmed that front-runner Bernie Sanders is far too liberal to beat Trump, had been craving, according to more than two dozen people who either gave their endorsements or were involved behind the scenes. “I hadn’t planned on endorsing anybody, but then I started getting worried that Bernie Sanders would become the nominee,” said former Senator Barbara Boxer of California, a longtime Senate colleague of both Biden and Sanders. On the eve of the South Carolina primary, she called longtime Biden aide Steve Ricchetti, telling him she would endorse Biden if he won the race. People both inside and outside the Biden campaign said that while the effort to garner endorsements involved calls from Biden aides asking for help, most decided on their own. “People woke up and got a sense of urgency,” said one person close to Biden. Buttigieg’s endorsement, in particular, surprised Biden. Biden did not ask Buttigieg for his endorsement nor did the former mayor say he was going to announce support, Biden said at the Texas chicken restaurant event. The event, which lasted only a few minutes and involved a small crowd of press, campaign supporters and people who just happened to be at the restaurant, was hastily arranged to accommodate a quick, last-minute announcement, said one person familiar with the matter. Virginia is the fourth-largest prize on Super Tuesday, awarding 99 pledged delegates, ranking behind California (415), Texas (228) and North Carolina (110), the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. It’s a huge day in this increasingly-blue swing state and will be a useful early indicator of how things are going for the leading candidates Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren when polls close at 7pm ET. Meanwhile, WDBJ7, the CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Roanoke, Va, reports: Virginia Tech Professor and WDBJ7 Political Analyst, Bob Denton, said Virginia’s primary will likely come down to a three-way race among Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg. Elizabeth Warren remains in the race, but in the last 48 hours, Tom Steyer, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have ended their campaigns. Biden, Denton said, has picked up momentum following a decisive win in South Carolina. “In a matter of one month he’s gone from a distant third to first in the most recent poll, by three or four points,” Denton said, “so it makes him extremely viable.” Denton said Sanders has an opportunity to make a statement. “And if he has a very strong night,” Denton said, “that will certainly send an interesting message indeed for the Democrats.” And Bloomberg must prove himself in Virginia, after focusing his attention and millions in campaign spending on Super Tuesday, WDBJ7 reports from Blacksburg, Va, the home of Virginia Tech university. Virginia congresswoman and moderate Democrat Abigail Spanberger, part of the Blue Wave in the 2018 midterms, who flipped her red district in her first ever run for office, mourns the departure of Klobuchar and urges her fellow Virginians to get out and vote in this key primary today. Abby to Amy: Rocky in the Rockies? Will Joe Biden pull back from way behind in Colorado primary voting today and, if making significant progress, how many delegates will he pull in? Two Colorado polls last week gave Sanders leads of 12 and 14 percentage points over the rest of the field in the purple state, the Denver Post reports. Those were pre-Biden South Carolina primary landslide, obviously, but the indications had been that Elizabeth Warren could come in second behind Sanders. So will the Biden phoenix-like rise of late make a difference tonight? State watchers expect a strong voter turn-out in Colorado today and a lot of undecided voters making late decisions - perhaps wise in light of the developments of the last 48 hours. It’s definitely Bernie’s to lose. Bernie just voted He’s in his home state of Vermont today and will be there tonight as the results come rolling in. It could be a long night, especially waiting for a result in California, where the polls don’t close until 8pm local time. Will Bernie Sanders follow his strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada voting with a good show east and west? Will it be enough to hold off Joe Biden? If he beats Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts tonight it could be a harbinger for where Warren’s campaign is going to end up. But will it mean the start of a sweep for Sanders, or will Biden capitalize strongly on his South Carolina win - leaving California as a late-night cliffhanger? The Boston Globe has a handy “everything you need to know on Super Tuesday in Massachusetts” piece, here. The Globe has endorsed Warren for the Democratic nomination. And my senior politics reporter colleague Lauren Gambino will be on the spot when Joe Biden rounds off a hectic day of campaigning in some key Super Tuesday states, with an event in Los Angeles. Here she shares her thoughts on what to expect from Super Tuesday with the Guardian’s award-winning news podcast Today in Focus. At 29 minutes long it’s the perfect commuter-listen. Ah, so the president perhaps thinks the Federal Reserve’s emergency rate cut over coronavirus concerns is kinda cute, but Not Enough for Potus’s liking. Follow all the business details on our dedicated live blog out of London. Today is the biggest voting event of 2020 before actual election day in November. With California bringing its primary voting forward to join Super Tuesday and the warring moderate wing of the Democratic party suddenly coalescing around Joe Biden, it’s going to be an exhilarating/nail-biting night. They say everything is big in Texas and the biggest thing going on there today is Joe Biden’s hope - because if he loses Tex and California to Bernie it could be very grim for his prospects. After a rambunctious rally in Dallas last night, after a string of key endorsements, the Biden campaign is reportedly feeling very confident. “I expect to win Texas,” Cristobal Alex, a senior adviser to Biden and native of El Paso, told Politico. The Lone Star state will award 261 pledged delegates at today’s primary. If Texas is really in play for the Democrats this November, today is a good day to start. Down ticket, new names are emerging in the effort to push Texas to the blue end of purple and try to flip the state. Barbra: “We can’t go on like this” We HAVE to pivot now. To Barbra Streisand. One of Hollywood’s most loyal Democratic donors over the years, the 77-year-old’s written a searing op-ed for Variety, so stop what you’re doing and check this out before you hit the polling station, if you’re in a Super Tuesday voting state. She says she fears the country “could be extinguished” if Donald Trump wins reelection in November. “Every morning I wake up, holding my breath while I turn on my phone to see the latest news. I think to myself, ‘It can’t be worse than yesterday.’ But when the news loads, I think, ‘Ohhhhh, yes, it is worse. Since 2016, we’ve been dragged down into the mud of Trump’s swamp. We can’t go on like this. It’s too dangerous.” “Every day, he takes another swipe at the pillars of our democracy, but we cannot allow him to irrevocably change this country,” Streisand writes. “The ‘beacon of hope’ that is America could be extinguished if he’s given another four years.” The US Federal Reserve has slashed US interest rates in an emergency measure to protect America’s economy from the coronavirus. Follow our business live blog for all the developments, here. In an unscheduled move, the Fed is cutting its benchmark rate to between 1% and 1.25%. That’s down from 1.5% to 1.75%. The move comes two weeks before its next official meeting, but just three hours after that joint conference call with G7 finance ministers and central bankers. The Fed says: The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point, to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The Committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. Michael Ellis, a White House lawyer and former counsel to the House intelligence committee under Republican Devin Nunes is the new senior director for intelligence on the National Security Council. It’s the latest instance of Donald Trump elevating a trusted loyalist to control the intelligence community, according to a Politico report this morning. Ellis, a deputy to White House lawyer John Eisenberg, started in the role on Monday, according to a senior administration official and a former national security official. Ellis left the counsel’s office so won’t be dual-hatted with his new job. The office of the director for intelligence serves as the day to day connective tissue between the intelligence community and the White House. Sensitive information coming in from the intelligence agencies will go to that office, especially if it is in hard copy form. The office also coordinates covert action activities between the White House and the intelligence community, and it’s where the NSC server is housed that stores the most sensitive classified information. Ellis featured in the Ukraine impeachment scandal, according to testimony heard by the House Intelligence Committee during the impeachment investigation. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated Army officer who served as the National Security Council’s director for Ukraine, told lawmakers in October that Ellis and Eisenberg were the ones who decided to move the record of Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky into the NSC’s top-secret codeword system—a server normally used to store highly classified material that only a small group of officials can access. Warren still on the hunt Elizabeth Warren will be deep in a rabbit hole tonight if she doesn’t make a surprisingly good showing in Super Tuesday voting. She badly needs to win, at the very least, her home state of Massachusetts, which she represents in the Senate - but there’s a danger of Bernie Sanders winning there tonight. If she doesn’t win Mass or Oklahoma, where she grew up, the landscape will be bleak, with a path to the nomination (contested party convention...?) very had to see. She gives fantastic performances on the trail and the enthusiasm mask has never slipped, but this has been a devastating few months for Warren’s campaign - especially as she is arguably the most qualified of anyone for the White House (including the incumbent). Warren’s busy on a Twitter fundraising streak this morning, as if oblivious to the fact that Buttigieg and Klobuchar have abruptly dropped out and moved quickly to heal division in the Democratic ranks, despite beating her in the early contests. And progressive rival Bernie Sanders has mountains more support at this point, based on most recent polls, in states from New England to California via Texas. Does the candidate with “a plan for that” have a plan for tomorrow morning if she tanks tonight? US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said the Group of Seven leading industrial countries agreed this morning to do “everything possible” to limit harm from the coronavirus outbreak to the world’s economies. There was an international special conference call on this earlier this morning, led by Mnuchin and US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, with finance and economics ministers from around the globe. You can follow all the developments live on our dedicated coronavirus blog, here. And all the business news on our live blog, here. Just hours after endorsing former Joe Biden for president, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar joined NBC News’ Today program this morning - and firmly rejected the notion that she and other Democrats are trying to crush progressive champ Bernie Sanders in the 2020 race. “You want a candidate that not just builds a coalition of fired-up Democrats, which we’ve got, but also brings in independents, moderate Republicans. That’s how we won back the House of Representatives [in the 2018 midterm elections], and that’s what Joe Biden can do,” Klobuchar told program host Savannah Guthrie. She added, “I don’t look at the Mayor [Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out on Sunday], Beto O’Rourke [who’s been MIA since he dropped out of the presidential race late last year] and myself as ‘establishment’.” And she continued: “I look at us as new leaders for the party, fresh faces for the party and we’re basically saying we’ve got to win here and that’s why we’re supporting Joe Biden...None of us had talked to each other. We came to our own decisions...We made the decision, instead of a personal victory for ourselves or a personal quest that this was about our country.” On leaving the Democratic primary race, Klobuchar said: “There literally was no push from anyone. It was a decision I made...The hardest part was actually telling our staff...but I think everyone knew this was the right thing to do.” And on if she discussed with Biden serving in his administration, should he win the White House in November, Klobuchar said, “No actually not one bit,” and when asked about the possibility of being Biden’s running mate she responded, “I’m just doing my work right now, I’m one day out of having left my own campaign.” The eventual party nominee chooses his or her own candidate for vice-president, some time after the party convention in the summer. Hello all, Joanna Walters here: I’m taking over the blog in New York now, from my esteemed colleague in London, Martin Belam, and will be you walking with you through this Super Tuesday morning before passing the baton on to others for an exciting afternoon and then a dramatic night of results. Stay tuned here for all the action. Bloomberg’s D-Day Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg appears on primary voting ballots for the first time today and it’s make or break for him. After Biden’s overnight surge of support from his South Carolina result, Bloomberg’s billions could end up counting for very little in his personal race. He’s spent a record-breaking $566 million of his own money so far on his gamble of launching a campaign but not actually competing in a primary or caucus until today. And of that, a whopping $215 million has been spent in the 14 Super Tuesday states where primary voters go to the polls today to pick their Democratic party nominee to face Donald Trump in November. Oddly, Bloomberg’s spending the day in Florida, which doesn’t vote until March 17, at events in Orlando and Miami before watching the results at an event in West Palm Beach, coincidentally the location of Trump’s private resort club Mar-a-Lago and a billionaire snowbird playground. And here’s Trump’s generous take on his rival. Donald Trump is inevitably having his say on the Democrat’s Super Tuesday primaries from the comfort of his phone. He’s just been tweeting that voters in Texas and Oklahoma should shun Mike Bloomberg, as he will have a negative impact on their fossil fuel-based energy industries. Trump has gone on to describe Bloomberg as a “chocker”, which is rapidly becoming the covfefe of election season. Talking of Mike Bloomberg and Texas, a few hours ago Time published this in-depth look at his campaign from Molly Ball in Houston. On 3 March, Bloomberg’s big bet will be called. His name will be on the primary ballot for the first time. Sanders holds a delegate lead over a surging Joe Biden, and Bloomberg’s debate flops have some Democrats accusing him of being an obstacle rather than savior, contributing to the clog of moderate contenders that’s preventing Democrats from consolidating around a non-Sanders candidate. Unlike when he was mayor, Bloomberg can’t order those in the path of his blitz to evacuate—not that he hasn’t tried. Read it here - Time: Mike Bloomberg wants to fix America. But can he fix the Democrats? The AP are reporting that a super PAC is sending out robocalls today in five Super Tuesday states that feature positive words about Joe Biden from former president Barack Obama. Amanda Loveday of Unite the Country PAC says the call is running through Tuesday in Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia. The call features audio from a speech in which Obama calls Biden “a statesman, leader who sees clearly the challenges facing America in a changing world.” Loveday said the call also ran in South Carolina before its primary last Saturday and could be used in other states that vote in the future. She says the group did not need permission to use the audio, nor did it seek permission. Obama has so far gone out of his way not to specifically endorse Biden - or any other candidate - in person. Sources close to the former president have suggested that he feels his voice may be best saved until later in the year, to bring unity to the Democrat campaign against Trump once a nominee is chosen. Last week the former president threatened legal action against a Republican super PAC that was running an anti-Biden campaign which, he said, used Obama’s words out of context to paint his vice president in a negative light. Amy Klobuchar was live on NBC News this morning in her first TV spot since dropping out. She said she made the decision to quit the race herself. She said that she stepped back while she was attending the commemoration service in Selma at the weekend, and thought to herself “What is better here? What is better for the country?” She said that announcing her support for Joe Biden last night was an “incredible joyous moment”. Asked if Super Tuesday was “do or die time” in terms of stopping Bernie Sanders, Klobuchar said: “It’s a big deal tonight. You have Sen. Sanders who has been ahead in a number of the states, but part of that was because there were so many other people. I think you will see some victories of Joe Biden in a number of the states.” Explaining her preference against Sanders, she says the Democrats want to “win big” and that means nominating a candidate that “brings in independents, moderate Republicans”. On Biden she said “He has this decency, exactly what we need right now” You can watch the full segment here: Amy Klobuchar rejects idea that moderate Dems are trying to crush Sanders Here’s a few things worth a read over your coffee this morning: Jim Newell in Slate suggesting that this Super Tuesday, anything could happen, and all he is willing to predict is that: Sanders will win a whole bunch of delegates, Biden will win a whole bunch of delegates, and Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren will win some number of delegates. Dead candidates, like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, might also win some delegates based on either early voting tallies or people who don’t watch the news. Tulsi Gabbard, who is still in the race, will probably not win any delegates. The rest, though, is all unknown. Read it here - Slate: After Mayhem Monday, it’s Super Tuesday! Over at The Hill, Niall Stanage has a breakdown of what he says each candidate needs to do. Key takeaways - it is vital for Biden to do better than Bloomberg, Warren must win her home state of Massachusetts, and he didn’t bother working out what Tulsi Gabbard needed. And Sanders? One key question for Sanders is how he does in Southern states. Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee all vote on Tuesday. Black voters will be crucial to the outcome in those states, and Sanders underperformed with African Americans in South Carolina. His skeptics will be scrutinizing the Super Tuesday results for signs of further weakness in that regard. Read it here - The Hill: What each candidate needs to do Away from the results of the election and more about the mechanics of elections temselves, Kim Zetter at Politico has been looking at the business of states investing in their own election tech. Los Angeles County spent nine years working on a government-designed and owned voting system with the goal of setting a new standard for security, reliability and transparency. Instead, millions of county voters on Super Tuesday will cast ballots on a system in which numerous security flaws were found. Read it here - Politico: Los Angeles County’s risky voting experiment At least 7 people were killed earlier today as two tornadoes touched down in central Tennessee, shredding about 40 buildings across the Nashville area. The state is due to vote today as part of Super Tuesday. Metro Nashville Public Schools said its schools would be closed Tuesday because of the tornado damage. Wilson County, just east of metro Nashville will close schools for the rest of the week. Election polling sites at schools were expected to remain open, as well as district offices, according to tweets from its official account. Jeff Roberts of the Elections Commission said in a statement early Tuesday that information about damage to polling stations is being collected as polls open. Any voter in Davidson County whose assigned precinct has been impacted may vote at the Election Commission Offices, the statement said. Polls open in the state at various times, starting at 7 am CST, depending on the county. Polls will be opening at 8am in Nashville It’s not just in the 14 Super Tuesday states that Democrats are casting their votes today. 3 March also marks the opening of the Democrats Abroad primary. There are thirteen pledged delegates at stake. The primary runs until 10 March. To vote, you have to be a US citizen residing abroad, be 18 as of 3 November 2020 and be a member of Democrats Abroad. One of the earliest voting stations to open was in Bangkok, Thailand, where the primary is taking place amid the coronavirus outbreak. There have been 43 cases and one death in the country. Some voters have been casting their ballots wearing face masks. Polls are opening across the US as 14 states vote in the biggest day of the 2020 election campaign so far. Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard all still vying to win the Democrats nomination to fight Donald Trump for the White House in November. The primaries in Texas and California are key battle ground, both sending swathes of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Sanders and Warren are both facing votes in their home states. Biden has been boosted in the last two days bu the endorsements of former candidates Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke. Here’s Lauren Gambino in Los Angeles with our scene-setter for the day. 130 million people live in the states that votes today. That is more than 10 times as many people who live in the four states that have had their say so far. It is also one of the most diverse electorates of the primary season. 25% of the population in these 14 states are Hispanic, with an 11% black population and the 7% Asian population. Altogether the white vote makes up 53%. Here are the 14 states voting today, when their polls close (in Eastern Time), and how many delegates they have on offer. Closing at 7pm ET Vermont (16 delegates) Virginia (99) Closing at 7:30pm North Carolina (110) Closing at 8pm Alabama (52) Maine (24) Massachusetts (91) Oklahoma (37) Tennessee (64) Texas (228) - El Paso closes at 9pm Closing at 8:30pm Arkansas (31) Closing at 9pm Colorado (67) Minnesota (75) Closing at 10pm Utah (29) Closing at 11pm California (415) You can’t expect full results on the dot though. In some primaries, for example California, postal ballots still have a couple of days to arrive and be counted after the polls close. They are still valid as long as the post-mark is before 3 March. Another key question - given the late drop-outs of Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer and Pete Buttigieg, what happens to the votes of people who opted for them in early voting? Here’s Maanvi Singh with a quick guide to ‘zombie votes’ Also overnight on the coronavirus outbreak, Donald Trump was flexing his muscles again over interest rates at Federal Reserve - a long-term concern of his. Responding to news that Australia’s central bank has cut interest rates to a record low due to the “significant effect” of the coronavirus outbreak on the Australian economy, Trump blasted the Fed and Jerome Powell again for their interest rate position. There’s been some domestic controversy over the coronavirus outbreak brewing overnight. Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan has picked up on news that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have changed the way it reports the number of cases in the US - removing public information about how many people have been tested. Pocan tweeted last night to say that he has written to CDC director Robert Redfield demanding to know why this information is no longer available. In the letter, Pocan says: Americans are dying. We deserve to know how many Americans have perished from Covid-19, and we deserve to know how many people have been tested for it. Knowing that CDC testing is keeping pace with the likely number of cases is imperative to maintaining public trust. He goes on to ask when the CDC will resume publishing the information. Here’s the latest on the coronavirus situation in the US from Hallie Golden in Seattle. One story that will not go away during the whole of the 2020 election cycle is that of vote security. Associated Press have been looking at some of the measures in place in the first big test of the system since the 2018 midterms. And there’s a new factor at play - coronavirus. In 2016, the Russians weaponized social media to sow discord among Americans, scanned state and local election systems for cyber vulnerabilities and deployed the targeted release of stolen campaign emails and documents. US intelligence chiefs have warned that foreign interference remains a threat. And the recent outbreak of a new virus could present a bad actor with an opening to spread false information to keep voters away from the polls. We’ve already seen misinformation about the virus on social media go, well, viral. One California county has sought to address concerns over the coronavirus by sending bottles of hand sanitizer to polling places and asking poll workers to post fliers from the public health department on how to avoid spreading the virus. Jesse Salinas, the chief elections official in Yolo County, California, told Associated Press that a few poll workers have backed out over concerns but most understand the threat is relatively low. The county had no reported cases as of Monday morning. “We are hoping people remain calm and still participate in the election process,” Salinas said. Unlike the fiasco of the Democrat counting at the Iowa caucuses, it will be state and local election officials will be administering Tuesday’s elections. “Texas voters can rest assured ... that our office and those of local and county elections officials are committed to working hand in hand to ensure smooth elections as well as the integrity of our electoral process,” said Stephen Chang, spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State’s Office. States vary considerably in their use of technology to run elections. Some utilize computerized voter lists known as electronic pollbooks to check in voters, while others rely on paper. Voters in a few places will be using new electronic voting machines that produce a paper record of voter selections while some voters in Texas, Tennessee and Oklahoma will be using older ones considered vulnerable by election security experts. In California - widely seen as the most crucial Democrat primary to win - a new publicly owned computerized voting system the first of its kind in the nation will face a crucial test in Los Angeles County, the nation’s largest elections jurisdiction with 5.4 million registered voters. The new system won conditional state approval despite serious security and technical issues, with the county ordered to offer all voters the option of using hand-marked paper ballots. An estimated 63 percent of voters were already expected to vote by mail using hand-marked paper ballots. Such ballots are considered the most reliable by election security experts because paper can’t be hacked or altered by programming errors. If you’d like an indication of where votes might go across the states voting today, then NBC News have got a state-by-state look at who’s leading in the polls. They give Sanders a clear lead in California, the state where most delegates are up for grabs. Sanders has a tighter six point lead over Biden in Texas, which has 228 pledged delegates on offer. A word of caution though. Some polling has been done in some states after Biden’s South Carolina victory, but a lot of these figures are going to be a bit stale, as they don’t reflect that Biden win, or that Klobuchar and Buttigieg have dropped. The final destination of the votes from their supporters is going to be one of the things that makes today so intriguing. Read it here - NBC News: Super Tuesday polls state-by-state look at who’s leading Good morning. And then there were four. Well, four plus Tulsi Gabbard. Super Tuesday always looked like being the day that the Democratic nomination field narrowed - but we expected it to be after the results, not in the two days beforehand. The withdrawal of first Pete Buttigieg and then Amy Klobuchar from the race leaves today’s election tantalisingly poised. For Bernie Sanders, it is about showing that he can keep on picking up those pledged delegates and keep his nose ahead in the race. For Joe Biden, with key moderates now out of the running and backing him, it is a huge opportunity to make himself the clear single leading opponent to Sanders. Elizabeth Warren needs to do well enough that it seems worthwhile her continuing, although her strategy appears to be just hanging on all the way to the convention, and see what shakes out there. And Mike Bloomberg needs to see if he can turn his massive ad spend into votes. It is the first time he has been on the ballot paper. 14 states across the country – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia – as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes, allocating around a third of the delegates candidates need to get the nod to run against Trump. Here’s our guide to the night: Away from the Democratic race, it will be another important day for the Trump administration in its attempts to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, which has now claimed six lives in Washington state. Donald Trump is visiting a viral pathogenesis laboratory at the National Institutes of Health Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He will be taking part in a roundtable briefing. There is also expected to be a press briefing by members of the Coronavirus Task Force later this afternoon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/dec/26/china-to-rein-in-foreign-investment-as-domestic-growth-stalls","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-26T21:30:28Z","webTitle":"China to rein in outward investment as domestic growth stalls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/26/china-to-rein-in-foreign-investment-as-domestic-growth-stalls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/dec/26/china-to-rein-in-foreign-investment-as-domestic-growth-stalls","fields":{"headline":"China to rein in outward investment as domestic growth stalls","bodyText":"Beijing has signalled plans to curb Chinese firms’ investment in foreign assets, after revealing that companies from China are on course to spend 1.12 trillion yuan (£130bn) on everything from British football clubs to a Hollywood film producer in 2016. Companies from China ramped up their spending on overseas assets during the year, as a weakening domestic economy saw investors turn their attention overseas. A diverse array of targets included the maker of Godzilla, Aston Villa Football Club and the pub in which former prime minister David Cameron and Chinese premier Xi Jinping once shared a pint. The spending spree boosted non-financial overseas investment 55% in the first 11 months of 2016, putting Chinese companies on course to spend £130bn this year, compared with £86bn in 2015, said commerce minister Gao Hucheng. While foreign investment has soared, the amount of money flowing into the country is set to remain broadly flat at £92bn. This means the difference between investments abroad and those coming into China has reached an unprecedented £39bn. The widening gap has triggered concerns about capital flight, where investors send their money out of the country rather than investing it to spur domestic growth. Gao signalled that Beijing would move to address the investment gap by reining in Chinese firms’ overseas spending and making it easier for firms from abroad to access the Chinese economy. He said the government would “promote the healthy and orderly development of outbound investment and cooperation in 2017”, in remarks at a conference that were published on the commerce ministry’s website. In November it was reported that China was preparing a clampdown on non-Chinese mergers and acquisitions. Separately, the ministry said on its blog that China would sharply reduce restrictions on foreign investment access in 2017 to make it easier for overseas firms to spend their cash in the People’s Republic. No details were given on what restrictions would be changed. Major Chinese investors have spread their investment around the world and across multiple sectors during 2016. One of the most high-profile purchases was part of a multi-billion dollar bet on high-end US real estate by Chinese buyers. Insurer Anbang spent $6.5bn (£5.3bn) on luxury group Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts from private equity group Blackstone, continuing a flood of Chinese money into prime US property. The deal came two years after the same firm paid Hilton Hotels $1.95bn for the Waldorf Astoria in New York, a landmark art deco building ranked among the world’s most fabled hotels. British assets have also proved tempting for Chinese firms and wealthy businessmen looking to add to their already sizeable clutch of UK investments. State-backed China General Nuclear took a 30% stake in the £24bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, helping France’s government-owned energy group EDF fund the project. While Hinkley was the highest-profile Chinese foray into the UK, its investors have also showed they are partial to English football clubs, particularly those from the West Midlands. Entrepreneur Guochan Lai bought West Bromwich Albion for a sum thought to be between £150m and £200m earlier this year. Businessman Tony Xia spent £76m to buy Aston Villa, even after the club had been relegated from the Premier League, vowing to restore the club to its former glory. Investment group Fosun International paid £45m to gain control of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Among the larger British acquisitions by Chinese firms in 2016 was the £1.4bn that travel firm Ctrip.com paid for flight comparison website Skyscanner. The takeover was announced just a day after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, promised to stem the flow of British firms being sold to foreign investors before reaching their full potential. Government-backed SinoFortone sealed a much smaller but diplomatically significant deal when it bought a 16th-century Buckinghamshire pub for an undisclosed fee. The Plough at Cadsden, Buckinghamshire – a rural tavern near Chequers, the official country retreat used by British prime ministers – hosted former PM David Cameron and Chinese premier Xi Jinping during a diplomatic visit that saw them set the world to rights over a pint of Greene King IPA. Chinese investors were also involved in the consortium that agreed to pay £13.8bn by a majority stake in the National Grid’s gas pipeline network. This year’s deals increase the scale of investment into the UK from China, which already owns or holds large stakes in household names such as Weetabix, Pizza Express and Thames Water. One huge deal that was agreed this year but may not complete until early 2017 is ChemChina’s $43bn takeover of Swiss seeds and pesticides giant Syngenta. The deal would be China’s largest ever foreign acquisition and is seen as a key plank of its strategy to ensure food security for its huge population. The bright lights of Hollywood have also attracted Chinese money. Investment group Wanda, headed by China’s richest man Wang Jianlin, paid $3.5bn for the Legendary studio behind films including Godzilla and Pacific Rim.

Barely 10 days from the first round of voting on 23 April, the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen, both with 23-24% of the vote, are still favourites to go through to the run-off round. But Mélenchon, an acid-tongued political showman with a radical tax-and-spend platform, is now just five or six points behind. Some recent polls have placed him third, ahead of the scandal-hit centre-right candidate, François Fillon. Mélenchon’s rise means that with up to a third of voters undecided, no two opinion polls entirely alike and margins of error to account for, it is impossible to say with certainty who of the front four will go head-to-head in the second round. The extreme unpredictability of the contest is rattling financial markets and observers alike. The campaign “smells bad”, the outgoing president, François Hollande, has privately told friends, Le Monde reported. Fearing what commentators are calling a destructive mood among voters, Hollande also warned against the dangers of “simplifications and falsifications” in an election widely marked by anti-establishment anger and populist politics. Analysts are now contemplating the previously unimaginable prospect of a run-off between Mélenchon and Le Pen, a clash between far-left and far-right that would represent a seismic upheaval in French and European politics. Mélenchon, 65, who resigned from Hollande’s centre-left party in 2008 and heads a grass-roots movement, La France Insoumise or Untamed France, has mainly picked up votes from the plummeting official Socialist candidate, Benoît Hamon. Helped by his caustic rhetoric, strong performances in televised debates and a slick campaign that includes addressing rallies by hologram and Fiscal Combat – a “hit-the-rich” video game – his personal approval rating has leapt 22 points in a month to 68 points, making him France’s most popular politician. “He’s invented political stand-up,” said one former Socialist party ally, Julien Dray. “He’s become a showman.” Mélenchon himself told the Journal du Dimanche he had become a “reassuring” figure and was “less of a hothead”. Mélenchon’s policies include reducing France’s working week from 35 to 32 hours, lowering the retirement age to 60, raising the minimum wage and social security benefits, and taxing earnings of more than €33,000 a month at 100%. He also wants to withdraw from nuclear power, which produces about 75% of France’s electricity needs, and radically reform the French constitution by abolishing the presidential regime of the Fifth Republic. While his position on immigration is the opposite of Le Pen’s, Mélenchon is not so far removed from the Front National leader in foreign affairs, advocating a “new role” for France in the EU, withdrawal from Nato and warmer ties with Russia. It is his plans to boost public spending by €173bn over five years and pull France out of EU treaties if Brussels does not agree to fundamental reforms that have most rattled conservatives and investors. “Melenchon: the crazy programme of the French Chavez,” read the front-page headline in the conservative Le Figaro daily on Wednesday, comparing the Communist-backed candidate to the late Venezuelan leader. Pierre Gattaz, the leader of France’s main business group Medef, said this week a second round pitting Mélenchon against Le Pen would be “a catastrophe” for France, forcing voters to choose between “economic disaster and economic chaos”. Recent polls modelling hypothetical second round run-offs predict that Macron – a former economy minister and investment banker who has never held elected office but says he wants to transcend the traditional left-right divide and govern “fairly and efficiently” – would beat Le Pen, Fillon and Mélenchon. Fillon, a former conservative prime minister battling allegations he paid his wife hundreds of thousands of euros of public money for minimal work as a parliamentary assistant, would beat Le Pen, but lose to either of the other two, while Mélenchon would beat Le Pen and Fillon but lose to Macron."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/sep/27/hinkley-point-what-price-avoiding-humiliation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-27T09:29:07Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point: what price avoiding humiliation?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/27/hinkley-point-what-price-avoiding-humiliation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/sep/27/hinkley-point-what-price-avoiding-humiliation","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point: what price avoiding humiliation?","bodyText":"Why did chancellor George Osborne have to scuttle off to China last week to round up funding for Hinkley Point, the expensive nuclear power station he wants to build in Somerset? The short answer is that every sensible investor decided long ago to give this troubled project a wide berth. Centrica, owner of British Gas, was the most high-profile refusenik. In 2013, it decided it could no longer throw good money after bad and took a £200m write-off rather than commit to a 20% stake. Former chief executive Sam Laidlaw’s investment record at Centrica was patchy but his judgment on that occasion was impeccable. “Since our initial investment, the anticipated project costs in new nuclear have increased and the construction timetable has extended by a number of years,” he said. Since then, Hinkley’s costs have ballooned to £24bn and the timetable been stretched ever further. The last government’s response was to agree a absurdly generous “strike” price of £92.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley’s output. Yet still it’s a struggle to get the investors to sign up. The European pressurised reactors (EPRs) that EDF, lead backer of Hinkley, is building in Finland and on home turf in Normandy are massively over budget and years behind schedule. “For third parties observing the announcements of delays and cost overruns for the EPRs under construction, it is difficult to commit,” Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of EDF, told French newspaper Les Echos last week. Don’t worry, continued Lévy, the Chinese “still have confidence in the EPR”. Up to a point. They, like everyone else, can see Osborne is desperate. They also require loan guarantees and a pledge that they can build their own nuclear plant (to a different design, naturally) in Essex. In short, the Chinese have Osborne over a barrel. One wonders what other incentives have been offered to avoid a humiliating U-turn on Hinkley. The final deal, assuming it is agreed, should be published in full: and parliament should comb every line."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/24/areva-creusot-nuclear-forge-france-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-24T21:57:22Z","webTitle":"Inspectors find safety irregularities at Creusot nuclear forge in France","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/24/areva-creusot-nuclear-forge-france-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/24/areva-creusot-nuclear-forge-france-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"Inspectors find safety irregularities at Creusot nuclear forge in France","bodyText":"An international team of inspectors has found evidence of doctored paperwork and other failings at a forge in France that makes parts for nuclear power stations around the world. The UK nuclear regulator said the safety culture at the site, which has produced forgings for British plants including Sizewell B and the planned new reactors at Hinkley Point, fell short of expectations. Last December regulators from the UK, US, China, Finland and Canada visited the Creusot forge run by the French state-owned nuclear builder Areva, to address their concerns after the country’s regulator ASN discovered quality-control problems and falsification of records in 2014. A report of the inspection by the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), obtained via a freedom of information request, concluded the improvement measures ordered by ASN were not yet effective. The visit uncovered an example of an employee at the forge “amending a manufacturing record in an uncontrolled manner” as recently as September 2016, two years after similar problems were uncovered. The doctoring went undetected by Areva’s on-site quality control, Areva’s independent third-party body and inspectors from EDF. The international inspectors also discovered the use of correctional fluid – like Tipp-Ex – at the forge’s operational control room. Correctional fluid is banned at the site, where a manager told the inspection team she regularly searched workstations for it. Experts said the report was worrying and would damage Areva. Paul Dorfman of the Energy Institute at University College London, who obtained the document, said: “Given nuclear regulation is all about safety, this kind of language is extraordinarily damaging coming, as it does, from the UK nuclear regulator.” Areva is already suffering serious financial problems. The company recently reported a €665m (£575m) net loss for 2016, though that is smaller than the €2bn net loss it posted in 2015. The ONR said there was a greater quality control presence “on the shop floor” of the Creusot, and much of the top management had been replaced since ASN told it to improve. But it said the international team of inspectors “were not confident that the improvement programmes and associated remedial actions … were sufficiently resourced, prioritised and integrated in order to bring about sustained improvements in manufacturing performance and nuclear safety culture”. The report said the UK regulator should reflect on whether EDF’s oversight of Areva was up to scratch, given it is a key supplier to the Hinkley Point C power station that EDF is building in Somerset. The ONR told the Guardian that since the visit to Creusot it had put in place plans to ensure any forgings destined for UK reactors, including Hinkley, met UK standards. A spokeswoman said: “Since this multinational inspection, ONR has developed its intervention plans to ensure that the licensee has in place and implements adequate management and assurance arrangements to clearly demonstrate that all components are manufactured to the required standards. “These plans will include a series of targeted inspections and other assessments of both the licensee and the supply chain, specification of appropriate regulatory hold-points, and a targeted regulatory review at an appropriate time in the next year to assess the progress and performance of both the licensees oversight and assurance activities and the expected improvements within the supply chain.” A spokesman for EDF said: “Steel forgings for Hinkley Point C will be manufactured to the most stringent nuclear standards which are reviewed and assessed by the independent UK regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. EDF Energy also has its own inspection and quality assurance programme to provide the required confidence that the components manufactured by Areva for Hinkley Point C meet those exacting standards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jul/13/donald-trump-greeted-with-military-fanfare-in-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-13T18:47:31Z","webTitle":"Trump downplays differences with France on climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/13/donald-trump-greeted-with-military-fanfare-in-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jul/13/donald-trump-greeted-with-military-fanfare-in-paris","fields":{"headline":"Trump downplays differences with France on climate change","bodyText":"The US president, Donald Trump, has begun a visit to Paris, greeted with military fanfare as the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, showed him Napoleon’s tomb before they held talks on Syria and counter-terrorism. The two leaders appeared keen to set aside their differences on climate change as they asserted their intention to work together on Syria and other matters. Standing alongside Macron at a news conference, Trump said that the two countries have had “occasional disagreements” but that would not disrupt a friendship that dates back to the American Revolution. He was non-committal on the possibility of the US rejoining the Paris climate agreement, telling Macron: “If it happens that will be wonderful, and if it doesn’t that will be OK too.” Macron acknowledged the two leaders’ differences on the climate pact but said they would find other areas of cooperation. “Should that have an impact on the discussions we’re having on all other topics? No, absolutely not,” he said. After landing in Paris early on Thursday morning, Trump began his visit by honouring American first world war veterans in a ceremony at the US embassy to mark 100 years since the US joined the conflict, while Macron was engaged in a separate meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The US president then arrived at the vast, historic military complex at Les Invalides, built by the Sun King Louis XIV, where he was met with a large French army reception and joined Macron in inspecting the troops. Trump will spend 24 hours in Paris, as a guest of honour at Friday’s Bastille day celebrations. While a row continues in Washington over allegations that his family sought to collude with Russia to win last year’s US presidential election, the US president looked relaxed, patting Macron on the shoulder several times as he began a schedule of high pomp and pageantry. Macron has chosen to move on from his aggressive first handshake with the US leader and style himself as Trump’s new “straight-talking” friend on the international stage. Trump firmly held Brigitte Macron’s hand as he and Melania Trump arrived to greet the Macrons at the historic site, where they were escorted to see Napoleon’s tomb. In a live stream of the visit on Macron’s Facebook page, Trump could be heard asking Macron questions about Napoleon and French history. The two leaders spent more than an hour at the Élysée Palace in talks where the key topics included Syria, Iraq, counter-terrorism and also possible financial support for French anti-jihadi military operations in Africa. In hosting Trump for 24 hours, Macron’s strategy is to set up a kind of of persuasive bridge-building. When the two leaders first met in May, the French president publicly asserted his superiority by crunching Trump’s knuckles and later rebuked him for pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord, but the tone has now shifted. Observing the US president’s increasing isolation on the western stage, Macron has sensed an opportunity to reach out. Christophe Castaner, a government minister and spokesman, described it as “offering a hand” to bring Trump “back into the circle”. French diplomats said Macron had been concerned about Trump feeling backed into a corner. The French leader has seen a potential opportunity to sway US thinking and elevate the role of France – a nuclear power and permanent member of the UN security council – in global affairs, in particular on Syria and the Middle East. France is the second biggest contributor to the US-led coalition in Syria and French officials had expressed concerns about what vision the US had there beyond taking the military fight to Islamic State. An Élysée official said: “Where we have differences, we talk about them very clearly – such as on climate – but there are issues like counter-terrorism where we are on the same line and need close cooperation and common action.” A joint press conference is scheduled for Thursday evening – the first time Trump has faced a room full of journalists since the latest allegations about his election campaign’s relationship with Russia. The military pomp of the Trump visit reflects Macron’s new style of showmanship diplomacy, seen when he invited Russia’s Vladimir Putin to the Palace of Versailles. It is aimed at highlighting French prestige and grandeur and is as much for his domestic audience as foreign leaders. The Élysée added what one official called a personal “post-card” tourism touch: instead of dining at the Élysée palace, Macron and his wife will invite the Trumps to eat a meal cooked by the chef Alain Ducasse in a restaurant at the top of the Eiffel Tower. It is a deliberate attempt to show the French capital was still “welcoming” after Trump told a rally that “Paris is no longer Paris” following a string of terrorist attacks. The Trump organisation has no financial interests in France and it is unclear how well the US president knows the country. He said last year that the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks would have been very different if French citizens were allowed to carry guns. While the two leaders held talks, Brigitte Macron was to take Melania Trump on a visit to Notre Dame Cathedral before a boat trip down the river Seine. The US first lady visited the Necker children’s hospital in Paris earlier in the day, where she spoke to children in French. Macron and Trump will attend the Bastille Day military parade on the Champs Élysées on Friday morning, before the Trumps return to Washington. Security for the visit was tight. Far from the official events, anti-Trump protesters were gathering at a “No Trump Zone” at Place de la République, where organisers linked to the Paris’s Nuit Debout movement said they would stand against Trump’s “anti-migrant positions, sexism, Islamophobia and racism”. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the leftwing party France Unbowed, said last month that Trump was “not at all welcome” on Bastille Day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2015/dec/13/three-police-forces-still-at-risk-of-budget-cuts-government-admits","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-13T22:43:28Z","webTitle":"Three police forces still at risk of budget cuts, government admits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/13/three-police-forces-still-at-risk-of-budget-cuts-government-admits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/dec/13/three-police-forces-still-at-risk-of-budget-cuts-government-admits","fields":{"headline":"Three police forces still at risk of budget cuts, government admits","bodyText":"Three police forces are at risk of having their budgets cut, despite the chancellor George Osborne’s pledge to protect police spending, the government has admitted. The forces concerned protect the transport system, army barracks and nuclear power infrastructure. The chancellor sprang a surprise when he promised to safeguard police spending during his spending review last month. But that was labelled a con by Labour on Sunday after the policing minister Mike Penning admitted that the pledge only applied to the 43 police forces funded by the Home Office. Three others – British transport police, defence police and the civil nuclear constabulary – are afforded no such security because they are funded by other Whitehall departments, as well as industry sources. The Treasury was unable to say on Sunday whether or not government funding of those three forces would be protected. Furthermore, the Treasury said that the private funding given to them was out of the government’s control. Labour initially claimed that the police budget promise was, in fact, a real terms spending cut because it only protected current levels of funding. But the Treasury insisted that was not the case. The spending review document made it clear that the government would “protect overall police spending in real terms over the spending review period, an increase of £900m in cash terms by 2019-20”. Sunday’s revelation will put further pressure on Osborne over police spending after the home secretary, Theresa May, insisted that, despite the chancellor’s promise to protect their overall budgets, police forces would still have to find savings. The admission was made in a ministerial reply to a written parliamentary question from Labour’s shadow Treasury minister Rebecca Long-Bailey. “Two weeks ago, George Osborne promised the British people he would protect the police who protect us – now we know that promise was just another con,” Long-Bailey said on Sunday. “We need a guarantee that the police forces in the frontline against terrorism won’t be in the firing line. The chancellor wasn’t protecting the police; he was just promoting himself.” A government spokesperson said: “It’s ridiculous to suggest the government is not committed to funding the forces that keep our country safe. At the spending review, we protected overall police spending in real terms with an increase of £900m cash by 2019-20 to maintain strong frontline policing and further strengthen police firearms resource to protect UK citizens. This is on top of an extra £500m extra funding for the counter terrorism budget, to protect the UK from the ongoing threat posed by terrorism. “Funding for other specialist police forces is not provided by a central government grant and comes from other sources, including industry. We are committed to funding our police forces across the country to protect Britain’s national security.” The three unprotected forces employ more than 6,300 officers between them – equivalent to some of Britain’s biggest forces."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2016/dec/04/the-children-review-lucy-kirkwood-royal-court-baby-boomers","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-04T08:00:08Z","webTitle":"The Children review – Lucy Kirkwood's subtle take on baby boomers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/04/the-children-review-lucy-kirkwood-royal-court-baby-boomers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2016/dec/04/the-children-review-lucy-kirkwood-royal-court-baby-boomers","fields":{"headline":"The Children review – Lucy Kirkwood's subtle take on baby boomers","bodyText":"Baby boomerism.

Three old friends – two of them married, two linked in a liaison – meet in a cottage near a nuclear power station that has suffered a disastrous meltdown. All are nuclear scientists.

The 75th anniversary of the evacuation, Operation Dynamo, passed two years ago; Christopher Nolan’s epic is sure to bring further attention for this port city of 90,000 that almost spills over the Belgian border. It’s another opportunity to branch out from the heavy industry that has dominated since the late 19th-century and to deepen its tourist credentials. Tourist dynamo After the film’s world premiere in London on 13 July, Christopher Nolan and Harry Styles previewed it for the Dunkerquois at the city’s Ociné de Pôle Marine last Monday. It was the least locals deserved for pitching in: with Nolan able to do what Spielberg couldn’t on Saving Private Ryan and film in situ, the city provided around 2,000 extras for a six-week shoot on and around the beach at Malo-les-Bains last May and June. The Hollywood presence, which also involved technical staff from the area, brought in an estimated €5-7m for the local economy. A nice little boost, but the municipality will be looking for Nolan’s Dunkirk spirit to linger in order to add touristic gloss to a city that has been largely known as a ferry and freight port and hub for intensive industries like steel and hydrocarbons. “The mayor, Patrice Vergriete, was very present at the events surrounding the filming,” says Paolo-Serge Lopes, 40, born in the city and president of a sustainable-energy company, “in order to make certain that that the French rediscover Dunkirk because of it. If we let the opportunity slip by, it’ll be a big mistake.” Key is the Dunkerque 1940 museum, which has just reopened with double the exhibition space. Dunkirk in numbers … 3 – the harbour’s ranking in France’s list of biggest ports, behind Marseille and Le Havre. 3 – different nations – Spain, France and England – that controlled Dunkirk on 25 June 1658, the final day of a month-long siege. 6 – fission reactors at the nearby Gravelines nuclear power station, also the sixth largest in the world. 450 – kilograms of smoked herring symbolically thrown by the mayor and his team on to crowds at the mardi gras carnival. … and pictures A few years ago, in an effort to break past images of beleaguered servicemen on white-sand beaches, the city commissioned William Eggleston and other famous photographers to re-envision the place. Here’s a flick through what Eggleston stumbled upon. History in 100 words Thanks to Nolan’s cinematic Cliff Notes, no need to go over the evacuation. Suffice to say that Dunkirk – named for the “church in the dunes” noted there in the 11th century – has been much fought over down the centuries. The Flemish counts and their French vassal lords scrapped over this strategic point on the Channel in the Middle Ages; the tug of war continued, England, Spain, the Netherlands and various Hapsburg entities also weighing in, until the 17th century. Dunkirk was certifiably French by 1662, when pirates still operated out of the rapidly fortifying town and expanding harbour. Jean Bart, whose name is still on a major Dunkirk square, was No 1 rogue. The arrival of rail in 1848 linked the city with the northern coalfields and made it a major point of entry for raw industrial materials. It also put a target sign over the city during wartime: heavily bombed in the first world war, it was more than 70% destroyed 30 years later. But Dunkirk bounced back. A modernist reconstruction of town and port proceeded under the urbanists Théodore Leveau and Jean Niermans, and perhaps fuelled by the ensuing tensions between locals and the French state, Dunkirk and surrounding communes declared themselves the county’s first agglomerated urban community in 1968. Dunkirk in sound and vision The Dunkirk carnival has a rep as France’s most raucous and eccentric. Here’s an hour of music to practice your finest drunken bellowing to. Take a dip back in time for swimming lessons at the Bains Dunkerquois, the beautiful oriental-facaded folly that has been closed since 1975. What everybody’s talking about The ongoing plight in the north of migrants and refugees, despite the closure of the camp in Grand-Synthe – part of the Dunkirk urban community – after a fire in April. At the start of July, Grand-Synthe mayor Damien Carème alerted President Macron to the presence of hundreds of migrant rough-sleepers in Puythouck woods and threatened to reopen a welcome center in the commune if nothing was done. “Migrant policy hasn’t changed between the UK and the France, and we haven’t dealt with the root of the problem from the humanitarian point of view,” says Lopes. But he says the general anxiety over the issue in Dunkirk is lower than down the coast. “It’s a relatively recent phenomenon here. Everything was concentrated in Calais, and Dunkirk was only a place of transit. A little while ago, people – especially the port-workers – were starting to say [the migrancy situation] could have an impact here. They didn’t want to have the problems their colleagues in Calais had to undergo.” What’s next for the city Project Phoenix is the regeneration programme on which hopes for the new, more white-collar Dunkirk are resting. It’s hoped that initiatives like pedestrianizing Place Jean Bart and widespread reworking of street furniture, new shops and housing lining Parc de la Marine and overhauling the public-transport system will start to address the urban degrowth that means the city currently loses 1,000 people a year. Particularly forward-thinking is the fact that its bus network will become free to use in September next year; using Tallinn as a model, Dunkirk will be easily the largest of the 29 French cities or towns to have adopted such a measure. It’s a key step in revitalising a town centre that’s suffered partly because cars were so in vogue when the reconstruction was drawn up.

But the Committee on Climate Change said it expected the increase to be more than offset by savings as people switched to more efficient fridge freezers, LED bulbs and better boilers. The committee, a body of experts set up under the Climate Change Act to advise the government, found that a rise of £105, or 9%, to the average £1,160 dual fuel bill in 2016 was down to green policies. These included subsidies for windfarms and solar power through schemes such as the Renewables Obligation. A report by the committee predicts that meeting the UK’s carbon targets would see the cost of the subsidies rise to £200 of an average bill of £1,350 by 2030. However, other factors were involved in the net increase. The committee also calculated that rising wholesale energy costs and other issues will add more than £200 a year to bills, while an ongoing switch to more energy-efficient appliances and gadgets is expected to save £150. Matthew Bell, chief executive of the committee, told the Guardian that he thought it was worth spending the money on climate policies. “The reason we’re acting to reduce our emissions is climate change poses real risks, real risks to the UK as well as round the world.” The cost was relatively modest, he said, adding: “What our analysis says quite clearly is that as a proportion of total energy costs, climate costs are a small minority portion. The vast majority of your energy bill is accounted by other things, like wholesale costs and transmission costs.” Five of the big six energy suppliers have announced price hikes over the winter, sparking calls for a cap on bills. Three energy companies outside of the major supplier group, including Bristol-based Ovo, which has 680,000 customers, and smaller suppliers Octopus and Utility Warehouse, signalled their support on Thursday for a relative price cap. The cap has been proposed by the Conservative MP John Penrose and would limit the gap between the best and worst deals on the market. About 50 MPs have backed a motion to be debated in parliament on Thursday, on the need to protect consumers on standard variable tariffs, which are the most common deal for British households. Some of the energy companies, such as German-owned E.ON, laid the blame for their rises partly on the cost of supporting green policies. But the Committee on Climate Change said that such policies had in fact shaved £290 a year off the average household energy bill between 2008 and 2016, because they had encouraged a shift to A-rated fridge freezers, condensing boilers and a swing away from incandescent lightbulbs to energy-saving ones. Bell said that future progress on more energy-efficient appliances was slowing slightly, but there was still potential for huge savings. “We’re still seeing only 1% of lighting being LEDs. And what we’ve not factored in at all is what IT will do for how we manage energy in our homes.” The committee said British households’ energy costs are not high compared to the rest of Europe. Residential electricity prices are below average, and gas prices the third lowest among 15 EU countries. Despite the government recently announcing a review into energy costs for businesses, the committee said climate policies were adding relatively little to companies’ bills and had not affected UK plc’s competitiveness. Rebecca Williams, energy specialist at WWF, said: “This report shows that energy companies are wrong to blame the increase in energy bills solely on UK government policies. It is clear that the main driver here is rising fossil fuel costs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/27/flamanville-france-edf-nuclear-reactor-hinkley-point-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-27T13:58:41Z","webTitle":"Flamanville: France's beleaguered forerunner to Hinkley Point C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/flamanville-france-edf-nuclear-reactor-hinkley-point-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/27/flamanville-france-edf-nuclear-reactor-hinkley-point-c","fields":{"headline":"Flamanville: France's beleaguered forerunner to Hinkley Point C","bodyText":"On granite cliffs overlooking the Channel is France’s most famous building site. If all goes to plan, by the end of the decade this rocky outcrop will house the biggest and most powerful nuclear reactor in the world. The technology behind the European pressurised reactor (EPR) is meant to be safer than anything that has gone before. But the project is more than three times over budget and years behind schedule, and France’s nuclear safety authority has found weaknesses in the reactor’s steel. And the same model could soon be coming to the English coastline at an even bigger cost. France’s state-controlled energy giant, EDF, is expected to announce on Thursday whether it will go ahead with its investment into the £18bn Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset, where two EPR-style reactors are proposed. EDF is expected to come out in favour of the massive project, despite strong opposition from trade unionist board members, who argue the French government cannot afford it. Perhaps not since the D-Day landings will the British government have taken such a keen interest in the Normandy coast. If and when it comes online, possibly in late 2018, the Flamanville EPR will be the world’s largest nuclear reactor. It will also be more efficient, using less fuel and producing almost a third less waste than older reactors, according to the technical specifics provided by EDF. The reinforced concrete core is intended to withstand plane crashes and earth tremors. But the combination of the EPR’s size and its safety features have turned it into a construction nightmare. Today, not a single EPR reactor operates anywhere in the world. In Flamanville, the first concrete was poured in 2007. Since then costs have more than tripled to €10.5bn, while the project is six years behind schedule. In Finland, the location of another EPR, the picture is even worse: the Olkiluoto reactor is nearly a decade behind and three times over budget, with the added headache of legal battles over who is to blame. Less is known about two EPR reactors being built in China. What might have been just a colourful tale of shareholder angst took a different turn in 2015, when it emerged that weak spots had been found in the Flamanville reactor’s steel, which is made by another French industrial champion, Areva. France’s Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) said it had found “very serious anomalies” in the reactor vessel. As the regulator deepened its investigation, it warned that the problems could affect other reactors in operation, although it stressed that France’s reactors were safe. In its latest annual report, the ASN described the safety of the country’s 58 nuclear power plants as “satisfactory”, but said it had “significant concerns” for the future as financial pressures build on France’s nuclear industry. Even before the 2011 Fukushima disaster turned some countries off nuclear power, the horizon for France’s nuclear industry was clouded. It has made a dash for big, costly projects, just as electricity production is moving to a smaller, more dispersed model with the arrival of renewables. Meanwhile, demand for power has been falling in continental Europe as a result of factory efficiency drives. Martin Young, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, questions whether anyone needs to be building nuclear power stations on the scale of Flamanville or Hinkley Point C. “We should probably think about smaller, easier-to-build, more-flexible nuclear power stations,” he says. Instead, the EPR prestige project has forced Areva to the brink of bankruptcy. The reactor builder is cutting 1,000 jobs and has been forced into a shotgun merger with EDF at the behest of the French government. No wonder the business newspaper Les Echos has come up with a new name for the EPR: Enormous Problems to Resolve. The EPR woes have raised the stakes over Hinkley Point C, whose two reactors are intended to supply 7% of British electricity by 2025. But the British project, to be co-funded with China, has become another enormous headache. In March, EDF’s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned because he felt his warnings that Hinkley Point C could bankrupt the company were being ignored. France’s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, argues that Hinkley Point C is vital to secure EDF’s position in the UK, but also to promote “our expertise in this major technology around the world”. In May, he told Le Journal du Dimanche that if Hinkley Point C did not go ahead, “we would give up our place to our American, Chinese or Russian competitors”. He also questioned where France would find the skills to renew its own ageing nuclear power stations. Some argue that savoir-faire in the French nuclear industry has already begun to wither. Mycle Schneider, a Paris-based nuclear policy analyst, accuses the industry of overestimating its capacity to build highly complex reactors, while underestimating skills gaps. “It is clear that the skills issue is part of the problem. Areva hasn’t built reactors [in France] for a very long time,” he says. Schneider is worried that relentless cost-cutting pressures could compromise safety, as Areva bids to save €1bn by 2017, through job cuts. “To me, it is very obvious that you will cut into safety and security and that is what makes me most nervous,” he says. “The financial and economic pressure on all the stakeholders is completely unparalleled.” The decision on Hinkley Point C may come down to politics. Young at RBC suggests that EDF wants a decision on Hinkley Point C while the UK has a functioning government and before possible Brexit aftershocks complicate the picture. “If you are EDF, why would you want to wait and run the risk of a snap election being called?” he says. A future government could change its mind on the project, Whitehall’s official spending watchdog has said, warning of a “tidal wave” of pressures from an impending Brexit. Patrick Fauchon, the mayor of Flamanville, is no stranger to political pressures. He recalls strong tensions in the 1970s when locals first debated plans to build two reactors. He has been in post since 1983, two years before the first Flamanville reactor went into service, followed by the second a year later. These reactors were among the 58 built by France in a rapid sprint between 1977 and 1999, spurred into action by the oil price shock. Like high-speed trains and Concorde, nuclear energy was viewed as a symbol of progress. For small towns such as Flamanville, it was a welcome source of jobs. The nuclear industry is by far the biggest employer in the region, estimated to provide one in two local jobs. The nuclear power station took over the site once occupied by the local granite mine, which closed in 1962. Once, Flamanville shipped granite all over France, including that used in Paris’s Place de la Concorde. Now it supplies nearly 5% of the country’s electricity. “There is a continuity of industrial life here,” says Fauchon. There are dissenting voices. A poster advertising an anti-nuclear rally along the tricolour-festooned high street underlines that not everyone has fallen head over heels for nuclear. But most people are content to support the industry. “The locals are very happy to take advantage of the huge financial windfall provided by La Hague [a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant] and Flamanville,” says Jacky Lebuhotel, a reporter. “Delays to the EPR may raise an eyebrow, but they are also a source of significant financial return.” Among the neat little yachts and cheerful summer blooms in the harbour at Diélette, it is easy to forget the nuclear plants that surround the bay – Flamanville on one side, La Hague on the other. Several people said they gave no or little thought to the local nuclear industry. Only the steady stream of trucks trundling past the tidy granite houses give a hint of a grittier business. Unsurprisingly, nuclear workers take a close interest in the EPR’s fortunes. Philippe Revel, a 51-year old foreman, is not convinced that the much vaunted next-generation nuclear model is an improvement on its “simpler, more functional” predecessors, or that it will play a big role in France’s nuclear future. Asked whether he would recommend it to the British, he smiles wryly. “Personally, no. It is too complicated. It is too big.” This piece was amended on Thursday 28 July 2016 to make clear that Mycle Schneider was referring to Areva’s reactor-building experience in France."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/dec/13/trampoline-gives-hens-a-measure-of-freedom","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-13T19:48:12Z","webTitle":"Trampoline gives hens a measure of freedom | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/13/trampoline-gives-hens-a-measure-of-freedom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/dec/13/trampoline-gives-hens-a-measure-of-freedom","fields":{"headline":"Trampoline gives hens a measure of freedom","bodyText":"The “Orwellian” schmoozing of young people in schools along the proposed HS2 route (Report, 12 December) pales into insignificance alongside the efforts of the nuclear industry to ingratiate itself with the community around the Magnox nuclear power station at Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex.

We were touring the estates of the Yantai Changyu Pioneer Wine Company and our guide was pleading with us to love what we were seeing. “Look at how beautiful the castle is! Just like your country.” Spring had not quite broken in northern China and the Italians were struck dumb by this strange semi-industrialised land where only the tiled tombs seemed to come from a China they might have imagined. Now they were faced by a looming vision of their own culture. It was the Chateau Reina winery, and the fields of vines around it had a slightly tenuous appearance, as if they had been placed there by an army of conquest. Chateau Reina was set to welcome its part-owner and investor, 76-year-old Augusto Reina, who was ahead of us in his private limo. Reina is the CEO of Illva Saronno, maker of Disaronno (the world’s most famous almond liquor), the renowned Sicilian marsala Florio, and other alcoholic brands. Reina once tried to buy Drambuie, but his joint ventures today reach deep into new, booming markets such as India and China. He is said to produce the most-consumed wine on earth and clearly enjoys marketing a “made in Italy” chic. “We try to look forward,” he was recently quoted as saying in a profile in Italian Vogue “riding the desire for novelty with ideas that generate fashions, tastes, trends.” I wondered if medieval castles in China were included. He and his wife come to China frequently. “China was lovely in the 1980s,” she said to me earlier that day. “There wasn’t any wine but there weren’t any cars either. I miss it.” After lunch in Chateau Reina’s banquet hall, I went for a buggy ride around the wine-themed park where gold cupids danced with plaster putti and a bench seemed to hold a life-size bronze of Augusto Reina himself, raising a glass. Changyu was founded in 1892 by a maverick diplomat named Chang Bishi who built his winery in the Shandong peninsula on the coast south of Beijing in a then small city called Yantai. But Bishi had to import all his plant stock from the west and, after decades of indifferent Communist rule, the experiment failed to produce anything drinkable. The story is much the same with China’s other major wine-makers. Ten years ago I visited the Great Wall Wine Company near Beijing in the middle of winter with Chinese wine writer Jim Boyce and found its vines desolately buried underground in order to endure a Mongolian-style winter, its freezing labs filled with shivering men and women in white coats looking more like year-rounders in a nuclear power plant – though they offered us a rather fine grappa. The wines were a work in progress and, as they delicately added, “not yet pleasant”. But everything has changed. Wineries like Grace, Changyu and now Great Wall have begun to carve out segments of the growing Chinese wine culture. Grace’s Deep Blue, for example, has become ubiquitous in luxury Chinese hotels and, along with Lafite, is a notorious favourite with government officials. Many wealthy drinkers will buy higher-priced wines simply to “give face” before a client, a boss or a mistress, and red is the luckiest colour to the Chinese. At Macau restaurant Robuchon au Dôme, Beijing and Shanghai millionaires happily pay thousands for Hermann Goering’s stash of rieslings (complete with swastika labels) and for rare bottles of Pétrus. The national palate is evolving and Dr Pepper is no longer poured into glasses of Romanée-Conti. That night at the Italian restaurant of the Xi’an Sofitel, I had a bottle of the Changyu Noble Dragon cabernet-syrah blend from another estate in Shandong, and was told that it was the world’s best-selling wine. Millions of bottles sold, production greater than the whole of rioja, etc. It was national pride in a bottle. Noble Dragon was “dry”, as advertised, technically well made, with an ornate old-world label – the canny Reina touch. Aside from the cabernet and syrah it also contained a dash of a local variety known as Dragon’s Eye. The Spanish love it. I followed it with a $90 bottle of Master’s Choice cabernet from Chateau Changyu and was quietly satisfied I wasn’t paying for it. It’s a pleasant wine, with a carefully studied technique behind it. The local party bosses wouldn’t mind the $90. In the dining rooms of the Sofitel, a vast Communist Sino-Russian art deco pile built in 1953 and once a state guesthouse, these wines were at home, perfectly attuned to their environment. They serve a distinctly Chinese corporate world inside which there is a fierce desire to make an indigenous equivalent to anything the outside world can create. The next day we flew to the place where that wine was made. On the way from the airport we passed through a wonderful bank of rolling mist that came off the sea and submerged the empty promenades. There was no sign of the horrifying apartment towers and as I sat in my 17th-floor room in the Yantai Hilton looking down at the misted sea, I had a feeling China’s original wine town might be more charming than I had anticipated. But at sunrise the mist had cleared and brilliant sunshine lay upon the sea and a hundred empty tower blocks identical to the ones surrounding Xi’an. “Yantai is famous for its beauty, for its Red Fuji apples and beautiful wines,” our translator cried into the microphone as we passed more tower blocks on our way to Changyu’s massive Wine City. One of the Italians asked how many people lived in Yantai. “Small city,” the translator smiled. “Only five million or so.” It was like the Wine City itself, a sprawling viticultural Willy Wonka factory with roofs taller than Amiens cathedral and endless conveyor belts, bottling machines and probably the largest fermentation tanks ever seen. That night we were invited to a banquet for the Reinas at the original Changyu chateau, this one more gothic in style, with suits of armour at the entrance and a bronze equestrian statue which could have been a mercenary Florentine condottiere commander of the Quattrocento or, quite possibly, Signore Reina himself once again. In yet another chilly and huge banqueting hall we sat through yet more eulogies to Chinese success, brilliance and vastness and then I was seated at a merry table along with the company’s principal wine-makers. Finally, drinking with the men who make the stuff, the mood swung back to something approaching the better spirit of Dionysus and, after I had expressed my enthusiasm, in my appalling Mandarin, for the whites being served, a few bottles of “off menu” stuff were brought up from the cellars, including an unusual example of Viognier. The Mandarin word for comrade, tongzhi, has taken on all kinds of meanings over the past 30 years but it is able, at certain moments, to encompass things like shared enthusiasms for the pleasures of fermentation. And this is what redeems all the gigantism, the empty towers, the billions of bottles, the projections of future glory: the feeling that, deep down, an old culture is returning to its roots and becoming, in a strange way, more Italian.

Tomorrow, the Closing the Gap latest report will be delivered to the parliament. Last year came with a renewed focus on a “refresh” – as Scott Morrison said in 2019 At Coag in December last year, all governments committed to share ownership of, and responsibility for, jointly agreed frameworks, targets and ongoing monitoring of a refreshed Closing the Gap Agenda, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples at its heart. Cag asked that this work be finalised by the middle of this year. This is a major step toward the genuine and mutually respectful formal partnership between governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians that will empower individuals and allow communities to thrive. Governments fail when accountabilities are unclear. When investment is poorly targeted, When systems aren’t integrated. And when we don’t learn from evidence. This is why clear accountability will be at the centre of a new approach to Closing the Gap, with states and territories and the commonwealth government and Indigenous Australians having clear responsibilities for delivering on targets. This is also why the progress we jointly make will be subject to regular independent Indigenous-led reviews. This is about delivering action on the ground. And this is about giving us all the best chance for success. This year, we will see how that is going. We’ll have that, and whatever else the Wednesday throws at us. You get the feeling everyone in this building is a little more tired and cranky than they usually are at this point in the sitting.

Backbench senator Matt Canavan is wasting no time stirring the pot from his new seat in the Senate. Just as Labor’s social team have wasted no time in capturing his interjections to Simon Birmingham in the Senate in a video for their MPs to share. Over in the Senate, Larissa Waters and Janet Rice have seen a motion demanding the government produce documents between the infrastructure minister and the prime minister regarding the sports grant affair pass. The government has until tomorrow morning to produce the documents. Which, based on recent history, it will not. And it’s official, official. Some other question time goodies from Mike Bowers: Someone seemed a little cranky this question time. Bob Katter, whose electorate of Kennedy sits just outside Collinsville, in the Capricornia electorate where the coal-obsessed Nationals want a coal-fired power plant has some things to say about the proposal: The federal government has bowed to the pressure of rogue, leadership driven Nationals by announcing a $4m feasibility study into a 1 gigawatt power station at Collinsville, Bob Katter has said. The Kennedy MP believes a power station of that size doesn’t stack up financially, and has called on Nationals MPs to stop using the north as a plaything for their own leadership battles. “I am all for a single unit, 200-megawatt power station at Collinsville,” Mr Katter said. “There was a power station there previously, so half of it is already built. The basic infrastructure is there; pylons, housing, buildings, and flooring. The construction costs would be negligible; it would create 100 jobs for the area and you would need to transport the coal from Newlands 60km away. So a 200-megawatt power station would be relatively cheap for North Qld industry and I say if you want to build it, just do it. “Going to a power station five times the size is just ridiculous. If we build a major coal-fired power station, the size they are talking of, we are locked into $84 a megawatt hour – Finkle is right. North Qld’s businesses and industries would collapse. Alternatively the people in south-east Qld are getting their power at $28 a megawatt hour.” It has taken a while, but the acting immigration minister, Alan Tudge, has responded to the high court decision from this morning. The key line here is: “On the face of it, it has created a new category of persons; neither an Australian citizen under the Australian Citizenship Act, nor a non-citizen.” Brendan Thoms has also been released from detention, following the court’s 4-3 ruling. The statement: The high court delivered a significant judgment today which has implications for our migration programs. In Love v Commonwealth of Australia and Thoms v Commonwealth of Australia, the high court acknowledged that neither Mr Thoms nor Mr Love were born in Australia and neither are Australian citizens under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007. Both men are citizens of other countries and entered Australia on valid visas, which were mandatorily cancelled under the character provisions in the Migration Act 1958, due to their significant criminal histories. The Migration Act gets its head of power under s 51(xix) of the Australian constitution – the power to make laws for “aliens”. The court held that Aboriginal Australians are not within the reach of the “aliens” power under the constitution. This may have implications for both the operation of the Australian Citizenship Act and the Migration Act. On the face of it, it has created a new category of persons; neither an Australian citizen under the Australian Citizenship Act, nor a non-citizen. The government is currently reviewing the decision and its implications. In light of the court’s ruling, Mr Thoms was this morning released from immigration detention. Mr Love had previously been released in September 2018. The Department of Home Affairs will consider the best methods to review other cases which may be impacted. On robodebt, Bill Shorten says he believes most of the $1.5bn the government raised in revenue using the scheme, should be returned to those who paid it: I mean, the reality is that if this, just without over complicating it. Robodebt was introduced by the government. They would assess whether or not a Centrelink recipient was entitled to a payment. It doesn’t take into account sometimes people are unemployed and people are employed. This is farmers, students, single mums and pensioners. They have relied on a computer generated program and we have said it was an unfair program, but what I’ve discovered in the last few months and now the courts have established, it is illegal. In other words, the government didn’t have the power to just rely on a computer program without checking it before they sent the letter of demand out to vulnerable Australians. This is a scandal. I know we’re almost so cynical about scandals, but this is a situation where the government of Australia, the biggest entity, the most powerful organisation in Australia has been unlawfully creating debts from citizens to the commonwealth which were just invalid. Why don’t heads roll anymore? ... It was an unlawful scheme. It is wrong. ... If you have been breaking the law for three-and-a-half years and then you decide to breaking the law is that good for bad? It makes you look stupid and negligent. What happened on 19 November is the chief lawyer for the tax office says to the commissioner of taxation effectively it was a smoking gun document which the document didn’t want us to see, but we won the vote so it went out publicly. They said, “Hey, the Department of Social Security’s lawyers have told us we can’t do this.” How embarrassing for the tax office. They go along taxing and doing everything and they have been told by the science brigade in the government, the lawyers that it is October and it is OK and now it is not OK. The government were so greedy there they wanted to go after welfare shaming, blame the poor they are ripping things off and they didn’t bother to check the detail. Two, they did check the detail and they just didn’t care. Either way it is an incompetent scandal and in this government where blame never sticks to the elected ministers, who is in charge? Bill Shorten is now speaking to Patricia Karvelas on the ABC and he’s asked about Labor’s position on coal: First of all, we’ve got coal fired power stations and they’re part of our energy grid, but going forward, you know, I know that people like to debate the hypotheticals – the only proposal which seems to have any legs at all is that the government will underwrite a taxpayer funded coal fired power station. That’s the only proposition on the table and Labor wouldn’t invest any taxpayer money in that. ...It is a hypothetical and we know that one of the great stalling tactics of the climate sceptics of the government and they did it to some effect in the last election was, you know, putting up these hypothetical propositions. I agree with something that the previous interviewee, Zali Steggall said. We have got to start thinking about the future. You and I know that this government is so divided that they have got to placate the climate sceptics with taxpayer-funded coal fired power stations and that’s the issue and indeed today in Question Time, poor old Minister Birmingham is up the front trying to give one answer and you hear Matt Canavan down the back interjecting and you have got George Christensen out there on contradicting other Liberals. We have this ongoing destructive debate we have seen since 2013. On the division within the Coalition on climate, Zali Steggall says: Look, I think it is distracting and I don’t think it is good, but at the same time this is democracy and to expect everyone to have the same views on every issue is unrealistic, but what I want to see is every issue being given the same weight and importance. We should have a conscience vote on the climate change bill where it is a matter of principle. We should not have a situation where a couple of rogue voices hold to ransom good policy. ... I’m not in the party room. I’m an independent, but I certainly encourage and urge every MP that feels strongly that we need to be on a path of clear policy when it comes to climate action to speak up. You have a duty to your electorate to ensure they are safe in the future. I support those MPs that want to speak up on better action on climate change. ...I do think everyone is accountable. And at the end of the day we are all accountable to the electorate and the people who voted for us, if they don’t feel we have done a great job in representing their views and concerns, it will be their decision in two years. We have that duty and responsibility. This is what we’re here to do. We have a duty to make sure we’re looking further afield.It can’t just be about reactive policies and three-year short-termism. We need to put in place a long-term plan. So I would encourage MPs to be brave and stick to their principles and really fight for what’s right. Zali Steggall tells Patricia Karvelas more than 20,000 people have signed the petition calling for her climate bill to be treated as a conscience vote. It has only been up since the weekend. Guardian Australia understands that shadow assistant treasurer Stephen Jones has made an offer for Labor to support the Coalition’s proposed amnesty for employers who have failed to pay superannuation – if the Coalition agrees to an amendment putting the superannuation guarantee in the national employment standards. Super in the NES would make it a right enforceable by workers (and their unions, lawyers etc), to sue for unpaid super rather than relying on the Australian Tax Office to follow it up. Labor points to the fact an amnesty is expected to gain back just $86m of the $5.9bn unpaid superannuation bill, so wants something with more teeth. The Law Council has responded to the the high court decision today. From its statement: The Law Council of Australia has welcomed a landmark high court decision confirming that the Australian parliament cannot use the “aliens” power to make laws for Aboriginal Australians. Law Council president, Pauline Wright, said the decision of the high court today in Love v Commonwealth of Australia; Thoms v Commonwealth of Australia flows from the Mabo (No 2) decision in 1992. This decision confirms that the question of membership of Aboriginal societies is outside of the legislative power of the Australian parliament, Ms Wright said. “Many lawyers were concerned about the notion that people of Indigenous heritage could be deported both for the individuals concerned and their families,” Ms Wright said. “The Law Council welcomes the decision which turned on the principle of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having native title rights. These rights depend on the existence of societies with continuing systems of law and customs that pre-date the acquisition of sovereignty by the British, and the unique connection Aboriginal people have to the lands of Australia. This means they cannot be regarded as aliens.” Ms Wright said the decision raised a number of complex issues which require careful consideration. The plaintiffs in the case were both born outside Australia and were not Australian citizens but they identified as Aboriginal people and were accepted as such by other members of their community. “The decision is not one which the high court has previously had to consider but is one of a number of questions which might naturally flow from the Mabo (No 2) decision in 1992,” Ms Wright said. “It will no doubt be the subject of much scrutiny and comment in the coming weeks and months.” Scott Morrison calls time on question time. That hour was a very long month. I just nearly choked on a rogue Snickers peanut and that was still more enjoyable than this question time. You’re really not yourself when you’re hangry. What we learned there, in that very long nothing answer, is that the government wants to avoid answering whether or not it would provide an indemnity to any new coal-fired power plant in north Queensland. And that is important to note. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: The proponents of the Collinsville coal power plant have said it will require a taxpayer indemnity from carbon risk, which the Australian Industry Group says could cost taxpayers $17bn. Will the prime minister provide that indemnity? Morrison: Our government believes in jobs. We believe in jobs in north Queensland. We believe in jobs in northern Tasmania. We believe in jobs in Western Australia. Right across the country we believe in jobs and we believe in ensuring that manufacturing continues to be able to get access to the reliable power it needs to ensure that they can support jobs and livelihoods into the future. So before the last election our government committed to undertake to look at what the reliable power generation options were to support heavy industry in north Queensland. And that review, Mr Speaker, then led to the series of options that were put before the government, which the government has agreed to support, undertaking feasibility studies to assess those options and how they can support jobs in north Queensland. Now, Mr Speaker, we are technology agnostics when it comes to ensuring we have reliable power generation in this country. We want to ensure the electricity prices come down, not go up. We want to ensure the lights stay on, not go off. We want to ensure that industries, whether they be in north Queensland or anywhere else, that provide the livelihoods for Australians continue to be maintained and we will assess the options which support those jobs. The simple question I have for those opposite... We may never know the answer to that, because Tony Burke brings him up on relevance, which Tony Smith agrees with. George Christensen then has a go: The point of order is that the question is purely hypothetical. There is no carbon price unless they’re proposing to bring in a new tax. Smith tells him the question is in order, and the prime minister didn’t object to it, so the time to have done that is passed. Morrison goes on, but then Smith sits him down and tells him to get to the point. Morrison: What I was seeking to do was to say that the feasibility study of the Collinsville project was what the government has committed to undertake. The matter that the member has raised with me in this question is not currently before the government. It’s not currently before the government. It is not before us. What I know, Mr Speaker, is our government will always stand up for jobs and the leader of the opposition wants to have his eachway on every bet and when it comes to the resources industry in north Queensland and the jobs of north Queensland ... he is nowhere to be found. Vince Connolly appears to still be possessed by a cut-price Toastmasters aficionado, and is losing the battle to keep the spirit contained. The power of Lizzo compels you. The power of Lizzo compels you. THE POWER OF LIZZO COMPELS YOU. Joel Fitzgibbon to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister consider the implementation of a minimum farmgate milk price to help our desperately struggling dairy farmers? David Littleproud, and his tie, gets the nod for this one: This is nothing more than a cruel hoax. This should be above politics and cheap politicisation. In fact, the member for Hunter is not promising a minimum milk price, what he said was he’d get the ACCC to investigate. Let me save the Australian taxpayer a couple of million dollars. The ACCC gave back a report that actually said it shouldn’t do that but in fact we should have a dairy code of conduct, one in which this government is putting in place. One which we are making sure that there is a timeline of transition, complemented by a market mechanism that will grow like other commodities can. That other commodities enjoy. This is about ensuring that populous politics and the policies of One Nation are not adopted by the Labor party. This reckless, reckless cruel hoax to dairy farmers that are doing it tough is something I didn’t think I would see, particularly the last time that we had a floor price was for wool. It was for wool. And how did that work out? That ended up being a stockpile, an oversupply. All economists say exactly the same thing. This is a perishable product. A perishable product. In fact, I remember the member for Hunter coming into this chamber and espousing the fact that it was a Labor minister that got rid of the floor price on wool. Now they have turned around and gone with the economic advice of One Nation. That is what the economic credentials of the Australian Labor party has become, nothing more than a cruel hoax. From a reader: Michael McCormack is really enjoying Keith Pitt’s performance. Enough said. Phil Thompson brings Keith Pitt to the dispatch box, and the new minister turns up with a “it’s great to be back”. Dude, it’s been less than 24 hours. You didn’t actually go anywhere. Scott Morrison continues: And I can confirm that the small-scale renewable energy technology package remains part of the government’s policy and will continue to remain part of the government’s policy, Mr Speaker. And the minister of resources – and I’ve been asked about comments by the minister for resources. And I quote the minister for resources – he has a lot of common sense. He says, “As an electrical engineer, I can tell you solar panels don’t work in the dark.” Well, that’s a simple statement of fact, Mr Speaker. We can’t have the entire Australian economy relying on the weather, he says, Mr Speaker, “otherwise you’d only be working between 11am and 3pm in the afternoon, if it’s just on solar. You won’t do anything in the dark.” The minister of resources is making a point which seems lost on those opposite. That if you’re putting all your eggs in one basket on intermittent renewals, you cannot support jobs in heavy industry, Mr Speaker. Now, the leader of the opposition needs a GPS to explain his policy, Mr Speaker. He’s got one policy on climate in north Queensland and another one down in Melbourne, Mr Speaker. Just like the member for Maribyrnong. Mr Speaker, they can’t even tell you what their 2030 target is. And if you ask the deputy leader of the Labor party, normally so eloquent at this dispatch box, as he comes and gives each audition without notes, you ask him about coal, Mr Speaker, and his tongue wraps around his head! Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to his new minister for resources’ statement that, and I quote, “We have got a real risk, particularly with solar panels and lithium batteries, that they could turn out to be this generation’s asbestos.” Does this statement reflect his government’s policy? That is in relation to this story from Sarah Martin in June 2019, where Keith Pitt said: The Nationals MP Keith Pitt, who is leading the charge for the new Senate probe, said he was open to the idea that a carbon price may be necessary for nuclear power to stack up. “This is the purpose of having the select committee, I think it is past time we had the conversation with the Australian people about nuclear energy,” Pitt said. He said he wanted the select committee to also look at the lifetime costs of renewable technologies in comparison to nuclear, saying solar panels only had a life expectancy of up to 20 years and there were “tens of millions” of them already in the system. “We have got a real risk particularly with solar panels and lithium batteries that they could turn out to be this generation’s asbestos,” he said. “We need to look at the life cycle in its entirety and we need to have a balanced approach moving forward with energy in this country.” Morrison: Under our government, we have now one of the highest rates of solar panels on people’s roofs of any country in the world, Mr Speaker. And, under our government’s policy, Mr Speaker, we know the future of emissions reduction and renewable energy is achieved through technology, not taxation. We know you achieve it not by putting people’s electricity prices up, we know you don’t put more taxes on it, and we know you don’t wipe out jobs in regional Australia because of the approaches that those opposite would have applied to the Australian people, had they been elected at the last election. What we have, and the minister for resources and northern Australia is an electrical engineer, Mr Speaker. And, Mr Speaker, he could write on a postage stamp what the leader of the opposition would know about this issue compared to the new minister, Mr Speaker. Albanese jumps up on relevance. Karen Andrews is going full Karen in the house. Seriously. There is a reason we don’t cover dixers. Susan Templeman to Greg Hunt: Young Australians in my electorate have faced the stress and trauma of bushfires for weeks and weeks and weeks. Yet the government’s only promised one headspace satellite service for my entire electorate, and it still hasn’t opened. Will the government listen to the calls from my community to upgrade the Katoomba headspace to a full centre and get it up and running immediately? Hunt: And I want to thank the member for her point. Only yesterday I met with Pat McGorry, as well as spoke with the head of headspace for Australia. We discussed a number of needs across Australia, and whilst they didn’t raise this one, I can say that this is one of 30 new services which the government is funding. And, more significantly than that, we know that the Nepean Blue Mountains [primary health network] PHN is working closely with the local community to ensure that the new headspace is established. In particular, in addition, the PHN is receiving funding of $500,000 to support young people aged 12-25 in bushfire-affected communities. So this is in addition to the headspace funding. So we are supporting headspace by establishing one, we’re providing, right now, at this moment, $500,000. And unfortunately that was omitted from the question, that important detail. And as well as that, and I make this commitment to the House, there is additional funding for those PHNs and those headspaces which require additional services, if demand exceeds what is provided for then we will provide that additional funding. So that will be demand-driven in the case of Katoomba. So it’s one of 30 around the country. It’s supplemented by $500,000, specifically for PHN. Again, I realise that was an omission from the question. And the commitment is that if demand exceeds what is currently provided, we will meet that demand in full. There is a real pattern emerging of Nationals MPs wearing green ties with dark blue suits, and really I can see why the party room is in revolt. Josh Frydenberg is yelling again, and I can’t transcribe it, because GUESSWHOTHATFINANCIALGENIUSWASSIRTAXALOT is doing my head in, and really, you only get one life. Angus Taylor is allowed to take dixers again. Moving on. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg (this is really shaping into the battle between two MPs who have the leadership of their respective parties in their future sights, and have a very similar parliamentary style – although one seems to know how microphones work, which gives him a slight edge): The Reserve Bank said very low levels of investment are a very significant issue for the Australian economy. Given that business investment is now down 20% under this Liberal government, and is now at its lowest levels since the last recession three decades ago, why doesn’t the government have a plan to lift business investment and get the economy going again? Frydenberg: Under the Coalition, investment outside the mining sector has increased by 34% since we came to government, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, investment outside the mining sector fell by 10% during their time in office. Now, Mr Speaker, the member for Rankin refers to the governor of the Reserve Bank. Now, the Governor of the Reserve Bank made a very interesting speech last week, and what he said was that the fundamentals of the Australian economy were, in his words, “very strong”, Mr Speaker. That is what he has said. The strong fundamentals include world-class endowments of natural resources, a highly skilled and innovative workforce, an established and predictable regulatory system, sound public finances, a diverse and growing population, and being well-placed to benefit from the strong growth in Asia, not just in China, but also in the countries of Indonesia and India, Mr Speaker. So, this is what the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said. So we have a lot to feel fortunate about. “We enjoy a set of fundamentals and a standard of living that few other countries enjoy. It’s important that we do not lose sight of this.” So, why is it only the Labor party who’s constantly talking down the Australian economy, Mr Speaker? The governor of the Reserve Bank is saying how strong the fundamentals ... It’s because the Labor party are only interested in the politics of the economy, not the jobs that the economy creates, not in boosting the livelihoods of hardworking Australians. Someone is excited about the impending royal visit: For the record, I am a republican. And also #TeamSussex It really is the Josh Frydenberg hour today. My main takeaway is that he STILL hasn’t worked out how a microphone works. Sussan Ley’s office has updated the threatened species list after the bushfires: The Wildlife and Threatened Species Bushfire Recovery Expert Panel has identified a provisional list of 113 animal species as the highest priorities for action to support recovery from the 2019-2020 bushfires. Among the animals identified for the most urgent management intervention are the Kangaroo Island dunnart, the northern corroboree frog, the Blue Mountains water skink and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo. The panel’s detailed review overlays the status of species before the fires, the area of habitat potentially impacted by fires and the species’ overall vulnerability to fire events. As the Morrison government’s initial $50m wildlife and habitat recovery package flows to states, natural resource managers and zoos to help fund animal treatment, insurance populations, food drops and pest animal control, the expert panel’s work is identifying species in most critical need of action for short-term protection and long-term recovery. The panel’s scientific advice will help the government’s on-ground delivery partners to target their efforts to where it is most needed. Thirteen birds, 19 mammals, 20 reptiles, 17 frogs, five invertebrates, 22 crayfish and 17 fish species are identified as the highest priorities for urgent management intervention over the coming weeks and months. Some species were already threatened before the fires, but this new analysis also includes other mammal, bird, reptile, frog and crayfish species that were not previously considered to be under threat. The whole list can be found, here You may be noticing a theme there. The theme being the budget surplus is probably forked, and Josh Frydenberg now has to sell a strong economy line, while walking back all the ‘back in black’ declarations and hoping that there is some massive turnaround in the next few months. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Can the treasurer confirm that, since the election, the government has downgraded its own forecasts for growth, the IMF and OECD have downgraded Australia’s growth forecasts more than other advanced economies, the Reserve Bank has downgraded its forecast for growth three times? Why has the government refused to provide support to an economy that was already floundering, even before the bushfires and coronavirus hit? Frydenberg: I can confirm to the House that the International Monetary Fund has the Australian economy growing faster this year than the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Mr Speaker. Now, the honourable member ... asked about the support that we were giving to the Australian economy. Well, I can confirm, in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which was released just prior to Christmas, we announced the bringing forward of $4.2bn in funding and spending on infrastructure, Mr Speaker. And we announced more than half a billion dollars extra for aged care, Mr Speaker. And since the election, we’ve announced about $1.3bn of commitments over and above what had previously been announced in relation to responding to the drought, Mr Speaker. And those on this side of the House know that we announced a $2bn National Bushfire Recovery Fund, which was on top of the payments and allowances which we provide from the commonwealth through the states. Now that $2bn was announced without increasing taxes, Mr Speaker. ... So, the Labor party, they’re in favour of higher taxes, they’re in favour of fewer jobs, they’re in favour of stronger unions. What we are in favour of, on this side of the House, is more jobs, lower taxes and a stronger Australian economy. Michael McCormack, resembling the word interminable, is once again pretending to be a statesman, and honestly, it would be funny if it wasn’t so depressing. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Why does the treasurer pretend that weakness in the economy is entirely due to the fires and coronavirus, when before they hit, this Liberal government was already presiding over weak and slowing growth with a one in front of it, stagnant wages growth, high underemployment, declining business investment and falling productivity, well below-average consumer and business confidence, and record net debt and record household debt? Frydenberg: I’m pleased to inform the member for Rankin, and the House, that we have the first current account surplus in more than 40 years, Mr Speaker. We have the lowest welfare dependency in 30 years, Mr Speaker. We have the biggest tax cuts in more than 20 years, Mr Speaker. And we have the first balanced budget in 11 years, Mr Speaker. Now, the member for Rankin referred to the time before the coronavirus. Now, Mr Speaker, that includes the month of December. Now, that includes the job numbers for the month of December. Well, we created 29,000 new jobs, Mr Speaker. And unemployment fell to 5.1%, Mr Speaker. What was unemployment under Labor? 5.7%, Mr Speaker ... Today, employment growth is around three times what it was under Labor, and around double the OECD average, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, the gender pay gap was 17.2% and rising. Today, it’s now 14%, Mr Speaker, and we’re seeing that women are about $1,000 a year better off, Mr Speaker, in that particular bracket. Now, under Labor, non-mining investment was in free-fall, Mr Speaker. It fell 10% over their six years in government. Since we’ve come to government, growth in non-mining investment has been over 30%, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, in the last year, 62,000 small businesses shut their door, Mr Speaker. Under us, in the last reported year, 75,000 small businesses were created, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, living standards, as measured by real net national disposable income per capita, had fallen by 1.2%. And they are 3.3% higher through the year today, Mr Speaker. And under Labor, in their last four budget outcomes, the budget deteriorated by about $80bn. Whereas our last four budgets, we’ve seen improvement of over $10bn, Mr Speaker. So growth continues under the Australian economy. We’ve seen more jobs created. And under Labor you’ll always see higher taxes and fewer jobs. Once again – the last time Labor was in power, there was the global financial crisis. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister agree with the father of the House, the Liberal member for Menzies, who said today, and I quote, “If you can’t govern yourselves, you can’t govern the country”? Morrison: (tl;dr – the government is united, don’t you know) ... This government is united on the need to lower taxes, Mr Speaker. I can assure the House the government is united on the need to build infrastructure, as we are. That we’re united on the need, Mr Speaker, to build the dams, that is climate action now, Mr Speaker. I can say, Mr Speaker, the government is united on the need to continue to expand our trade borders, as we have done, Mr Speaker, and increased the amount of trade, two-way trade that is subject to export agreements, under this government from 26% to 70%, Mr Speaker. I can say absolutely, Mr Speaker, that this government is united on the need to bring our defence force funding and spending to 2% of GDP, Mr Speaker. ... And I can tell you we’re united on the need to take action on the drought and support drought funds, Mr Speaker. I can tell you that we’re united on the position of having temporary exclusion orders for terrorists and mandatory sentencing for paedophiles, and cracking down on farm invaders, Mr Speaker. And I can tell the House that we are united on the need to ensure that we meet our emissions reduction targets, not by increasing taxes on people, not by putting up people’s electricity prices, and not by walking away from the jobs of Australians in rural and regional areas. That’s what we’re united on, and we’re united on what we took to the Australian people, Mr Speaker. And what we took to the Australian people was an economic plan to create jobs, and that’s what’s happening, Mr Speaker. That’s what we took to the Australian people. Now, once upon a time was a Labor government that did believe in creating jobs, Mr Speaker. Given he is referring to a comment that was first made by the former prime minister, Mr Hawke, this is what the leader of the opposition used to say about the Hawke government, Mr Speaker. He said in an article quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald, it was said that the Hawke government had lost touch with people when they talk about wages, budget deficits, they talk about it like it’s out of the textbooks. [They show] ... an absolute contempt for working-class people. Someone like Keating can put himself up as a possible Labor PM, but he’s more comfortable mixing with millionaires and business executives than he is with working-class people. This mob are not a patch on Hawke and Keating, Mr Speaker. They have nothing in common with them. Tony Burke points out that the article quoted was from the “previous millennium” but the House moves on. Scott Morrison has recently said there is no question climate change is happening and it is having an impact within his government, and that has always been the case. Cue Craig Kelly: The decision for a couple to have children is normally personal and private. However, last night the national broadcaster put to air comments of a young lady saying she was too scared to bring children into this world because of climate anxiety. Sadly, this is what hysteria, alarmism, propaganda and misinformation has brought. The facts are a child born today is 100 times safer from extreme weather than their grandparents. And this trend continues. Last year was the safest year in human history from extreme weather events. And a child born this year will enjoy a life expectancy 25 years longer than that of their grandparents. And while we worry about the coronavirus, remember our great grandparents survived world war one, lived through the Spanish flu, which killed between 50 and 100 million people, about 3% to 6% of the world’s population. They then survived the horrors of the great depression and world war two. And with the very real threat of nuclear war, our parents and grandparents maintained the optimism and decided to have children, otherwise none of us would be here today. The reality is a child born today will inherit a world that is safer and more prosperous than ever before, and given the freedom and opportunity they will make it even better. First we get a statement on indulgence* on the coronavirus and how the Chinese-Australian community have handled it: Scott Morrison: We want to thank the Chinese-Australian community for the way they’ve supported each other and how so many other Australians have also supported them. Those who might have been involved in self-isolation, the medical professionals who have been working within these communities. This is a very significant challenge and the Chinese-Australian community has risen to that challenge. They deserve our great appreciation and support. And going forward, Mr Speaker, I know that will continue. And the House stands as one on this matter. Anthony Albanese thanks the prime minister for his bipartisanship comments. *Albanese did a 90-second speech on this topic and Morrison’s statement on indulgence followed it. Question time is about to begin. Huzzah. The treasurer and deputy leader, Josh Frydenberg, also echoed the prime minister’s remarks, reflecting on John Howard’s adage that the Coalition was a “broad church” and joking that “sometimes we need to bring in the builders to build an extra pew or two”. “But what unites us is bigger than what divides us,” he said. He also said he was frustrated that the “historic” visit on Monday by the Indonesian president was overshadowed by the Nationals’ turmoil, urging colleagues to focus on the issues that mattered to voters, including economic management and lower household power prices. “We must all focus on those achievements and our policies and plans going forward and put internal issues of recent days behind us,” he said. The Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, said he had received a call from Judy Brewer, the wife of former Nationals leader Tim Fischer, who had called him after he completed a trek in Tumbarumba. McCormack said Brewer had relayed her view that Fischer “would want us all to stand firm together at present” to deliver on the government’s commitment to deliver lower taxes and to help those affected by fire and drought. Following a robust discussion in last week’s party room meeting over climate change, the former resources minister, Matt Canavan, spoke about the importance of delivering on the promise of a feasibility study into the Collinsville coal-fired power station, saying it was an election commitment that had boosted the vote in Michelle Landry’s seat of Capricornia. Canavan said the Collinsville community had rewarded Landry with a 48% primary vote “despite it being historically a strong Labor community and some of that was to do with the promises being made”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has lectured MPs about the importance of unity, urging them to focus on the Australian people and move past the Coalition’s “difficult period” of recent months. In a joint party room meeting of MPs on Tuesday, Morrison urged his squabbling MPs to remember that they came to Canberra as members of the government “team”, saying there were only “two party rooms in this building”: that of the government and that of the opposition. “When we walk through the doors of the cabinet room we take on serious responsibilities. Equally when we walk through the doors of the government party room we also take on serious responsibilities and we must do so as a government,” he said, according to a spokesman. “That’s the argument we took the last election: highlighting local plans and capabilities of local MPs, but also doing so very much as a member of the government and the team.” Morrison said that the Australian people had endorsed MPs as a “government” and that no individual was above that. “We are the government, I am not, but we are. No individual is. We are together the government. “We know that there are many parties in this government, the Liberal party, the National party, the CLP, the LNP, but the contract we have with the Australian people is when we are walking through these doors is to be the government, their government. “The people supported us and we owe them to continue to deliver for them, to deliver what we promised – in terms of tax relief, economic growth and other policies, including stable government that is focused on them. That is the contract we have with the Australian people.” Morrison urged MPs to focus on their constituents when they returned to their electorates at the end of the week. ”Focus on the people who put us here – think of them because when they are foremost in our minds, as they are in mine, we do our best for them,” Morrison said. On those Australians who are in quarantine on Christmas Island, Greg Hunt laid out this timetable for their departure: The respective dates for the quarantine for Christmas Island ending February 17 for the first humanitarian flight, and February 19 for those that came from New Zealand via Air New Zealand, and we thank the New Zealanders. They will be tested before they leave and if health authorities believe that additional testing is required, then they’ll do that. But they’ll be able to go home, subject to having a very clear process of having been checked and declared disease-free. If the chief medical officer has had to warn people to stop being xenophobic, you know it is bad. He’s not alone. George Christensen also had to issue a plea to stop on his Facebook page, where he reported a constituent had presented to hospital concerned they had caught coronavirus because they had eaten Chinese food. Christensen was worried about the impacts of the scare on north Queensland tourism. Strange bedfellows, yes, but irrational public panics tends to create those. Professor Murphy continued: We’re talking about a relatively small number of people just because of where they’ve been, not who they are. There is no community transmission of this virus in Australia. We have not seen any case of sustained transmission at all in this country. There is no reason for people to be wearing masks. There’s no reason for people to avoid anybody of any particular background or appearance. I want to reassure the community. As the minister said, our quarantine is working extremely well at the moment, and we’re very, very pleased that the two facilities have had excellent medical support, and we’re obviously actively screening everybody on a regular basis. So, the situation is clearly evolving in China. There are still more and more cases in Hubei, but we are watching that very closely and there is smaller growth outside of that province. The international scene has been closely watched, and at the moment, our containment strategies are effective and do seem to be working in Australia. In a press conference with Greg Hunt, updating the nation on coronavirus (five cases have recovered), Prof Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, has warned against xenophobia when discussing the health pandemic. We’ve still only got 15 cases in Australia and all are clinically in good condition. They’re all in stable condition. Five have recovered. This is consistent with the exported cases around the world, the 455 cases. There have been some severe cases in some countries, but they’re very small numbers, and only two deaths in the exported cases. Which is a positive. But, as we know, more than 2% of the cases in Hubei province have been reported as having an unfortunately fatal outcome. So we are still evaluating the severity of this virus, and there’s still a lot more information that we need to know. But as the minister says, our strategies have been there, saying that we’ve isolated the cases, all of whom had come from Hubei province, or in one case, had contact with someone who was a confirmed case from Hubei province. We have not yet seen anyone without contact from Hubei province or been from Hubei province detected in Australia. As the minister said also, our risk population is people who have come from China from February 1. Not people of Chinese background. People who have come from China, whatever their background is. And we are very concerned about xenophobia and any sort of racial profiling which is completely abhorrent. Look, there is a lot to unpack there. As always. Bottom line though is the government should probably stop trying to deport Australians. And just on the “hOw mUcH bLOOd dO YoU haVe” ridiculous argument a lot of white people like to throw at Indigenous people, have a look at any St Paddy’s day celebration, where people whose great-great-great-grandmother’s cousin’s sister’s best friend’s neighbour was Irish are suddenly running around with a ‘kiss me, I’m Irish shirt’. Stop it. It’s a shit argument. Pauline Hanson responded to the high court decision in the most Pauline Hanson way possible: They are the native title holders of the land, well they are the traditional owners, I understand that, native title holders, because I was born here, this is my land as much as any Aboriginal, they are the true traditional owners and they like to be acknowledged as that, so, if you are truly Aboriginal. But I don’t see why they shouldn’t have to get a passport, because a lot of people now, how much Indigenous blood do they have, so I think this should be, everybody should be treated equally, in this land, whether you are Aboriginal or a migrant, if you require a passport, everyone must apply for a passport. Labor’s Mark Butler has issued a statement on Zali Steggall’s and the crossbench climate action bill. He says Labor wants to look at it and work on it with Steggall, but for it to go anywhere the government has to bring it on for debate (which it has a history of not doing): Labor welcomes any constructive effort to progress climate action and looks forward to continuing to engage with Zali Steggall about her climate change bill. For Zali Steggall’s bill to be considered, Scott Morrison would need to allow a full debate in the parliament. When Labor moved a motion to declare a climate emergency last October, Scott Morrison wouldn’t allow the question to be debated at all. Scott Morrison and his divided government have never taken action on climate change seriously. The latest official government emissions data confirms Australia will not meet our Kyoto commitment to cut emissions by 5% by 2020. In fact, emissions reduction will amount to little more than a rounding error of 0.3%, putting the lie to the prime minister’s claim that we are meeting and beating our international commitments. The government’s own data suggests emissions will come down during the next 10 years by only less than 5%. At that rate, it will take Australia 230 years to reach net zero emissions, rather than the 30 years scientists tell us is necessary. No major explosions in today’s Coalition party room meeting, but there were rumblings about constitutional recognition. The Liberal senator James McGrath sought assurances that the party room and the appropriate backbench committees would be consulted before the government reached a final landing on the recognition of Indigenous people. (This is a not very subtle code that a number of MPs are unhappy with the way Ken Wyatt, the responsible minister, is handling this particular issue.) I gather two other senators voiced objections: Amanda Stoker and Dean Smith. According to colleagues, Stoker expressed opposition to recognition per se. Smith was concerned that the debate was distracting from practical issues. Scott Morrison assured MPs they would be consulted, and he indicated he wanted the process to be like the one Christian Porter has pursued in relation to religious freedom. Wyatt spoke and indicated that recent comments he had made about the timetable for a referendum had been misrepresented in the media. Government MPs tell me there would have been more dissent on the recognition issue today but the word had gone out to keep it nice in today’s party room. Which I gather it largely was. People tell me Matt Canavan also made a plea that MPs allow the feasibility study for a new coal-fired power plant at Collinsville to run its course, but the intervention didn’t generate any responses. That fight is playing out in public. Possibly there was no appetite to bring it into closer quarters. Christian Porter, after admitting the government missed its own deadline on putting forward its own legislation, has said the government will release its own (some argue less effective) federal integrity body, when its ready. But don’t expect that any time soon. Adam Bandt lost 72 to 70 to have the issue dealt with now, so the House is voting on Darren Chester’s motion that it be dealt with in the next sitting. Based on those numbers, that is what will happen. Darren Chester is asking the House to move this to the next sitting. Adam Bandt wants it dealt with now. The chamber divides. Shorter Coalition party room meeting message from Josh Frydenberg: I wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school ... I wish I could bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat and be happy ... No one was actually saying this, but it never hurts to learn more about parliamentary practices Meanwhile, in the joint party room, it is situation normal: people getting upset about coal, while others got upset that people were upset about coal. The government is doing its best to try to quell the latest climate squabble, but the breakout group doesn’t want to calm down. And its members are feeling a bit bolshie. So good times keep on keeping on. Anthony Albanese has addressed caucus this morning, talking about the Coalition’s internal tensions after yesterday’s Nationals’ boilover. “If you look like you are more concerned about yourself than the country then the country will punish you,” Albanese said. “Our team is united, coherent and determined. They are a mess. If you can’t govern yourself, you can’t govern the country.” He criticised Morrison’s response to the parliamentary defeat, accusing the prime minister of trying to spin the tactical defeat that saw renegade MP Llew O’Brien elevated to the role of deputy speaker against the will of the government. “When you have been defeated like that you take it on the chin and move on. To try to spin it as a win says everything about Scott Morrison. It was all about spin and marketing, not a plan. “Scott Morrison has no plan for wages growth, no plan for productivity, no plan for aged care, no plan for education outcomes that are falling, no plan for broadband, no plan for climate change and no plan for energy.” On climate change policy, Albanese said the “test” for the government was whether it allowed the Collinsville coal-fired power station to go ahead with government assistance. “The last new coal-fired power station came into operation in 2007. The test for the government when they talk about building Collinsville is whether it is going ahead. The proponents say it can only go ahead with a massive indemnity against climate risk,” he said. As for Labor’s climate policy, Albanese said the party did not need “to fit the timetable of the government or of commentators”, saying he would be focused on the election cycle. ”Our plan will need to focus on jobs, lower emissions and cheaper prices,” he said. It’s been confirmed – Scott Morrison has not yet issued an invitation to Wills and Kate, but he will. So expect the royal tour soon. The bells are ringing. What will today bring? Who knows. That’s the 2020 parliament for you. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age are reporting Scott Morrison is about to issue an invitation to the duke and duchess of Cambridge to visit Australia so they can tour bushfire regions. From Bevan Shields’s report: “Prince William and his wife Catherine are set to visit bushfire-ravaged Australian coastal towns during a special royal visit that will spur more international financial support for survivors and volunteer firefighters. “Preliminary negotiations between the Morrison government and Kensington Palace – the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s official household – have been under way for weeks and Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected this week to issue the formal invitation needed to give the tour the go ahead.” Back on the Labor staffer meeting: while the rumour Sharon McCrohan would be brought back is floating around, I am being told there is “zero chance” she’ll be returning to the show. So make of that what you will. Parliament will start at midday, for those wondering why it is so quiet. Daniel Love’s lawyer is speaking outside the high court on the decision Indigenous Australians cannot be deported, regardless of where they were born: Maurice Blackburn Lawyers’ senior associate Claire Gibbs: This is relevant, particularly to Aboriginal Australians, regardless of where they’re born. We know it’s a relatively small but vulnerable category of Australians, so yes, you know, it’s potentially relevant to others and it’s important. Today marks a day where we have permanent protection for Aboriginal Australians from deportation so it’s very important. I haven’t had the opportunity to talk to Daniel or his family this morning following the decision, but I can tell you during the course of these claims, it has, as I mentioned before, had a lot of mental health impact on him. This decision will come as an incredible relief, not just to him, but to his family, who are Aboriginal. They will all have protection from deportation as a result of this decision. The party room meetings are breaking up. We’ll soon have updates on went on there. Mike Bowers was out the front of parliament this morning where bushfire survivors are holding a protest, asking politicians to cut ties with the coal lobby. They brought debris from what was left of their homes. Pacific Islanders were also protesting, highlighting the dangers their homelands face from a warming planet. Just back on Paul’s post for a moment, you can read the whole summary of that court decision here. While the MPs are meeting, so are their staff. In the opposition staff meeting, a former Victorian premier, Steve Bracks, has been brought in to give “a morale-boosting speech” to the troops. There are also rumours that Labor wants to bring back Sharon McCrohan, who was Bracks’ comms chief and who also came in late during Bill Shorten’s campaign. Bracks has told the staff that to win government from opposition, ‘You have to let people know where you stand.’ That has raised a few eyebrows, because so far, under Anthony Albanese’s leadership, ministers and MPs have been told to keep their positions fairly close to their chest. Albanese wants the focus on the government, not the opposition, after the release of Labor’s policies early in the last term put the spotlight on what Labor would do, rather than what the government was doing. But with a new year, shadow ministers are starting to get itchy to announce policy positions – something I understand won’t be happening for a little while longer. Bracks has also told the group to keep reminding people Albanese is “genuine”. Looks like those focus groups are getting interesting. The high court has decided that Aboriginal Australians are not aliens for the purpose of the constitution, a major defeat for the deportation powers of Peter Dutton’s home affairs department and a significant development in the rights of Indigenous Australians. In four-to-three split decision the high court ruled on Tuesday that Aboriginals cannot be aliens, giving them a special status in Australian constitutional law likely to have ramifications far beyond existing native title law. The majority of the high court ruled that Brendan Thoms was not an alien and the commonwealth therefore did not have power to order his deportation. The court was not able to decide if the second plaintiff, Daniel Love, is Aboriginal Australian, requiring a further hearing to establish the facts. The plaintiffs were born in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, each with one Aboriginal parent, and face deportation due to laws which allow the cancellation of visas on character grounds. Lawyers for the two Indigenous men, backed up by the state of Victoria, argued the Australian government cannot deport Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders even though they do not hold Australian citizenship because the constitutional definition of “alien” can’t be set by the government of the day through citizenship law. Paul Karp is in the high court where a pretty major decision has been handed down about whether or not Indigenous Australians can be considered ‘aliens’ and deported, if they were not born in Australia. The federal government is attempting to deport Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms, who were born abroad, following criminal convictions. Both men identify as Indigenous, and their case went to the high court, to determine whether they could be considered ‘aliens’ under immigration law. Matt Canavan, who has been in front of more cameras this morning than I have taken Panadol, told Laura Jayes on Sky this morning that he will be concentrating on defending the poor, besmirched resources industry now that he is on the backbench and has more time to be Matt Canavan. Having made the mining industry sound like a Dickensian orphan, Jayes asks Canavan who exactly is attacking the industry: Well, look, it’s mainly, it’s these well-financed environmental organisations – there is this creeping environmentalism coming over our society, and we all want to balance the environment, but some of the restrictions and regulations placed on people on the land, who actually live in the environment, make no sense, and that’s what needs to be pulled back on.” Because apparently people who care about the environment do not live in the environment, or something. (Side note: creeping environmentalism sounds like something a Dickens character would say, so I am glad he is remaining on theme at least.) Canavan continued, all but declaring himself to be the Batman to the “‘creeping environmentalism” poison ivy: Now, could the government be doing more on this? Absolutely we could.” (Like the Coalition hasn’t been in power since 2013 and he hasn’t been a minister in that government for a very big chunk of that time, with the power to do something about those very things.) That’s what I’ll be pushing for. But I expect many, many at this stage, to be disagreeing with government policy. All of these things are more about direction and, and, and speed. And so that’s what I hope to do, is try and speed those things up.” From the backbench. In terms of what well, we’ve got a review of the federal environmental law, the EPBC act, this year. I hope we take forward significant reform because that act is not working for people who want to grow and develop this country, in particular Indigenous Australians in Cape York who want to have a sort of similar economic base that we enjoy in other parts of the country; they are locked up in ribbons of green tape at the moment that stops them from developing their own land. You know, 25 years ago we gave Indigenous Australians land rights back. We gave them native title back and we spent the next 25 years slowly taking it away from them again, and just giving it to bureaucrats in departments of environments around the country. On ABC RN with Fran Kelly this morning, Anthony Albanese continued cleaning up Labor’s position on coal after his deputy squibbed it on Insiders on Sunday: Q: Should the government be funding a feasibility study for new coal-fired power stations? Albanese: No. Exclamation mark. This is quite outrageous. Here we have, essentially, the government pretending that the world isn’t changing. What we need is a transition to a clean energy economy. And the truth is that no private sector operation will touch a new coal-fired power plant with a barge pole. It can’t get the proper insurance, they can’t get financing. And that’s because renewables are cheaper. And the risk factor with regard to investing in a new coal-fired power plant means that it simply doesn’t stack up. And what we have with this $4m is essentially you can add it to the sports rorts and add it to the other areas whereby the $150m program for women’s sports that didn’t actually fund women’s sport, as $4m just for political purposes. This is hush money. Hush money for the climate change deniers in the Coalition. I mean, Matt Canavan yesterday made the most extraordinary comment about renewables as the dole bludgers of the system. The fact is that the cheapest new energy sources in Australia today are solar and wind. Q: So, let me put this to you because you don’t support the feasibility study money, but your deputy, Richard Marles, struggled on Sunday to answer whether Labor would support new coal-fired power generators if they were funded by industry. You have just said what we need is a transition to a clean energy economy. If it stacked up, if industry was prepared to back it, would a Labor government support it, allow it? Albanese: You may as well ask me, Fran, if I support unicorns. Q: This is important. Because do you have a position on this? Albanese: Fran, we have a position which is that it does not stack up. It will not proceed. It doesn’t stack up. No private sector operator, Fran, right now, there is nothing to stop a private sector operator establishing a coal-fired power station. Q; I understand. But why can’t you say that a Labor government would not allow any new coal-fired power stations to be built? Why can’t you say that? Albanese: Well, because it’s not happening, Fran. It won’t happen. We do know that, Fran, we do know that because it’s reality. It’s like saying, “Do you know if the sun will come up this morning.” Liberal senator James Paterson had a chat to Sky News this morning about the Nationals. Here is what he had to say about some of his colleagues: I think we’re all responsible for our own behaviour in politics. There’s a lot of disappointments in politics. Everybody has ambition. It’s not always realised or at least not realised in the timeline that you might want it to. But that doesn’t give you licence to misbehave and act out. And it’s certainly not an excuse to say that you [or] your friends were passed over for promotion. Last night a motion put forward by Larissa Waters – that the House of Representatives bring about a vote on the Greens national integrity commission bill – passed the Senate: (1) That the Senate notes that: (a) the Senate passed the Australian Greens’ national integrity commission bill 2018 (No 2) on 9 September 2019 to establish a federal corruption watchdog with broad remit to investigate allegations of corruption and misconduct, and to ensure strong, independent oversight of the actions of parliamentarians; and (b) public consultation on the commonwealth integrity commission model proposed by the government ended more than one year ago, but the government has yet to introduce legislation to establish an integrity commission. (2) That the Senate calls on the federal government to bring on the Australian Greens’ national integrity commission bill 2019 in the House of Representatives for a vote in the February 2020 sittings. (3) That this resolution be sent to the House of Representatives for concurrence. That should hit the House around midday. And it’s the first opportunity Llew O’Brien will have to cross the floor. One of his big bugbears has been the government’s proposed national integrity commission not being strong enough. Let the games begin. This happened late yesterday, but is worth repeating: The barrister and former inspector general of intelligence and security, Bret Walker, gave some very interesting evidence at the Senate inquiry into press freedom last night. Walker called for a root and branch reform of disclosure laws, including a general reversal of the presumption against disclosure of governmental matters and a loosening of freedom of information laws. He argued that because government is not done for profit and it has no commercial rivals, it is absurd to apply the same levels of secrecy in government as occurs in the commercial world. The obvious exception is national security. But Walker criticised the government for an overly expansive definition that encompasses relations with foreign governments and harm to the economy. “We’re not a free and confident people if we can’ t have a vociferous debate, for example, about Australia’s dealings with a notoriously tyrannical regime,” he said. “[At present] national security catches too much.” Walker proposed: Dedicated units within government departments and agencies to ensure serious consideration of whistleblower complaints. A positive duty of public servants to protect whistleblowers who go through the correct internal channels, rather than just a duty not to do them harm. Citizens and bloggers should receive the same sorts of protection for publishing governmental information as journalists – provided they do the right thing by checking with agencies what information is genuinely secret before doing so. On why bloggers deserve protection, he said: “I don’t care if it’s the first or only time they publish ... they should have the same protection [as journalists]. The idea that people’s right to know should be filtered first by government and then an intermediary class of journalist I find really offensive ... I’ll be damned if I’m going to give a monopoly to [officially approved] journalists. I don’t want the government to be giving badges to people, here are our licensed critics – that’s nonsense.” But Walker also had harsh words for public servants who are paid to keep genuinely classified material confidential and nevertheless leak, suggesting this amounted to “disreputable disloyalty” and warning “if you take your money for the promise of confidentiality, you should follow [that promise]”. Anthony Albanese also tried to clean up Richard Marles’s trainwreck of an interview on Insiders on Sunday by laying out Labor’s position on coal, by discussing the problems with the Collinsville coal-fired power station $4m feasibility study. Well the truth is that we have a market-based economy. And what we see is that they’re not just climate sceptics, they are market sceptics. And what we see with this $4m subsidy is taxpayers’ right throughout Australia, including in regional Australia, paying for something. $4m is a lot of money for a feasibility study. I’ve been the infrastructure minister. That is an extraordinary amount of money. That is $4m of hush money for the climate change deniers in the Coalition. Anthony Albanese stopped by the media pack outside the doors this morning to lay out his theme of the day. Spoiler: it’s about the Nationals. Well we have seen this movie of what happens when a party is divided. When a government’s divided. We know how it ends. It ends badly for the government. And this government are incapable of putting themselves together. This is a government that has had three prime ministers. That’s had three deputy prime ministers. Has had countless number of defence ministers, countless number of ministers in so many portfolios. I give Scott Morrison credit when he was taking President Widodo around his frontbench. He at least remembered all of their names which is a real challenge. It’s a challenge for us to look across the other side and work out who’s on the frontbench. It’s Tuesday, which means it is party room day, and boy oh boy I would love to be a fly on the Akubra I assume hangs on the wall of the Nationals’ party room. After Labor humiliated the government on Monday by nominating rebel LNP MP Llew O’Brien for the deputy Speaker role over Michael McCormack’s pick of Damian Drum – and won, with the help of at least five rogue government MPs (Ken O’Dowd, Barnaby Joyce and O’Brien himself, with the other two not confirmed, but very, very easy to guess) – McCormack and Scott Morrison are struggling to pretend everything is just bibbity boppity boo in the junior Coalition partner. O’Brien remains in the government but will sit as an LNP MP, not a National. He wants the Queenslanders to sit as LNP MPs across the board. The Greatest Nation on Earth formally married the Coalition partners under Lawrence Springborg’s direction a few years ago, and every now and then one of them gets shirty at either the Liberal party or National party federally and starts making noises about a separate party room. Nothing ever comes of it, but that doesn’t mean they stop. So O’Brien won’t be in the party room today when the Nationals work out what the hell happened over the past 24 hours. O’Dowd, who admitted on national TV he not only voted for O’Brien against the party’s wishes, he was also going to run himself, may have some explaining to do, but his job as deputy Nationals whip – the guy who runs around making sure the Nats keep toeing the party line – is allegedly safe: A ballot in the House of Representatives is a free and fair vote. Mr O’Dowd is entitled to his democratic right as a member of parliament. This was not a vote on government legislation or a matter of supply for the Australian government and both candidates in the ballot are members of the government,” a spokeswoman for McCormack said. McCormack tried to shrug it all off as “that’s democracy”. But Drum, who missed out on the $42,000 pay rise, extra staffer and the prestige of overseeing the federation chamber (where speeches go to die) may actually crack his teeth if he keeps gritting them so hard through his fake smile. Well, I just didn’t think ... anyway, I was pretty surprised,” he told reporters as he got in his comcar overnight. We’ll cover all of that and more as the sitting week rolls on. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin along for the ride. I am going to hunt down my second coffee, so that’s a win. Ready? Let’s get in to it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jul/17/brexit-wont-help-britain-survive-the-rise-of-the-robots","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-17T15:14:14Z","webTitle":"Brexit won’t help Britain survive the rise of the robots | Paul Mason","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/17/brexit-wont-help-britain-survive-the-rise-of-the-robots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/17/brexit-wont-help-britain-survive-the-rise-of-the-robots","fields":{"headline":"Brexit won’t help Britain survive the rise of the robots","bodyText":"What do a Japanese robot and the world’s first tidal turbine have in common? They are not in Britain. While the British government destroys itself over Brexit, the parts for a third industrial revolution are being assembled elsewhere. This is an industrial revolution where you don’t “catch up” – you catch the economic backwash. This is what would keep ministers awake at night – if they were serious. In the past 12 months, Japan has started to produce a lot of robots. Its production index for industrial robots stood at 25 in 2009, achieved 175 last year and rocketed to 225 in June this year. Three-quarters of the units made were exported, helping Japan boost its total exports by 11% in the past year. In turn, the industrial surge of robots has stimulated a surge in semiconductor production in Japan and South Korea. This is big and real. Japan is ahead in robotics not only because it has a decades-old semiconductor industry and an ageing population, but because it has an industrial strategy. Its government demanded a new industrial revolution in 2014. In 2015, its Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry issued a “New Robot Strategy”, stipulating sales targets for robotics in various sectors and urgent measures to train and retain technologists. In robots for nursing care, for example, the strategy spells out a detailed five-year plan – from supporting manufacturers and changing International Organization for Standardization regulations to new health regulations and the creation of a marketplace between healthcare providers and robotics firms. The policy was not made in a vacuum. Japan’s industrial strategists were worried about big US spending commitments on robot research and development and a €2.8bn (£2.5bn) robotics project, funded by the European commission, called Sparc. One country they do not worry about is Britain. While the UK government announced in April that it will throw £93m at robotics and artificial intelligence over four years, Britain’s membership of Sparc is in question because of Brexit. In future, we will most likely compete against Sparc. In order to “take back control” of our borders, we have told the world’s robotics experts to get lost. While Japan designs and implements a robotics strategy, we do not even have a basic industrial strategy: a green paper produced by our weediest ministry, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, is out for consultation. This lack of strategy is killing opportunities for the UK to turn innovations into industries. Take the proposed tidal lagoon in Swansea. It could be built in six years, generate power for 155,000 homes and establish Britain as a world centre for the technology at the core of the project: 16 massive turbines, to be assembled at General Electric’s factory in Stafford, with most of the components made in Britain. The lagoon project has been designed not only as an energy solution – it also contains a miniature industrial strategy. With a potential market of 940 turbines in the UK alone, the project’s backers have put together plans to make Wales the world-leading venue for training, education and design for this kind of water power. Predictably, the UK government is still sitting on the idea – despite the fact that its own experts gave it the green light in January. One factor is Britain’s ludicrous commitment to having an energy system subsidised via high consumer prices and its bias in favour of nuclear power stations. A more strategic factor is, again, our absence of industrial or economic strategies. The tragedy is that industrial strategy problem is solvable – but only if you have three things. First, strategic certainty: what does the country want to be in the world; what industries does it favour? Second, a powerful economics ministry and a government investment bank. Third, private money looking for long-term projects backed by a government guarantee. Brexit and internal warfare in the Conservative party have combined to make these conditions impossible. You cannot have an industrial strategy if you do not know your future trading relationship with the rest of the world. Anything the Conservatives produce in advance of a concrete trade agreement with the EU should be filed under fantasy. You cannot have a powerful economics ministry if all the energy in government is being sapped by infighting and cack-handed negotiations. Long-term money is there, in the City, which is ready to invest in the third industrial revolution. However, it looks with dismay at the situation in the UK, while enthusing about Emmanuel Macron’s promise of a hi-tech, globally oriented France. In the event of a Conservative collapse, delay, confusion and years of laissez-faire would deal a poor hand to an incoming Labour government. Labour wowed the electorate with its tax-and-spend policy, while leaving the City cold. Now it needs to wow potential investors. To do this, it has to turn its aspirations for Japan-style industrial policy and state-directed investment into a shovel-ready proposal. There are numerous bright points of innovation from which to start. The tearooms of all sorts of royal institutions and societies are teeming with technologists who know how to execute big projects. University-level innovation is booming. But what global businesses need is an environment predictable over 30 years, not unpredictable over three. If Labour – or a coalition of opposition parties – comes to power, it is important that its proposed economic strategy is not only coherent, but also certain. At this stage, it cannot be about reversing Brexit on principle. It must simply guarantee that Brexit creates a positive, predictable environment for the third industrial revolution in Britain or does not go ahead. In the weeks since Theresa May lost her majority, the theme of capital flight from Britain has come to the fore. JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon’s threat to take many of the bank’s 16,000 jobs to Europe if the deal is not right was merely a straw in the wind. The long-term danger is much worse. The third industrial revolution will replace human beings with machines on an unimagined scale. This will create a long, global deflation. But the pain of this deflation will not be distributed evenly. The worst place to live will be a country with low wages, low skills and a trade deficit, because these will act as magnets for economic pain. Once you understand this, it is clear that we need a Labour government. Corporations and banks should be falling over themselves to help equip Labour with the design and execution skills it will need to make industrial strategy work. If the UK’s business establishment cannot stage a 1922-style coup inside the Conservative party to reinstall its globalist, liberal wing this autumn, the most sensible thing would be to place its chips on red."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/mar/28/uk-nuclear-westinghouse-bankruptcy-toshiba-us","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-28T18:47:55Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear plans could be hit by Westinghouse financial crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/28/uk-nuclear-westinghouse-bankruptcy-toshiba-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/mar/28/uk-nuclear-westinghouse-bankruptcy-toshiba-us","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear plans could be hit by Westinghouse financial crisis","bodyText":"A financial crisis at a major nuclear energy business is threatening to deal a blow to the UK’s atomic energy programme. Toshiba’s US nuclear subsidiary Westinghouse Electric is believed to be on the brink of filing in the US for bankruptcy protection from creditors. A UK expert said the collapse would leave a considerable hole in Britain’s new nuclear ambitions as Toshiba is a key player behind plans for a new power station at Moorside in Cumbria. Westinghouse is a behemoth in the world of nuclear vendors, with its technology in about half the world’s reactors. But it is facing a writedown of billions of dollars over its acquisition of a nuclear construction and services business. In 2015 Toshiba bought CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster, the company managing the construction of new reactors Plant Vogtle in Georgia and Virgil C Summer in South Carolina, both of which are over budget and behind schedule. Westinghouse filing for Chapter 11 protection would potentially limit future losses for its owner Toshiba. The move will also trigger complex negotiations between the Japanese conglomerate, its American unit and creditors, and could embroil the US and Japanese governments, given the scale of the collapse and US government loan guarantees for new reactors. The US utilities that operate the two nuclear plants are among Westinghouse’s biggest creditors, owed for work that has yet to be completed and potential penalties, sources have said. The bankruptcy filing will allow Westinghouse to renegotiate or break the construction contracts, although the utilities that own the projects would likely seek damages. Credit rating agency Moody’s said it welcomed the prospect of bankruptcy because it could limit Toshiba’s liabilities. Anti-nuclear campaigners said the episode showed the world should build renewable energy rather than new nuclear. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “The world is watching the meltdown of a major corporation and questioning the cost of new nuclear. Declaring bankruptcy in the USA might shield Toshiba from Westinghouse’s debt, but as Toshiba’s share price ricochets and its multibillion-dollar losses escalate, the beleaguered nuclear industry is being shaken to the core again.” Dr Paul Dorfman, a nuclear expert at UCL in London, told the Guardian: “Toshiba has fallen on its sword and this has significant consequences for the UK’s plans for new nuclear. Kepco of South Korea may come and buy into NuGen [the consortium behind the UK’s Moorside plant]. But you can’t necessarily sell off the bad bits of a nuclear corporation and keep the good bits.” Kecpo last week ruled out buying Westinghouse but said it was in talks to take a stake in NuGen. However, Dorfman said: “While Kepco may wish to buy into NuGen they may find it both legally and financially problematic.” He added that any unravelling of Nugen as a result of Westinghouse filing for bankruptcy would “leave a considerable hole in UK nuclear plans”. The AP1000 reactor design of the two US plants is the same as the three planned for the Moorside power station. Within days the UK nuclear regulator is expected to approve a “generic design assessment” for the AP1000, the end of a four-year approval process. This year Toshiba has twice delayed publishing its financial results for the third quarter of 2016, which will reveal the scale of the impairment it faces with regards to CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster. In January, chief executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said that while Toshiba would continue to maintain and operate its existing nuclear plants: “It is unlikely that we will carry out construction work for future nuclear power plant projects, in order to eliminate risk.” But NuGen has said that while Toshiba may not build Moorside, the Japanese corporation was still committed to developing the Moorside power station. The possibility of a Westinghouse bankruptcy also raises questions over its impact on the Springfields nuclear fuel plant in Lancashire. The company owns the site on a 150-year lease from the UK government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. In the US, the reactors that Westinghouse is building are due to be completed within the next three years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jul/02/russia-begins-cleaning-up-the-soviets-top-secret-nuclear-waste-dump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-02T09:00:24Z","webTitle":"Russia begins cleaning up the Soviets' top-secret nuclear waste dump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/02/russia-begins-cleaning-up-the-soviets-top-secret-nuclear-waste-dump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jul/02/russia-begins-cleaning-up-the-soviets-top-secret-nuclear-waste-dump","fields":{"headline":"Russia begins cleaning up the Soviets' top-secret nuclear waste dump","bodyText":"As the Rossita pulled away from the pier at Andreyeva Bay, sounding a long boom of its horn, a military band struck up a jaunty march. On board the ship were nine sealed metal casks, each four metres high and weighing 45 tonnes, containing canisters of spent nuclear fuel. Dozens of Russian and foreign nuclear specialists looked on applauding, as the chilly rain of a northern summer fell on the bay deep inside the Russian Arctic. The ceremony, held on Tuesday afternoon, marks the culmination of a long international project to begin removing nuclear fuel from the site, formerly a top-secret Soviet installation. Nuclear specialists say Andreyeva Bay contains the largest reserves of spent nuclear fuel in the world, in fragile conditions that have disturbed the international community for years. During the Cold War period, nuclear submarines were refuelled at sea, and the spent nuclear fuel was then shipped to Andreyeva Bay, where it was placed in a special storage facility to cool off before being transported to a reprocessing plant at Mayak, in the Urals. But in the early 1980s, leaks sprung up in the storage system, causing high levels of radioactive contamination. When the Soviet Union collapsed, transfers of the spent fuel ceased, and about 22,000 spent nuclear fuel caskets were left at Andreyeva Bay in leaky dry storage units, creating the potential for an environmental catastrophe. “I’ve been all over the world to pretty much every country that uses nuclear power and I’ve never seen anything so awful before,” said Alexander Nikitin, a former naval officer and environmentalist who has been monitoring the site for years. “With nuclear material, everything should be done very carefully, and here they just took the material and threw it into an even more dangerous situation.” In the decade after the Soviet collapse, the main concern was that poorly maintained facilities could lead to an onsite disaster. Nearly 250 nuclear submarines were decommissioned in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse, and facilities such as Andreyeva Bay were left in a perilous state. “There wouldn’t have been a big explosion, but it could still have been something serious,” said Nikitin. “With nuclear fuel, once processes start, you have no way of knowing how they will develop.” Over the next decade, security fears also increased. “Before 9/11, nobody would really think anyone would be crazy enough to try to handle spent nuclear fuel, but with the new type of terrorist threat we face, this became a bigger worry,” said Balthasar Lindauer of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which has managed the donor funds from western countries to help with the clean-up. The facility at Andreyeva Bay was one of many top-secret installations in the Soviet Arctic. A two-hour drive from the regional centre of Murmansk along a road cut out of mossy rocks, still dusted with snow in late June, the entire area around Andreyeva Bay is closed to all foreigners and even Russians who are not registered there. A heavily armed military checkpoint on the outskirts of town keeps out all those who do not have security clearance . This is partly because Russia has a working nuclear submarine base on the other side of the bay at Zaozyorsk. It might seem odd that, as Russia ploughs more money into its current military budget, western nations who see Moscow as a military threat are helping to fund the clean-up of the mess the Soviet military left behind. 13 countries have provided €165m in funding since 2003 for nuclear decommissioning in Russia’s north-west. There have also been a number of bilateral projects, with Britain, Norway and other countries funding a long project to help clean up Andreyeva Bay. The Norwegian foreign minister, who was present at Tuesday’s ceremony, said the funding for the project was committed nearly two decades ago, when Russia was in no economic state to deal with the problems alone. He also pointed out that the Andreyeva Bay facility is only about 40 miles from the Norwegian border, making the decommissioning issue one in which Norway has long taken a strong interest. “Nuclear challenges recognise no borders, and it is in our common interest to deal with nuclear waste now rather leaving the problems to future generations,” said the Norwegian foreign minister, Børge Brende. A suite of new buildings has been constructed around the area where the spent nuclear fuel caskets are kept, replacing the decaying structures that stood there previously. Work to load canisters into the giant protective casks can now be done using specially commissioned machinery. The Rossita, a ship constructed for the task, will take the huge fuel casks to Murmansk, where they will be put on fortified trains which will proceed under armed guard on the long journey from the Arctic to the Mayak reprocessing site. At the Mayak facility, the spent fuel will be recycled and the Russians say they will turn it into fuel to be used in civilian nuclear reactors. Specialists at the plant estimate it could take 10 years to remove all the fuel. About half of the caskets have some kind of surface damage to their containers and will be dealt with after the non-problematic batches have been removed. “This is the end of a long process, but also the beginning of another long stage in the clean-up,” said Marina Kovtun, the governor of Murmansk region. “Despite international tensions, work went on every day. Everyone who was working on this project understood that they were doing this for all of humanity and for protecting our environment.” Indeed, in the current climate of hostility between Russia and the west, it was an unusual tale of bonhomie and cooperation, as the ceremony included the flags of 10 western nations as well as the Russian tricolour. “The Barents Sea is maybe the cleanest sea in the world, and if something had happened here, it would have affected the whole Arctic,” said Brende. “This process is not completely without risk, but compared to doing nothing, the risks are now much lower.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/29/uk-government-could-approve-hinkley-point-delay-essex-project-bradwell-china","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-29T12:29:30Z","webTitle":"UK government could approve Hinkley Point but delay Essex project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/29/uk-government-could-approve-hinkley-point-delay-essex-project-bradwell-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/29/uk-government-could-approve-hinkley-point-delay-essex-project-bradwell-china","fields":{"headline":"UK government could approve Hinkley Point but delay Essex project","bodyText":"The government is considering a proposal to detach development of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant from an agreement allowing China to build a reactor in Essex. The plan is one of the options under consideration after Theresa May delayed approving the £18bn Hinkley Point project last month, according to a report in the Times (£). The prime minister is concerned about China’s involvement in the project to build Britain’s first nuclear power plant for a generation in Somerset and a further agreement for China to build reactors in Bradwell, Essex, and Sizewell, Suffolk. The government enlisted China last September to fund a third of Hinkley Point in a deal meant to ease financial pressure on EDF, the French builder of the plant, and forge closer links with China. But May, who raised objections to the deal when she was home secretary, called a surprise review soon after becoming prime minister. An option under consideration in Whitehall is to approve Hinkley Point but delay a decision on the Bradwell reactor to allow a discussion about its effect on British security, the Times said. Any attempt to split Hinkley Point from the agreement to let China build reactors in Britain would endanger the whole deal because the Bradwell plant was meant to be a showcase for China’s nuclear technology in Europe. Tension over Hinkley Point means May risks an awkward first G20 meeting of world leaders as prime minister. The meeting, on 4 and 5 September, takes place in the Hangzhou, China, and will be hosted by Xi Jinping, China’s president, who signed the Hinkley Point agreement last year. EDF, the French state-owned energy group, approved the building of Hinkley Point in July after months of doubts about whether it was financially strong enough to take on the giant project. On Sunday, Vincent de Rivaz, EDF’s UK chief executive, called on the UK to set aside concerns about Chinese involvement in the project. “We know and trust our Chinese partners,” he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. De Rivaz said there were “enormous benefits for the UK” from the involvement of China, which has the largest civil nuclear programme in the world. China has made clear its frustration over May’s decision to delay a decision on Hinkley Point. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, wrote that relations with Britain were at a “crucial historical juncture”. May then wrote to Xi and China’s premier, Li Keqiang, promising closer business and trade ties between Britain and the world’s second-biggest economy. May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year raised concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were investing in sensitive infrastructure. Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website: “Rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jul/13/macron-prepares-tourist-treat-charm-offensive-for-trumps-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-13T04:37:50Z","webTitle":"Macron to woo Trumps in Paris with military pomp and tourism treats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/13/macron-prepares-tourist-treat-charm-offensive-for-trumps-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jul/13/macron-prepares-tourist-treat-charm-offensive-for-trumps-paris","fields":{"headline":"Macron to woo Trumps in Paris with military pomp and tourism treats","bodyText":"The US president, Donald Trump, has arrived in Paris and is due to be greeted with a show of military pomp by the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, who has chosen to move from his aggressive first handshake and to style himself as Trump’s new “straight-talking” best friend on the international stage. Trump, under pressure over his son’s meeting with a Russian lawyer during the US election campaign, is on a 24-hour visit to the French capital, where Macron will woo him by escorting him to Napoleon’s tomb, taking him to dinner at the Eiffel Tower, then watching the Bastille Day military parade on the Champs Elysées. The centrist president’s invitation to Trump might at first seem surprising, after he publicly asserted his superiority by crunching Trump’s knuckles at their first meeting in May and later rebuked him for pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord. But the invitation is part of a determined strategy by Macron, who – observing the US president’s increasing isolation on the western stage – has sensed an opportunity. Christophe Castaner, a government minister and spokesman, described it as a kind of persuasive bridge-building with Trump. “Sometimes Trump makes decisions we don’t like, such as on climate. But we can deal with it in two ways: we can say ‘We are not going to talk to you,’ or we can offer you our hand to bring you back into the circle,” he said. The invitation for a US leader to attend this year’s Bastille day military parade had been in the pipeline long before either Trump or Macron were elected, because 2017 marks the 100th anniversary of the entry of the United States into the first world war. Inviting foreign leaders to Bastille Day celebrations is common in France – Nicolas Sarkozy even made Syria’s Bashar al-Assad a guest of honour in 2008. But it was not certain Trump would accept when Macron personally re-issued the invitation in a phone call last month. The Elysée has added what one official called a personal “post-card” tourism touch: instead of dining at the Elysée Palace, Macron and his wife, Brigitte, will invite the Trumps to eat a meal cooked by the chef Alain Ducasse in a restaurant at the top of the Eiffel Tower. It is a deliberate attempt to show the French capital was still “welcoming” after Trump told a rally that “Paris is no longer Paris” following a string of terrorist attacks. The Trump organisation has no financial interests in France and it is unclear how well the US president knows the country. He said last year that the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks would have been very different if French citizens were allowed to carry guns. On Thursday afternoon Macron and Trump will hold more than an hour of talks at the Elysée Palace focused mainly on counter-terrorism, Syria, Iraq and French anti-jihadi military operations in north Africa. “Where we have differences, we talk about them very clearly – such as on climate – but there are issues like counter-terrorism where we are on the same line and need close cooperation and common action,” an Elysée official said. French diplomats said Macron had been concerned about Trump feeling backed into a corner. The French leader has seen a potential opportunity to sway US thinking and elevate the role of France – a nuclear power and permanent member of the UN security council – in global affairs, in particular on Syria and the Middle East. France is the second-biggest contributor to the US-led coalition in Syria and French officials had expressed concerns about what vision the US had in Syria beyond taking the military fight to Islamic State. The two leaders are starkly different. Trump, 71, is an anti-globalist elected on a pledge to put America first. Macron, 39, believes in a kind of cosmopolitan globalism and is an ardent pro-European. Yet they share some traits – both were outsiders who challenged their country’s political status quo. Trump loves a winner and although he deemed Macron’s far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, the “strongest” candidate in May’s French presidential election, he has praised Macron’s solid election score. The military pomp of the Trump visit reflects Macron’s new style of showmanship diplomacy seen when he invited Russia’s Vladimir Putin to the palace of Versailles. It is aimed at highlighting French prestige and grandeur and as much for his domestic audience as foreign leaders. Macron’s defiant, alpha-male handshake with Trump when they first met in Brussels in May played well at home in France. “He had to show the French domestic audience he knew how to say no to America,” said Philippe Roger, author of the American Enemy, a history of French anti-Americanism, adding that for Macron to be seen to be too pro-US would be the “kiss of death” in French politics. But he said Macron was now showing it was time to talk to Trump. “I think Macron understands very well that with Mr Trump you have to be present – see him and talk to him face to face … Ambassadors don’t exist for Trump … The only thing is to be in the same room and to talk.” Laurence Nardon, head of the US programme the French institute of international relations (IFRI) said: “Macron’s team tried to establish respect in the first phase and now Macron is trying to become the best buddy in the second phase. It strikes me really as quite clever. It’s probably a very smart approach to deal with a bully.” Pointing to the sword dance Trump took part in on his trip to Saudi Arabia, she said that Trump clearly enjoys honours and pageantry. “I would say that Bastille Day is the French equivalent of a sword dance,” she said. “Because he is a very impulsive person it might set the stage for a more positive dialogue.” Security will be tight but French authorities do not anticipate large-scale protests against Trump. There will be a street demonstration against Trump and a “No Trump Zone” at Paris’s Place de la République where organisers linked to the Paris’s Nuit Debout movement said they would stand against Trump’s “anti-migrant positions, sexism, islamphobia and racism”. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the left-wing party France Unbowed, said last month that Trump was “not at all welcome” on Bastille day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/jul/15/scott-ludlams-millenial-ish-voice-will-be-missed-not-least-by-internet-privacy-advocates","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-14T22:32:44Z","webTitle":"Scott Ludlam's millennial-ish voice will be missed, not least by internet privacy advocates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/15/scott-ludlams-millenial-ish-voice-will-be-missed-not-least-by-internet-privacy-advocates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/jul/15/scott-ludlams-millenial-ish-voice-will-be-missed-not-least-by-internet-privacy-advocates","fields":{"headline":"Scott Ludlam's millennial-ish voice will be missed, not least by internet privacy advocates","bodyText":"Brought to politics by his passionate opposition to nuclear power and weapons, Scott Ludlam became the millennial-ish voice in parliament despite being well into his 40s. After narrowly escaping losing his seat in 2013 (instead facing a byelection) he has been brought down by his own administrative failure – not checking if he had renounced his New Zealand citizenship. Ludlam has spent his nine years in parliament following the Jo Vallentine model of “activist legislator”. He won his seat in 2008 and roared into broader public consciousness in 2014 with a withering invitation for Tony Abbott to visit the state he represents. His speech, to a mostly empty Senate chamber on the last sitting before the byelection, racked up almost one million views on YouTube alone. An impressive feat for a senator of whom former Greens leader Christine Milne had reportedly once asked: “Does this guy ever say anything?” Born in 1970 in New Zealand (his ultimate political undoing) Ludlam was raised by hippy-adjacent parents, travelling across Asia and Europe, going to school in apartheid South Africa before settling in Western Australia and becoming a citizen a few years later when he was a teenager. A quintessential nerd – Ludlam has previously said he had “a lot of lost Dungeons and Dragons years” instead of lost party years. If he is not the only politician to properly understand metadata, cybersecurity and the internet, he is certainly the one who understands it best. He has fought, at times unsuccessfully, against the slow erosion of civil liberties through data retention laws and campaigned on the importance of net neutrality. Ludlam thanked Abbott for sending him the “geeks and coders, network engineers and gamers who would never have voted Green in a million years, without the blundering and technologically illiterate assistance of your leadership team”. For a man who claims to be averse to personality politics, he has given enough lol-worthy quips and viral videos to build a significant online following. When asked by GQ about his hair, which has its own Twitter account, he replied: “Next. Doesn’t your editor want to know about our stance on nuclear weapons abolition?” A video congratulating environment minister Greg Hunt on winning best minister of the year “an award it sounds like his mum made up” was shared tens of thousands of times. His response to conservative commentator Chris Kenny that “nobody watches” his show was retweeted hundreds of times. His activism led to a friendship with Julian Assange which has come under scrutiny. He said last year he was “worried” about Assange and when he was interviewed by the Monthly in 2016 he had a signed photo with him in his office: “Scott – thank you for your courage, perseverance and generosity in my long struggle for justice, big and small. As an Australian I am proud of you! Much love, Julian A.” Assange tweeted his support on Friday from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, arguing that Ludlam should have fought to remain a senator. Reflecting on his crowd pleasing internet ways and tendency to do magazine interviews while saying he shuns personality politics, Ludlam admitted there could be an element of hypocrisy. “Maybe I’m just being a massive hypocrite cultivating some kind of anti-brand. If you want to call me out on that, that’s fine,” he told the Monthly. “If you’re going to do a profile in a lifestyle magazine, then you deserve to be asked about that stuff, so I was probably being a little petulant in pushing back in the way that I did. But also I feel as though that’s the least interesting part of what we’re doing. It really is. There’s much more interesting stuff to talk about than the shit I put in my hair. Seriously, there is.” If Ludlam has built an “anti-brand” then one of the cornerstones is his “realness” – for want of a less cringe-worthy expression. People think they know what Ludlam really believes and that he is not another career politician. Ludlam could have fought dismissal from parliament over his dual citizenship, and could have won on the grounds that he thought he had taken “reasonable steps” to renounce the citizenship. But, as he told the Saturday Paper, he believes the Greens are there “to demonstrate, hopefully, that there is a different way of doing politics … You can’t go out and say, ‘We are the ones with integrity’, you just have to damn well show it, and people will form their own judgments over whether they believe it or not.” Integrity was the word used by many in reference to Ludlam’s decision to resign rather than fight what he described as a section of the constitution that is “crystal clear and it has been tested before by others”. “It is not something that I particularly want to put myself, my staff or my party through. This is probably a cleaner way to just make a break.” Now there will be a convoluted countback to decide who will replace Ludlam. If it is the next Greens candidate on the ticket who takes the seat, 22 year-old disability campaigner Jordan Steele-John could resign creating a casual vacancy. The internal party process could drag on for months to pick a replacement – or Ludlam could fill it. The former Greens leader Christine Milne said she would not hesitate in encouraging him to run for the Senate again. “I’d love Scott to consider having a longer career in the Senate but it’s obviously something he will consider in time, that will be a choice in the future, for now I want to say how terrific it was to work with him. When leader he was such a calm, committed, thoroughly good person,” she said. Milne also emphasised Ludlam’s credentials when it came to internet privacy and surveillance, voicing concern his departure would leave a void in internet literacy in parliament. “His oversight, particularly on issues confronting technology and privacy, has demonstrated a level of insight way above that of almost everyone in parliament. Everyone will remember the wonderful speech he made before Tony Abbott visited Western Australia, it really resonated with the community because it expressed how people felt at the time about the meanness of sprit Tony Abbott was exhibiting.” There’s certainly appetite within the Greens, and even parts of the broader community, for Ludlam to stay in the Senate but it may prove difficult to convince the most important person in the decision making. “I don’t want to do this job until I’m properly old,” he has said. “I don’t want to hang on to it for too long. I want to write. And I want to draw. And I want to design stuff.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/mar/29/australian-medical-association-job-losses-hazelwood-brown-coal-power-closure-health-benefits","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-28T19:09:36Z","webTitle":"Impact of job losses in Hazelwood may outweigh health benefits, AMA says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/29/australian-medical-association-job-losses-hazelwood-brown-coal-power-closure-health-benefits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/mar/29/australian-medical-association-job-losses-hazelwood-brown-coal-power-closure-health-benefits","fields":{"headline":"Impact of job losses in Hazelwood may outweigh health benefits, AMA says","bodyText":"The head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Michael Gannon, has said the health benefits of closing down brown-coal power plants need to be considered against the health impacts of unemployment and blackouts. The Hazelwood power station will permanently close on Friday, affecting 500 staff and 300 contractors who will lose their jobs. Hazelwood, in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, is Australia’s dirtiest power station and one of the most polluting power stations in the world. The executive director of the Climate and Health Alliance, Fiona Armstrong, said the community would reap significant health benefits from the closure. “People in the Latrobe Valley have suffered a burden of ill health from the pollution caused by the burning of coal over a long period, given it is linked to cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological diseases, as well as lung cancers,” she said. “For children with asthma, the elderly, and people with respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, this announcement is good news.” But Gannon said that while it was accepted that brown coal is the dirtiest way to produce power, he was not convinced there were enough alternatives available to immediately replace the power generated by Hazelwood. “I’m not convinced we have that right,” Gannon said. “We need a mature debate about the power supply because it powers our hospitals, our schools and other essential infrastructure. “There is also the health affects of unemployment that need to be considered. The Australian Medical Association has clear positions about the risk of providing energy supply through fossil fuels and specifically the risk of brown coal, but somewhere in this we would call for common sense. “We need stable base-load power as well, and we need grown-up conversations about gas and nuclear power while technology is developed to deliver renewable energy.” In it’s submission to the 2013 Senate inquiry into air quality, the Australian Medical Association warned that increasing pollution from road transport and mining, combined with the growing effects of climate change, was exposing communities to an increasingly toxic mix of airborne chemicals and particles that were harming health. The submission warned that “thousands of Australians are dying prematurely or being hospitalised for asthma attacks and heart complaints because of lax standards and enforcement that leave millions exposed to harmful levels of particulate matter, diesel fumes and other airborne pollutants”. While Gannon said there was “no question” brown coal was the worst way to generate power, he said the industry needed more certainty. “It’s our industries that pay the taxes that pay for services in our society, like healthcare and hospitals,” he said. “I don’t have a puritanical view of renewable energy. We must have secure energy supply in our country. The desire of health groups is to see a greater proportion of power coming from renewables, but we can’t be risking blackouts that can also effect hospitals.” Armstrong said she agreed with Gannon that energy security was a pressing issue for hospitals and other essential services. But she said climate change was causing extreme weather events such as cyclones and increased flooding which was impacting hospitals and patients. “We’ve seen examples where hospitals had supply interrupted from extreme weather events,” she said. “Brown coal fuels climate change which causes these events to occur more frequently and more severely.” According to Environment Victoria, Hazelwood uses 27bn litres of water and emits 7,800 tonnes of hydrochloric acid each year. Burning coal is responsible for approximately 95% of air pollution in the Latrobe Valley, according to the Victorian Environment Protection Authority, while the CSIRO have estimated the cost of poor indoor air quality in Australia may be as high as $12bn per year. A Melbourne emergency physician, Dr Stephen Parnis, said from a health perspective moving away from coal could only be positive. He was president of the AMA Victoria in 2014 when the devastating Morwell fires spread into the Hazelwood mine. “We are still watching closely to see if there are any long-term impacts to people’s health from that fire,” he said. “Exposure to inhaled pollutants is known to be a cause of chronic heart disease, and anything that improves air quality such as reducing the burning of fossil fuels can only be a good thing for the health of the population of the La Trobe Valley.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/mar/18/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-deal-22bn-poison-pill-taxpayer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-18T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C nuclear deal contains £22bn 'poison pill' for taxpayer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/18/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-deal-22bn-poison-pill-taxpayer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/mar/18/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-deal-22bn-poison-pill-taxpayer","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C nuclear deal contains £22bn 'poison pill' for taxpayer","bodyText":"The Hinkley nuclear power deal contains a “poison pill” which could leave taxpayers with a £22bn bill if a future UK government closed the plant before 2060, according to an official document seen by the Guardian. The huge liability shows Hinkley is a “terrible deal” for the UK public, according to critics, with the company also guaranteed three times today’s price for electricity for 35 years. The project has recently been battered by financial warnings and resignations at its prime backer EDF, although on Thursday France’s economics minister, Emmanuel Macron, said that the French state would bail the company out. The deal the UK government has agreed with EDF, set out in an unpublicised “minute”, commits the British public to pay subsidies of up to about £40bn in real terms and provides state guarantees on nuclear waste disposal and insurance, while allowing the plant to begin producing electricity as late as 2033. A shutdown that triggers the “poison pill” compensation is not entirely within the control of the UK government but could also be forced by the EU or an international regulator such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, according to the document. “This is a dreadful agreement for the nation,” said Prof Catherine Mitchell, an energy policy expert at the University of Exeter. “The government is already paying a high price, index-linked for an incredibly long 35 years. This should be more than sufficient for a professional, business contract. “The £22bn ‘poison pill’ effectively reduces the risk to zero for EDF and its backers, which is great for them. But from an outside perspective, it smacks of desperation.” “There could be so many reasons over 35 years that you would want to close the plant,” she said, including rising costs, changes to the UK’s energy system or loss of public confidence. Green party MP Caroline Lucas said: “Even before we knew about this ‘poison pill’, Hinkley represented a terrible deal for taxpayers and a huge burden on bill payers too. This flies in the face of relentless ministerial rhetoric on value for consumers – especially compared to the costs of solar power and wind – which are already cheaper than nuclear and continue to fall.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “Hinkley Point C will give a boost to our energy supply and our economy, bringing in billions of pounds of investment into the UK and creating 25,000 jobs during construction. The [deal] gives developers the certainty they need to make sizeable investments like this one, by providing protection for a political risk that is outside of their control. All [such deals] include protection against political shutdown, but this is extremely unlikely to happen.” The £22bn is the maximum that would be payable and the deal allows the plant to be closed on safety or security grounds without compensation being paid. “EDF and its Chinese partner are taking the construction risks for this huge project,” said an EDF spokesman. “Consumers will not pay a penny until the plant generates its reliable low-carbon electricity in 2025.” EDF said in 2007 that the new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset would be providing power to cook Christmas dinners in 2017, but it has repeatedly delayed its final investment decision. It has yet to complete a reactor employing the new design intended for Hinkley, with projects in France and Finland hugely over budget and years behind schedule. In recent weeks, EDF’s finance director quit over concerns about the project’s impact on the already heavily indebted company and EDF had to ask its owner, the French state, for increased support. MPs will grill EDF’s boss next Wednesday, and say there are “serious questions” to answer about Hinkley’s viability. But François Hollande and David Cameron have strongly backed the project as “a pillar of the bilateral relationship” and “a key aspect of Britain’s energy policy”. Former Conservative energy secretary Lord Howell has criticised the Hinkley deal as “one of the worst deals ever” for British consumers and industry and has protested against “endless government guarantees for risk-free returns to the investors”. Tom Burke at thinktank E3G, a former special adviser to three Conservative environment secretaries, said: “Why would a Conservative government want to buy 35 years of electricity ahead of time? They are supposed to believe in the market. But they have tied themselves in knots and now it is too embarrassing to untie it.” The UK government argues that new nuclear power is essential to provide large amounts of reliable, low-carbon energy. But Mitchell said: “Energy economics are changing rapidly and so the momentum is towards decentralised, smart and flexible energy systems. It is moving away from large, inflexible power plants like Hinkley. If it ever gets funded, it will be a white elephant before it is even finished and this government, with this £22bn ‘poison pill’, will have tied the next generation into paying for it, for no reason that I can understand. If it is simply political saving face, it really is pitiful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/08/climate-change-impacts-already-hitting-us-say-europeans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-08T07:20:00Z","webTitle":"Climate change impacts are already hitting us, say Europeans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/08/climate-change-impacts-already-hitting-us-say-europeans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/08/climate-change-impacts-already-hitting-us-say-europeans","fields":{"headline":"Climate change impacts are already hitting us, say Europeans","bodyText":"The citizens of four major European countries think the impacts of climate change such as severe floods and storms are already affecting them, according to a major new polling study. The research dispels the idea that global warming is widely seen as a future problem, and also shows strong support for action to tackle global warming, including subsidies for clean energy and big financial penalties for nations that refuse to be part of the international climate deal signed in Paris in 2015 – as US president Donald Trump has threatened. There was also strong support for giving financial aid to developing nations to cope with the impacts of climate change. Renewable energy was viewed very positively in all nations, but fracking had little support, with just 20% of people seeing it positively in the UK, 15% in Germany and 9% in France. Nuclear power was also unpopular: only 23% of those in France, where it supplies the vast majority of electricity, have a favourable opinion. Overwhelming majorities of people in the UK, Germany, France and Norway said climate change was at least partly caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels. But only a third thought the vast majority of scientists agreed with this, despite about 97% of climate scientists doing so. “It is encouraging to see that most people in this very large study recognise that climate change is happening, and that support for the need to tackle it remains high amongst the people we surveyed,” said Prof Nick Pidgeon at Cardiff University, who led the international project. He said the firm backing of the public could be important in the light of Trump’s opposition to climate action: “With the recently shifting political mood in some countries, climate policy is now entering a critical phase. It is therefore even more important that the public’s clear support for the Paris agreement is carried through by policymakers across Europe and worldwide.” Nick Molho, at the Aldersgate Group, a business alliance that lobbies for a sustainable economy, said: “The UK government should build on the existing public support for climate policies to put forward in the near future a clear plan to meet the emissions reduction targets.” The polling study is the first in-depth climate change research in multiple European nations and involved interviewing more than 1,000 people in each country, with the results then weighted to be nationally representative. The citizens gave near identical answers to the question of when the impacts of global warming would be felt, with 60% answering that they were already here. At least two-thirds of them supported their nation being part of the Paris climate deal and they were at least two to one in favour of penalising countries that were not, perhaps via the border carbon taxes proposed by some French politicians. “People see that if there are free riders, that is not a very good thing,” said Pidgeon. Earlier in March, the US state department snubbed the UN’s climate change chief when she requested a meeting. Subsidising renewable energy with public money was popular, with 70% support in the UK and Germany, 75% in France, and 87% in Norway. Increasing taxes on fossil fuels was supported in oil- and gas-rich Norway, but opposed two to one in France and Germany. In the UK, people were evenly split over tax hikes for fossil fuels. Another split was in the trust people had in the European commission and national and local governments to transform their nation’s energy system to cleaner forms of energy. Germans were generally positive, but those in the UK had little trust in any of the institutions. The polling for the study took place in June 2016, before the Brexit referendum. The report is available online from noon UK time on Wednesday 8 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2017/jul/10/you-helmets-get-a-life-celebrating-25-years-of-the-dunwich-dynamo","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-10T14:05:17Z","webTitle":"'You helmets, get a life!': Celebrating 25 years of the Dunwich Dynamo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/jul/10/you-helmets-get-a-life-celebrating-25-years-of-the-dunwich-dynamo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/jul/10/you-helmets-get-a-life-celebrating-25-years-of-the-dunwich-dynamo","fields":{"headline":"'You helmets, get a life!': Celebrating 25 years of the Dunwich Dynamo","bodyText":"It was the 25th Dunwich Dynamo this weekend, and the fifth ridden by your correspondent. Starting from a park in Hackney, the Dynamo is a madcap 116-ish mile dash from London through the night to the sea-covered remains of a medieval town that was once its rival. A sportive this isn’t: the lovely folks of Southwark Cyclists arrange coaches and trucks back to London for you and your machines, but other than that, you’re on your own. The event attracts all sorts, from club riders swooshing to the coast by dawn, to packs of fairy-lighted Bromptons arriving six hours later but no less triumphantly. The event is a celebration of mild transgression in straitened times, with circadian rhythms and the concept of strangers put on hold for a summer night. Below is a personal account of how it all unfolded, with timings handily included so you can gauge my state of mind as the sun disappeared then turned up again. 7:30pm: A man at the lights by London Bridge station is wearing a lycra top bulging with bananas. I grin at him. He grins back, which means, yep, he’s also a Dun Runner. Our little cycling tributary is swelled by more riders at every junction, and by London Fields we’re as mighty as the Walbrook once was. 8:15pm: We’re under way. We join hundreds of other bikes crawling on out through Hackney. On Mare Street, a man in a car beeps his horn at the throng. “Make some space,” he shouts, with accidental irony. 9:16pm: We’re heading out into the Essex badlands and the boy racers of Epping, the most dangerous bit of the ride, with the odd close pass from bad drivers on the long wooded stretches of A-road. “You fucking helmets! Get a life,” shouts one young geezer speeding in the opposite direction. 10:30pm: After a glorious sunset as we cross the M11, we’re into the Essex countryside proper now, with trees looming in the moonlight, and a stream of blinking lights showing us the way. The village of Moreton is the first pub stop for many. At the Nag’s Head, a covers band is bashing out Blondie as a woman on a Boris bike charges on through at a fair old lick. 11:37pm: We’ve been cheered on by villagers staying up and sitting out in the warm summer evening, with one bunch having stuck their sofa in their front garden. At the top of an incline near Great Dunmow, a phantasm of pensioners wrapped up in white sheets shout encouragement from the summit. Outside the Axe &amp; Compasses pub, we’re passed by a bloke who has welded two bikes together to create a strange steampunk contraption called G Randy Parts. 0:57am: The Bell in Great Bardfield has set up a stall for tea, coffee and snack bars. A passing police car ushers the mass of bikes back to the kerb, and is responded to with gentle mockery. Inside, a local is bashing out random chords on the pub piano. 1:30am: The thousands of riders have stretched out, and we are no longer being passed by super-fit club riders. I leave my ride buddy to get a bit of solitude, to muse on the important things and stare out across the darkened fields. Rejoining my friend and half way up a hill in the middle of nowhere, there’s a guy blasting out Wu-Tang Clan from his panniers. I follow him gratefully, bats in the air and Wu-Tang Clan’s killer bees in my ears. 02:41am: “Fucking hell it’s my lucky night”. A man is delighted to find pubs are open specially late for the Dynamo. “It’s shit here. Nothing ever happens,” he adds, before getting into a conversation about his daughter, who I swear he said was called Paella, and a guy who became a Scientologist. We have reached Suffolk, and the market town of Sudbury. At the flooded urinal at the Boathouse pub by the river, another local makes conversation. “Piss up on the beach, is it? Good luck, mate.” Only 50-odd miles to go. Or is it 60-odd? Time to eat some peanuts. 02:53am: A quick cuppa with friends in the yard of Sudbury fire station, before heading uphill out of town. On its outskirts, drunk youths heading home shout abuse and encouragement, as is traditional. 03:15am: I swear incoherently at my friend about traffic lights. “Fucking traffic light bastards.” He turns around in confusion. He is not my friend, but someone else entirely. 04:11am: Dawn is here! Lovely glorious mindbending dawn. I love everyone, and their children. The world is amazing. Everything is amazing. 4:53am: An enormous queue for hotdogs at “birdpoo pond”, or Needham Lake as it is officially known. A guy removes his handlebars and uses them as an impromptu horn. There are rumours that this is the site of a killer swan (almost). “Who’s allowed to eat swans, anyway? Just the Queen and some idiots from Oxford and Cambridge once a year.” Only 28 miles to go. After a quick break, we’re all dreaming of bacon sandwiches from a pop-up stall 15 miles from the finish. 6:03am: The pop-up stall is not there this year. Bugger. 6:23am: Somewhere beyond Peasenhall there’s a nasty, gradual incline that would have been fine eight hours ago but now feels like the end of the world. Motivation comes with the sound of the Stone Roses blasting out from a cyclist somewhere behind me: desperation to keep Ian Brown as far away from my ears as possible gets me to the summit. 7:30am: I hate cycling. I hate everyone. I’m never doing the Dynamo again. 7:45am: We’re being passed by people already heading back to London, because for some, ridiculously, Dunwich marks the halfway point. I reassure myself with the thought that their bikes all look much fancier than mine. 8:20am: We’ve made it! I love cycling, I love everyone! After passing the remains of the 13th-century Franciscan friary, we collapse onto the beach, and strip off for a swim in the grey waters of the North Sea, Sizewell nuclear power station visible along the coast. “That’s why the water is so warm and green,” explains one man as he bobs past. 9:03am: I am lying in the garden of The Ship pub with a pint of ale. Bury me here, pointing towards the sea. 11:30am: On a coach back to London, to check if it’s still there, and if so, what to do about it. Did you ride the Dunwich Dynamo this year? Were you the person on a Boris Bike?

The agreement was hailed by David Cameron and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at a joint press conference in London, with Xi describing the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset as the “flagship project of cooperation” in a new era for China and Britain. State-owned China General Nuclear Power (CGN) has taken a 33.5% stake in Hinkley, with EDF holding the remainder of the ownership in what critics claim to be the most expensive power plant ever built. The deal was signed off in front of Cameron and Xi. EDF said it expected to take a final investment decision and start mobilising engineers for the plant, by the middle of next month. The companies also announced preliminary agreements to work together on two more nuclear power stations: Sizewell C in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. The latter has attracted particular criticism because it will give primary ownership of the project to CGN – and use Chinese technology. The terms for the 3.2GW Hinkley plant have been agreed but the final contract, running to thousands of pages, would be signed in the next few weeks, EDF said. The plant was originally scheduled to open in 2017 but has been hit by a a series of delays. On Wednesday EDF said it would be constructed by 2025 although the subsidy agreement with the British government contains a clause allowing the plant to be completed no later than 2033. The deal, backed strongly by the chancellor, George Osborne, is contentious because it commits British energy users to potentially expensive payments to EDF and CGN to supply energy once the plant is built. Homeowners and businesses will need to pay £92.50 per MW hour for Hinkley electricity over 35 years, compared with a current wholesale price of £40. The arrangement has also raised questions about why Britain is relying on France and China, which has been accused of hacking into other countries’ IT systems, to build a nuclear power station. EDF, which is controlled by the French government, said national security agencies would be involved in checking that Hinkley’s systems were protected. EDF said the 12.5% increase in construction costs – from an initial estimate of £16bn to £18bn – reflected the impact of inflation since an earlier estimate two years ago. EDF added that the underlying costs had remained stable. Hinkley Point is scheduled for completion by 2025, eight years later than first suggested, and is intended to provide about 7% of the UK’s energy. EDF said it had turned down the offer of up to £16bn of UK government loan guarantees and had decided to fund its £12bn share of the project by borrowing in the market because it was likely to be cheaper. Jean-Bernard Lévy, EDF’s chairman, said: “We are funding it on the EDF group balance sheet for our part, which is two-thirds. We will use the money we borrow or that we generate from EDF operations.” EDF needs the Chinese investment because it is burdened with high levels of debt and is expected to sell about €10bn (£7.4bn) of assets in the next five years. Earlier in October, two of the world’s biggest ratings agencies warned the company it faced credit-rating downgrades if Hinkley Point went ahead. The nuclear push has many critics over its cost, the time it takes to build plants and the potential threat to the UK’s national security of having China in control of a plant on UK soil. Osborne’s father-in-law, former energy minister Lord Howell, has described the project as “one of the worst deals ever” for British consumers and industry. Asked if the government security agencies would be inspecting the site, Levy said: “Yes, of course. Do you imagine that the people in charge of national security just sit in their office and ask for paperwork?” Rivaz said that, once the contract was signed, there would be hundreds of workers at the site by the end of the year and that at the peak of construction about 5,6oo people would be employed there. Levy said there would be a small number of Chinese workers involved in planning, engineering and project management among thousands of British workers. He said the deal to build Hinkley was an important event because it was the first order for a nuclear power station in the western hemisphere since the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011. The agreement was welcomed by many in Britain’s business community and bytrade unions, but was derided by Greenpeace, which was angry that the deal is going ahead when solar and wind power face major subsidy cuts. “Britain’s nuclear future hung in the balance and China came to the rescue. Nevertheless, the deal is good news for investors, for chemical engineers and crucially, for our low-carbon future,” said Andrew Furlong, director of policy at the Institution of Chemical Engineers. But Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, was scathing: “With this deal, George Osborne is not so much backing the wrong horse as betting billions of consumers’ money on a nag running backwards. There’s no end in sight for the nuclear industry’s dependence on billion-pound handouts, whilst the renewable sector is on the verge of going subsidy-free.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/blog/live/2015/oct/21/starbucks-and-fiat-chrysler-face-multimillion-euro-repayments-after-eu-tax-ruling-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T16:40:16Z","webTitle":"Chinese president: 'room for improvement' on human rights - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2015/oct/21/starbucks-and-fiat-chrysler-face-multimillion-euro-repayments-after-eu-tax-ruling-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/blog/live/2015/oct/21/starbucks-and-fiat-chrysler-face-multimillion-euro-repayments-after-eu-tax-ruling-live","fields":{"headline":"Chinese president: 'room for improvement' on human rights - as it happened","bodyText":"Prime minister David Cameron has told the UK-China business summit at the Mansion House in London that the £40bn of deals with China means “jobs, it means livelihoods, it means security.” PA reports: Cameron said he had been “determined” to build a stronger relationship with China during his time in No 10 but told how his relationship with Mr Xi dated back to 2007 when the pair promised to “nurture and develop” links between the two nations. “The deals that have been done during this visit cement what is a growing partnership,” he said. “This visit is taking our relationship to the next level and I want to ensure that our cooperation and partnership means we can support each other to deliver the growth and the jobs that we both want, to make sure that the trade and investment flows both ways along the modern equivalent of the Silk Road.” “I’m clear that the UK is China’s best partner in the West,” he added. Mr Xi told the summit there was “enormous” potential for trade with his country, which is expected to import around ten trillion US dollars worth of goods and invest more than 500 billion US dollars overseas over the next five years. The president said Britain and China must now work to “deepen mutual trust”, deliver some tangible results off the back of the new relationship and “synergise” development strategies. He added: “We are deeply impressed by the strong will and positive stance of the UK to grow relations and cooperation with China.” On that note, it’s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Downing Street has confirmed that Mr Cameron raised human rights issues with Mr Xi but would not go into the specific concerns he had, according to PA. Mr Cameron’s spokeswoman said: “The Prime Minister raised the issue of human rights, the importance of countries working together to address issues, to talk about the importance of what this means as countries develop and move forwards.” Dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei called on David Cameron to raise the issue of human rights in his continuing talks with president Xi Jinping. He told Sky News: “I think the British Prime Minister has had a record on putting human rights aside which is very bad strategy and also is a very bad aesthetics, because this certainly doesn’t represent the British people. “When [people in China] see Mr Cameron not put human rights as an issue, (that) will make people very disappointed.” Here’s some video of David Cameron unveiling the Hinkley Point deal: Britain and China have signed deals worth around £40bn, Reuters is reporting. Prime Minister David Cameron told business leaders: “One of the foremost elements of this visit is the huge number of commercial deals that we are signing, totalling almost £40bn.” He pointed to a £1.4bn deal for Rolls-Royce, as well as oil and gas deals worth more than £12bn, including one with BP. Meanwhile Chinese president Xi Jinping said some emerging markets were facing a slowdown in growth but still enjoyed sound economic foundations. Investors had been increasingly concerned about a slowdown in China after years of strong growth, and its effect on the rest of the global economy. Xi Jinping said China was entering a new normal in its economic development. The country does face some downward pressure, but a growth rate of around 7% would suffice. He said there would be no hard landing. What do the locals think of the Hinkley Point deal with the Chinese? Steven Morris has been finding out: Prime minister David Cameron also announced a new fund to support research into “anti-microbial resistance” and said the talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping had also touched on issues such as closer cooperation on global poverty, African development and women’s rights. The UK government says the Hinkley Point deal will create up to 25,000 jobs, up to 1,000 apprentices and also provide billions of pounds worth of supply chain contracts. The official release is here: Hinkley Point C to power six million UK homes China has been under pressure for its human rights record and UK prime minister David Cameron had been urged to raise the matter during this week’s meetings with president Xi Jinping. As it turned out, a large part of the - fairly brief - press conference saw president Xi Jinping addressing the issue. He said China attached great importance to the protection of human rights and had found a path suitable for China’s current conditions. But he said there was “always room for improvement.” Cameron said the UK needed a strong economic and trade relationship with China so that the two sides could have frank discussions about other issues such as human rights. He said: “I would completely reject the premise that either you can have an exchange with China about the issue of steel - or indeed about human rights - or you can have a strong relationship with China which is good for business, investment and growth...My argument, and my contention after five years of doing this job, is that you can have both. Indeed you must have both.” And now a question about the UK’s northern powerhouse from a Chinese journalist: Xi says he’s interested to visit Manchester tomorrow: Cameron adds: One of the points of these in depth discussions is to better understand each others economies. And with that - just one question from a journalist from each country - they are gone. The second part of the BBC’s question about China’s human rights record was primarily addressed to President Xi. Xi does not immediately tackle this but says: I want to answer the steel question. The world is seeing an oversupply [of steel] following the financial crisis. China also has overcapacity. We have taken a series of steps [to remedy this]. We have cut 700m tonnes of production capacity. You can imagine the task of finding jobs for those workers. The UK is an important partner for China. Our investment [in the UK reached] 12.8bn RMB by 2014. Our future investments will create further jobs. We want to avoid protectionist measures. Coming to the human rights issue, China attaches create importance to human rights. We have found a path suited to China’s conditions. There is always room for improvement in the world. China is ready to increase co-operation with UK and other countries over human rights. Questions. BBC - if you were a steelworker losing their job, at same time as seeing the Chinese president in a golden carriage, what would you think? What about China’s human rights record? Cameron: We discussed the importance of steel industry, problem of global oversupply. China has plans to reduce oversupply. The stronger our relationship, the more able we are to have discussions about other issues. We will take action here in the UK, on energy costs, securing projects. The investment we have announced here today will [use] British steel. We are building Crossrail using almost exclusively British steel. I reject the [premise] that you either have a conversation on human rights and steel or you have strong relationship. I want both. Now Xi Jinping is speaking. I was deeply impressed by the pageantry and warmth displayed yesterday. A meeting with the prime minister agreed a global strategic partnership and to open up a golden era and jointly create a brighter future. During the visit we achieved a string of outcomes... including the Hinkley Point deal. This is a flagship project between the two countries. [Among other business deals] China will issue in London RMB sovereign bond for first time. Let’s seize the opportunity .. to bring more benefits to our countries. A relationship fit for the 21st century, benefiting our people and the wider world. We discussed the excess supply of steel and how we can tackle it. We are able to have discussions about more difficult issues such as cyber and human rights. David Cameron is now giving a press conference. I want to see more trade flowing between our countries. I am pleased to announce an historic deal [to build Hinkley Point} So business leaders and unions have welcomed the Hinkley Point nuclear deal, Labour and the Green Party are not happy. Also criticising the deal - again not surprisingly - is Greenpeace. Its chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said: “With this deal George Osborne is not so much backing the wrong horse as betting billions of consumers’ money on a nag running backwards. “There’s no end in sight for the nuclear industry’s dependence on billion-pound handouts whilst the renewable sector is on the verge of going subsidy free. Backing the former and punishing the latter makes no economic sense whatsoever. “Our grandchildren will one day wonder why their bills are propping up a foreign-owned, outdated, and costly nuclear industry instead of supporting cutting-edge UK firms producing cheap clean energy.” Lisa Nandy, shadow energy and climate change secretary, expressed concerns about the cost of the project, and said she had written to the Public Accounts Committee to ask them to look at the terms of the deal in detail. She said: “There are real fears about what this deal will mean for family budgets, and for our national security too. “These concerns must be addressed before a final investment agreement is made. “Hinkley Point C is likely to be the most expensive power station ever built anywhere and it is largely families and business who are picking up the tab. “I’m deeply concerned about the costs for households, and particularly vulnerable groups like pensioners.” That is why I have written to the Public Accounts Committee and asked them to scrutinize in detail the terms of the agreement ministers have reached.” Another to greet the deal warmly was Phil Whitehurst, national officer of the GMB union, who said: “We welcome this financing for Hinkley Point C as another piece of the jigsaw in place for a project with 25,000 job opportunities, 1,000 apprenticeships and 60% of the construction cost going to UK companies. “The UK needs nuclear power to provide low-carbon base load electricity to keep the lights on the eight to 10 days per month when renewables are not generating power for the grid.” But the GMB said it would continue to campaign against giving the go-ahead for Chinese nuclear technology to be used in a new nuclear power station at Bradwell. But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “If we are to keep the lights on, wean ourselves off fossil fuels and meet global climate change targets, nuclear energy has a vital role to play in our economy. “It is clean, safe and secure, and the construction of power plants creates thousands of high-skill jobs and apprenticeships.” Proponents of renewable energy have also - unsurprisingly - attacked the Hinkley Point deal. Paul McCullagh, chief executive of renewable business UrbanWind, said: [For the government] to suggest that renewable energy subsidies were axed due to the impact they had on homeowner’s energy bills, and then to agree a strike price more than twice the current wholesale price for electricity generated by Hinkley Point, seems utterly backwards. Rather than supporting technologies, such as onshore wind and solar, that are readily deployable, popular with the public and increasingly cost-competitive, the Government has chosen to back a generation method that is ten years away, at best. On top of that, it comes at a price that will almost certainly increase energy bills for homes and businesses alike. National Grid have already warned that the chance of blackouts this winter will be the highest for a decade. If we experience an unexpected further outage, like we did last year with the unexpected closure of two EDF nuclear power stations over safety fears, then we could face big problems meeting demand. A new nuclear power station that is ten years or more away is not going to be much help. We’ve done a Q&amp;A on the key issues surrounding the Hinckley Point deal: Not everyone of course is happy with the deal, due to be signed shortly in the presence of David Cameron. The Green Party for one. Green MEP Molly Scott Cato MEP called it a “national disgrace” and said the party would continue to oppose it: This is a terrible deal which will result in the world’s most expensive power plant and massively overpriced electricity. .. This is all the more tragic as we know renewable energy can deliver energy security more quickly, more cheaply and provide thousands more quality jobs. Hinkley still has a number of hurdles to jump, despite this deal. We will continue to oppose this white elephant every step of the way. Here is our full report: The cost of building the new power station has risen by £2bn. Under the terms of the deal, the Chinese firm is taking a 33.5% stake in Hinkley Point in exchange for £6bn of funding with the rest owned by EDF. BREAKING NEWS EDF and Chinese firm China General Nuclear Power have confirmed a deal to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The deal is expected to be signed shortly.

He added: “Whilst multinationals were lured to EU states with offers of low tax rates as an incentive, little did they know that, despite having agreement at the highest national level, this would come back and bite a decade later.” Anders Dahlbeck, of ActionAid, described the tax rulings as “just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corporate tax breaks”. The international NGO estimates that developing countries lose at least $138bn a year to special tax breaks. The EU is right to act against sweetheart deals which allow multinational companies to avoid millions in tax but this only addresses part of the problem of international taxation. These sweetheart deals in Europe and developing countries are part of a race to the bottom on tax which hits the poorest hardest and leaves healthcare, schools and other key public services starved of resources.” We need a fairer global tax system which tackles tax breaks in Europe and developing countries, ends the race to the bottom on tax and supports developing countries to find a sustainable route out of poverty.” Margrethe Vestager’s boss is, of course, European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who was Luxembourg’s prime minister and finance minister when the tax dodging deals were struck. He has claimed he was not involved. Speaking the European Parliament in September, Juncker said: “The fight against tax avoidance and evasion is one of the Commission’s top 10 priorities.” He added that he felt he had “a duty to fight tax evasion and avoidance.” He was strongly critical of the current system, labelling it “unusable and unjust” with “multinational companies extremely adept at making use of differing tax rules in EU countries.” But he also stressed the need to balance the crackdown on corporate tax avoidance with boosting investment in the EU. He said: “there is a need to generate greater growth and investment given the current lack of investment, however, company taxation should not act as a break on investment.” Oxfam welcomes today’s EU tax rulings. The charity is urging that this should be seen as the start, and not the end, of a process to stop such practices to avoid tax, and is calling on the European Commission to launch a comprehensive investigation into the 350 cases of corporate tax avoidance revealed during last year’s LuxLeaks scandal. Oxfam’s head of campaigns Nick Bryer said: It’s high time that the European Union stood up to Starbucks, Fiat and other multinational corporations which are attempting to dodge paying their fair share in taxes and the Member States which help them. Companies like Starbucks and Fiat will continue to play the system unless the European Commission and Member States work together to close tax loopholes and punish those who break the rules. It’s not just rich countries that lose out to tax dodging, it costs people in poor countries billions every year that could help to pay for desperately needed schools and hospitals. The work undertaken so far is a first step, but only with a full investigation can the European Commission start to restore European citizens’ trust in tax systems. The European Union must fight corporate tax dodging through legislative change and build a fair system that works for people and not just for giant corporations. At times of great inequality and suffering it is unacceptable that big business is not paying its fair share of taxes. The European Union can no longer avoid taking responsibility to put its house in order. ” Oxfam expects the European Commission to levy heavy fines on those guilty of breaking European Union rules on state aid. The charity stressed the importance of giving legal protection to those whistleblowers who take risks to reveal tax avoidance by big corporations. Bryer added: The European Union can also lead by example in making the transformative changes that are really needed. A clear definition and criteria for a tax haven list with the capacity to sanction and blacklist is necessary. And public country-by-country-reporting will allow scrutiny on where corporate profits are made and where they should be taxed, providing a unique opportunity for European countries to demonstrate their will to fight tax avoidance.’’ On financial markets, the FTSE 100 index in London has turned positive, trading 36 points higher at 6381, a 0.6% gain. This is despite a sharp fall in Pearson shares, which are now down 16.5% at 992.5p, following a profit warning from the educational publisher. Elsewhere in Europe, markets have also shrugged off poor corporate results. Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC are both 0.9% ahead. Vestager said: “We need a fundamental shift in corporate philosophies.” She said paying their fair share of tax should be part of companies’ social responsibility. Linklaters competition partner and state aid expert Natura Gracia said today’s decisions are “basically about the Commission setting the limits for what member states can and cannot do in terms of reaching individual agreements with tax payers”. She added: It’s a bold move by Vestager showing that she will not shy away from taking decisive action even in a controversial policy area such as taxation. While the Commission recognises the legitimacy of tax rulings and the freedom for Member States to decide on their tax regimes, companies should be mindful of relying on those rulings going forward. Given the significant financial consequences of state aid enforcement, it will be prudent for companies to test the legality of individual rulings they have received or will be applying for.” The Dutch government said it was “surprised” by the European Commission’s decision on its tax deal with Starbucks, insisting that the arrangement was in line with international standards. It said in a statement: The fact that the Commission observes that there would be state aid in the Starbucks file raises a lot of questions. The Netherlands is convinced that actual international standards are applied.” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said: We’ve found a large variety of methods, one more complex than the other ... These arrangements shifted profits from one company to another in the same group without economic justification. But the result is that companies pay almost no tax on profits made.” You can listen to the press conference live here. The Amazon and Apple tax deal cases are very different from Starbucks and Fiat, Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, has told a news conference. These are very different cases and will be assessed on their own merit. The outcome today does not prejudge the next decisions we will eventually take. We will take a decision when the cases are ready for decision making.” In the UK, the Liberal Democrats celebrated the EC ruling as a “game-changer in the fight against corporate tax avoidance”. Catherine Bearder MEP, chair of the Liberal Democrat EU referendum campaign, said: By working together across Europe, we can clamp down on tax-dodging and get a fairer deal for British taxpayers and businesses. Outside the EU, Britain would find it much harder to ensure multinationals pay their fair share.” The Luxembourg government also disagreed with the European Commission’s tax ruling. An official said: Luxembourg disagrees with the conclusions reached by the European Commission in the Fiat Finance and Trade case and reserves all its rights. Luxembourg will use appropriate due diligence to analyse the decision of the Commission as well as its legal rationale. Luxembourg already notes that the European Commission has used unprecedented criteria in establishing the alleged State aid. In particular, the Commission has not established in any way that Fiat Finance and Trade received selective advantages with reference to Luxembourg’s national legal framework. Luxembourg does not consider that Fiat Finance and Trade has been granted incompatible State aid, as foreseen by article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Luxembourg adheres to international standards, in particular those relating to the arm’s length principle applicable with respect to transfer pricing, and with State aid rules.” Starbucks has been quick to respond to the EU tax ruling, saying it intends to appeal. A spokesperson said: Starbucks shares the concerns expressed by the Netherlands government that there are significant errors in the decision, and we plan to appeal since we followed the Dutch and OECD rules available to anyone. The dispute between the European Commission and the Netherlands as to which OECD rules we and others should follow could require us to pay about €20m to €30m on top of the $3bn in global taxes we have paid over the seven years in question (2008-2014). Starbucks complies with all OECD rules, guidelines and laws and supports its tax reform process. Starbucks has paid an average global effective tax rate of roughly 33%, well above the 18.5% average rate paid by other large US companies.” In the case of Starbucks, which has a coffee roasting subsidiary in Amsterdam, the Commission concluded that a tax ruling issued by the Dutch authorities in 2008 gave it a selective advantage, and reduced its tax burden by €20-30m. In particular, the 2008 ruling artificially lowered taxes paid by Starbucks Manufacturing in two ways, the Commission explained: Starbucks Manufacturing pays a very substantial royalty to Alki (a UK-based company in the Starbucks group) for coffee-roasting know-how. It also pays an inflated price for green coffee beans to Switzerland-based Starbucks Coffee Trading SARL. The Commission said a tax ruling issued by the Luxembourg authorities in 2012 gave a selective advantage to Fiat’s financial subsidiary in the Grand Duchy, Fiat Finance and Trade, which has unduly reduced its tax burden since 2012 by €20-30m. It said the 2012 tax ruling “endorses an artificial and extremely complex methodology that is not appropriate for the calculation of taxable profits reflecting market conditions”. In particular, it artificially lowers taxes paid by Fiat Finance and Trade in two ways, the Commission explained: Due to a number of economically unjustifiable assumptions and down-ward adjustments, the capital base approximated by the tax ruling is much lower thanthe company’s actual capital. The estimated remuneration applied to this already much lower capital for tax purposes is also much lower compared to market rates. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: Tax rulings that artificially reduce a company’s tax burden are not in line with EU state aid rules. They are illegal. I hope that, with today’s decisions, this message will be heard by member state governments and companies alike. All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax.” You can read the commission’s full statement here. The EU Commission said the companies’ tax deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg gave them selective tax advantages. A statement just issued said: The Commission has ordered Luxembourg and the Netherlands to recover the unpaid tax from Fiat and Starbucks, respectively in order to remove the unfair competitive advantage they have enjoyed and to restore equal treatment with other companies in similar situations. The amounts to recover are €20-30m for each company.” The European Commission has ruled that Starbucks and Fiat’s sweetheart tax deals with the Dutch and Luxembourg authorities respectively are illegal, and ordered the governments to recover between €20 and €30m in back taxes from each multinational. Back to the EU tax ruling, which should be coming any minute now. Alan Clarke of Scotiabank said: The Office for Budget Responsibility’s projection for the full year is for a £20bn reduction compared with the previous financial year. So we are moving in the right direction, but not fast enough. There is still six months to make up for lost time, but I suspect that the £69.5bn target for the year will not be met.” Investec economist Chris Hare said: Today’s (marginally positive) print marks a continued closing in the deficit, but still not at quite at the same pace as that embodied in the OBR’s projections. We are now six months into the fiscal year and cumulative borrowing stands at £46bn – that is £1.2bn per month less, on average, than the first six months of the last fiscal year. At this rate, borrowing would be set to reach around £75bn in the 15/16 fiscal year, versus £90bn in 2014/15. However, this would imply a slight overshoot of the OBR’s borrowing projection of £69.5bn for 2015/16. This is no major cause for concern though – we have only reached half time in this fiscal year.” On the economic front, Britain’s public finances improved by more than expected in September, as record revenues for the month from income, VAT and corporation tax flowed into Treasury coffers. Public borrowing came in at £9.4bn last month, down from £11bn a year earlier, and below City forecasts of £10.1bn. However, George Osborne is still struggling to meet his borrowing targets for the year, after a disappointing outturn in August. While tax receipts surged to a record level for the month of September, central government spending also climbed to its highest level since records began. Meanwhile, there is a new twist in the Volkswagen saga. A Norwegian shipowner, I.M. Skaugen, is seeking $50m in compensation from a marine unit of the German carmaker for rigging performance tests of ship engines produced over a decade ago, Reuters reports. I.M. Skaugen alleges that the specifications of the six engines it bought from MAN were misleading and it is seeking compensation for higher fuel use than specified over the expected 30-year lifetime of the engines. VW now owns 75% of MAN Diesel and Turbo, although it did not own the business when the engines were manufactured. The allegations are a further blow to Volkswagen, which faces massive penalties and class-action lawsuits around the world after admitting that some of its diesel cars were fitted with software that manipulated emissions tests. Some 11m vehicles are affected. Margrethe Vestager’s tax crackdown on global corporations comes after last year’s LuxLeaks. The leaked documents showed that the Grand Duchy – a tiny state with a population of half a million – struck tax deals with some 340 companies around the world to help them save millions in tax. In a useful primer ahead of the EC ruling, Politico writes: Wait a second, can Vestager actually set corporate tax rates? No, she can’t. Tax rates is one of the areas where national capitals reign supreme. But some of them — especially Luxembourg City and Dublin — have been offering ultra-low tax rates to attract some of the world’s biggest corporate names, and the money, jobs and prestige that come with them. Ultra-low tax rates are fine, says Vestager, provided they are available to all companies and not just the chosen few, who would enjoy an advantage over smaller, less-well-connected rivals. Why is Vestager first targeting Fiat and Starbucks, not Apple or Amazon? Since taking office, Vestager has charged Google with breaching EU competition law, and opened probes into Qualcomm and Amazon. So maybe she felt it was time to give U.S. tech firms at least a temporary break. Charging one European carmaker and one U.S. coffee shop chain avoids the accusations of only bashing Silicon Valley. She could, however, be testing the waters. Apple is the big one. The rulings are likely to be appealed, but are already having far-reaching implications, according to international law firm Pinsent Masons. Heather Self, partner at Pinsent Masons, said: Multinationals will be particularly anxious about the Starbucks case. The ruling process in the Netherlands is long-established and very well-respected internationally. For competition authorities to challenge very technical tax rulings by competent authorities in this way is extremely destabilising.” It has implications not just for companies that have received tax rulings from the Netherlands in the past, but for any multinational operating anywhere in Europe. The fact that EU competition authorities feel it appropriate to intervene in highly complex international tax issues adds another layer of complexity and unpredictability.” Caroline Ramsay, senior associate and state aid expert at Pinsent Masons, added: Having taken the cases this far, most experts are anticipating that the EU will rule that the tax rulings did constitute an award of unlawful state aid to the tax payer. If the findings are as is expected, then it is highly likely that they will be appealed to the European Court of Justice, and the taxpayers themselves may also appeal the decision.” While this appeal process could take some years, in practical terms, we are already entering a new era. Multinationals are already ensuring that state aid is part of their considerations in setting up a new tax structure in Europe.” So what is it all about? The European Commission is expected to rule that Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler had unlawful tax deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg – by declaring that they constitute unlawful state aid. The American coffee company has made the Netherlands its European hub by basing a bean-roasting subsidiary in Amsterdam. Fiat has based an internal financing subsidiary in Luxembourg, to benefit from favourable tax treatments in those countries. Both companies are believed to have been paying a fraction of the headline tax rates in Luxembourg and the Netherlands for many years, my Guardian colleague Simon Bowers reports. Any additional tax would be paid to the authorities in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Amazon and Apple are next, and could open the floodgates to more tax rulings, legal experts say. Returning to the European Commission’s decision on tax avoidance, a press conference will be held at 12.30pm in Brussels (11.30am UK time), but the ruling could come earlier. Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, has been dubbed the Danish tax reaper. She even cancelled a trip to China, citing pressing work matters, to announce the ruling today which comes after a 15-month investigation. Starbucks could be billed about €30m (£22m) in additional taxes, according to the Financial Times (£), which cited sources close to the investigation. Fiat’s bill is expected to be even higher. So Ferrari will start trading on Wall Street, under the ticker RACE this afternoon. The shares have been priced at the top end of expectations, at $52. As car enthusiasts snapped them up alongside institutional investors, the IPO raised nearly $900m (£580m) on Tuesday, valuing the company at almost $10bn. Parent Fiat Chrysler is taking Ferrari public to sell a tenth of its 90% stake in the luxury brand. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, is a bit sceptical. While the appeal of owning a piece of such a marque or luxury brand has its obvious attractions, which explains why the IPO is oversubscribed, one can’t help feeling what the advantages of owning the shares would be to a potential investor? Trading as it does at 33 times earnings the valuation seems rather high, given that car sales volumes are limited by exclusivity, unless there are certain privileges involved in being a shareholder like VIP access to the F1 paddock perhaps? When one thinks of luxury marque brands the names of Rolls Royce Cars, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Maybach and Aston Martin all trip off the tongue and all of these are subsidiaries of major car companies, BMW, Volkswagen Audi, Daimler and Ford, where the brand doesn’t have to necessarily stand on its own two feet. Even so one can’t help feeling that Fiat are surely missing a trick in not having a dual listing in Europe, particularly given how fanatical the “tifosi” are about the “Prancing Horse” brand. One company that might be more than an interested party in the success of this particular IPO is Volkswagen. If their problems get any worse they could find themselves having to do something similar to Fiat and look at potentially offloading Bentley, Bugatti or Lamborghini, particularly if the Ferrari float goes well.” Home Retail shares have crashed 13% to 130p after the profit warning. Profits at its Argos chain almost halved in the first six months of the year. The company blamed falling sales of TVs, tablet computers and other electrical computers, and of summer goods. Educational publisher Pearson, which sold the Financial Times newspaper to Nikkei in July, has also warned that 2015 profits would be at the lower end of the expected range. Shares in the FTSE 100 company slumped more than 12% to £10.42. Merlin Entertainments has teamed up with China Media Capital to open a Legoland near Shanghai. Merlin runs UK attractions including Madame Tussauds, Sea Life Centres and the London Eye. The UK company already runs five attractions in China, including Madame Tussauds and Chang Feng Ocean World aquarium, and wants to open three others in the next 18 months. The news comes as Lego warned that it may run out of bricks for Christmas. The Danish company has overtaken Barbie doll maker Mattel to become the world’s largest toymaker by sales. Even though its factories are running at full throttle, it is struggling to keep up with demand from European toy stores. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. We are expecting an EU ruling on tax avoidance this morning. Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler are likely to have to pay tens of millions of euros in additional taxes, with the European Commission expected to rule that they had unlawful deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Rulings on Amazon and Apple will follow. My Guardian colleague Simon Bowers writes: Starbucks has for years made the Netherlands its European hub while Fiat has based a lucrative internal financing subsidiary in Luxembourg. In both cases, the multinationals approached the local tax authorities to seek assurances that their controversial tax structures in these countries would not be challenged. These assurances – often known as “comfort letters” – are expected to be torn up on Wednesday when Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, confirms the commission has concluded that the two tax rulings constitute illegal state aid. The decision into the sweetheart tax deals follows a 15-month investigation.” You can read the full preview here. Also today: Home Retail Group, which owns the Argos and Homebase chains, has just issued a profit warning. UK public finance figures for September are out at 9.30am The Ferrari IPO in New York is due to kick off at $52 a share, valuing the company at $10bn. Fiat-Chrysler wants to spin off the brand to set it apart from its more mass market brands.

As part of my research into the regulation of self-driving cars, I’ve had the privilege of driving one. Or more accurately, I’ve had the privilege of being driven by one. On a Colorado highway in July, with some trepidation, I flicked the lever to engage Autopilot mode. I told the representative from Tesla that I was worried about handing over control, taking my feet off the pedals and my hands off the wheel. She reassured me that I would quickly get used to it. My curiosity was at least partly morbid. In May, a Tesla Model S was implicated in the world’s first fatal self-driving car crash. Joshua Brown was behind the wheel, but he was not in control of his car. As far as we know, neither he nor his car’s sensors detected a truck that had driven across his path. The car did not brake. It drove at 74mph under the truck’s trailer, crushing the car’s roof before leaving the road and hitting a post, killing its driver. On Thursday, in one of its last acts under the current administration, the US National Highways and Transport Safety Agency released its report on the crash. Much of the media coverage reports the good news for Tesla: that there has been no product recall issued. But for anyone interested in the responsible regulation of this new technology, the report is a missed opportunity. As new technologies emerge into the world, it is vital for governments to open them up, look at their moving parts and decide how to realise their potential while guarding against their risks. The people selling technology would rather this process – sometimes called ‘technology assessment’ – remained superficial. This is why accidents are so important. They are cracks through which to peer into the reality of technology. When technology doesn’t go according to plan, we can ask why and work on improving it. The NHTSA report contains a few reasons for optimism. It provided data showing how the use of Tesla’s Autopilot has cut accidents by 40%, much to the delight of Elon Musk, Tesla’s Chief Executive: The important thing is that Tesla shared at least some of this data, gathered remotely from its thousands of vehicles, with the regulator. The Tesla Model S is a prolific data generator. The information currently being gathered from the billions of miles driven by its army of early adopters is used to train the algorithms that will, Tesla hopes, eventually allow the cars to become fully self-driving. Data is key to the company’s competitive advantage. The battle over data-sharing will be hard fought by regulators and car companies in years to come. New technologies are often sold with grand, world-changing promises. But when regulators come knocking, the promises get scaled back. What was once sold as radical innovation becomes merely incremental. One technology journalist, referring to Tesla’s claims about self-driving from coast-to-coast by the end of 2017, called Tesla’s Autopilot “a giant leap toward full autonomy”. But when Elon Musk is asked difficult questions, his response has been to say that these are merely ‘baby steps’. The gap between giant leaps and baby steps is filled with hype, much of which the NHTSA has chosen to ignore. The agency instead looked at the individual systems involved – lane centring control, automatic emergency braking and traffic-aware cruise control – and concluded that they worked as designed. People outside Tesla were quick to point out that the name ‘Autopilot’ promised more than it could deliver. Andrew Ng, formerly a machine learning lead at Google, tweeted after an earlier crash. One US consumer group is similarly annoyed by the recent report, arguing that the “NHTSA has wrongly accepted Tesla’s line and blamed the human, rather than the ‘Autopilot’ technology and Tesla’s aggressive marketing… The very name ‘Autopilot’ creates the impression that a Tesla can drive itself. It can’t. Some people who apparently believed Tesla’s hype got killed. Tesla CEO Elon Musk should have been held accountable.” YouTube has countless videos of people who, if they don’t quite believe the hype, are certainly having fun with their new toys. Tesla insist that Autopilot is a ‘hands-on’ driving aid. But the videos suggest that plenty of people, including both Musk and his wife, are going hands-free. The NHTSA report does consider what it called ‘human-machine interface issues’. It notes that the driver, had he been concentrating, would have had seven seconds to react to the truck. It also notes that Autopilot-type systems in cars are known to increase the likelihood distractions lasting this length, because Tesla’s own research has shown this. Smart tech, it seems, makes people dumb. Rather than point the finger at the tech, however, the agency lays the blame squarely on the fleshiest, most vulnerable part of the system, the human being: “Drivers should read all instructions and warnings provided in owner’s manuals for ADAS [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems] technologies and be aware of system limitations.23 While ADAS technologies are continually improving in performance in larger percentages of crash types, a driver should never wait for automatic braking to occur when a collision threat is perceived.” Writing in the 1980s, sociologist Charles Perrow considered why some complex technological systems became safer over time while others seemed to resist improvement. He compared nuclear power stations with air travel. Over the last 50 years, flying has become much, much safer. For nuclear power, accidents have become, according to Perrow, normal. In an update to his ideas after the 2008 financial crisis Perrow commented that financial markets were similarly vulnerable. To blame individual users of technology is to overlook the systemic issues that, with aeroplanes, have forced huge safety improvements. When an aeroplane crashes, regulators’ priority must be to gather data and learn from it. User error should be seen as a function of poorly-designed systems rather than human idiocy. Google have recently decided that hubris is not a good look. They have chosen to stop publicising incidents where humans crash into their self-driving cars, most of which, they previously claimed, were the fault of drivers’ incompetence. They seem to be switching their focus from blaming to learning. Tesla should count themselves extraordinarily lucky that their car swerved right rather than left, killing only its driver rather than a stream of motorists travelling on the opposite carriageway. We may find that, when the first bystander is killed by a car in Autopilot, the courts are less persuaded by companies’ reassurances than regulators have been. In their enthusiasm for self-driving cars, the US government has been extraordinarily permissive. They seem to be overlooking the profound questions introduced by the technologies: What could they mean for the future of cities? Will they increase or decrease car ownership or use? Will they undermine public transport? Will transport systems become more vulnerable to glitches and hacks? These questions go far beyond the lives saved or taken in self-driving car crashes. Investigations of the type run by the NHTSA are opportunities to start this debate. This one has been missed, but another US agency, the National Transport Safety Board, is running a separate investigation, due to report in the spring or early summer. The NTSB more commonly investigates air accidents. Its ruthless attention to detail has been a vital part of making air travel safer. An NTSB spokesperson told CNN when they announced their investigation in July that, “There’s an opportunity to learn from the information about how automation is introduced into American highways.” Let’s hope they seize it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-27T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"10 years on from the Stern report: a low-carbon future is the 'only one available'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/27/10-years-on-from-the-stern-report-a-low-carbon-future-is-the-only-one-available","fields":{"headline":"10 years on from the Stern report: a low-carbon future is the 'only one available'","bodyText":"Clean, green development is the sole route to future global economic growth, according to British economist Lord Nicholas Stern, with a continuation of polluting, high-carbon growth only leading to self-destruction. There is a strong argument that China is now leading the world in action on climate change, Stern said, making the country both a competitor and inspiration for other nations. Stern, speaking ahead of two lectures to mark the 10th anniversary of the highly influential Stern report, said the cost of not acting to halt global warming had risen while the costs of doing so had fallen. The 2006 Stern report, commissioned by the UK government, found that the economic damage caused by unchecked climate change could be 5-20% of global GDP each year, but that cutting carbon emissions would cost just 1% of GDP. The report warned against delaying action, but this has not been heeded, said Stern on Thursday. “We have delayed action,” he said. “The potential damages now look bigger than I suggested then. In that sense I underplayed the consequences of not getting on with it. But the costs of action are a good deal lower than I indicated then, in that technical progress has been faster that we thought. The cost of solar power [for example] is not far off a factor of 10 less than in 2006.” Today, he said, a low-carbon future is the sole option for prosperity. “It is the only one available and it is a very exciting growth story,” Stern said. “Any attempt to follow high-carbon growth will eventually be self destructive due to the very hostile environment it creates. There was an old alleged tension between growth on the one hand and climate responsibility on the other, but it’s a completely fake horse race.” Stern said other drivers of economic growth, such as using interest rates, tax changes and structural reforms, had limited potential. “Sustainable development of infrastructure and cities is the growth story of the future,” he said. “We are winning the arguments intellectually and politically, but it has all been much too slow.” Stern foresees economies in which people travel using efficient self-driving cars, bicycles and walking, homes and businesses are powered by green energy, materials are widely recycled and ultrafast broadband supports home working. “It is a very attractive future if we just put our minds to it,” he said. “Cities where you can’t move and breathe make no sense.” Stern said China could be seen as the leader in climate action today. “You can make a strong case for that,” he said, noting Chinese coal use peaked two years ago. “You have radical change in energy and very big structural change in the economy, moving very strongly towards service sectors and high-tech.” He said a key driver is the threat to China from fossil fuel burning, both in terms of climate change impacts, particularly droughts and floods, and air pollution. “I wish the whole world had known [in 2006] how big an issue air pollution was. We kill millions a year, so delay on that has resulted in probably the deaths of tens of millions of people,” he said. “The double gain – both reducing the risk of climate change and reducing air pollution – is now seen as a very powerful and attractive argument for action. This argument has been particularly strong in its attraction in China, which has probably moved the most in the last 10 years.” Stern said China was also driven by the desire to be the biggest player in the green economy: “If there is a race in green products, China rather fancies itself to do well.” China already leads the world in wind and solar energy installations and also has a major nuclear power programme. “The future of nuclear will be determined in China as it is the only country doing it at scale,” Stern said, suggesting 100-150 new nuclear power plants could be built there in the next 15-20 years. The UK has been a leader on climate change, he said, both in its pioneering domestic laws passed in 2008 and in international negotiations towards the global Paris climate change agreement. “But the UK wobbled in 2015 in terms of support for renewables and that has created some uncertainty,” he said. Since coming to power, the Conservative government has drastically cut or ended subsidies for wind and solar power, leading the UK to fall down league tables ranking national energy sectors and attractiveness for renewable energy investment. Stern said all low-carbon energy technologies, including nuclear, would be needed in the UK but that “solar and wind with storage is particularly promising”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/sep/21/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-point-c-overcomplicated-overpriced-and-overdue","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-21T18:47:25Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Hinkley Point C: overcomplicated, overpriced and overdue | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/21/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-point-c-overcomplicated-overpriced-and-overdue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/21/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-point-c-overcomplicated-overpriced-and-overdue","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Hinkley Point C: overcomplicated, overpriced and overdue","bodyText":"The case for decarbonising power supplies in order to limit climate change is now beyond challenge. The best way of doing it is as contentious as ever. Every option – carbon capture and storage to reduce coal-fired power stations’ emissions, expanding wind and solar power, developing other renewables such as tidal power, cutting consumption and bringing new nuclear capacity on stream – each has its own daunting problems, although some look a lot cheaper to fix than others. In China this morning the chancellor, in his role as prime-minister-in-waiting, dangled yet another carrot in front of nervous investors, promising a further £2bn of credit guarantees for investment in EDF’s new European pressurised reactor at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. Two-thirds of the estimated £24bn cost of building the power station is now covered by government guarantees, even though EDF has agreed a “strike” price – what it will be paid for its electricity – that will make it the most expensive in the world while earning the company, when fully on stream, an estimated annual profit of £5bn. The need for a non-polluting, reliable source of energy has changed attitudes to nuclear power. It is now accepted, at least by some ex-critics, as the least bad option in a world where a fast-growing population and the multiplication of energy-hungry tech devices will hugely increase demand for the foreseeable future. That was why the last Labour government gave the go-ahead to third-generation nuclear power at Hinkley, and why neither the coalition nor this Conservative government imagine cancellation is an option. Yet it is looking more and more like a bum deal. Overpriced, overcomplicated and overdue, as the UK’s three most prominent green converts to nuclear energy, George Monbiot, Mark Lynas and Chris Goodall, argued last Friday when they wrote an open letter calling for the project to be abandoned and for nuclear generation to be concentrated on small modular reactors, cheaper, factory-made and – a bonus – highly suitable for export to developing countries. Hinkley C is expensive because it is very big and very complex. For more than a decade, EDF, the state-owned French energy giant, has been building two similar reactors, one in France and one in Finland, both of which are running late and neither of which has generated so much as a watt of electricity. EDF won the Hinkley contract partly because of the Treasury obsession with not spending public money, but it is struggling to raise the private finance. That is one reason why George Osborne is buttering up the Chinese with potentially costly blandishments. For a while, there was resignation about the project’s cost. It was a price that had to be paid to keep the lights on and the tablets charging. But in the past few years, it has looked less and less like the next generation in clean energy and more and more like a rerun of the Sizewell B debacle, when the government of the day found itself locked into an outdated technology. Meanwhile, renewables are rapidly proving more efficient than predicted – that’s the official explanation for withdrawing subsidies – and their costs are falling. They are still a long way from offering a real alternative to established nuclear power. But the danger is that the cost of making Hinkley C work will have a perverse effect, slowing the development of green alternatives. Germany has been here already. In 2011, Angela Merkel, in the wake of the Fukushima disaster reversed her planned extension of the life of nuclear capacity. Instead, it will be phased out entirely by 2022 (shortly before Hinkley C might finally come online). The move is not cheap, it has led to more reliance on coal, and individual renewable projects provoke strong local opposition. But it has also led to a doubling of energy efficiency. One windy day last July, 80% of Germany electricity came from renewables. As the ad says, Vorsprung durch Technik: forward through technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/13/observer-view-north-korea-donald-trump-united-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-12T23:05:01Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on North Korea and the role of the UN | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/13/observer-view-north-korea-donald-trump-united-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/13/observer-view-north-korea-donald-trump-united-nations","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on North Korea and the role of the UN","bodyText":"Barely a day passes without a reminder of Donald Trump’s unfitness for America’s highest office. The president’s performance during the past week has plumbed new depths of irrationality and ineptitude, even by the low standards he has set since January. Trump’s random, splenetic threats of unlimited military action against North Korea and now, bizarrely, against Venezuela, have exacerbated an already dangerous situation in east Asia. They have raised the real prospect of war, either by design or miscalculation. Trump’s inflammatory statements play into the hands of the despotic regime in Pyongyang, appearing to confirm its longstanding, phoney narrative that the US wants to destroy the country. They are doubly foolish because, for all his bombast, Trump evidently lacks the backing of senior advisers such as Pentagon chief, James Mattis, who says war would be “catastrophic”. Nor does he have support from Congress, the public or America’s allies, for an avoidable conflict aiming at forcible regime change that would inevitably draw in China, Japan, South Korea and possibly other countries, too. Trump’s erratic antics – they cannot be termed a policy – point to a deeper problem. His outbursts, and in particular, his boasts about America’s unmatched military might, give real cause for concern. Perhaps the pressure of the Russia scandal, his record unpopularity, his legislative humiliations, and his constant battles with the media is proving too much to bear. It would not be the first time a world leader has started a foreign conflict to distract from problems at home. Trump stands on one side of the North Korean confrontation. The other side is frightening, too, but for different reasons. The actions of Kim Jong-un’s regime are irresponsible, escalatory and reckless. But in a way, this is no big surprise. It should be plain to all by now that Kim, in power since 2011, is not his father. Where the late Kim Jong-il was cautious and not averse to negotiations with the west, the younger Kim is inexperienced and anxious to make his mark. He is also deeply insecure. He cannot be sure of the loyalty of senior cadres, hence the purges that have marked his tenure. North Koreans continue to suffer the dire economic and human consequences of one-party misgovernment. Only fear, underpinned by a horrific labour-camp system, keeps them in check and Kim in power. And Kim can no longer count on China to watch his back. Beijing is criticised for not doing enough to pressure Pyongyang. But as its agreement to the latest UN sanctions resolution showed, China’s leaders have come a long way in. One scenario Kim reportedly takes very seriously is a Beijing-backed coup that would leave the regime in place but decapitate its leaders, starting with him. The other new element in the equation – the one that triggered Trump’s rhetorical offensive last week – is Pyongyang’s apparent success in building an intercontinental ballistic missile and miniaturised nuclear warheads to go with it. This has confounded experts, who had predicted such a grim development was years away. Its import can and has been exaggerated. The idea that New York or Los Angeles are under imminent threat is fatuous and, perhaps, deliberately self-serving. All the same, the worst fears of successive US leaders have come true: North Korea has joined the global nuclear “club”. And there is no putting this evil genie back in the bottle. Pragmatic recognition of this incontrovertible, albeit regrettable, fact – that North Korea, like the US, is a nuclear power with offensive as well as defensive capabilities – is now the only sensible place from which to start rebuilding an internationally agreed strategy for lasting peace in the Korean peninsula. It is no use Trump and his Fox News chums threatening Armageddon. Peace cannot be attained by military means. Nor is there any point in the US trying to go it alone in terms of sanctions, isolation of the regime and other non-military methods. It simply does not have the power and influence any more. One of the hard lessons of the 21st-century world, which Trump has not begun to grasp but many other Americans are beginning to, is that the US can no longer expect to have things all its own way. China is the key player in the North Korean dispute. Ignore Beijing at your peril. If Trump were to do so, the various unfortunate outcomes could include an escalation of tensions in the South China Sea (there was more evidence of that last week), heightened friction with Japan and South Korea and damaging global trade and financial market strains. The telephone conversation on Friday between Xi Jinping, China’s president, and Trump was significant in this context. Xi called for restraint and emphasised the diplomatic path. If Trump truly wants Beijing’s help in pressurising North Korea, as he says, then he has no rational choice but to heed Xi’s advice. Perhaps he or, more likely, calmer heads in the state department, already have. Unconfirmed reports from New York suggest a back-channel diplomatic route to Pyongyang has been reactivated. If so, this is long overdue. But any renewed talks will get nowhere unless the US drops its unrealistic precondition that North Korea unilaterally abandon its nuclear arsenal. As China says, denuclearisation of the entire peninsula must be the ultimate aim. That means both North Korean and US nukes. The US would also be wise to consider other relevant factors. One is North Korea’s powerful folk memory of American war-making during the (still technically unfinished) 1950-53 Korean War, when more than a million civilians died. Why, they might ask, has Washington never signed a peace treaty? Why does the US still maintain large military bases in South Korea and elsewhere in their region? It is perhaps unsurprising that regime propaganda falls on fertile ground. Given their history, many North Koreans may fear American-led military “liberation” more than repression at the hands of their government. Another under-discussed factor is global nuclear disarmament. In short, this is something the US expects other countries to do but not itself. Like Britain, Russia, France and China, the US has never honoured its legally binding commitment under the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty to work towards the elimination of its nuclear arsenal. Instead, it has enhanced and expanded it. Leaders who did renounce nuclear weapons, such as Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, or who failed to obtain them, such as Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, paid the price. It is unrealistic to demand North Korea do something the world’s great powers, plus non-signatory nuclear states such as India, Pakistan and Israel, refuse to do themselves. Trump should heed Xi’s advice and that of Germany’s Angela Merkel, speaking for Europe, by calling a halt to the name-calling and foolish threats and offering a goodwill token – by cancelling this month’s unnecessarily provocative military exercises. If Trump does not, the grown-ups in Washington must call him to heel. For the sake of all the Korean peoples and the wider world, it is time to end the talk of war and relaunch a process of diplomatic negotiation under UN auspices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2017/jan/31/guardian-weekly-3-february-trump-war-muslims","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-31T16:00:55Z","webTitle":"Inside the 3 February edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/jan/31/guardian-weekly-3-february-trump-war-muslims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/jan/31/guardian-weekly-3-february-trump-war-muslims","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 3 February edition","bodyText":"As I write this, we are 10 days into a Trump presidency that is already like none that has gone before it. At times like these, with world events moving so quickly, it can be difficult to know what to put on the Guardian Weekly’s front page, for fear that events may have been superseded by the time the paper gets out. There are no such concerns this week; David Shariatmadari’s superb analysis of Trump’s war on Muslims perfectly captures the story and background behind last weekend’s travel bans to the United States. As Shariatmadari writes, it’s an apocalyptic view of Islamist terrorism that joins the dots between many of Trump’s appointments, be they military men, rightwing publishers or TV pundits. One senses a long, miserable campaign of attrition awaits. Inside the paper we look back on a scarcely believable first week in Trumpland that saw numerous other controversial executive orders, a visit from the British prime minister and an invitation to meet the Queen (already the subject of numerous UK protests). There’s also a report from rural Michigan, where the consensus seems to be that Trump is doing a phenomenal job.

In Germany, the former European parliament president Martin Schulz is being talked up as a potential challenger to chancellor Angela Merkel later this year. In Myanmar, the assassination of a legal adviser to Aung San Suu Kyi has raised fresh fears of renewed political instability. In Japan, the possible discovery of lost fuel rods at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station has raised hopes that the plant can be safely decommissioned. In another strand of science, a new human-pig hybrid has raised the ethically interesting prospect of growing human organs inside animals for use in transplants.

There are many others","bodyText":"The proposed new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset has turned into the first headache for Theresa May’s government. The issue is now about far more than Britain’s energy policy. It is about foreign policy too. May is yet to say anything publicly about the government’s decision to review the £18bn project. The only official comment was from Greg Clark, the new business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, who welcomed EDF’s approval of the project but added: “The government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.” On the face of it, taking time to review such a controversial project is sensible. After all, there are genuine doubts about whether EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, can build the plant and its European pressurised reactor (EPR) on time, on budget and safely. The National Audit Office has warned that taxpayers could end up paying more than £30bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project. But the role of China has taken centre stage. The China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has a 33% stake in Hinkley, with a gentleman’s agreement that it will go on to build its own nuclear plants in Britain. Last week it emerged that CGN and a consultant to the company have been charged in the US with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material. We now know, thanks to Vince Cable, that May raised security concerns about that while home secretary in the coalition. Her joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote last year that David Cameron’s government was “selling our national security to China”. No one in May’s new government has done much to move people away from the idea that it is concerned about China’s involvement in Hinkley. That is presumably why China’s ambassador to the UK said last week that Beijing’s relationship with the UK was at a “crucial historical juncture”. Britain’s relationship with China, the world’s second-biggest economy, is clearly at risk because of the plant. The fact that the Hinkley saga – which has rumbled on for a decade – is reaching a climax just weeks after Britain voted to leave the European Union adds another ingredient to the mix. Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, says Britain must show that it is open for business and “can’t be too fussy about who we do trade with”. Mandelson’s comments represent the extreme end of one side of the argument, with Timothy’s at the other. Britain must find a way to work with China, a key investor in London Heathrow, Canary Wharf and football clubs. It could also back other key infrastructure projects such as High Speed 2. China has already shown it is keen to invest in Britain, where the legal and regulatory system offer the reassurance of a safe haven for assets. Security, of course, should be a concern. But when Britain agreed to sell British Energy to EDF for £12.5bn in 2008, it became inevitable that foreign investment and expertise would be needed to build new nuclear power stations. The only way, therefore, to develop a home-grown energy policy is to move away from large Hinkley-type projects, either towards forms of renewable energy or towards smaller nuclear power plants, which Rolls-Royce can build. But if the government does decide to scrap Hinkley Point C, the decision should not be about security: it should be because alternatives offer more value, efficiency, and safety. The potential cost to the taxpayer through subsidies to EDF and China, and the question marks about the EPR reactor – there still isn’t one in service anywhere in the world – are more pressing concerns than Chinese involvement. If the government does scrap Hinkley Point C, it must outline the alternative route it intends to take – and then ensure there are no hard feelings in Beijing. Inheritance tax law needs reform The Dukes of Westminster have had almost as much influence on tax law as they have on the garden squares of Mayfair and Belgravia. The £9bn property fortune now passing to a new generation would probably not exist today without a legal environment moulded over time by the very richest families. The second duke, famous for his four wives and a love affair with Coco Chanel, was more cautious with his finances than his personal life might suggest. In 1936 he won a case in which the judge stated that every man was entitled to arrange his affairs so that the tax owing was “less than it otherwise would be”. The ruling has been a thorn in the revenue’s side ever since. The trust structure from which the 25-year-old Hugh Grosvenor and his sisters will benefit dates from his death in 1953. For the Grosvenors, the 40% death duties incurred by normal estates do not apply. Trusts can last for up to 125 years, with wealth flowing freely from one generation to another. Campaigners are calling for the beneficiaries of family trusts to be named on a public register, and for trusts to publish annual accounts, as private companies do. Lobbyists in the thriving wealth management industry argue that opaqueness provides protection. Research suggests as many as a quarter of the beneficiaries are either children or vulnerable adults. A public register would expose individuals who have access to significant sums. But the secrecy arguments are weak. These vulnerable individuals do not control the money from which they benefit – that responsibility lies with competent adult trustees. The latest available data shows the number of trusts registered with the tax office has fallen slowly over time, to 160,500 in the financial year ending in March 2013. But their total annual income has risen to £2bn. The degree to which trusts should be taxed is up for discussion, but the argument for transparency has surely been won. Stop whingeing about apprenticeships Depending on who you listen to, the government’s planned apprenticeship levy is a desperately needed scheme to address Britain’s chronic skills shortage or a badly designed payroll tax that will drive down the quality of training. Both sides were out in force to make their case on Friday when the government confirmed it was launching the levy next April and ignoring the calls from business for a postponement in the wake of the Brexit vote. Just days earlier, Downing Street had faced down calls from corporate lobbyists to slow the implementation of the national living wage. Critics who say that the design of the apprenticeship levy needs tweaking to get the kind of schemes we need may be proven right. But Theresa May’s government is right to press ahead with an April launch. May said last week that she wants to tackle inequality, and creating more routes into secure jobs with good career prospects is a key part of that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
