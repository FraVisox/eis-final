In remarks which may explain why the president later snubbed him, Brown told McBride Obama appeared a \"bit light\" when they met seven months before the 2008 election in the US. The launch of Power Trip, a Decade of Policy, Plots and Spin also received some unexpected publicity when McBride's publisher Iain Dale was filmed in a scuffle with a veteran conference protester by the Brighton seafront. Dale, a former Tory parliamentary candidate who founded Biteback Publishing, grappled with Stuart Holmes as McBride was being interviewed for ITV's Daybreak. Sussex police tweeted: \"Police are seeking to interview a man in connection with an assault on Brighton seafront earlier today.\" A Sussex police spokesman said: \"A male went voluntarily to the police station to assist us with our inquiries.\" Dale challenged Holmes and his dog, who regularly protest against nuclear weapons outside party conferences, before tumbling to the ground in view of the TV cameras. Dale was seen grabbing the protester's backpack and attempting to haul him out of shot as the terrier – festooned with placards reading No Nukes – appeared to bite its owner on the backside. The serialisation of the McBride memoirs in the Daily Mail over the weekend focused on what he has described as his \"shameful\" part in the feuding between Brown and Tony Blair. But the memoir also provides insight into Brown's private thoughts about US leaders. The former prime minister made the comments about Obama after meeting the future president and Hillary Clinton, who were battling for the Democratic nomination, at the British embassy in Washington during a visit to the US in April 2008. He also met John McCain, who by then had won the Republican nomination. Brown went out of his way in public to be scrupulously impartial. But in private he was dismissive of Obama, regarded McCain as \"very ideological\" and praised Clinton for being \"unbelievably sharp, probably more than [her husband] Bill\". McBride quotes Brown as saying: \"Obama – bit light. I don't think he really gets what's happening with the economy; talking about how we need to reform for the future and all this stuff, he doesn't get how serious things are now.\" But Brown was \"stunned\" when Obama visited London three months later in July 2008 – two months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which galvanised his election campaign. McBride writes: \"Gordon was stunned by the transformation. After their private talks about the economy and foreign policy in No 10, Gordon came out saying: 'He's done some bloody homework, that guy; he's on top of it all now, totally gets what's happening. He's really impressive, really impressive.\" Brown's relations with Obama were mixed after he became president. McBride recounts the infamous story of how Brown tried five times to arrange a meeting with Obama on the fringes of the UN general assembly in September 2009, only to be granted a \"snatched conversation\" in a New York kitchen. \"The papers were merciless,\" he writes. The disclosures in the book were overshadowed by the events on the Brighton seafront, which were worthy of an episode of The Thick of It. The usually mild-mannered Dale later said he had been trying to remove the protester from the background of live TV interviews, but the commotion was beamed to the nation on ITV1's Daybreak and posted online by Channel 5. In a blogpost published after the altercation, Dale explained that he had hoped to do \"what any self respecting publisher would do\" and pull the man away from the cameras, but said it had ended in an \"unseemly tumble on the ground\". \"I am someone who runs a mile from any form of physical confrontation normally, but I never understand why broadcasters seem to accept without question that someone with a placard or a loud voice should disrupt this sort of interview,\" he said. \"In some ways I have committed the cardinal sin of becoming the story myself, rather than my author, and I regret that. But do I regret that I stepped in to protect my author? No, I do not. \"Everyone has an inalienable right to protest, but no one has a right to make a continual nuisance of themselves and interrupt interviews like that.\" Dale sought to defuse the situation further by insisting there was \"no real violence\" involved and \"the only injury was when the man's dog bit him on the bum. Anyway, now you can see why my publishing company is called Biteback\". Holmes told the Guardian he would not press charges against Dale, adding: \"Publicity is what is really important to me.\" \"The police asked if I wanted to make a statement, and if they [the police] want to pursue it I will talk to them,\" he said. \"But I'm only interested in getting publicity for my campaign – I can't believe that all political parties are now in favour of nuclear power.\" A spokeswoman for Sussex police said it had been \"made aware of the incident and is looking into the circumstances\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2014/apr/05/miners-strike-books-david-edgar-rereading","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-05T07:45:00Z","webTitle":"The miners' strike: Coal not Dole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/05/miners-strike-books-david-edgar-rereading","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/apr/05/miners-strike-books-david-edgar-rereading","fields":{"headline":"The miners' strike: Coal not Dole","bodyText":"The only major television commemoration of the start of the miners' strike 30 years ago was an hour-long documentary that went out late at night on ITV a few weeks ago. Following the model of earlier anniversary programmes, Stuart Ramsay's The Miners' Strike and Me interviewed a dozen individuals and couples – loyal strikers and their wives, strikebreakers, a couple of policemen – who had been filmed during the strike and could be revisited now. With the exception of one of the policemen, who couldn't condone the violence of his colleagues, all of them defended their actions at the time. For the strikers and wives, they'd do it all again. For one of the strikebreakers, his only regret was that his father has refused to speak to him since he returned to work. The year-long strike was the longest national dispute in British industrial history. It was provoked by the government in order to take revenge for the 1972 and 1974 miners' strikes, which destroyed the Heath government's incomes policy and brought it down. The lack of attention to its anniversary is odd, not least because the conventional story of the strike is now being challenged. Cabinet papers released in January confirm that, as Arthur Scargill claimed, there was indeed a plan to shut down 75 pits, a plan that went way beyond the 20 pits whose announced closure provoked the strike. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is considering an investigation into police fabrication of evidence during the trials that followed battles between police and miners at the Orgreave coke depot in June 1984 (95 cases collapsed a year later). And Guardian journalist Seumas Milne's 1994 book The Enemy Within, which exposed a post-strike media campaign to disgrace Scargill for allegedly using Libyan money donated to the strikers to repay what was in fact an already paid-off mortgage, has been republished, with further damning information. Milne's book also argues persuasively that the secret services were heavily involved both in undermining the strike and seeking to destroy its leadership afterwards. Together, these revelations support much of what was dismissed as Scargillite paranoia at the time. The prevailing contemporary view – revolutionary fantasist leads loyal troops to unnecessary defeat – was expressed in some but not all of the impressive array of books published in the strike's immediate aftermath. Milne was not the first person to use Margaret Thatcher's most noteworthy 1984 soundbite for his title (associating the enemies without in the Falklands with the enemies within in the coalfields). Coal Board chairman Ian McGregor's The Enemies Within was the most obviously polemical study: it condemned not only \"Marxist autocrat\" Scargill but also the \"rampaging mobs\" if not \"stormtroopers\" of South Yorkshire. In Martin Adeney and John Lloyd's The Miners' Strike: Loss Without Limit and the Sunday Times Insight Team's Strike: Thatcher, Scargill and the Miners, a clear distinction was drawn between a flawed leadership strategy and the bravery and commitment of the rank and file miners who followed it. Even veteran Mirror journalist Geoffrey Goodman, whose book The Miners' Strike is dedicated to British miners, argued that the refusal of the leadership to hold a strike ballot eventually finished the strike off. All three books (as well as McGregor's) noted the miners' failure to build relationships with power workers or to effectively picket the power stations. By contrast, the majority of books about and by strikers and their families focused on the effects rather than the causes, anticipating the waves of sympathy for devastated communities that lay behind the success of films such as Billy Elliot, Brassed Off, and, most recently, Bill Morrison's film elegy The Miners' Hymns. In Tony Parker's Red Hill, a prose study of a pseudonymous Northumbrian pit village, the tone was of almost unbearable bleakness: a community visited and vitiated by the inscrutable workings of an alien destiny (\"I don't see what I'm ever going to do with my life\"). By contrast, strikers interviewed in Peter Gibbon and David Steyne's oral history Thurcroft defended the decision not to hold a ballot (\"I don't think you should vote on a man's job\") and tried to think positively about the outcome (\"we gave them a good run for their money\"). Between the journalistic summaries and the interview books lay a number of essay compilations, from a perspective instinctively supportive of the miners, which tackled the most painful and important questions raised by the dispute. In his introduction to Digging Deeper (published during the strike), the book's editor Huw Benyon pointed out that, even in traditionally militant South Wales, most of the lodges were initially reluctant to come out, and only did so as the result of picketing by miners from other parts of the area. In one of the essays, David Howell criticised the Blackadder model of the conflict (Neil Kinnock's oft-quoted claim that Scargill was \"the labour movement's nearest equivalent to a first world war general\"). But the most considered analysis of the strike's meaning was an essay by historian Raphael Samuel in a Ruskin College compilation (The Enemy Within number three, subtitled Pit Villages and the Miners' Strike of 1984-5). Samuel's argument was that, far from being a movement to overthrow the existing order, the strike was a deeply conservative defence \"of the known against the unknown, the local and the familiar against the remote and the gigantesque\". In seeking to protect their communities, the miners were defending precisely those old-fashioned, \"Victorian\" values that Thatcher sought to promote: \"the dignity of work, the sanctity of the family, 'roots'\". In an article on the strike, Jeremy Seabrook made an adjacent point by way of contrast. For him, \"a world in which we are no longer burdened by debt, credit, hock, mortgage, HP, might not be a grievous loss but a deliverance … a more modest and more prudent way of living\". Discussing consumerism and personal debt, Seabrook explains one crucial difference between the miners in the militant areas and those – in Nottinghamshire, for example – who refused to join. The Thurcroft strikers pointed out that the miners who didn't come out, or went back, weren't the poorest, but the ones with most ties precisely to Seabrook's hock and mortgages. But there were in fact two other new developments in 1984-5. One was the emergence of women's support groups, celebrated in several dedicated books (including Here We Go: Women's Memories of the 1984-5) as well as in chapters of most of the others. Provoking rueful and some less rueful reservations from miners themselves (for one \"Red Hill\" miner, this was \"no way to behave\"), Women Against Pit Closures both politicised and emancipated thousands of women from the coalfields, who spread out across the country to campaign for their communities, no longer standing behind their menfolk, but beside them, and in doing so building new and unexpected alliances. Many of these alliances were forged in support groups that emerged in the cities. For Martin Adeney and John Lloyd, the \"new bonds\" forged between city activists and the miners gave a spurious excuse for the left to claim the strike as a victory; for McGregor the groups consisted of \"the whole ragtag mob of the militant left\", jumping on the miners' bandwagon. Noting that at least a dozen books quickly appeared exclusively chronicling support group activities, Samuel observed that the groups \"owed more to a humanitarian spirit of good works than, in any classical trade union sense, solidarity\". Certainly, the main activity of the support groups, fundraising for striking miners and their families, was closer to the impetus of Live Aid (July 1985) than the proletarian solidarity that won the miners their emblematic victory at Birmingham's Saltley Gate in 1972. Food and money were nonetheless vital to keep the strike going and more money was raised for South Wales miners in Oxford than in the Welsh capital. In towns and cities, supporters collected food outside supermarkets, wrapped Christmas presents and – an action by Covent Garden florists – floated hundreds of carnations down the Thames. Support was not, of course, universal: in Digging Deeper, South Wales NUM organiser Kim Howells noted \"friendly Hindu communities in Birmingham\" and \"magnificently supportive farmers in the wilds of Dyfed\", but also hostile steelworkers in Newport and city councillors in Cardiff. As Bea Campbell argued, the strike saw a considerable cultural revolution in the coalfields as well as in the towns. At a Pits and Perverts concert which raised £5,640 at the Electric Ballroom, a South Wales miner told attenders: \"You have worn our badge, Coal not Dole, now we will pin your badge on us.\" Plus there was some real political solidarity going on. The miners allied with the Greenham Common protesters not just because they'd come to terms with \"scruffy lesbians\" (or realised that not all Greenham woman were lesbians, or scruffy, or that it didn't matter if they were), but because they were opposed to nuclear power as well as nuclear arms, and so shared an interest and a cause. Before the strike, women wrote in Here We Go, \"our kids would call black people niggers\"; miners changed their minds when they found themselves experiencing police brutality too. Men were impressed with feminism because they saw it working, and women because they were doing it. In the immediate aftermath of the strike, much of this melted away. Women's groups folded, and miners' wives went back to the kitchens in their thousands. Looking back 30 years, however, the new political forms that arose during the strike year leave a longer shadow. When Communist party organiser Pete Carter called for the NUM to ally with churches, he was derided; now, London Citizens is built on an alliance between left organisations and faith groups. At the end of Ramsay's ITV documentary, Michael Heseltine says of the government's war on the NUM: \"This issue had to be faced, and there was no nice way to do it.\" In combination with the cabinet papers, Milne's Enemy Within demonstrates how nasty the government and sections of the media were prepared to be. By contrast, miners and their supporters were standing up for what former NUM branch delegate David Douglass called \"values of community, of work, solidarity, of looking after each other rather than dog eats dog\". As one of the Thurcroft miners put it, \"in years to come, there might be something to come out of that\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global/2013/jan/28/ian-breach-humanist","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-28T16:35:31Z","webTitle":"Letter: Ian Breach was an inspired humanist celebrant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/jan/28/ian-breach-humanist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2013/jan/28/ian-breach-humanist","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Ian Breach was an inspired humanist celebrant","bodyText":"Ian Breach conducted the funeral service for my wife, Hetty, in Cockermouth, both at the graveside at the natural burial ground and at the wake afterwards.

Windfarms, plus a new generation of nuclear and gas-fired plants, will ensure that the decade up to 2030 will also see enough electricity generated to meet the country's needs, argues Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). There have been endless warnings from energy experts that the phasing out of old coal and nuclear plants risked the lights going out after the middle of this decade as the UK lurches towards less carbon-intensive power sources. Michael Liebreich, chief executive of BNEF, said: \"The blackout plays an iconic role in British history – first with world war II and the blitz, and then the industrial strife of the 1970s. \"The UK is embarking on an historic shift in its electricity supply, and commentators and critics have continually raised the spectre of the lights going out once again across Britain. Our analysis shows that, barring unforeseen circumstances, it is not going to happen.\" The recession and European debt crisis has slashed electricity consumption in Britain by 9% compared with the peaks of 2005 and Bloomberg believes power demand may not return to pre-slump levels for 20 years. But the energy supply/demand picture has partly been changed by a \"dash for gas\", which could see 15GW of new gas-fired power plants coming onstream by 2016 - 11GW of new gas could be built from now through 2016 and 4.5GW has been built in 2010-11. That will easily make up for the 12GW of coal-powered plants being closed down for environmental reasons or nuclear facilities that have reached the end of their natural life. Beyond 2016 Britain will be relying on a huge rise in the number of windfarms coming onstream, both onshore and offshore. Bloomberg analysts believe that the current dash for gas – which is less carbon intensive than coal but still much more polluting than wind – will be the last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2013/jun/13/transparency-india-nikhil-dey","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-13T12:57:39Z","webTitle":"Transparency in India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jun/13/transparency-india-nikhil-dey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/jun/13/transparency-india-nikhil-dey","fields":{"headline":"Transparency in India","bodyText":"Nikhil Dey has a law degree from India's most prestigious university, but you wouldn't guess it from the way he lives his life. The 50-year-old activist makes his home in a mud hut in a tiny village in Rajasthan, in northern India. He earns a salary of about £2 a day, India's minimum wage. The frugal lifestyle makes sense for Dey, who works for an organisation called Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS), which roughly translates as \"the organisation for the environment of workers and peasants\". \"I've had the privilege of being part of an extraordinary story,\" says Dey, who cites India's 2005 enactment of a Right to Information Act as a major achievement for social activism in the country. The law, which has been described as a highly ambitious example of transparency legislation, requires the Indian government to respond within 30 days to any citizen's request for the publication of government information. It also obliges public authorities to \"computerise\" their official documents. The law was passed after more than a decade of campaigning from transparency activists. MKSS was one of the first groups to become involved in the fight. \"It was a local struggle that grew into a national campaign, and a national campaign that grew to become a law, and a law that has contributed in every single day and at every single moment toward sustaining a movement,\" says Dey. Dey played a prominent role in pressuring the government to adopt the act, but insists he can take little credit for its passage. \"It wasn't that the right to information was some great idea that [came from] people like me or my senior colleagues from the English-speaking, university-educated world,\" he says. \"It was ordinary people who were fighting for minimum wages and public works.\" \"Today we travel all over India, and we learn about how creatively the right to information is being used by the most ordinary people against the most powerful of forces,\" Dey says. \"The energy, the power behind it, and the support for it is really amazing.\" Clear thinking What does transparency mean to you? \"It's a concept like truth. To me, it actually has everything to do with power and the balances of power. The right to information actually helps completely break those constant illegitimate concentrations of power. It empowers the person using the right.\" Why is access to information important in development? \"Development is a loaded term. Development for whom? Development by whom? Who decides? Who makes the choice? Unless you have complete free information, unless you have an opportunity to make prior informed choices, unless you have full access to information, you cannot really participate in the development process … [Access to information] allows for more equitable development and access to development for all poor and marginalised people.\" What is the one piece of information you most want released? \"That's not a question that I would like to answer … I don't have a single bit of information [that I would most like to see], because it depends on where I am located.

To recap, world stock markets have hit new five-year highs today, driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep pumping $85bn into the US economy each month until the end of 2013, and perhaps into 2014. This sent many markets higher, including the FTSE 100 which gained 0.5%. The US crude oil price, though, dropped below $100/barrel following reports that inventory levels are higher than expected. In the UK, US hedge funds have won a battle over the future of Co-op Bank, which is being rescued through a new deal between the Co-operative Group and its bondholders. Under the new plan, Co-op Group will own just 30% of its bank. Our closing round-up of the European markets is here..... and here's the lunchtime round-up too. There's also details of the overnight rally in Asia (feels a long time ago now!) Our coverage of the new rescue deal for the Co-operative Bank, in which the Co-op Group will only hold 30% of the company, starts here. The official video statement from the company is covered here And here's some reaction from (unimpressed) customers. Elsewhere: • The Bundesbank has warned that German house prices may have risen too high, and also predicted that the country's economy will keep growing this year. • Italy's unions say they will organise fresh strike action to protest against the 2014 budget • UK energy firm NPower has hit customers with 10.4% price rises, as Britain announces a new deal with EDF for the construction of a £14bn nuclear plant • Jamie Dimon insists he's \"so damn proud\" of JP Morgan, as a $13bn settlement for mis selling sub-prime mortgages looms. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Wall Street remains subdued, with the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 both down around 0.1%. Optimism in New York has been dampened by McDonalds. It warned that sales around the globe will be pretty flat this month, and may not really pick up before the end of 2013. Don Thompson, chief executive, suggested the global economy was tough, saying: While we are focused on strengthening our near-term performance, the current environment continues to pressure results. The FTSE 100 blue-chip share index just posted its eighth daily rise in a row, helping European stock market to shuffle up to their highest levels in more than five years. The FTSE 100 gained 31 points to finish at 6654, up 0.5%, despite Royal Bank of Scotland dropping 5%. The FTSEurofirst 300, which tracks the biggest companies in the region, finished 0.23% higher at 1280.66. That's its highest close since May 2008 - as this graph shows: Germany's DAX closed marginally higher after hitting a new five-year high of its own this afternoon. Spain's IBEX rose 0.3%, Italy's FTSE was flat and the French CAC fell 0.2%. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, commented It has been yet another positive day for the FTSE 100, which is not too surprising given the strong finish by the S&amp;P 500 in the US on Friday, after it closed at another all-time high. RBS was one of the larger blue-chip movers, down 5% on the day as the UK government considers its options – including splitting a part of it off into a 'bad bank'. It feels like a few years since this phrase has been used so today’s weakness could well just be a short-term, knee-jerk reaction until plans are clearer for the bank’s future. There was some caution among traders ahead of Tuesday’s US unemployment numbers. This has been delayed due to the recent government shutdown and is typically one of the more eagerly-awaited economic releases. Sentiment being what is at the moment, any stock market weakness following the release is likely to be seen as a buying opportunity. A good jobs number means the economy is fine; a bad number means the US Federal Reserve is likely to further delay withdrawing support. The net result is that so far shares have seldom stayed down for long as a result of the US unemployment levels. Some Co-operative Bank customers are suggesting they will take their accounts elsewhere after learning that the Co-op Group is losing majority control of the company. The prospect of US hedge funds and City investors holding the bulk of Co-op Bank has disappointed at least a few account holders who were attracted by its reputation for ethics. With the Co-op Group owning just 30% of the 'saved' Bank (see earlier post for details of the deal reached with bondholders), there's already some Twitter chatter about the merits of switching elsewhere. Only a tiny handful of Co-op's customer base, of course. But it must be a worry for a Bank that proudly declares that 90% of customers would recommend them to a friend. US housing sales fell by 1.9% month-on-month in September, as American households absorbed the impact of higher prices and rising mortgage rates. The National Association of Realtors reported that existing homes sales fell to an annual rate of 5.29 million last month compared to August's reading of 5.39 million (revised down from 5.48 million). The amount of homes on the market rose by 1.8% year-on-year in September, the first such rise since early 2011, which also suggests demand dipped a little (after several strong months). European stock markets inched a little higher on the back of the data -- with traders perhaps concluding there's nothing here to encourage the Federal Reserve to ease its stimulus programme sooner than before. It's official, the Co-operative Group is losing majority control of the Co-op Bank after a battle with its bondholders, in a deal that will save the bank from collapse. Co-op Group has released a video message in which Euan Sutherland, group chief executive. announces that it will hold a 30% stake in the Bank once its £1.5bn recapitalisation is achieved. This means success for the two US hedge funds who have been battling to prevent Co-op maintaining majority control of the Bank after it has been recapitalised. As Sutherland put it: I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement in principle which saves Co-operative Bank. The deal means the Co-operative Bank will continue to operate, without having to seek a bailout from taxpayers, Sutherland added. Full details of the deal weren't disclosed, but it's likely that that City investors and its bondholders will own the remaining 70%. Sutherland says that the Group will \"maintain control of the bank, with 30% of the equity\" - which makes it the largest-single shareholder. He also tried to calm fears that the Bank's culture will change once hedge funds get a larger shareholding, insisting that the group will embed \"the co-operative principles in the constitution of the Bank\". As reported this morning (see 9.16am), Co-op Bank's bondholders had pushed back against the Group's original plan, in which it would have provided £1bn of fresh capital while its bondholders provided £500m. Sutherland was looking to the future in his video message, saying that: Most importantly, we have to build a fair and attractive proposal for small investors, the hard-working families across Britain who have invested in the Co-op Bank.

That's what I think about when I wake up everyday. 260,000 people around the world are going a great job for our clients. We're gaining market share. We're doing great stuff. We're trying to get our problems behind us. CNBC reports that Dimon was also asked about the possibility of future criminal charges against JPMorgan, and replied that \"We are going to resolve every matter as best as we can, and then we're going to move on and serve our clients.\" More here: We're gaining market share, we're trying to get our problems behind us: Jamie Dimon Here's our latest story on the issue: JP Morgan close to agreeing $13bn settlement with US authorities Back in the financial markets, and world stocks remain near their highest levels in five years today, despite a somewhat lacklustre session in Europe so far. The MSCI world equity index, measuring stocks around the globe, is up 0.7% today at its highest level since Macy 2008. It was driven by decent gains in Asia overnight, where Australia's index hit a five-year and China's stocks enjoyed their biggest daily rise in two weeks. As explained in the opening post, markets are being driven higher by steady speculation that the Federal Reserve will resist cutting its $85bn/month stimulus programme this year. Many analysts suspect the Fed will not 'taper' the scheme until the consequences of the US shutdown are clear. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 crept a little higher -- helped by decent results from Philips and Akzo Nobel. London's FTSE 100 is up a modest 10 points - with Royal Bank of Scotland's shares down almost 5% as rumour swirl of a good bank/bad bank breakup. Matt Basi of CMC Markets reports that City traders are starting to ponder a festive rally: With high street stores seemingly intent on starting the Christmas shopping period earlier each year, equity traders too seem to be weighing an early start to festivities as we approach ‘santa rally’ season. With many major indices making fresh highs last week and barriers to further upside apparently reduced, the potential for record-breaking gains by year end is strong – though the prospect of another round of political wrangling in the US in early 2014 may be enough to prevent a full bear capitulation… The oil price, though, has fallen today - with a barrel of US crude sliding below the $100 mark for the first time since July 3 this year. That follows reports of production increases, and comes ahead of new (postponed) government oil inventory data later today. Fawad Razaqzada of GFT Global Markets in London said prices could well keep falling: The ample and rising supply of oil, combined with a weaker demand growth prospects, point toward lower prices in the months ahead. There'll be a rush of US data this week, with the delayed publication of various reports that were held up by the US shutdown (including the Non-Farm Payroll report on the jobs market). This means some investors are being cautious, for the moment. Here's Monex Capital Markets's take, ahead of the Wall Street open, in around 15 minutes. With the overdue non-farm payrolls and a busy week for US corporates, Wall Street is certainly set to find some fresh direction. What's more, with the threat of a default having weighed on US equities for most of the month so far, there's arguably some catching up to be done. Ahead of the open we're calling the DOW down 6 at 15394 and the S&amp;P down 2 at 1743. In after hours trade, Nikkei futures are down 19 at 14675. In other Italian news, police in Bologna say they yesterday arrested a former banker who is wanted in the United States over accusations of allegedly helping wealthy US clients to set up Swiss bank accounts. AP has more details: Police said on Monday that when Raoul Weil checked into a hotel Friday evening, authorities were alerted that he is wanted in the U.S. on an international arrest warrant. Weil was indicted in 2008 in Florida on charges that he conspired to defraud the government when he was chief of UBS's wealth management business. Weil's lawyer has said his client is innocent, and that the charges should have been dropped when UBS agreed to turn over clients' names in 2009 to settle allegations it conspired to defraud the U.S. government of taxes. Political tension is rising in Italy again, with the country's major unions agreeing to hold strikes and protests to protest against the country's 2014 budget. The head of the UIL union, Luigi Angeletti, told reporters in Rome that prime minister Enrico Letta had blundered by not making more radical changes in next year's fiscal programme, arguing: Everything stays the same, he shouldn't have done a budget to stabilise the government, he should have done one to stabilise the country. Angeletti was speaking after a meeting with other union heads. The planned protests are not a full-blown general strike. The budget, announced last week, has been badly received across Italy. Many people had hoped for a major cuts to labour taxes, to narrow the gap between the cost of employ workers and what they actually get, along with an easing of austerity. Instead, prime minister Enrico Letta only offered minimal changes, after struggling to get agreement for spending cuts and deciding to comply with EU debt targets (the budget cuts Italy's deficit from 3% this year to 2.5% in 2014). Anger over the budget hit the streets of Rome on Saturday, when thousands of people took part in an anti-austerity protests: Writing in the FT today, Wolfgang Münchau explains how Italy's fragile coalition made it impossible for Letta to cut labour taxes and compete better with Germany: Mr Letta’s Democrats are one of Europe’s last unreformed socialist parties. It supports the prime minister in his determination to stay within the EU-mandated deficit target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But it also opposes the changes needed to free up resources for tax cuts. Meanwhile, Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right People of Liberty party, another member of the coalition, opposes increases in wealth, property and consumption taxes. If one coalition partner vetoes spending cuts, and the other vetoes tax increases, the margin for budgetary manoeuvre is close to zero.

Earlier I blamed uncertainty over its future, with the government poised to say whether it will be broken up. There is another factor, though, as fastFT flags up. With JP Morgan close to a $13bn settlement over the mis selling of mortgage-backed securities, could RBS be facing another penalty? Berenberg analysts reckon it could be $3.7bn. The upshot is that RBS shares have slipped to their lowest level in almost six weeks, -5.2% at 353p, as this graph shows. The Bundesbank's warning that German house prices could be overpriced (see also 11.21am) is online here: Possible overvaluation of residential property in German cities In it, the central bank cites Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf as cities where prices are up to 20% above the level that demographic and economic factors would suggest as reasonable. The Bundesbank suggests that overseas investors are piling into the German property market, seeking higher returns than are possible from government debt. In Germany, renting a home has traditionally been more common than in the UK. That attitude may be changing ,though, as Germans look for a safe place for their savings. As the Bundesbank put it: The belief that the value of one’s assets can be best secured through property ownership was certainly an argument for many households to consider investing in property. Germany's economic recovery will continue through the winter, according to its central bank's latest assessment. The Bundesbank predicted that Europe's largest economy kept growing between July and September, partly thanks to rising orders across the industrial and construction sectors. It said: Economic output should have increased in the summer quarter. and also suggested German consumers will push private consumption higher. The monthly report also flagged up concerns over German house prices (rising by around 4% year-on-year), saying: Price increases have so far concentrated in large cities. Measured by longer-term demographic and economic influence factors, overvaluations could be between 5 and 10 percent In the attractive large cities, the deviations are up to 20 percent. (quotes via Reuters) Wonder what they make of the situation in the UK, with one survey finding London house prices leapt 10% last month alone (driven by hot demand for the priciest residences). The latest assessment of European government finances confirms that deficit levels fell last year, but with stark differences across the region. Eurostat reported that the total national debt of eurozone countries rose from 87.3% of GDP in 2011 to 90.6% of GDP in 2012. The region's annual deficit dropped from 4.2% to 3.7%. Across the wider EU, national debts rose in 2012, from 82.3% to 85.1% of GDP. The updated data also found that Greece's deficit in 2012 was 9%, not 10% as estimated six months ago. Ireland's, though, was 0.6% higher at -8.2% of GDP. Eurostat also reported that: In 2012 the lowest government deficits in percentage of GDP were recorded in Estonia and Sweden (both -0.2%), Luxembourg (-0.6%) and Bulgaria (-0.8%), while Germany (+0.1%) registered a government surplus. Seventeen Member States had deficits higher than 3% of GDP, with the largest registered in Spain (-10.6%), Greece (-9.0%), Ireland (-8.2%), Portugal and Cyprus (both -6.4%). In all, fifteen Member States recorded an improvement in their government balance relative to GDP in 2012 compared with 2011, twelve a worsening and one remained stable. Cyprus finance minister has reportedly told the country's parliament this morning that most of its capital controls could be raised \"before the spring\" next year. Harris Georgiades made the comments as he briefed MPs on next year's budget. He cautioned that people could still be restricted on sending money overseas even if other controls are lifted. Since March, Cypriots have faced stringent restrictions on how much money they could take out of their bank accounts, to prevent a bank run following its bailout. Cyprus's central bank governor also testified, telling MPs that Cyprus's banks face a rise in bad debts as its recession hits firms Reuters has the details: Cyprus's banking sector is expected to show further losses in 2014 as the economy worsens and banks book rising non-performing loans, but the sector is adequately capitalised, the head of its central bank said on Monday. Panicos Demetriades also told lawmakers the island state would see an economic contraction of less than the 8.7 percent forecast by international lenders this year, but that risks were on the downside for 2014. The big news in the energy sector today is that France's EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group, have agreed a £14bn deal to build a new UK nuclear power station at Hinkley, in Somerset. Prime minister David Cameron has declared it was a \"very big day\" for Britain, and suggested Hinkley Point C will be followed by other new reactors. He said: This is about guaranteeing secure and safe long-term supply of electricity for this country,…and creating thousands of jobs. Here's our latest news story on the deal: UK to build new nuclear power station Our Politics liveblogger, Andrew Sparrow, is tracking all the action here: Hinkley Point nuclear power station deal announced: Politics live blog The deal involved a hefty incentive -- the government is agreeing to pay roughly twice today's rate for electricity. Energy editor Terry Macalister writes that Britain is guaranteeing \"decades of guaranteed financial returns\" in exchange for the £14bn of investment. City AM's Allister Heath isn't impressed by the deal: Another day, another energy price hike. This time it's NPower, hitting UK consumers with a 10.4% hike in dual-fuel tariffs. This makes an unpopular hat-trick for the industry, after SSE announced an 8.2% rise and British Gas raised prices by 9.2% (the increases are getting steadily higher). These steep hikes, just as the weather turns colder, has intensified concern over Britain's living standards squeeze (wages continue to lag well behind inflation). The opposition Labour Party continues to pledge to freeze bills for 18 months if it wins the next election, while the government encourages consumers to consider changing tariffs. Tricky if everyone raises their prices.... Over in Greece, local authority workers have announced a three-hour walkout tomorrow to protest against the Athens's government's cuts to the public sector workforce. The strike will coincide with the arrival of a group of school guards in the capital. They began walking from Thessaloniki, 300 miles away, in 28 September to object to being dismissed from their jobs. The protests come as Greece's finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, insists that the government will not swallow any further austerity measures. Stournaras told the Kathimerini newspaper that: We are negotiating hard, as we always do.... However, realism and calm has to prevail on all sides. At a time when markets are starting to trust Greece again, illogical demands can only cause damage. But Athens does appear to be running out of options to fix its financing gap of around €4bn in 2014. Here's the full story. Our banking expert, Jill Treanor, writes that Co-operative Group could lose control of Co-op Bank to its bondholders. She explains what the statement released this morning about the £1.5bn rescue plan really means: After a month of intense talks with two US hedge funds, Co-op Group has conceded that its original plan, which allowed it to keep a majority stake in the bank, needs rethinking. The US hedge funds which own debt in the Co-op Bank have been warning they have enough support to block the original plan, under which the overall group kept a 75% stake in the bank, which was to be listed on the stock market. The Co-op was asking bondholders to take £500bn of losses while the group injected £1bn into the bank. But Aurelius Capital Management, best known for forcing Argentina to pay out on its debts, and Silver Point Capital, linked to distressed groups such as Lehman, had argued that Co-op Group should give them more shares in return for the losses on their bonds. They do not want the Co-op to own as much as 50% of the bank after it floats on the stock market. The Co-operative Group's plan to recapitalise its troubled banking operation appears to have hit problems. In the last few minutes, the Group released a statement on the process, revealing that negotiations with its bondholders over how to inject £1.5bn in fresh capital are continuing. It insisted that the talks remain \"constructive\", but admitted that its original plan -- to float the Bank on the stock market with £1bn of capital from the Group and £500m from bondholders - will change substantially. Here's the key point: The Board of the Group remains committed to delivering a solution that provides both the necessary capital for the Bank, while preserving its ethical focus, and an acceptable outcome for bondholders, including private investors. To this end, we have been engaging with different bondholder constituencies and seeking to balance the requirements and expectations of these parties. We currently expect that many elements of any recapitalisation plan will be materially different to the outline provided on 17 June 2013, whilst still meeting the additional £1.5bn Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement. The news comes as Co-op also admitted that its bill for PPI provisions will be £100m higher than expected. More to follow... World stock markets have nudged a new five-year high this morning. The FTSE All-World equity index crept up to its highest level since January 2008, on the back of Asia's overnight rally where China was the stand-out performer. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 hit a new five-year high too, although the main markets are somewhat mixed. While the FTSE 100 is slightly higher, the German DAX and French CAC are both down 0.2%. The star performer is Philips - up 6% after posting strong profit number. However, the FTSE 100 is being dragged down by the banking sector, with Royal Bank of Scotland tumbling 6% on speculation that the government is about to split it into a good and bad bank. China's stock market just posted its biggest one-day gain since early September, following reports that the Beijing government is urging officials to keep reforming its economy to hit growth targets. Reuters has the story: China's CSI300 share index posted its strongest daily gain in six weeks on Monday, outshining Asian markets after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said there should be \"no slackening\" in implementation of policies that ensure growth targets are met. The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings finished up 1.9% at 2,471.3 points, its biggest gain since September 9. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.6%. Reports in official Chinese media said that Li, at a State Council meeting on Friday, urged officials to keep up the pace of making reforms and reiterated that the policy focus will not change. The market also responded positively to local media reports on Monday that China's securities regulator, over the weekend, said that more steps have been added to the approval process for new initial public listings. Investors took that to suggest that the freeze on IPO approvals since late 2012 will not be lifted by the end of this year . Stock markets are traditionally roller-coaster rides. Now the owner of the Alton Towers Theme park wants to join the fun. Merlin Entertainments has announced plansto float 20% of its business on the stock market, three years after an early IPO was scuppered by the financial crisis. Merlin is Europe's largest operator of visitor attractions, including Madame Tussauds, LEGOLAND, and Chessington World of Adventures. It's owned by a group of private equity firms, who hope to raise £220m to pay down existing debt. The float suggests its advisors see calm times ahead on the markets (always tricky to get an IPO off the ground when shares are dropping faster than the Nemesis) If you're interested, you need to buy at least £1000 of shares. Succeed, and you get money off Merlin annual passes. More fun than just getting a dividend cheque. Official statement here. The Bank of Japan struck a positive tone this morning, raising its rating on all nine of the country's regional economies in a sign that its huge stimulus package was having an effect. The BoJ used the terms \"recovering\" or \"picking up\" for each area, with most now 'recovering moderately', adding; Many regions said employment and salaries are showing signs of improvement amid firm domestic demand and a gradual improvement in factory output. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Stock markets are starting the new week on the front foot, with Australia's main index hitting a new five-year high as Asian markets romp upwards. Having hit their highest levels since 2008 on Friday, equities seem set to climb even higher today. Three factors seem to be driving the rally: • optimism over global economic prospects (after encouraging Chinese GDP data on Friday) • ongoing relief that America's government shutdown is over. • predictions that the disruption it caused means the Federal Reserve will keep its stimulus programme unchecked a while longer, continuing to pump $85bn of new money into the economy each month through bond purchases. As Alpari analyst Craig Erlam put it: A U.S. default has been averted and the disruption caused by these events has almost certainly ensured that the Fed won’t taper until at least December, but probably towards the end of the first quarter of 2014. This pushed Japan's Nikkei up 0.9%, while China's CSI 300 is up 1.7%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed up 0.5% at a five-year high, while New Zealand's benchmarkNZ50 hit a record high. Mind you, America's political problems (let alone the fiscal ones) aren't over, as Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out: Away from the markets, there's plenty afoot today, including the Germany Bundesbank's monthly report (at 11am BST).

The chancellor said that reactors built before 1980 would be taken offline while an urgent review of their safety was carried out. \"Safety has the priority in all our deliberations,\" Merkel declared after she met politicians from affected German states. This latest announcement came just a day after Germany's coalition government announced a three-month delay in its decision to extend the lifespan of Germany's 17 elderly nuclear power stations. German papers mulled over Merkel's dramatic wavering in policy in response to the unfolding disaster at the Fukushima plant in Japan. Critics claim that the chancellor's real reason for switching the stations off is elections in three German federal states – in particular Baden-Württemberg, where Merkel's Christian Democrats are running neck and neck with the centre-left Social Democrats (though an opinion poll on Tuesday put Merkel's CDU party five points ahead). One of the controversial reactors is in the southern state. Elmer Jehn, a columnist writing in Hamburger Morgenpost, said Merkel was guilty of realpolitik. He linked her \"reversal\" on nuclear power to the poll in Baden-Württemberg on 27 March, writing: \"Since Japan, every sensible person knows that nuclear energy is dead.\" Unsurprisingly, the catastrophe in Japan dominates newspapers' front pages. The tabloid Bild reprints a full-page photograph of Fukushima's reactor No 3 going up in smoke, just above an image of an embattled Merkel. The headline says: \"Here the next nuclear reactor explodes … and here Angela Merkel announces an atomic U-turn.\" Bild notes that German firms are now selling a record number of Geiger counters, which can cost up to €500 (about £450) each. There are a few other stories of note. The daily Süddeutsche Zeitung always has good science pages, and reports on Tuesday two interesting developments. First, bees have been dying out: Europe's bee population has fallen 10-30%, while the numbers in the Middle East have dropped by 85%. Parasites, pesticides, and destroyed habitats are blamed for the reduction. The paper also reports that Neanderthals, thought to have sprung from what is now modern-day Germany, mastered fire much earlier than thought. They were lighting fires and cooking stew 400,000 years ago, an article says. Amid the gloom there is at least some good news for one dog owner. On Monday the paper Bild reported that punks had been stealing dogs from the streets of Hamburg, including Nina Schmidt's hound, Joker. On Tuesday the punks left Joker at a police station. \"He's dog-tired, sleeps all day, but is otherwise healthy,\" Nina said, after being reunited with him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/17/clegg-school-meals-tory-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-17T20:15:05Z","webTitle":"Free school meals for infants 'was price for Lib Dem support of Tory tax plan'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/17/clegg-school-meals-tory-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/17/clegg-school-meals-tory-deal","fields":{"headline":"Free school meals for infants 'was price for Lib Dem support of Tory tax plan'","bodyText":"Every child at infant school in England will receive free lunches from next September, Nick Clegg will announce on Wednesday in a £1.2bn coalition deal that will allow the Tories to introduce a marriage tax allowance by the end of the year. As the Liberal Democrats step up their campaign to draw up sharp differences with their coalition partners, the deputy prime minister will contrast his support for free school meals with Tory demands for the marriage tax allowance. In his closing speech to the Lib Dem conference, after winning a series of crunch votes, a newly emboldened Clegg will make clear that the £600m-a-year scheme was the price he had demanded to support David Cameron's tax scheme. George Osborne will announce plans for the marriage tax allowance, which will cost a similar sum, in his autumn statement this year. The Lib Dems will abide by their commitment in the coalition agreement to abstain in a Commons vote introducing the allowance, allowing it to pass. The deputy prime minister will contrast the values of the Lib Dems – who pressed for the provision of free school meals for an extra 1.5 million children – with those of the Tories. Hailing the scheme, which will save parents £437 a year and reintroduce the concept of universal benefits at a time of austerity, Clegg will say: \"The Conservatives have made it clear that their priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples – a tax break for some, funded through the taxes of others. That tells you everything you need to know about their values. \"We, however, will help all families in these tough times – not just the kind we like best – by helping their young children get the best possible start in life. And that tells you everything about ours.\" The announcement was the result of a direct deal between Cameron and Clegg. The Tories were interested in the idea of free school meals, which were suggested in the School Food Plan commissioned by Michael Gove. But the extra spending was not a priority for Cameron, who announced in summer that the marriage tax allowance would be introduced this year. A senior Lib Dem source said: \"They want to spend roughly the same amount on the marriage tax. We want to spend it on this. It is a straight-up-and-down deal.\" The Lib Dem move means that an extra 1.5 million children aged between five and seven will be entitled to free school meals. This will take to 1.9 million the number of infant school pupils eligible for the meals – 400,000 children, whose parents are on low incomes, already qualify. Clegg's decision to highlight the nature of coalition deals – and what they say about the contrasting values of the two parties – shows how he is determined to highlight Lib Dem achievements and to draw dividing lines with the Tories. He will deliver his fourth conference speech as deputy prime minister after a week in Glasgow in which he saw off challenges from the left on tax policy, Trident, deficit reduction and nuclear power. Ministers joked about their one \"loss\" – the vote denouncing the bedroom tax. \"We didn't make much of an effort on that one for obvious reason because most of us agreed with the motion,\" one said. Clegg will argue he is determined to stake out the middle ground of British politics – and to remain neutral over the Lib Dems' choice of coalition partner – when he depicts the party's role as a restraining influence on the two main parties. In a sign that he is keener than ever to stay on in government after the election, he will say: \"The country is finally emerging from the biggest economic crisis in living memory. The absolute worse thing to do would be to give the keys to No 10 to a single-party government – Labour or the Conservatives … Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery. Only the Liberal Democrats can finish the job and finish it in a way that is fair.\" Clegg, who will give a personal account of his privileged background and of his family's role in turbulent twentieth century continental Europe, will declare that the Lib Dems are \"not some subset\" of the larger parties and will say: \"We're no one's little brother.\" Clegg regards the free school meals announcement as one of the most significant since he entered government. In their School Food Plan this year the Leon Restaurants founders, Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent, supported universal free school meals for primary school children after citing research finding that it had educational benefits in addition to nutritional advantages. The study under the last government in three boroughs, Durham, Newham and Wolverhampton, found academic benefits that outstripped those from the introduction of the literacy hour. The Clegg proposal received widespread praise from children's groups and teaching unions. But two rightwing thinktanks, the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Centre for Policy Studies, criticised it. Ryan Bourne, of the CPS, said: \"There was me thinking we had huge public borrowing. The poorest children are already eligible for free school meals – the main beneficiaries of this new universal benefit will be middle and upper income households, who really don't need a public subsidy. I thought that with the huge deficit, ageing population and productivity pressures in the public sector, it was becoming acknowledged that universal benefits were unsustainable.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2016/jan/06/north-korea-major-announcement-artificial-earthquake-nuclear-test-site-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-06T13:58:45Z","webTitle":"North Korea nuclear H-bomb test claims provoke scepticism and condemnation – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jan/06/north-korea-major-announcement-artificial-earthquake-nuclear-test-site-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2016/jan/06/north-korea-major-announcement-artificial-earthquake-nuclear-test-site-live","fields":{"headline":"North Korea nuclear H-bomb test claims provoke scepticism and condemnation – as it happened","bodyText":"Julian Borger, and Justin McCurry report increasing scepticism about North Korea’s claims in the Guardian’s latest wrap up all the key developments. With that we’re going to bring this blog to a close, but there will be more reports and all the latest on the UN security council meeting on the North Korea section of the Guardian’s site. US Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has used the test to criticise Barack Obama’s “failed” foreign policy, Reuters reports. “If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy,” Rubio, said in a statement. “I have been warning throughout this campaign that North Korea is run by a lunatic who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama has stood idly by,” Rubio said. Rubio said Obama should “stand up to people like Kim” but did not elaborate. Of all the international statements denouncing North Korea’s move, China’s is the most significant, writes Simon Tisdall. Beijing formally protested, expressed concern over radioactive fallout in areas bordering North Korea, and indicated it would support new, punitive UN security council action as demanded by South Korea, among others. Maybe Beijing’s undisguised wrath will give Kim Jong-un pause. But maybe not. In a deliberate poke in the eye for China’s leaders, he failed to inform them of the test in advance. Kim has refused to rejoin the Chinese-led six-party nuclear talks. In September, he snubbed President Xi Jinping’s invitation to attend celebrations marking the end of the second world war. In fact, Kim has never visited his Chinese ally A visit to Pyongyang last October by Liu Yunshan, a senior Chinese party official, suggested relations were warming up. Now Kim has slammed the door again. In truth, China has less leverage over Pyongyang, both politically and in terms of trade and oil supplies, than is commonly believed. So perhaps the boyish Kim, self-styled “Supreme Leader”, does not really care what “Big Daddy” Xi wants. Or perhaps – a more alarming thought – Kim does not know what he is doing. Conventional diplomatic wisdom suggests China will not break with North Korea’s regime for fear of internal collapse, a refugee crisis, and a US-South Korean takeover. But there is more than one way to skin a cat. Tough bilateral Chinese sanctions in addition to UN measures are one option, plus a halt to Chinese aid, investment and joint projects. If China does not act, it is unclear who will. AP mops up more reaction: Melissa Hanham, senior researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterrey, California, said: “I’m pretty skeptical. ... The seismic data indicates it would be very small for a hydrogen test. It would be very, very remarkable if they had achieved it already. ... It seems just too soon to have this big technical achievement. But North Korea has always defied expectations.” Song Chol, a resident of Pyongyang, said: “The United States is the aggressor with all kinds of nuclear weapons, waiting to invade our country, so having a hydrogen bomb is the right thing, the legitimate right of a sovereign state, which nobody can complain about. It would be stupid to put down your gun as you are faced by fierce wolves rushing at you.” Hazel Smith, director of the International Institute of Korean Studies at Britain’s University of Central Lancashire, said: “The North Koreans are not led by diplomatic strategy anymore. They are led by a view that the military is what allows the regime to survive ... You have a group of (ruling) families who don’t want to see their power go, who don’t want to end up in (the International Criminal Court in) The Hague. “Every nuclear test that they’ve had has caused massive consternation in China. But the North Koreans have never been susceptible to letting China tell them what to do.”_ Lassin Zerbo, executive secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, said: “I sincerely hope that this will serve as the final wake-up call to the international community to outlaw all nuclear testing.” John Delury, a professor at Seoul’s Yonsei University said North Korea’s powerful military and nuclear weapons bureaucracies “are continuously looking for ways to improve their programs,” Delury said. “I figure they are constantly asking to test.”He said that since “there’s not much in play” with North Korea diplomatically with the US, South Korea or even China, leader Kim Jong Un “takes a little bit of a blow” with the test while gaining international attention and placating powerful officials in his regime. China’s Xinhua news agency has video footage of children and staff evacuating a school in an area close to North Korea’s border after tremors from the test. Trying to figure out North Korean motivations is difficult as the regime is so opaque, but the New York Times gives it a go in a comprehensive q&amp;a. In the past, United States administrations and South Korean governments managed to tamp down periodic heightened tensions with North Korea by offering concessions, including much-needed aid, in return for the North’s promising to end its nuclear weapons programs. Many analysts believe that North Korea is again seeking aid and other concessions, while some suggest that it merely wants to be recognized as a nuclear state, like Pakistan. Still others suggest that the North genuinely fears an attack by the United States or South Korea and views the warnings as deterrence. Highlighting a perceived threat from abroad is also a favorite tool the North Korean government uses to ensure internal cohesion in an impoverished country that has experienced enormous privation, including devastating famine and continuing pervasive hunger. North Korea’s nuclear program and its repeated nuclear tests are serious threats to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, according to Germany’s foreign ministry Frank-Walter Steinmeier. In his statement of condemnation he said: North Korea is against the principles of the international community and threatens the regional and international security. We urge North Korea to refrain, to behave according to the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and return to the negotiating table. Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, called for a resumption of the stop-start six-party talks aimed at terminating North Korea’s nuclear programme. Involving China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the US, they began in 2003, but have been moribund since 2009. Angela Stanzel, a policy fellow in the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, summed up the state of the talks in this piece for Al Jazeera. Time and again, the talks stopped and were relaunched, until eventually collapsing completely in 2009, after a North Korean satellite launch prompted the UN security council to expand sanctions on North Korean firms. Ever since, China has been attempting to reconvene the talks but has failed as the other parties (mainly the US) do not wish to resume negotiations without imposing preconditions on North Korea. When Kim Jong-un succeeded his father Kim Jong-il in December 2011, hopes rose again that the son would be more willing to re-engage in negotiations. Those who had this hope were disappointed soon. In December, 38 North, a US research institute that tracks North Korea, reported that a new tunnel was being excavated at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. 38 North said - presciently as it turned out - that the new tunnel gave North Korea increased capability to conduct additional explosions. Recent commercial satellite imagery indicates that North Korea is excavating a new tunnel for nuclear testing at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. This tunnel is in a new area of the site in addition to the three others where the North has either conducted nuclear tests or excavated tunnels in the past. While there are no indications that a nuclear test is imminent, the new tunnel adds to North Korea’s ability to conduct additional detonations at Punggye-ri over the coming years if it chooses to do so. Nato says the test undermines regional and international security. In a statement secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said: The nuclear weapons test announced by North Korea undermines regional and international security, and is in clear breach of UN Security Council resolutions. I condemn the continued development by North Korea of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes and its inflammatory and threatening rhetoric. I call on North Korea to fully respect its international obligations and commitments. North Korea should abandon nuclear weapons and existing nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and engage in credible and authentic talks on denuclearisation. Hilary Benn, who survived Labour’s reshuffle as shadow foreign secretary, has added his voice to the stream of condemnation. In a statement he said: “If verified, the nuclear test carried out by North Korea represents a clear violation of numerous UN Security Council Resolutions and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms. “The country’s nuclear programme poses a grave threat to international peace and security and does nothing to improve the prospects of the people of North Korea, who continue to pay the price for the country’s misguided policies. “I call on the North Korean government to recognise its commitments under international law, and urge it and the international community to reinvigorate efforts towards the goal of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, ideally through the resumption of the Six Party Talks.” Here’s a round up of where things currently stand: North Korea claims it has successfully detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb. The underground test took place on Wednesday at 10am local time (1.30am GMT/Wednesday 12.30pm AEDT/Tuesday 6.30pm ET) at a known nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, in the east of the country. Pyongyang said the test and was “self-defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weapons”. In a TV announcement it also said the test went “perfectly”. If true, this would be North Korea’s fourth nuclear test, and its first using a hydrogen bomb, significantly more powerful than an atomic bomb. There has been no independent verification of North Korea’s claims. An artificial earthquake of magnitude 5.1 was detected close to Punggye-ri. The UN organisation monitoring the world for signs of nuclear testing confirmed it had detected “an unusual event in the Korean peninsula”, but some experts have cautioned that claims of a hydrogen bomb could be exaggerated. The UN security council is expected to meet in New York on Wednesday 11am ET (4pm GMT) to discuss the North Korean claims. Russia and China have joined the international chorus of countries condemning the test. China, once seen as an ally of North Korea, said it “firmly” opposed the test. It also said it was given no warning. There has also been widespread scepticism of Pyongyang’s claims about the test. The White House said it could not yet confirm the test, but reiterated that the US “will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state”. South Korea and Japan have condemned news of the test, labelling it a threat to their security. Statements of concern have also been issued by the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Australia’s foreign minister Julie Bishop said her country “condemns in the strongest possible terms the provocative and dangerous behaviour of the North Korean regime”. The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said any test would be a “grave breach” of UN resolutions and “a provocation which I condemn without reservation”. Sweden’s former prime minister, Carl Bildt, encapsulates the international response in single tweet by condemning North Korea’s test while expressing doubts about its claims. The test can be seen as snub to China and sign of Beijing’s waning influence over North Korea, analysts have told the Washington Post. “In a way, this is a protest against Beijing,” said Bo Zhiyue, director of the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre at the Victoria University of Wellington. “They are saying: ‘we can do whatever we want. This shows our independence and we don’t need your approval.’” ... No one is expecting a complete breakdown in Sino-North Korean ties, nor are they expecting Pyongyang to abandon a nuclear program that has become a key pillar of its regime’s declared legitimacy, at least not in the foreseeable future. “Beijing will face increased pressure both domestically and internationally to punish and rein in Kim Jong Un and to ultimately force Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons,” said Yanmei Xie, senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group in Beijing. “But there is likely to be a repeat of the worn playbook of denunciation, tightening of sanctions, and calling for resurrection of the six party talks.” Nuclear experts have questioned whether the size of the blast was large enough to have been from a hydrogen bomb test, the BBC reports. Bruce Bennett, an analyst with the Rand Corporation, was among those casting doubts on Pyongyang’s test: “The bang they should have gotten would have been ten times greater than what they’re claiming. “So Kim Jong-un is either lying, saying they did a hydrogen test when they didn’t, they just used a little bit more efficient fission weapon - or the hydrogen part of the test really didn’t work very well or the fission part didn’t work very well.” A South Korean politician, Lee Cheol-woo, said he was briefed by the country’s intelligence agency that the blast “probably falls short” of a hydrogen detonation. Sanctions and resolutions will not stop North Korean engineers from working hard to build bigger and better weapons, warns Andrei Lankov. More likely, in the next few weeks we will see a repeat of the same cycle we have seen so many times over the last 10 years. The UN security council will have an urgent meeting that will introduce sanctions targeting North Korea. Such sanctions will allow politicians to explain to their voters that they are punishing a rogue regime in all ways imaginable – for instance, depriving the leadership of Hennessey cognac and Godiva chocolate. Credulous voters will agree and feel placated, but in actuality, such measures will make little if any difference. Even if sanctions were to inflict damage on the North Korean economy – which has exceptionally low dependence on foreign trade – the only victims will be common North Koreans, who will just suffer more. Of course, the top leadership might lose access to champagne, but in their eyes, this is a small price to pay for escaping the fates of Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein. We seem to be caught in a cul-de-sac ... Nothing good about this situation is in sight, but seemingly there’s nothing to be done. Japan’s defence ministry has deployed three T4 training planes to collect possible radioactive material in the air following North Korea’s claimed hydrogen bomb test, AFP reports citing officials “To understand the impact of possible radioactive materials released by the test, Air Self-Defence Force planes have collected dust in the air,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the government’s top spokesman, told a press conference. “It is currently being sent to the Japan Chemical Analysis Center,” he said. Suga added that the planes flew in Japanese airspace, while the Sankei Shimbun daily reported that the aircrafts took off from three separate bases in different parts of the country. The cabinet secretary also said no abnormal levels of radiation have so far been detected through monitoring posts installed across Japan as of 4:45 pm Wednesday (0745 GMT). The results collected by the planes are expected to be released on Thursday, an official with Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority told reporters. The FT’s Seoul correspondent, Simon Mundy, says North Korea’s claimed status as a nuclear power “has become a major domestic propaganda trope in recent years.” In a video primer on the test he suggests Pyongyang will see it as a “useful asset for a regime that has precious few economic achievement to boast of”. Koryo Tours, who have been taking western tourists to North Korea since 1992, said it does not epect the nuclear test to affect any of their upcoming tours, writes Maeve Shearlaw. The company’s general manager Simon Cockrell is due to travel to Pyongyang tomorrow and Vicky Mohieddeen, who got back from New Year’s Eve tour yesterday, described everything in the country as normal: “We had 54 tourists from all over the world in Pyongyang seeing in 2016 on a boat on the Taedong River” “The only things that have caused tours to be cancelled in the last few years have been Sars in 2003, and Ebola in 2014-2015. The nuclear tests previously haven’t had any effect on tourism” says Cockrell. He described the people who sign up to their tours as “safety-aware” and said this “extends to knowing the difference between an underground nuclear test in a remote area, and being in normal tourist areas above ground – a test is not the same as the actual danger from nuclear weapons.” Koryo’s next tour is scheduled for 11 January. Russia has joined the international chorus of condemnation of North Korea’s test. “Such actions are fraught with further aggravation of the situation on the Korean peninsula, which is anyway marked by very high potential of military and political confrontation,” said Russia foreign ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova. Japan’s government said the test was a “grave threat to Japan” but appealed to the Japanese public to remain calm. Here’s video of Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond’s statement on the test. The International Atomic Energy Agency said if confirmed the test is clear violation of UN resolutions. In a statement its director general, Yukiya Amano, said the agency remains ready to resume nuclear verification in North Korea. He said: The DPRK’s nuclear test, if confirmed, is in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions and is deeply regrettable. I strongly urge the DPRK to implement fully all relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the IAEA. The IAEA remains ready to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue by resuming its nuclear verification activities in the DPRK once a political agreement is reached among countries concerned. Justin McCurry in Tokyo and Michael Safi in Sydney wrap up the key developments and reaction to the test. The European Union’s high representative on foreign affairs has added her voice to those condemning the test. In a statement, Federica Mogherini said: If confirmed, this action would represent a grave violation of the DPRK’s international obligations not to produce or test nuclear weapons, as determined by several United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and a threat to the peace and security of the entire North East Asia region. I call on the DPRK to re-engage in a credible and meaningful dialogue with the international community, in particular in the framework of the Six-Party Talks, and to cease this illegal and dangerous behaviour. I will speak this morning with the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea Yun Byung-se and the Foreign Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida to discuss the way forward. We will work with the UN Security Council, which will meet later today in urgent session to address this issue. China’s news agency Xinhua has more on Beijing’s opposition to the test. China “firmly” opposes the latest nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), according to a statement on Wednesday from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The ministry made the statement after the DPRK announced Wednesday that it has successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test. “China is steadfast in its position that the Korean Peninsula should be denuclearized and nuclear proliferation be prevented to maintain peace and stability in Northeast Asia,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced at a press briefing. “We strongly urge the DPRK to honor its commitment to denuclearization, and to cease any action that may deteriorate the situation,” Hua said. This timeline shows the key developments in North Korea’s nuclear programme since it started operations on a nuclear reactor in 1986. North Koreans gathered in a square in Pyongyang to watch state television announcements of the successful miniaturised hydrogen bomb detonation. Reuters video shows many reacting to the news with smiles and applause. Maeve Shearlaw rounds up reaction from some of the most clued-up North Korea watchers. Although North Korea’s state media website KCNA appeared to creaking under the pressure: As for the timing, perhaps Kim was treating himself to an early gift? Human Rights Watch has put out a strongly worded statement condemning the test and picking out that it comes on the eve of Kim Jong-un’s birthday. Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said: “Kim Jong-un may think it appropriate to celebrate his birthday early with a nuclear test, but even a hydrogen bomb should not cause the world to forget that the Kim family’s hereditary dictatorship is built on the systematic brutalization and abuse of the North Korean people. The only birthday present that Kim Jong-Un should get from the international community is a one way trip to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, where he should be put on trial for crimes against humanity.” Chosen Exchange, which runs regular business workshops in North Korea, said the test and the likely sanctions to follow, will disrupt trilateral corporation between South Korea, Russia and China. It will probably mean business as usual, with new sanctions creating a slightly more inconvenient environment, but with Koreans and their Chinese (and other) partners finding ways to evade enforcement. The most significant effect may well be the death of potential North Korea-Russia-South Korea cooperation on major economic development projects. Certainly, new UN sanctions seem inevitable, designating more companies, individuals and industries as out of bounds, while also reaffirming everybody’s frustrations. As usual, China will be the pivot. Beijing has shown a willingness to pass resolutions after each nuclear test, but has been less interested in enforcement than Washington would like it to be. How much pressure can the US apply to have China tighten up on transactions and trade of sensitive or luxury goods? China is frustrated with the DPRK’s nuclear program, for sure, but they still want to see Pyongyang experiment with economic policy and integrate its economy with the Chinese northeast. Residents on China’s border with North Korea have been evacuated from buildings after feeling tremors from the nuclear test, AFP reports citing state media. People near the frontier with North Korea “clearly felt tremors” on Wednesday morning when Pyongyang said it detonated a hydrogen bomb, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) said on a verified social media account. The areas on the border included Yanji, Hunchun and Changbai in Jilin province, it added - some of the counties closest to the North’s nuclear test site. Residents in Yanji saw desks and chairs shake for several seconds and some companies evacuated employees from their offices, CCTV said. Students at a senior high school were dismissed during an examination after its recreation grounds cracked, it added. China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said authorities were evaluating the environmental impact of the nuclear test, adding currently the radiation level in the area was “normal”. Environmental officials’ monitoring showed indicators within normal ranges, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing, so that “so far the nuclear tests have had no impact on the public and health”. Here’s video of China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman denouncing North Korea’s test. She also urged Japan to “stop deteriorating the situation”, according to a translator on CCTV. China knew nothing about the North Korea’s nuclear test before it was announced, according to foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. In comments on the foreign ministry website, China also urged North Korea to honour its commitment to denuclearisation and called on Pyongyang to stop taking any action that could cause a deterioration of the situation on the Korean peninsula. An image purporting to show Kim Jong-un’s hand-written text ordering the nuclear test has been published by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency and republished by the China’s People’s Daily. Here’s a clip of North Korea’s state-owned broadcaster announcing the test. The broadcast from Pyongyang includes images of former North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, as well as newsreel footage of scientists working at a nuclear facility. Britain’s foreign office has issued a statement from Philip Hammond accusing North Korea of a “grave breach” of UN resolution. In a addition to his remarks to journalists (see earlier) the foreign secretary said: “If a nuclear device has been detonated by North Korea, this is a grave breach of UN security council resolutions and a provocation which I condemn without reservation. “It underlines the very real threat that North Korea represents to regional and international security. “We will be working with other UN Security Council members to ensure the international community responds urgently and decisively to this latest activity.” “I have discussed this matter today in Beijing with my Chinese counterpart, State Councillor Yang Jiechi, and we have agreed to work with other members of the UN Security Council towards a robust international response.” The UK’s former ambassador to North Korea has described the nuclear test as “deeply worrying” and warned that Pyongyang could launch a nuclear strike. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme John Everard, said: “Anything that produces a seismic shock of 5.1 is dangerous ... an explosion of that size is quite enough to wipe out a city, and that of course is deeply worrying.” Everard warned that Pyongyang’s leaders believed they could survive a nuclear counterstrike by sheltering in tunnels. He said: “North Korea has a defensive tunnel system that makes the Tora Bora look like a child’s play pen in comparison. If they believe they can hide away in their tunnels and survive a nuclear counterstrike, the possibility that they could launch a nuclear first strike remains.” Asked whether he believed that North Korea would seriously considered a nuclear strike, Everard said: “Yes, because the North Koreans have a deep sense of victimhood – that they are aggrieved by the international community. They also have a warrior tradition which would mean that they would probably prefer to go down fighting rather than be absorbed by South Korea.” Everard also claimed that relations between China and North Korea have become so strained over nuclear weapons that Beijing could side with the international community in condemning the test. “It looks like the China/North Korea love in has soured very quickly. The Chinese have said they will cooperate with the international community in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and I have a hunch, that when the UN security council meets later today that, we will see a rather different Chinese attitude from the one that we seen in the past.” North Korea claims it has successfully detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb. The underground test took place on Wednesday at 10am local time (1.30am GMT/Wednesday 12.30pm AEDT/Tuesday 6.30pm ET) at a known nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, in the east of the country. An announcement on state television claimed the test “worked perfectly” and was “self-defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weapons”. If true, this would be North Korea’s fourth nuclear test, and its first using a hydrogen bomb, significantly more powerful than an atomic bomb. There has been no independent verification of North Korea’s claims. An artificial earthquake of magnitude 5.1 was detected close to Punggye-ri.

The UN security council is expected to meet in New York on Wednesday 11am ET (4pm GMT) to discuss the North Korean claims. The White House said it could not yet confirm the test, but reiterated that the US “will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state”. South Korea and Japan have condemned news of the test, labelling it a threat to their security. China has yet to respond officially but an editorial from Xinhua, the official news agency, warned: Any act that disrupts stability in north-eastern Asia is undesirable and unwise. Australia’s foreign minister Julie Bishop said her country “condemns in the strongest possible terms the provocative and dangerous behaviour of the North Korean regime”. The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said any test would be a “grave breach” of UN resolutions and “a provocation which I condemn without reservation”. Hammond told reporters in Beijing: So far as I think any of us can tell, there is no reason to doubt what the North Koreans are claiming: that they have carried out a test detonation of an H-bomb. This isn’t particularly easy to read, and we’re working on a more legible transcript, but here is the full version of the North Korean state TV broadcast announcing the test: We’re expecting official reaction from Beijing soon. Meanwhile, Xinhua, the official news agency, has published a Chinese-language editorial on the test. Christy Yao in our Beijing bureau has translated some of the key lines: The test of a nuclear bomb by North Korea runs counter to the relevant UN resolutions and the internationally-backed Korean peninsula denuclearisation efforts. It is not good for anyone for there not to be peace on the Korean peninsula. Any act that disrupts stability in north-eastern Asia is undesirable and unwise. All relevant parties should refrain from unilateral steps that are detrimental to regional peace and stability. Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, has just sat down with a small group of foreign correspondents in Beijing, where he is on an official visit. Here’s what he had to say on North Korea: We are anticipating that there will be an emergency session of the UN security council in New York later today, when both countries [UK and China] will condemn – along with, I expect, everybody else in the world except perhaps for one or two mavericks – any nuclear test carried out by the DPRK. I think I can say that Britain and China are pretty much completely aligned on North Korean nuclear. We both strongly oppose the acquisition or testing of nuclear weapons by North Korea and we both want to see a resumption of the six-party talks. So far as I think any of us can tell, there is no reason to doubt what the North Koreans are claiming: that they have carried out a test detonation of an H-bomb. It is clearly very bad news for the non-proliferation agenda generally and for security in the East China Sea region specifically. France has now condemned the nuclear test and has called for a “strong reaction from the international community”, president François Hollande’s office said in a statement. The statement said the claims of a hydrogen bomb detonation were “an unacceptable violation of [UN] security council resolutions”. South Korea President Park Geun-Hye called the test a “grave provocation” at an emergency meeting of the country’s national security council. “The test is not only a grave provocation to our national security but also a threat to our future … and a strong challenge to international peace and stability,” she said, calling for strong sanctions on Pyongyang. In an earlier statement, Seoul said it would “take all necessary measures including additional sanctions by the UN security council … so that the North will pay the price for the nuclear test”. Japan “The nuclear test that was carried out by North Korea is a serious threat to the safety of our nation and we absolutely cannot tolerate this,” prime minister Shinzo Abe said in Tokyo. “This clearly violates UN security council resolutions and is a grave challenge against international efforts for non-proliferation,” he said, adding his country would seek to coordinate efforts among UN members to tackle North Korea’s actions. United States In Washington, the White House said it could not yet confirm the test, but vowed to “respond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocations”. It said the US “will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state”. China There was no immediate response from China, but in a report from Pyongyang, the official Xinhua news service said that the “test apparently runs counter to relevant UN resolutions” and “is set to cause repercussions”. Australia Foreign minister Julie Bishop said her country “condemns in the strongest possible terms” the test, which “confirms North Korea’s status as a rogue state and a continuing threat to international peace and security”, adding that Canberra would express its concerns to Pyongyang directly and call for stronger UN sanctions. United Kingdom Foreign secretary Philip Hammond said: “If North Korean H-bomb test reports are true, it is a grave breach of UN [security council] resolutions and a provocation which I condemn without reservation.” Verifying – or disproving – North Korea’s claim that it has tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb could take days or weeks, experts say. For now, other nations and expert bodies are treating the claim with caution. However, according to South Korean media, the defence ministry in Seoul has said a small amount of hydrogen may have been added to the device North Korea tested on Wednesday. The MoneyToday online news service quoted ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok as saying: We will find out after closely analysing it but we understand a small amount of hydrogen may have been added to the fourth nuclear test. Should we believe North Korea’s claims to have tested a hydrogen bomb? John Carlson, the former head of Australia’s nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation Office, said the veracity of the claim would be difficult to determine “until we can analyse any gases emitted, and it could take several days for those to show up, if it all”. He said it would be a “major challenge” for the North Korean regime to develop a thermonuclear weapon, particularly a miniaturised version, which required even greater expertise. “Their claim would be far more convincing if it was a larger size,” he said. Carlson, who headed Australia’s safeguards office for more than two decades, said it was possible Pyongyang had actually produced a lower-yield “boosted explosion”, in which the hydrogen isotope tritium undergoes partial fusion, allowing them to describe the device as a hydrogen bomb. “I think it’s feasible that they’ve done that and they’re claiming that they’ve done more,” he said. North Korea claims it has successfully detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb. The underground test took place on Wednesday at 10am local time (1.30am GMT/Wednesday 12.30pm AEDT/Tuesday 6.30pm ET) at a known nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, in the east of the country. An announcement on state television claimed the test “worked perfectly” and was “self-defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weapons”. If true, this would be North Korea’s fourth nuclear test, and its first using a hydrogen bomb, significantly more powerful than an atomic bomb. There has been no independent verification of North Korea’s claims. An artificial earthquake of magnitude 5.1 was detected close to Punggye-ri. The UN organisation monitoring the world for signs of nuclear testing confirmed it had detected “an unusual event in the Korean peninsula”. The UN security council is expected to meet in New York on Wednesday 11am ET (4pm GMT) to discuss the North Korean claims. The White House said it could not yet confirm the test, but reiterated that the US “will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state”. South Korea and Japan have condemned news of the test, labelling it a threat to their security. Australia’s foreign minister Julie Bishop said her country “condemns in the strongest possible terms the provocative and dangerous behaviour of the North Korean regime”. The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said any test would be a “grave breach” of UN resolutions and “a provocation which I condemn without reservation”. Chinese border residents were evacuated from buildings after feeling tremors from North Korea’s nuclear test on Wednesday, state media has reported. People near the frontier with North Korea “clearly felt tremors” on Wednesday morning after Pyongyang said it detonated a hydrogen bomb, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) said. The areas included Yanji, Hunchun and Changbai in Jilin province, some of the counties closest to the nuclear test site. Residents in Yanji saw desks and chairs shake for several seconds and some companies evacuated employees from their offices, CCTV said. Students at a senior high school were dismissed during an examination after its recreation ground cracked, it added. Pyongyang said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had signed the order for the test on 3 January and has released this picture of him apparently doing so: Casting further doubt on North Korea’s claims, South Korea’s intelligence agency says the device tested on Wednesday may not have been a hydrogen nuclear bomb, Yonhap news agency reports. South Korea’s meteorological agency said separately that it has not detected any radiation after North Korea said it successfully conducted a hydrogen nuclear test. The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, has responded to the North Korean claims: He – like the White House – adds the caveat that we do not yet know if the North Korean claims are true or an aggrandisement. US experts have said it will take at least a number of days, and possibly weeks, to investigate and confirm (or otherwise) the claim that a miniaturised hydrogen bomb was detonated. According to John Carlson, the former head of the Australian safeguards and non-proliferation office,, a thermonuclear bomb, colloquially known as a hydrogen bomb, is essentially a two-stage explosion: one a nuclear fission reaction, the a other nuclear fusion reaction. The “primary” explosion is the fission reaction – as for a conventional nuclear bomb – that emits x-rays which cause the “secondary” explosion, triggered by the fusion of tritium and deuterium, two hydrogen isotopes. These two isotopes naturally repel each other, but the x-rays weaken this repellent force, causing the pair to fuse together. It is the fusion of these two isotopes that triggers the enormous energy release that make thermonuclear explosions so destructive. How does this differ to past North Korean nuclear tests? Past nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 were purely the primary stage, a nuclear explosion, “and fairly low yield at that”, Carlson says. South Korea says it will consult with allies and regional powers to get North Korea to face the consequences of the nuclear test it says it has carried out, including possible additional UN sanctions. Presidential security official Cho Tae-yong said “we strongly condemn” the North’s fourth bomb test. He said North Korea must abide by UN resolutions that require the country to scrap its nuclear and ballistic missile programs completely and irreversibly. South Korea’s defence ministry also says it is bolstering security and monitoring on North Korea. Public reaction inside North Korea – as far as it is possible to report – has been enthusiastic, Associated Press says: Crowds dressed in thick winter coats have gathered outside a large video screen near a Pyongyang train station to cheer and take video and photos on their mobile phones of the state TV anchor announcing the country had carried out a nuclear test. Some people raised their hands and applauded. Many smiled and cheered. Australia’s foreign minister Julie Bishop has issued a statement on the nuclear test claims: Australia condemns in the strongest possible terms the provocative and dangerous behaviour of the North Korean regime. Today’s nuclear test confirms North Korea’s status as a rogue state and a continuing threat to international peace and security. Bishop added that Australia would make its concerns known directly to the North Korean government and would work to strengthen sanctions aimed at reducing funding to North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction programs. A successful fourth test could deepen North Korea’s international isolation if the UN security council decided to respond with more sanctions, the Guardian’s Japan and Korea correspondent, Justin McCurry, reports. Pyongyang is thought to have developed several crude nuclear weapons. Since becoming North Korean leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has stepped up condemnation of joint US-South Korean military drills he believes are preparation for an invasion. In early 2013, Kim responded to UN sanctions imposed after North Korea’s third nuclear test by unleashing a barrage of threats aimed at South Korea, the US and Japan. Kim appears to have caught the world off-guard yet again. He did not mention his country’s pursuit of a nuclear deterrent in his New Year’s address – an omission some analysts was designed to improve the prospects of a summit with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. China joined other countries in condemning North Korea’s 2013 test – conducted in defiance of international sanctions – leading to a deterioration in traditionally warm ties between Pyongyang and Beijing. Last month, Washington dismissed Kim’s claims that his country had developed a hydrogen bomb – a development that, if true, would mark significant progress in North Korea’s nuclear capability. Hydrogen bombs are capable of producing a far more powerful blast than basic atom bombs. KCNA quoted Kim as saying at the time that he was continuing the work of his grandfather – and North Korea’s founder – Kim Il-sung, to turn North Korea into a “powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation”. The claim was greeted with scepticism in Washington, however, with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying Washington had evidence that “calls into serious question” Pyongyang’s claim. Here is the full statement from the White House, which is cautious ahead of confirmation of the claimed hydrogen bomb test, but reiterates that the US “will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state”. Markets in Asia have reacted to the news, with Japan’s Nikkei share average falling as much as 1.7% on Wednesday afternoon. “North Korea woes added to investor fears and hit further the Japanese market, which was already battered by geopolitical worries about the Middle East and volatility in Chinese shares,” Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, told Reuters. The Nikkei share average recovered but was down 1.4% at 18,123.30 points by mid-afternoon. The Guardian’s Beijing correspondent, Tom Phillips, says China has yet to comment officially on news of the test: But Shi Yinhong, a government foreign policy adviser, says he believes Chinese president Xi Jinping will have been infuriated by the test. “Of course he will be very angry and Xi Jinping will further delay his intention in the process [towards] improved relations with North Korea. With this kind of action you have no choice,” Shi said. Shi, who is a professor of international relations at Beijing’s Renmin University, said China had been attempting to improve ties with North Korea, sending Liu Yunshan, one of the Communist party’s most powerful leaders, to visit last October. “Only a few months ago China tried to improve relations with North Korea by sending Liu Yunshan to Pyongyang. But of course this process … will be very much more difficult now,” he said. The test showed those attempts had failed “in some ways [because of] Kim Jong-un’s own actions”. With Wednesday morning’s test Kim was sending a signal that he was prepared to defy anyone, “including Xi Jinping himself”. “Beijing-Pyongyang relations already for years are quite bad so of course it further damages them,” Shi added. First report of a response from the White House, which says it cannot confirm North Korea’s claims to have detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb. Nonetheless, it says, it condemns any violation of UN security council resolutions, which ban North Korea from testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. The UN security council will meet in New York on Wednesday 11am ET (4pm GMT) to discuss the North Korean claims. The UN organisation monitoring the world for signs of nuclear testing confirms it has detected “an unusual event in the Korean peninsula”. The head of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation, Lassina Zerbo, said: Our international monitoring system detected an unusual seismic event in the Korean peninsula at latitude 41.27 longitude 129.10. The location on the map places the epicenter at North Korea’s Pyunggye-ri testing site in its north-eastern mountains, where all of its nuclear tests have been conducted. North Korea claims it has successfully detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb. The test took place on Wednesday at 10am local time (1.30am GMT/Wednesday 12.30pm AEDT/Tuesday 6.30pm ET) at a known nuclear test site at Punggye-ri. An announcement on state television claimed the test “worked perfectly” and was “self-defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weapons”. If true, this would be North Korea’s fourth nuclear test, and its first using a hydrogen bomb, significantly more powerful than an atomic bomb. There has been no independent verification of North Korea’s claims. An artificial earthquake of magnitude 5.1 was detected close to Punggye-ri. Japan has condemned news of the test, labelling it a threat to Japan’s security. Yonhap reports that South Korean president Park Geun-hye will chair a national security council meeting to discuss reaction to the hydrogen bomb test. A standoff between North and South was – temporarily – resolved last August, following talks between the two nations after tensions soared on the peninsula. North Korea had declared a semi-state of war and an exchange of artillery fire heightened fears that the situation could escalate. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said the nation would make a firm response to North Korea’s challenge against nuclear non-proliferation, calling its latest nuclear test a threat to Japan’s security. Abe, speaking to reporters, said Japan absolutely could not tolerate North Korea’s nuclear testing. Reaction from China, North Korea’s most important supporter, will be key. After the 2013 nuclear test, China expressed “its firm opposition” and warned North Korea to avoid any actions that could worsen the situation on the Korean peninsula. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said North Korea had not informed China that it was about to conduct the test. The Pyongyang bureau of Xinhua, China’s official news agency, is reporting the claims of the “successful” hydrogen bomb test. We are, bit by bit, getting translated quotes from the North Korean TV broadcast: The republic’s first hydrogen bomb test has been successfully performed at 10am on January 6, 2016, based on the strategic determination of the Workers’ party. With the perfect success of our historic H-bomb, we have joined the rank of advanced nuclear states. NK News reports the KCTV news announcer as saying: The US has gathered forces hostile to DPRK and raised a slanderous human rights issue to hinder DPRK’s improvement … It is just to have H-bomb as self-defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weapons. The DPRK’s fate must not be protected by any forces but DPRK itself. North Korea says leader Kim Jong-un signed the order for the hydrogen bomb test on 3 January. The test “worked perfectly”, according to the official announcement. This map shows Punggye-ri, site of the artificial earthquake set off by North Korea’s nuclear detonation. It is difficult to verify North Korea’s claims and other nations will be rushing to investigate its announcement that it has successfully conducted a test of a miniaturised hydrogen nuclear device. A hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear bomb, uses more advanced technology to produce a significantly more powerful blast than an atomic bomb. If the hydrogen bomb claim is true, it would indicate significant advances in the North’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. In December, Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea had a hydrogen bomb – although others, including South Korea, expressed scepticism. Kim suggested that North Korea had the capacity to launch a hydrogen bomb, a step up from the less powerful atomic bomb, citing the achievements of his father Kim Jong-il and his grandfather, Kim Il-sung. The work of Kim Il-sung “turned the DPRK into a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation”, Kim Jong-un was quoted as saying. North Korea claims the reason for the test is its “legal right” to defend the country against the United States. The broadcast claimed that if the US does not threaten North Korean sovereignty, it will not need to use nuclear weapons. The “self-defence” claim is one that Pyongyang has attempted to use before. North Korea says the test was of a hydrogen bomb and it was successful. Yonhap says North Korea announces that it has conducted a hydrogen bomb test. Korean Central Television, which is of course state-run, has begun broadcasting its official statement. The Guardian’s Japan and Korea correspondent, Justin McCurry, sends this dispatch: North Korea is thought to have conducted its fourth nuclear test, after a “man-made” earthquake was detected near the country’s main nuclear testing site on Wednesday morning. Speculation that the regime in Pyongyang had conducted a surprise nuclear test rose after seismologists from South Korea, China and other countries said they were confident the earthquake, which struck at around 10am local time, had been caused by an explosion. A fourth nuclear test could bring North Korea a step closer to developing a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a long-range missile, and possibly bringing the US mainland within striking distance. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said North Korea had not informed the US or China – its traditional ally – that it was about to conduct a test. Yonhap added that North Korea was due to make a “major announcement” around midday local time on Wednesday. The tremor was a “suspected explosion”, the China Earthquake Network Centre said on its website. It gave the magnitude as 4.9. The US defense department said it was “looking into reports of a possible seismic event near North Korea’s nuclear facilities”, according to a US official. “We are looking into the reports of a possible seismic event near North Korean nuclear facilities,” the official said on condition of anonymity. The United States Geological Service, meanwhile, said it had detected a 5.1 magnitude quake. South Korean meteorological officials said the epicentre of the quake was 49 kms (30 miles) from the Punggye-ri site in North Hamgyong province, where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests in the past. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said it had also detected unusual seismic activity in North Korea. South Korean news agency Yonhap reports that the foreign minister Yun Byung-se has convened an emergency meeting in response to the possible nuclear test. A ministry official said: The foreign ministry is currently holding a meeting presided over by the minister to immediately determine the situation following the reports. Cheong Wa Dae, South Korea’s presidential office, plans to hold a session of the national security council over the issue, Yonhap says. Tremors detected on Wednesday by South Korean officials are a strong indication that Pyongyang has conducted its fourth atomic test. North Korea drew widespread condemnation in 2013 conducting a nuclear test in defiance of international bans. Two previous – and smaller – nuclear tests were carried out in 2006 and 2009. In 2013, experts put the earthquake prompted by the test at between magnitude 4.7 and 5.2. Those in 2006 and 2009 were 3.9 and 4.5 respectively. Wednesday’s quake has been preliminarily recorded at magnitude 5.1. North Korea will make what it calls a “major announcement” at 3.30am GMT (2.30pm AEDT/10.30pm ET) following reports of an earthquake – believed to be artificial – close to what is known to be a nuclear testing site. The United States Geological Service reported a 5.1 magnitude quake that South Korea said was 49km (30 miles) from the Punggye-ri site where the North has conducted nuclear tests in the past. An official from the South Korean meteorological administration said: “We suspect a man-made earthquake and are analysing the scale and epicentre of the quake with the geoscience and mineral resource institute of South Korea.” This live blog will have news of the announcement as it comes, along with reaction from North Korea’s neighbours.

But I think it’s time for me to stop talking. Let’s part ways with a summary. The last couple of mornings have been unfortunate for the prime minister. Today, there was a crook Newspoll. On Monday, it was Alan Jones, hectoring about the perils of free trade with China, and lecturing about the great wind farm hoax and the con that is global warming. Fortunately, things pick up around mid morning. On Monday, there was a free trade deal with the Chinese. Today, there was progress towards and economic cooperation agreement with India, and a defence agreement. In addition to warm words and a timetable – a free trade deal in 12 months – prime minister Modi sprinkled his people power magic in Canberra. The PUPs continued their general mulishness. During a debate about defence pay in the senate, it wasn’t clear whether Glenn Lazarus was digging in behind an increasingly recalcitrant Jacqui Lambie – or rebuking her. Labor continued to mull its options on the China FTA. It sought particulars on whether or not there would be labour market testing in the deal, and inquired why the deal had an ISDS clause when there’s a growing consensus in trade circles that these mechanisms are problematic. These were questions without specific answers. The agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce liked the China FTA, but he wasn’t quite sure whether or not it passed the pub test. It depended on whether it was the 7pm, 8pm, or 9pm pub test. It probably passed the pub test at 7pm .. provided it delivered something. Late in the day, the immigration minister Scott Morrison thought he’d not only set the terms for unauthorised boat arrivals, he’d dictate terms of resettlement for folks in Indonesia. That’s pretty much it. Have a lovely evening. Thus ends the meta cycle. We are #deskcisive on that front. Terribly convenient – these press conferences outside the Guardian Australia office. We get them periodically. It means Mike Bowers can shoot and file live without standing up. After a day sprinting after world leaders, this is called winning at life. The Greens leader Christine Milne is currently outside my door, reacting to this Morrison announcement. Once again, Australia has failed the global citizenship test. These are people who have been found to be refugees. Milne says the Abbott government has lobbed this announcement once world leaders have departed the country. She says – where are the Afghan Hazaras and the Iraqi Christians supposed to go? We decide who comes to Indonesia, and the circumstances in which they come. The old Howardism is becoming more and more ambitious. A statement has just lobbed from the immigration minister, Scott Morrison. If you registered with the UNHCR in Indonesia on or after 1 July 2014 – you will no longer be eligible for resettlement in Australia. The Morrison statement says the change is part of the government’s ongoing work in the region to strip people smugglers of a product to sell to vulnerable men, women and children. Morrison: While nine of ten months of 2014 have passed without a successful people smuggling venture to Australia, we know smugglers continue to encourage asylum seekers to travel illegally to Indonesia for the purpose of seeking resettlement in Australia. These changes should reduce the movement of asylum seekers to Indonesia and encourage them to seek resettlement in or from countries of first asylum. This seems somewhat presumptuous, to in effect impose arrangements applying in countries other than Australia. Morrison says the Indonesian government has been briefed. There was Lazarus, speaking just before. At the close of the debate, Jacqui Lambie sought a 30 second statement. She said she would have liked to speak during the debate, but she’d been denied leave to make a contribution. Liberal senator Ian Macdonald says he likes to be the voice of reason in debates. He’s surprised by Senator Back’s breaking news of the politician’s pay freeze. I hadn’t focussed on it. I hadn’t realised it. Macdonald says he is concerned about the pay offer, but the good folks of the defence force have to defend the country from Labor’s profligacy. Meaning the ADF folks have to defend the coffers as well as the country. By not getting a generous pay rise. Now who says there’s trouble in the PUP kennel? The brick with ties, Senator Glenn Lazarus, is rising now to speak to this defence pay motion. He’s lending Jacqui a hand. Possibly. Lazarus repeats a Lambieism in the debate – why do we give all this aid money to Indonesia when we could be giving some money to our diggers. Indonesia has a perfectly good army. (Let’s not get bogged down in facts here, like we don’t give aid money to fund armies in other countries. It’s not helpful.) Lazarus: I think the Abbott government has taken advantage of the ADF becuase it doesn’t have a union or an association to speak for them. The Palmer United Party is determined to see this insulting pay deal reversed. It isn’t actually clear whether Lazarus is helping Jacqui or lecturing Jacqui. He says together as a team, the PUP is determined to force a rethink on the pay deal. Lazarus warns this issue could bring down the government. It’s unclear whether this contribution is tacit endorsement of Lambie’s tactic of voting against government legislation, or whether it’s just a general political observation. Senator Back in the senate’s defence pay debate says he’s been getting emails, from soldiers, presumably, complaining that politicians get generous pay increases despite all the alleged belt tightening. In June 2013, the Remuneration Tribunal increased the base salary of Australian parliamentarians by 2.4% to $195,000. But Back insists hard times have come for honest politicians. Our salaries were frozen on the 1st of July. We have had our salaries frozen. I have some free advice for Senator Back, which he should feel free to take or leave. Let it go. The prime minister will be doing yoga next. You heard it here first. As I mentioned before – very glad our visitors have left the building, even if Narendra Modi is keeping up his diplomatic end in the Twitterverse. Liberal senator Chris Back, in the defence pay debate in the senate. I will allow the Labor party to burn slowly over the next few minutes. That serial liar, Mr Abbott .. That’s Labor’s Stephen Conroy, speaking in a motion in the senate about defence pay. For a moment I thought he was going to get away with this unseemly flourish of unparliamentary language – but no, the senate president is awake. Conroy withdraws. Oh dear. The G20 isn’t very popular in Essential land. 62% were more likely to agree that “the G20 is an expensive talk fest, it’s unlikely to change anything.” Harsh. Tuesday is poll day. We began with Newspoll. Now we have Essential. Helpfully, Essential has dived head first into the China FTA. (I refuse to call this thing CHAFTA, and if anyone else does, that purple bear is coming back. You have been warned. Maybe you like the bear. I have an irrational fear of purple bears. Anyway, enough about the bear.) Here are the findings: we approve although that’s soft; we suspect China will benefit more than Australia; we think the deal benefits government, miners and business most; not much to see for workers – and the rest .. without further ado .. 44% approve of Australia signing a free trade agreement with China and 18% disapprove. 39% could not give an opinion. Those most likely to approve were Liberal/National voters (58%), aged 55+ (58%) and men (54%). Those most likely to disapprove were Greens (27%) and other voters (35%). 35% think that China would benefit most from a free trade agreement, 24% think both countries would benefit equally and 12% think Australia would benefit most. Those most likely to think China would benefit most were Greens (53%) and other voters (54%) and aged 55% (43%), Respondents thought those most likely to benefit from a free trade agreement with China were the Australian government (52%), mining companies (48%) and Australian business overall (44%). Only 25% thought that there would be a lot or some benefit for working people. 47% though there would be little or no benefit for working people. A majority (61%) support a free trade agreement that gives greater access to Chinese markets for Australian businesses and respondents were also more likely to support reduced tariffs on imported manufactured goods from China (43%). A majority oppose fewer restrictions on Chinese workers coming to Australia (57%) and fewer restrictions on Chinese investment in Australia (52%). There were few significant differences between Labor and Liberal/National voters – except that 51% of Liberal/National voters supported reduced tariffs on imported manufactured goods from China. President Xi and the prime minister are currently in Hobart. I beleive there’s an event intending to hook the two leaders up with respective scientific teams in Antarctica. Question time is now over. Want to know what Kevin Rudd thinks of the China FTA? Here you go. You know something .. Sorta PUP senator Jacqui Lambie has the ‘why aren’t you paying our diggers more’ question. (Surprised? No? Me neither.) This inquiry is to the attorney-general George Brandis, because the defence minister David Johnston is on G20 duty. Or perhaps he’s on Hollande duty. It’s hard to keep up. Brandis is resolved to be friendly. Thank you senator Lambie. He explains calmly that this is all Labor’s fault. The government can’t afford to pay the diggers because Labor spent all the money. Lambie is not resolved to be friendly. It’s a disgusting deal, from the Liberal government. Brandis: Senator Lambie, I’m sorry, but I can’t accept the premise of your question. (Surprised? No? Me neither.) Ok, the minister for veterans affairs Michael Ronaldson has now joined many others in calling the new free trade CHAFTA. This terminology sounds completely unbearable. I return fire with this purple bear. Mitch Fifield, the minister representing the communications minister Malcolm Turnbull in the red room, is asked why the government said very clearly before the election there would be no cuts to the ABC and SBS – and now there will be a cut to the ABC of around 9% of its budget. Fifield says it was never the government’s intention that the ABC and SBS wouldn’t make a contribution to fiscal repair. (Which begs the obvious question, why tell voters there would be no cuts?) Do I look like Colonel Klink to you? Huh? So pleased the visitors have left. Downstairs in the red place, Labor’s Sam Dastyari has referred to Abetz as Colonel Klink. The attorney-general George Brandis has, meanwhile, branded the Greens dogs in the manger. Greens just hate prosperity, Brandis says, and hate commerce. Brandis is throwing around generalities in somewhat dangerous fashion. He suggests that ISDS clauses are part of all respectable trade agreements. That’s not quite reflective of contemporary thinking (which is my polite way of saying the impression being created there ain’t so accurate.) But go with the feels, George. Most everyone else does. I know I’ve been drawing heavily on The Economist today (one of my favourite publications). One more reference. It’s just occurred to me that today at least, I haven’t really explained what an ISDS clause is. This is a neat backgrounder from the magazine on the clauses and why they are increasingly controversial in trade deals. Put simply – an ISDS clause gives overseas investors a mechanism to sue governments if the company’s business interests are adversely affected by national policy. One example: the Asian arm of the tobacco multinational Philip Morris is challenging the Australian government over plain packaging laws – even though Philip Morris lost a case in the Australian courts. Penny Wong opens the batting for Labor. She’s seeking details on the labour mobility provisions of the China FTA: is there market testing? The question is to the government senate leader, Eric Abetz. Abetz says he can confirm that any overseas worker will need to be paid Australian market salary rates. (Which wasn’t the question. The question was about labour market testing, not about conditions of employment.) He adds that existing conditions in existing migration frameworks remain. Abetz says Wong is running a scare campaign. Wong persists. Will there be labour market testing? Abetz retaliates by quoting Simon Crean. Wong retaliates by asking Abetz to answer the question she asked. Abetz says employers will have to demonstrate need. Wong then asks a supplementary question on the investor state dispute clause. Will it create liabilities via the renewable energy target or the carbon farming initiative? Abetz retaliates by calling Wong .. immature and very unAustralian. Abetz says Labor used to negotiate FTAs with ISDS clauses in them. So grow up. Hear ye, hear ye. It being 2pm – and the senate sitting – here cometh the question time. Shadow trade minister Penny Wong couldn’t give a toss about the pub test. She’s on Sky News now. Wong says she’s concerned the Abbott government has done it again: set an arbitrary timetable for wrapping up a free trade deal with India – twelve months hence – rather than just progressing negotiations in a natural way. She says arbitrary timetables don’t always deliver the best results. Wong is repeating Labor’s two areas of concern on the China FTA – labour market testing and the ISDS clause. She says a Labor government would not have granted China an ISDS clause. Back to Barnaby for a moment. Just listening through his press conference from just before. Q: Does the China FTA pass the pub test? Joyce: It will go down differently between 5 o’clock, 7 o’clock and 9 o’clock. But let’s try the 7 o’clock pub test where basically people will say “I will believe it when I see it”. (We didn’t get to the later pub tests. Probably best we didn’t.) My joint press statement from Tony Abbott and prime minister Modi – distributed by the prime minister’s office – got lost in the mail. It’s a great shame that this happens every now and again, stuff getting lost in the mail, because it’s hard to report things accurately if you don’t have facts. Anyhow – I’ve mentioned before that I’ve been in search of some basic particulars regarding the defence MOU Modi clearly briefed the Indian media about before today’s set piece events. This is the relevant material from the joint statement. It’s basically what Team Modi told The Hindu. Prime minister Modi and prime minister Abbott decided to extend defence cooperation to cover research, development and industry engagement. They agreed to hold regular meetings at the level of the defence minister, conduct regular maritime exercises and convene regular Navy to Navy, Air Force to Air Force and Army to Army staff talks. Agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce thinks there’s more good than bad in the China FTA. Way more good than bad. He’s addressing reporters now. Joyce: The sugar industry, I suppose, is one area where there is a form of disappointment, I acknowledge that, and we will continue to work hard to make sure we get a better outcome for the sugar producers – but we can’t let the whole deal fall over because we haven’t got a perfect deal. Q: Labor has a 10-point lead. What is it you are doing wrong? Is the message not getting through? A lot of people say I don’t watch polls, of course I do, I’m not a fool. I watch polls but I keep working diligently to try and show the Australian people we are turning things around. I’m not for one moment saying I disregard polls, I don’t, I take it as a cue to work harder. Let’s take stock. It’s been a relatively straightforward morning. Tony Abbott woke up to a bad Newspoll – a ‘Labor ahead by ten points’ Newspoll. On the plus side, the free trade framework unveiled with China on Monday was given the thumbs up by most everybody (apart from Labor, which gave a partial thumbs up in lieu of concrete details on people movement and temporary migration.) Indian prime minister Modi came, addressed the parliament, signed a bunch of MOUs, hit Twitter and Instagram, spoke about trade and about yoga – and said good on Australia for finally waking up that it was part of Asia rather than part of somewhere else it wasn’t actually a part of. Onwards, and upwards blogans. The senate is sitting now to clear a backlog of business. The current topic is education funding. I’ll post a summary shortly so we can take stock of the morning. Man of the peeps. A gesture to vocal supporters in the gallery. Modi also stopped to shake hands with the clerk of the House of Representatives. Not the usual practice during bursts of pomp and circumstance. Meanwhile, snapping the kiddies. One curiosity of the day. The Indian delegation was obviously eyes on the new defence agreement with Australia – sufficiently eyes on to brief the deal to The Hindu in advance of the day’s festivities (I mentioned this in a post around 8.30am this morning.) But this, from the press event from Modi, was the only explicit reference to that new MOU today. I welcome the new framework of security cooperation. Security and defence are important and growing areas of the new India/Australia partnership for advancing regional peace and stability and combating terrorism and transnational crimes. It’s been an interesting 48 hours. The Abbott government has set its framework for a free trade deal with China – a pact the prime minister was cool about during opposition. In Battlelines in 2009, Abbott acknowledged China’s economic power in the region, but he said that development didn’t have to change anything for Australia. The communism was a problem for Abbott. “Although China has had to become less repressive to accommodate more economic freedom, the long term ability of what’s still a communist government to maintain legitimacy and to satisfy popular aspirations is far from clear.” And if we roll back to October 2011, Abbott said he was happy to pursue a free trade pact with Japan, but he had concerns about China. Abbott favoured an FTA with Japan because Japan was “vastly more of a market economy” and, like Australia, a pluralist liberal democracy. China would be pursued of course, but this was a more problematic agreement because China was not like us. It was not a democracy. There were questions “to what extent China is a market economy”. That was then, this is now. But Abbott stubbing his toe against communism perhaps helps explain why he was so quick to jump on president Xi’s very passing reference to democracy in his speech to parliament on Monday. Abbott either didn’t grasp, or didn’t choose to grasp, that “democracy” for China is not western multi-party democracy – but it’s own thing. If it was a projection rather than a stumble (and one of the experts we quoted this morning, Steve Tsang of Nottingham University, suspected it was a projection by the Australian prime minister), it was a revealing one. It would be interesting to know what the Chinese made of it. Now, to India. India has always been ok – an important member of the anglosphere, Abbott noted in Battlelines. He also contrasted India and China. There’s no reason other countries of our region could not also advance economically at much the same pace as China, or even faster. Despite its caste system, India has some key advantages – democracy and the rule of law besides the English language. So what does this all boil down to? In the space of two days, Abbott gets to progress two relationships: tie down a trade deal that he used to be openly ambivalent about, and tie down Modi to his domestic agenda of reform and transformation. Modi wants more market access and more Australian resources, Abbott wants Modi to be the prime minister who delivers, who can steer a deal through India’s complex and impenetrable bureaucracy. Abbott wants to believe that China is, somehow, on the road to being less communist; and he wants, with Modi, to be the ‘can do’ chaps of the anglosphere. Now we are through the various set pieces, I want to deal in the next post with Tony Abbott and his relationships with India and China. His evolving attitudes. Just a bit of analysis. Shortly. Modi points to terrorism, a threat India deals with constantly. Combating terror, the Indian prime minister says, will require global security cooperation but even more, a policy of no distinction between terrorist groups of discrimination between nations. He rounds out thus: It has taken a prime minister of India 28 years to come to Australia. It should never have been so long. This will change. Australia will not be on the outer of the region but at the centre of our talks. So we stand together at the moment with enormous opportunity and great responsibility. I see a great future of prosperity, a partnership between India and Australia and a shared commitment. Modi moves on to security: practical security and economic security. He argues that closer ties between Canberra and Delhi are positive for regional security. (Again, you can see that big guy in the region hovering just out of sight, can’t you?) Our region has seen huge progress on the foundation of peace and stability but we can not take this for granted. Preserving it will be the most important task in the region. India and Australia can play their part in it by expanding our security cooperation and depending on international partnerships in the region. But we do not have to rely on borrowed architecture of the past, nor do we have the luxury to choose who we work with and who we do not, but what we do need is to work together and with others to create an environment and culture. That promotes the currency of coexistence and cooperation in which all nations, small and big, abide by international law and norms. Even when they have bitter disputes, we should maintain maritime security, we should work together on the seas and collaborate in international forums and we should work for awe universal respect for international law and global norms. We must also support the process of economic integration in the region. An open global trading system that remains integrated. We must guard against regional trading issues becoming instrument of political competition. however, economic integration by itself would not be a strong basis for peace and stability. You get a sense from this address of the power of Modi’s change narrative. He’s got that appeal to hope down pat. Modi is like Obama, before the exhaustion set in. Modi: Australia has immense opportunities participate in India’s progress. In turn, India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities, and your desires to diversify your global economic engagement. India’s development, demographic and demand provide a unique long term opportunity for Australia and all in the framework of democracy. There is no other example of this nature in the world. (That’s a smack at China. You can have a democratic factory to the world if you like Tony, or you can stick with China – what say you?) Modi delivers a polite backhander among the compliments. He’s pleased to see Australia seeking a bigger role for itself in the region – more meaningful engagement. There was a time when for many of us, Australia was a distant land on the southern edge of the world. Today, the world sees Australia to be at the heart of the Asia Pacific and Indian ocean region. It holds the key to this world’s future and Australia is at a cross roads. Australia has become more engaged in this part of the world. We welcome it. The Indian prime minister would also like more Australian uranium so the glaciers don’t melt. India needs nuclear power – a source of low carbon emissions electricity. And gas. And renewables. Energy that does not cause our glaciers to melt. Clean coal and gas, renewable energy, a fuel for nuclear power. After the inevitable cricket anologies, Modi pays tribute the the nation he is visiting, and to the contribution played by the Indian diaspora. Australia is .. A beacon of democracy and rule of law. A nation that leads the search of lost aircraft, one of the most prosperous nations in the world. Among the best in human development index, a nation with some of the best cities in the world, some of the most wonderful minds and advanced technology base and a nation with great sporting skills. Not just immense beauty, Australia, but also of a great quality of life. Today, its cities are alive with the richness of the world’s diversity and it is home to 450,000 Indians who are as proud to be part of Australia as they are of their Indian heritage. Modi is now at the podium. He opens with a shirtfronting quip. Modi notes that he’s now the third head of the government that Australian parliamentarians are listening to this week. Modi: I do not know how you are doing this. Maybe this is prime minister Abbott’s way of shirtfronting you. (Maybe.) Shorten wound out of cricket to Modi’s domestic agenda for economic and political transformation. He ended with a quote from Ben Chifley. India will show the way to peace. Of course I’m listening very attentively but some pictures have to be shared just as soon as they hit the desk. You understand that, right? The Labor leader Bill Shorten is firmly in cricket territory with his welcome remarks. One of the firmest and fastest bonds that Indians form with Australians comes from our love of cricket. Prime minister Modi, in Australia we sometimes say that being captain of our test team is the second toughest job in the country behind prime minister. Some would say we should never compare cricket with politics. After all, one is the cause of great national debates, the intense passion, endless media commentary on controversial decisions and leadership speculation. And the other is just about deciding who governs Australia. The Australian prime minister drops a news point into his welcome. In noting how the economic relationship with India has been underdone in the past – he says the two countries have now turned the corner. It’s shoulders to the wheel, apparently. There are two can do types in this chamber, Abbott says. By the end of next year we will have a free trade deal with what is potentially the world’s largest market. And I want to make this declaration here in this parliament, there are two can do prime ministers in this chamber today – and we will make it happen. Abbott is back now in the Anglosphere – the shared history. India didn’t reject Britain. It reasoned with Britain. Abbott: Australians admired the way India won independence, not by rejecting the values learned from Britain but by appealing to them. Not by fighting the colonisers but by working on their conscience. Democracy again. (You got that – right?) With China, India is the emerging super power of Asia. The emerging superpower that is already a democracy. Abbott once again shares his backpacking memories from 1981. Well, here comes the set piece. Prime minister Modi is getting a very warm welcome as he enters the House of Representatives chamber. Tony Abbott opens proceedings. It is long overdue for an Indian prime minister to address this parliament given that the leaders of the US, China, Indonesia, Britain, Canada, Japan and New Zealand have already done so. But I am personally delighted that this omission is at last corrected. It is fitting that in the home of our democracy we should be addressed by the leader of the world’s largest democracy. Madam Speaker, there is so much that we can learn from a prime minister who must try to reach some 830 million voters. (That one gets applause. I’m too dignified to reference Newspoll, but I think we know what those folks are thinking down there.) Early submissions on yoga ministry: Clive Palmer and Peter Garrett. Coming up in a sec, Modi’s address to the Australian parliament. My former colleague and great friend Mark Skulley reminds me via Twitter that Modi recently appointed a minister for yoga. I confess I missed this development, but I salute it to the sun. Thanks again to The Economist: Until this week India had somehow got by without a minister for yoga, ayurveda and other traditional medicines. Now it can breathe easier. On November 11th Shripad Naik took charge of a new ministry to promote them. His boss, Narendra Modi, the prime minister, is a yoga enthusiast. He also wants local manufacturers, such as of homeopathic potions, to tap a global market for “alternative medicine” that is said to be worth some $100bn. This is completely superb and opens the obvious question – who would you appoint Australia’s first minister for yoga? Go. Modi references the MOUs signed this morning and addresses security issues, before ending his remarks. No questions. Our prime minister could learn to love this. Modi lobs a yoga reference. Yoga. Yeeesss. I know yoga is enormously popular here. We need to connect our people more. Prime minister Modi is addressing reporters in English. This is not his usual form. The Indian prime minister says he’s confident aspirations can turn into outcomes in India. He also indicates negotiations concerning a new economic partnership will be split – presumably making a pact easier to achieve. Modi: There are huge opportunities for a partnership in every area we can think of – agriculture, resources, energy, finance, infrastructure, education and science and technology. The economic climate in India has changed. I believe it will be a lot easier to convert opportunities into concrete outcomes. Prime minister Abbott and I discussed what we should do to impart real momentum to our economic partnership. Reconstituting the forum is an important partnership. We have agreed to split up negotiations under comprehensive economic partnership agreement. I also ask for easier access for Indian business to the Australian market and quicker investment approvals. If I may say so .. (you may, prime minister .. ) we’re not resting on our laurels. Tony Abbott says now is the moment, the economic partnership, the moment, the .. verb. We want to go further and that’s why the next priority for Australia is a comprehensive economic partnership agreement with India. If I may say so, this is a moment in time. This is the time to get this done. This is the time to turn the warm friendship between Australia and India, the long history that Australia and India have together into something that will be meaningful, more meaningful for us and significant for the wider world. I think this Australian government has the runs on the board when it comes to free trade. I know prime minister Modi has the runs on the board when it comes to getting the officialdom of India to actually respond to government, to making the Indian bureaucracy work for the people and the nation of India. This is our moment, Narendra, and I am determined to absolutely make the most of it. The two leaders have packed up their MOUs and have stopped by the podium for a chat with reporters. Tony Abbott is pleased with Indian democracy. India has democracy, so that helps I dare say. He also has breaking news: India has smart folks, not just cricketers. India, as we know, is one of the world’s emerging super powers. India, I often say, is the emerging democratic super power of Asia. We in Australia tend to associate India with cricket and with sport. That’s important. But we can never forget that India is an intellectual powerhouse, a potential economic powerhouse, IT, science, medicine, research – these are all great strengths of India’s and they can be great strengths for Australia as well if our relationship develops as it should. Meanwhile, some open mouthed hugging. The best kind, I find. Downstairs, we are beginning a sign-off. Tony Abbott and prime minister Modi are now singing a number of agreements with relevant portfolio ministers. There is clapping and gripping and grinning and flashing of flash bulbs. And throat clearing. Gosh, things must be bad. Peter Costello is actually being nice to Tony Abbott. The former treasurer makes something of a small specialisation of using a regular column in the News Corp tabloids to tell Abbott regularly enough that he’s the younger foolish brother to Costello’s elder statesman. But this morning he’s been charming about Abbott and treasurer Joe Hockey’s effort at the G20 at the weekend. He saves his disdain for Barack Obama. (Oh, that guy.) Costello: When Barack Obama strode on to the platform at the University of Queensland he placed the issue of climate change firmly on the summit agenda. He received the kind of rapturous applause that is given to an international celebrity, which he is. He is an accomplished performer and does oratory well. Since he has lost a majority in both Houses of the US Congress his chances of meaningful domestic legislation back home have diminished. He will use his two remaining years in office to focus on the international stage, where he carries much more influence and respect. Went to get a quick coffee. Missed the present. A present! While I’m doing the rounds of the regional media, democracy doesn’t get a look in in the Xinhua report of president Xi’s address to the Australia parliament yesterday. (There are a lot of reports of the visit – perhaps it’s elsewhere and I haven’t found it yet.) Xi pledged that China will continue to follow a win-win strategy of opening-up, both uphold justice and promote cooperation, develop an open economy and strengthen and expand all-round mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries. On Sky News meanwhile, the trade minister Andrew Robb is being asked whether people are right when they say Australians can’t own assets in China (so what’s the point of trade with China because we never get anything.) People like, say, I don’t know .. Alan Jones. Robb: This is wrong. The Hindu tells us the two leaders will upgrade defence ties as part of the day’s announceables. India and Australia will commit to an “enhanced strategic partnership” when Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott in Canberra on Tuesday. Sources told The Hindu that the two sides will announce an “action plan” for cooperation in defence and other areas. This will include exercises between armies, navies and air forces, as well as counter-terrorism, maritime security, non-proliferation and cyber security. Again, some useful background on our guest – this time from The Economist. This piece departs from the usual ‘here comes the rockstar’ journalism that inevitably follows the Indian prime minister – it looks at the two insiders behind the Modi juggernaut. Even the mightiest cannot rule alone, and Mr Modi relies on two old allies, both crucial. One, Amit Shah, engineers the electoral victories that give Mr Modi his authority. The other, Arun Jaitley, must take that authority and out of it craft policies and decisions that will launch the economic recovery which Mr Modi has promised and by which he will be judged. These two men are Mr Modi’s enablers. I suspect most politics tragics will enjoy this read. If you need some background on Modi, do have a look at this profile by my colleague Ben Doherty. Modi is a genuinely fascinating mix of populist and economic reformer. Ben’s piece tracks Modi from the controversies of the Godhra riots to last weekend’s G20 meeting. Modi was ostracised for his actions, or inactions, during the Godhra riots, sectarian violence that roiled across his state for a month in 2002 in which 1,000 or more people, largely Muslim, died. As a neophyte chief minister, he was accused of allowing the riots to rage, even of actively fomenting the violence of Hindu vigilantes. Modi has always denied the allegations and none have ever been proven against him. That he did not, or could not, stop people dying in the brutal communal bloodbath that seized his state is self-evident. Whatever else he may have done is likely lost forever in the conflicting “truths” of the time. That month has coloured all opinion of him since. Once the outcast, Modi arrived at the G20 on Friday as the political rock star of the summit. As the newly minted prime minister of the largest democracy the world has ever known, the 64-year-old is the man the other leaders are seeking out this week. Lots of gripping and grinning down on the forecourt right now. There will be anthems. Ah yes, here they are. Let the music play. Tony Abbott and Narendra Modi are standing together in front of the trombones. And the soldiers. For folks wanting to plan their blog watching when the boss isn’t watching – let me help with Modi facts. Shortly, there will be a ceremonial welcome at parliament house. Modi will meet Tony Abbott at around 8.30am, and there will be a media conference (of some sort) at 9.35am. Prime minister Modi’s address to parliament is just after 10am. On cue, the ACTU president Ged Kearney is on another ABC radio outlet talking about people movement and labour market testing. Andrew Robb says the trade union movement has been scaremongering on this issue. Radio National Breakfast host Fran Kelly asks Kearney is that true, is she scaremongering – talking about the risks of Chinese workers taking jobs that should rightly go to Australians? Kearney: I don’t see how it is. Are we actually inflating what is going to happen from this agreement? The Chinese president incidently is on his way to Tasmania, continuing his Australian visit. The newspapers and morning radio current affairs are dominated by the China free trade deal. The interesting question now, apart from the concrete details about various in-principle agreements not yet supplied, is will this trade pact win bipartisan support? The China FTA has the potential to spark the biggest internal bunfight within Labor since the US free trade agreement in 2004. It may not, but it’s certainly possible. The shadow trade minister Penny Wong has hit the ABC early. She says Labor in-principle supports trade liberalisation, but she notes key details concerning this pact are not yet in the public domain. Labor is concerned about two things: the people movement provisions in this deal, and the investor state dispute resolution mechanism. Wong was asked about the people movement provisions on the ABC. Wong says the government needs to clarify whether this proposed agreement will safeguard Australian jobs. She says the key to this is labour market testing. Wong says the trade minister Andrew Robb needs to clarify this provision. If there’s labour market testing, make that clear. It’s not clear in the framework text circulated yesterday. Good morning everyone and welcome to Tuesday. Yesterday was China day. Today, Tuesday, it’s all about India. Parliament will host the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. We are underway slightly early this morning because Modi is underway slightly early. He’s already stopped by the War Memorial, and he’s on his way into the building. Possibly he’s powered by the crowd – the Indian prime minister is getting a huge reception from the expat community. Before we turn to India, let’s first deal with the wash-up of China. Readers with me yesterday know that the Abbott government secured a handshake on a free trade pact with China. The deal has been well recieved by business. The Chinese president Xi Jinping also gave an address to parliament in which he asserted China’s posture in the region: the big guy, but the peaceful, rule-of-law guy. The address by Xi was a bookend to the 2011 address to the Australian parliament by the US president Barack Obama – his famous “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific. Xi made one reference to democracy in his speech in the context of explaining the official slogan, “the Chinese dream.” Xi has discussed democracy in the past, but he’s made it clear he doesn’t mean multi-party democracy, he means Chinese democracy, which means a one party state. But Tony Abbott liked what he heard. The prime minister told a state dinner last night that Xi had made a commitment to full democracy in China by 2050 – an “historic statement which I hope will echo right around the world.” Given the working disposition of the Chinese leadership, China watchers were less than convinced about that. Steve Tsang, Nottingham University, said: Mr Abbott has clearly got carried away in projecting his own understanding of democracy and rule of law to what he heard from President Xi. What President Xi referred to could be seen as ‘democracy with Chinese characteristics’ and ‘rule of law with Chinese characteristics’. Perhaps Abbott has the correct interpretation. As is said in the classics, only time will tell. In any case, the prime minister has more to deal with than a possibly overly enthusiastic report on Xi’s commitment to multi-party participatory democracy, and his high-level hosting duties today. There’s another bad Newspoll this morning. Labor has a ten point lead on the Coalition and Bill Shorten is ahead as preferred prime minister. This poll was taken over the G20 weekend, which was supposed to be a triumph. World summits never are political triumphs of course, but it’s fair to say this one wasn’t great. You wouldn’t care about one bad poll, but the trend is bad for Abbott and for the Coalition. Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones told the prime minister on Monday he wasn’t passing the pub test. I suspect it’s been a while since Alan’s been in a pub, but we can say Abbott is not passing the poll test. Just as well these good folks aren’t inclined to panic.

According to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Authority, 20% of the world's 442 working commercial nuclear power stations are in areas of \"significant\" seismic activity. With the nuclear industry hoping to build 350 new reactors within 20 years to meet soaring electricity demand and to counter climate change, the risk of a nuclear catastrophe from a natural disaster is growing significantly, they say. \"Japanese plants were said to be earthquake resistant and the best prepared in the world for disaster, but see what happened. Seismic zones only make them more risky,\" said Karuna Raina, nuclear campaigner for Greenpeace India which is opposing plans for a massive nuclear plant being built in Maharashta state. According to the government's Geological survey of India, the Maharashta site and the surrounding area experienced 91 tremors between 1985 and 2005, ranging up to magnitude 6.3. Turkey meanwhile is planning three nuclear power plants at Akkuyu on the Aegean Sea. The site is only a few kilometres from the active Ecemis fault line and is in an area where large earthquakes have occurred in the past. A 1999 earthquake in Turkey killed nearly 20,000 people. In Chile, which has been hit by successive earthquakes in the last year, the government has declined to comment on plans to build several nuclear plants, despite significant opposition. Nuclear plants are generally built to withstand earthquakes of a maximum of 8.5 magnitude, but proofing installations against tsunamis is seldom considered. The 2004 Sumatra tsunami which forced the temporary closure of the Kalpakkam nuclear power plant near Chennai and four plants in Taiwan also affected nuclear stations on the west coast of the US. \"This is going to change the discussion in the US and elsewhere about basing energy supplies on nuclear power. Placing stations in earthquake zones is going to change the debate,\" said Tom Clements of Friends of the earth USA. Some governments have moved to calm nerves. India's top nuclear bodies said they would revisit all safety aspects of atomic plants in the country and analyse the nuclear crisis arising in Japan after the tsunami as it has offered new lessons to fine tune existing emergency preparedness. \"We will not jump to say that our power reactors will not suffer a similar kind of situation but we are planning to revisit all the safety aspects of our plants after doing a complete analysis of the Japanese incident and share the entire safety means with the public in a transparent way,\" said SK Jain, the chairman and managing director of Nuclear Power Corporation of India. Energy and climate change secretary Chris Huhne said: \"We take this incident extremely seriously even though there is no reason to expect a similar scale of seismic activity in the UK. I have called on the chief nuclear inspector, Dr Mike Weightman for a thorough report on the implications of the situation in Japan and the lessons to be learned. It is essential that we understand the full facts and their implications, both for existing nuclear reactors and any new programme, as safety is always our number one concern.\" Nancy Birch, of the anti-nuclear group Kick Nuclear said: \"Only last December, Cumbria was hit by an earthquake. It hit an area that has been earmarked by the government to store decades-worth of cancer-causing, high-level radioactive waste. The disaster in Japan clearly demonstrates that nuclear energy is too dangerous to be considered a sustainable form of energy in the 21st century. We want a future, not a disaster.\" In Germany around 50,000 protesters came out in force at the weekend to urge the government to drop plans to extend the life of its atomic reactors after news of the Japanese disaster. The Japanese disaster has also shaken confidence in the Philippines to revive its mothballed Bataan nuclear plant, a senior government official said on Sunday. Presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte told a government radio station that it was not timely to discuss nuclear energy as source of power for the country. \"Alternative fuels [renewables] are less controversial ... you meet less opposition and it might be the win-win solution for everyone,\" she said. Taner Yildiz, the Turkish energy minister, dismissed critics. \"The [Japanese] system shut down automatically right after the earthquake and it opened when everything turned out normal. I can say Japan has tested itself. Nuclear power plant projects will continue in Turkey.\" \"It's premature to make any long term statements,. The situation has to be assessed and then action taken,\" said Giovanni Verlini, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Authority. in Vienna. • This article was amended on 14th March 2011. It originally referred to the \"Richter scale\" as a measure of earthquake magnitude. Seismologists no longer use this scale so the phrase has been removed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2013/dec/05/autumn-statement-2013-public-leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-05T14:34:36Z","webTitle":"Autumn statement 2013: key points and expert comment for public leaders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/dec/05/autumn-statement-2013-public-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2013/dec/05/autumn-statement-2013-public-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Autumn statement 2013: key points and expert comment for public leaders","bodyText":"The key message underpinning the chancellor George Osborne's autumn statement today was one of cautionary optimism. \"Britain's economic plan is working,\" he said, but only if we stick to it in the long term. Here's a roundup of the salient points for public leaders, including reaction from experts. Government department cuts • The chancellor commended the \"good financial management\" of government departments, which are expected to underspend by £7bn this year. Consequently, departmental budgets will be reduced by around £1bn in the next two years. Exemptions • Protections for the NHS and schools will apply and the security and intelligence agencies and HMRC will be exempt. Budgets for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales will see a net increase. Local government • Public spending cuts do not apply to local government, but the coalition expects local authorities to freeze council tax again next year. • Councils will be expected to sell off expensive social housing and use the proceeds to build more homes. Jobs • Businesses have created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector. An Office for Budgetary Responsibility report today forecasts 3.1m more jobs will be created by businesses by 2019. Pensions • Osborne confirmed that state pension age will rise, likely to increase to 68 in the mid 2030s and to 69 in the late 2040s. This will save future taxpayers £500bn, he said. • The state pension will not be included in a new cap on welfare spending, and will rise by £2.95 a week from next April. Welfare spending • The government will introduce a cap on welfare spending, and if it is breached there will be a vote in the House of Commons. • Meanwhile, Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has announced he will miss his deadline of getting all new and existing benefit claimants onto universal credit by 2017. Infrastructure • The chancellor said the country needed to get serious about \"competing in the modern world\", including committing to new roads and railways such as HS2. • He pointed to the update on the national infrastructure plan, announced on Tuesday, which includes a deal with Hitachi on the next nuclear power station in Anglesey and investment from the insurance industry of at least £25bn in UK infrastructure. Reactions... Dave Penman, general secretary at FDA: \"The chancellor has once again used the autumn statement to announce further cuts in departmental budgets beyond those already planned. And once again there was no indication of what he expects departments to stop doing, with resources being so dramatically reduced. \"By 2015 departmental budgets will have been cut by just under a quarter, yet the demands being made of the civil service continue to increase, with radical changes to welfare, business regulation and criminal justice primed to continue at break-neck speed. The government is creating a perfect storm of unrealistic demands and low pay for those delivering key public services. Something has to give and it can be no surprise that many of the most talented and senior staff are increasingly considering careers elsewhere.\" Richard Harries, deputy director at Reform: \"I suppose the first question you have to ask yourself is whether you can trust the judgment of a man who tells us it is still autumn – especially on a day like today. The real question however is whether the chancellor has dodged the difficult questions. By opting for fiscal neutrality, he clearly hopes that the rising tide of OBR forecasts will lift the fiscal boat of state. But the OBR has warned repeatedly that, without further tax increases or spending cuts, the ageing population will \"put public sector net debt on an unsustainable upward trajectory\". And yet, by opting to bring forward the increase in the pension age to 68 to the mid 2030s, the chancellor has chosen to penalise tomorrow's pensioners: those in work now and already burdened with a growing tax bill to pay for today's pensioners. \"The good news for local government leaders is that councils have (temporarily) joined the magic circle of public services protected by a ringfence – although it is not clear whether authorities will be compensated for the income foregone by capping next year's business rates to 2%. Will this give councillors the breathing space they need to innovate? Or the excuse they need to avoid real reform? If chancellors, like doctors, were bound by a Hippocratic oath to \"do no harm\", then perhaps this year's autumn statement should be judged a qualified success. But by prioritising the needs of the present over the needs of the future, George Osborne has put off once again the really tough choices facing the country.\" Gareth Hills, president of ARC, the union for senior managers and professionals in HMRC: \"ARC welcomes the introduction of a new power requiring taxpayers using avoidance schemes that have already been defeated in the courts to pay the tax they are trying to avoid upfront. However, the Chancellor could have gone further by introducing a penalty or surcharge regime for all users of avoidance schemes on tax finally payable over and above amounts returned as due. \"The Chancellor said it would be economic madness to increase the rate of corporation tax. The real economic madness is that the Chancellor, along with this Government, does not recognise that sustained and additional investment into HMRC is part of the solution to closing the tax gap. \"In not taking up ARC's Budget 2013 proposals of investing £312m for a return of £8bn the Government continues to miss the opportunity to grab the most compelling invest to save argument ever.\" Sue Ferns, director of communications and research at the Prospect union: \"The autumn statement is a missed opportunity. The OBR economic forecast signals a return to economic growth but the economy has not yet recovered from the deep economic downturn that started in 2008 and real wages are not expected to reach their pre-crisis peak until 2015. \"It is important that the recovery is sustained and that there is real investment in productive industries that will take the economy forward. The government has committed to providing more funding for science education, but this will only be attractive if students are confident of their career prospects. The chancellor's assertion that three jobs have been created for every one lost in the public sector tells us nothing about the quality of work or job security. \"It is important that the government invests in research and development, but we do not yet know the details of the science budget allocations and recent reports that additional items will be tucked inside the ringfence are worrying. The science and innovation strategy needs to provide a roadmap that achieves the target of 2.5% as a percentage of GDP if we are to compete with the developed and emerging economies in science and innovation. \"An important signal of the government's intent is how it treats its own specialist workforce. The announcement on public sector pay is more evidence that the current pay policy is broken. No details have been announced about how the 'pay bill control' will work in practice. Departments and agencies want more flexibility in their pay policies to attract and retain the specialists that they needed. Pay for engineers, project managers, procurement specialists already lags behind the private sector; pay control will not address this problem. Rather than tinkering around the edges government needs to confront this issue head on by setting up an independent review of specialist pay in the civil service.\" • Want your say?

Tehran's extensive propaganda campaign, stressing the \"moderation\" of its new president, Hassan Rouhani, seems to be working, softening up the gullible in the United States and Europe. As in previous iterations of the charade now reopening in Geneva, Iran's bargaining position benefits from our own repeated mistakes. The ayatollahs need only take advantage of these unforced errors, and success may well fall into their undeserving hands. Consider the most blatant errors that Iran is eager to exploit. First, both Presidents Bush and Obama conceded that Iran was entitled to a \"peaceful\" nuclear program, for energy and scientific purposes. Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), however, that view is flatly wrong. By pursuing nuclear weapons for over two decades, Iran has violated key NPT provisions – notably, the obligation it freely undertook to be a non-nuclear weapons state. Tehran is not, therefore, entitled to claim benefits under NPT sections permitting peaceful uses of nuclear power. Beyond treaty interpretation, Iran's long record of ignoring its commitments and lying about its nuclear program demonstrates beyond dispute that it cannot be trusted. What conceivable reason exists to believe today's pledge to abstain from nuclear weapons when the ayatollahs have violated so many previous pledges? Only if credibility counts for nothing would Iran's likely upcoming \"commitment\" hold any weight. Second, by allowing Iran to possess any uranium enrichment, nuclear reactors, or spent nuclear fuel reprocessing capabilities, the west will both legitimize Iran's nuclear program and ensure that it can move to weaponization at a time entirely of its choosing. President Obama's negotiators conceded last year that Iran could enrich uranium to reactor-grade levels, so long as it didn't enrich to higher levels. But reactor-grade enrichment levels already take Iran nearly 70% of the way to weapons-grade enrichment. \"Stopping\" enrichment above standard reactor-grade levels saves, at best, a few weeks of enrichment effort. By misunderstanding the physics of uranium enrichment, the Obama administration has made a mockery of itself. Third, the White House retort that international inspections will prevent Iran from speedily moving to weaponization is a complete fiction. Given the broad, deep nuclear infrastructure Iran is building aggressively, Tehran need merely expel the International Atomic Energy Agency when it chooses to do so, and then move rapidly to weaponization. North Korea expelled the IAEA ten years ago, and Iran will calculate it can do so, too. Even with the IAEA in-country, Iran's large territory and mountainous topography will greatly facilitate concealing its ongoing nuclear activities. Mineral \"mines\", for example, can easily hide nuclear-related work; or Iran could build facilities elsewhere, such as North Korea, with which it has co-operated for over 15 years on ballistic-missile programs. Fourth, what Iran really wants near-term, and what the west seems poised to give, is relief from international economic sanctions. Although these measures have caused Iran economic pain, there is no evidence they have impeded the nuclear program. Obama's director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, so testified earlier this year, and the IAEA has repeatedly reaffirmed that Iran's nuclear program continues to grow at alarming rates. While America and Europe insist they will demand reciprocal concessions for any weakening of the sanctions, Iran (with its backers, Russia and China) is bargaining from a position of strength. The ayatollahs sense from Obama's desperate efforts for a handshake or phone call with Rouhani at September's UN opening that he is hungry for a deal, thus allowing them to extract concession from the west before making even a superficial response. Our negotiators are already talking about \"sequencing\" steps by the two sides – meaning, in reality, we will make the first concessions, hoping that Iran will make substantive concession later. In fact, the likely scenario is the exact opposite: Obama will make significant reductions in sanctions that will be very hard to restore subsequently, and Iran will give us blue smoke and mirrors. Even worse, these non-reciprocal episodes could continue at length, giving Tehran another precious resource, time, to continue building its nuclear facilities. There is a theoretical case that economic sanctions might, at some point in the past, have been sufficient to bring Iran's nuclear efforts to a halt. Our historical experience, however, demonstrates that economic restrictions must meet several preconditions before they can achieve any significant geopolitical objective. To be effective, sanctions must be sweeping and comprehensive; swiftly and unhesitatingly applied; and widely complied with or rigorously (that is, militarily) enforced. None of these criteria has met in the case of Iran. Sanctions have been applied sporadically, in a piecemeal fashion, have had only intermittent and ineffective enforcement, and often have been flatly disregarded by Iran's champions, including Russia and China. Accordingly, therefore, even if the current sanctions were continued or tightened – highly unlikely in present circumstances – they would prove insufficient. We have only two very unpleasant choices: either Iran gets nuclear weapons in the very near future, or pre-emptive military force, fully justified by well-established principles of self-defense, must break Iran's control over the nuclear fuel cycle and prevent (or, at least, substantially delay) weaponization. President Obama has said repeatedly that \"all options are on the table\", the standard euphemism for military action. But, especially after Syria, no one believes him, the ayatollahs in Tehran, most notably. By default that leaves Israel, which is watching today's negotiations most uneasily. The fact is we shouldn't trust and can't verify Iranian promises not to fabricate nuclear weapons. Indeed, even now, Washington really doesn't know how quickly Iran could assemble a small number of nuclear weapons. But a crash program has never really been Tehran's objective. Iran is playing a much longer game that the west, largely because it fears neither our sanctions nor a possible military strike. Our inability to see through this strategy has brought us grief time and again. Unfortunately, in Geneva, we may be watching a re-run."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/29/britain-energy-bills-tough-with-us","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-29T17:15:00Z","webTitle":"If Britain wants to cut energy bills it must get tough with the United States | Chris Huhne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/29/britain-energy-bills-tough-with-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/29/britain-energy-bills-tough-with-us","fields":{"headline":"If Britain wants to cut energy bills it must get tough with the United States","bodyText":"Heaven help the planet, because dealing with climate change is going to cost something (although a lot less than not dealing with it). The politics is getting more difficult, judging by the promises of Ed Miliband and David Cameron. They evidently think that voters are in no mood to pay even a modest insurance premium to stop what the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report says is a 95% certainty that human activity is destroying our habitat. The latest round of populism on energy prices began last October, when the prime minister said the government would legislate to put consumers on to the cheapest deal. Miliband joined in last week, with a call for a price freeze. The Tory right riposted with demands to cut support for low carbon generation, currently a small part of the total. Energy comes with painfully large bills of typically £1,200 a year, probably the biggest bill after the rent or mortgage. Never mind the inconvenient fact that we have lower electricity and gas prices than most western European countries, and that the biggest impact on household bills is world gas prices – going up as Asia booms and Japan, Germany, and Italy abandon nuclear power. The polling shows energy prices hurt. Both Miliband's and Cameron's proposals risk being counter-productive, which is why the government swiftly ditched the prime minister's. Shopping around may be frustrating, but it is safer than telling companies to put people on to the lowest bill, which would mean they would only charge one tariff. Miliband's price freeze from the election until 2017 would have two effects: bigger price hikes between now and the election, and bigger catch-up price rises when the freeze comes off. Price controls do not work. In electricity, price caps were one of the toxic components that caused California blackouts in 2000 and 2001. Sharp rises in wholesale prices, combined with caps on retail prices, would simply cause companies to turn off the lights. Why sell at a loss? There are only two safe ways of getting prices down: increase supply or cut demand. Key to our energy bills are gas prices. We use a lot of gas to heat our homes, and it is usually the cheapest way of generating electricity so it also sets our electricity costs. But there is a puzzle. The wholesale gas price in Britain is nearly three times as high as in the United States. If we had US gas prices, consumers would save hundreds of pounds a year. Gas enthusiasts say this is due to the US fracking revolution driving down prices. George Osborne thinks if we turn Cheshire and Sussex into wildcatting Texas, our prices will fall. He has even given fracking a tax break. But there would be no such effect. We have pipelines to mainland Europe. More gas from the North Sea did not much cut British prices. The US gas price is so low because it is hard to ship. It has to be liquefied, put in special ships, and then regasified when it arrives. The fracking revolution in the US has happened more quickly than the ability to turn import terminals into export terminals. The key to lower British energy bills is not our own production, but more US export terminals. So far, just four terminals have been given permission, and more than 10 export terminals are still awaiting approval, even though the US has a legal obligation under the World Trade Organisation rules not to restrict exports. As I've seen in my role in (unrelated) US green energy, there is fierce lobbying against export terminals in Washington from chemical, steel and other energy intensive companies (and their unions) that want cheap inputs (and a big competitive edge on Europe). Cameron should be putting pressure on the other side of the Atlantic when he talks with the president. The EU should be jumping up and down about unfair trade practices. We should get tough, if necessary funding legal challenges to American sloth. There is also an appalling effect on carbon emissions. Gas is displacing coal in the US, but the US coal producers are just dumping their product in Europe. European power companies have been shifting from gas to coal, which emits twice as much carbon for the same heat. Gas should replace coal on both sides of the Atlantic, as it probably would in a free market. If we are to use gas responsibly in the long term, we will need to capture the carbon emitted when it burns. But the anti-green Treasury is dragging its feet on the first big low-carbon gas power station. The other way to cut energy prices is to curb demand: the lower the demand for electricity and gas, the lower prices will be. The government legislated for a revolutionary way of increasing household energy saving – the green deal – which had three-party support at the last election. But Osborne and the Treasury have blocked any serious incentives despite private financing, savings in household bills and job creation. So much for Osborne's pre-election promise to turn the Treasury into a \"green ally\". Voters are cleverer than politicians sometimes assume. They know there is no such thing as a free lunch, so both Miliband and Cameron should stop pretending that it exists. On energy prices, three things will work: more competition, free trade with the US, and energy saving. More supply and less demand will get prices down. It really is that simple. The rest is just political posturing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/aug/22/weary-german-voters-europe-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-22T13:01:10Z","webTitle":"Is standing up for European values too great a risk in Germany? | Rebecca Harms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/22/weary-german-voters-europe-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/22/weary-german-voters-europe-debate","fields":{"headline":"Is standing up for European values too great a risk in Germany?","bodyText":"It has been a hot summer in Germany. It appears that temperatures have been too high for a heated election campaign. The debates have been sluggish and drawn out. And even if the major TV duels are yet to be fought: what are the issues that will jolt the Germans from their summer lethargy and make them flock to the polling stations? Arguments over equitable taxation or the merits of the state and its institutions have been exchanged for ages. Likewise, the price of abandoning nuclear power and achieving the energy transition is perceived as a permanent topic. So far, none of these disputes have really hit home. Nothing has truly gripped the public and sparked the kind of debate that captivates the mind beyond the evening news and comment pages. The only issue to defy the general weariness is the discussion about civil liberties and democracy triggered by whistleblower Edward Snowden's actions. Of course, the runup to an election is not a time that would allow for an objective investigation of programmes such as Prism or Tempora. But the debate on secret services, surveillance and civil rights should indeed be pursued – now more than ever. No other country in the European Union has benefited more in terms of its democratic development from being firmly rooted in the EU than Germany. When, if not now, is the time to defend the shared values that allowed this country to evolve after 1945, and again since 1989? If the European commitment to freedom, democracy and justice is to carry any weight, the debate about data privacy and civil rights must be a central campaign issue. The word from Berlin is that the German public remains largely unmoved. But voters are left indifferent because the debate has been absurdly reduced to the question of whether Merkel or the SPD's Frank-Walter Steinmeier (who was previous in charge of foreign affairs) knew more or less about the collaboration between the NSA and the German intelligence agency BND, and acquiesced in it. If you want to engage the citizenry, then the real argument is about how we can meet Snowden's request for asylum in a democratic country. Engaging the people means contesting some of the alarming approaches adopted by western security policy since 9/11. Getting the people involved means defending the European way, which is not anti-American, but seeks to realign the relationship between liberty and security. The prerequisite for this, however, is that we place greater belief in, and demand more of, our common European way. Is standing up for European values too great a risk in Germany, nearly 25 years after reunification? In Brussels, necessary decisions have been put off for quite some time. As the date of the German election draws nearer, the more openly it is admitted that nothing will happen before the end of September. Many Europeans were expecting the German campaign season to spawn precisely those heated debates on EU policy. They do not want philosophical musings, but clear answers: what will happen in Greece? What can we learn from the failure of a strategy that relied solely on austerity measures? How can Europeans escape the debt trap? How will we correct the design flaws of the euro? How must a banking union be constructed to safeguard states and citizens against repeated bankruptcy through speculation and other shady dealings? How can we achieve economic recovery and the long-term renewal of Europe's industries? How will we make good on the European promise of a better life in the face of growing poverty and unemployment, particularly in the union's southern and eastern regions? These are vital questions – for Germany and for Europe. There has been a tendency to steer clear of these questions in this federal election campaign. Germany's political elite is given to a certain fear of the electorate whenever the EU crops up as an issue. Yet it is the same elite that has long neglected to explain to the public how valuable the EU is for us in every way, and has instead never missed an opportunity to proclaim that the community is costing us too much. That is why Germany again lacks an impassioned debate about the rights and wrongs of the future European path. As a German European, I am disappointed by the mixture of incapability and carelessness back home. After all, in today's EU a lot, albeit not everything, depends on Germany. And Germany itself has enjoyed great economic success over the past 50 years, thanks to debt cancellation, the Marshall plan, German reunification and above all, thanks to Europe. The existence of the European Union has also allowed German society to evolve and has made the country one of the most popular destinations. The debate about our shared European future is an existential one. It requires passion and attractive ideas. That would be good for the German electoral campaign – and for the reputation of German politics in Europe. • Translated by Jan K Schwing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/blog/2013/jun/27/george-osborne-danny-alexander-sketch","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-27T18:48:44Z","webTitle":"At home with George and Danny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/jun/27/george-osborne-danny-alexander-sketch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2013/jun/27/george-osborne-danny-alexander-sketch","fields":{"headline":"At home with George and Danny","bodyText":"Danny Alexander scratched his head and raised his hand. \"Excuse me, Mr Osborne, but when you have a spare moment, can you help me again?\" The chancellor sighed and put down his PlayStation 3 controller. \"What is it this time, Danny?\" he asked, though not unkindly. \"It's my statement on all the new infrastructure spending we're planning.

Next year: 2.4% instead of 1.8%. Following four years: 2.2%, 2.6%, 2.7% and 2.7%. • Britain 'growing faster than any other major economy', chancellor George Osborne says. • Euro area GDP will shrink by 0.4% in 2013, predicts OBR. Deficit and debt • Underlying deficit – excluding Royal Mail pension scheme and asset purchase facility – due to fall to 6.8% of GDP this year (previous prediction was 7.5%), then next year 5.6%, then 4.4%, 2.7%, 1.2%. By 2018-19 no deficit – instead a small surplus. Deficit was 11% of GDP when government came to office. • Borrowing is down more than forecast, and the government will meet its \"fiscal mandate\" a year early, chancellor says. The government will borrow £111bn this year - £9bn less than predicted in March. Borrowing will fall to £96bn next year, then £79bn, £51bn and £23bn in following years, he says. • Debt is forecast to be 75.5% of GDP this year, rising to 78.3% next year and 80% in 2015, before falling to 79.9% in 2016 then 78.4% at 75.9% in following years. By 2017-18, debt is forecast to be over £80bn lower than forecast in March budget, and debt predicted to be falling in 2016-17, a year earlier than previously predicted. • A new charter for budget responsibility will be introduced next year. This will look at committing the government to running a surplus. The government will see if the five-year timescale for cutting the deficit could be cut. The plan will be put to a vote in parliament. • Read more: what is the deficit, and what is debt? Employment • OBR's employment forecasts revised up. Number of jobs will rise 400,000 this year. Unemployment forecast to fall from 7.6% this year to 7% by 2015 and 5.6% by 2018. OBR forecasts that private businesses will create 3.1 million more jobs by 2019, more than offsetting reductions in public sector workforce. • Funding for Jobcentres to support 16- and 17-year-olds in finding apprenticeships or traineeships. Jobseekers aged 18 to 21 without basic maths or English will be required to undertake training in these skills or lose their benefits. There will be a requirement for jobseekers aged 18 to 21 to start a traineeship, work experience or community work after six months or lose their benefits. HM Revenue and Customs will fund employers directly for apprenticeships with an extra 20,000 higher apprenticeships over next two years. • Employer national insurance contributions will be removed on workers aged under 21, affecting 1.5 million jobs. Recession • Office for Budget Responsibility says Office for National Statistics has reassessed recession. Fall in GDP between 2008 and 2009 was not 6.3% but 7.2%. • There was no double-dip recession, data revisions state. Business • The export finance capacity for UK businesses has been doubled to £50bn to help firms. • There will be an additional 50,000 start-up loans for entrepreneurs and an extension to the new Enterprise Allowance. • The small business rate relief scheme will be extended for one year from April 2014. Inflation increase in business rates capped at 2% from April 2014. Businesses will be allowed to pay their rates in 12-month instalments. Every business in a retail premises, used as a shop, pub or restaurant, with a rateable value of up to £50,000 will get a business rates discount worth £1,000. • There will be a new reoccupation relief to encourage the use of vacant town centre shops, halving the rates for new occupants. Welfare • The overall welfare budget will be capped. Only 50% of UK spending is subject to fixed budget controls. From next year welfare will be included. But state pensions will not be included. Cyclical benefits for job seekers will not be included. The chancellor will set the cap at the start of each parliament. If it is breached, there will be a vote. Departmental budgets • Government's contingency reserve will be reduced by £1bn this year and departmental budgets by similar amount in the next two years, saving £3bn. The NHS, schools and security services are exempted. Military • The military special reserve will be reduced by a further £900m, while still funding all operational costs, because of winding down in Afghanistan. An additional £100m of Libor fines will go to military charities and help will be extended to charities for the emergency services. State pension • The state pension will rise by £2.95 a week from next April, leaving pensioners £800 a year better off from government measures since 2010, Osborne says. Pensioners will be offered the opportunity to make voluntary national insurance contributions to boost their retirement income. The new principle that people should spend one third of their adult lives in retirement implies an increase in the state pension age to 68 in the mid-2030s and 69 in the late 2040s. Tax • A package of measures to tackle tax avoidance, evasion, fraud and error will raise more than £9bn over the next five years. • Capital gains tax will be imposed on non-residents who sell residential property in the UK from April 2015. • Rolling back green levies takes an average £50 off energy bills, Osborne says. Bank levy • The rate of the bank levy will rise to 0.156% from 1 January 2014 and it will raise £2.7bn in 2014-15 and £2.9bn a year from 2015-16. Infrastructure • An infrastructure plan includes an agreement with Hitachi on the next nuclear power station in Anglesey, a deal with the insurance industry to invest £25bn and support for long-term investment in offshore wind energy. Science • A commitment to invest in quantum technology, a tax allowance halving taxes on early profits in shale gas and a new science centre in Edinburgh University named for the discoverer of the Higgs-boson particle. Housing • New loans worth £1bn intended to unblock housing developments, including in Manchester and Leeds. The Housing Revenue Account borrowing limit will be raised by £300m. There will be a new priority \"right to move\" for social tenants who need to relocate for a job. Schools • Financial resources provided to fund expansion of free school meals to all schoolchildren in reception, year one and year two. Universities • Next year another 30,000 student places will be available. From next year the cap on student numbers will be abolished altogether. Shares • Stamp duty for shares purchased in exchange traded funds will be abolished. Culture • The film tax relief scheme will be made more generous, with the possibility of extending this to regional theatre. Married couples • From April 2015 there will be a new transferable tax allowance for married couples, and an \"uprating mechanism\" will be introduced to ensure the transferable tax allowance will be increased in line with the personal allowance. Transport • Next year's fuel duty rise (supposed to be 2p a litre) cancelled. That means petrol will be 20p a litre less than under Labour's plans, he says. • Plans to increase train fares by 1% above inflation from January are cancelled, so fares will go up in line with inflation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/10/derrik-littler","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-10T11:21:27Z","webTitle":"Derrik Littler obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/10/derrik-littler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/10/derrik-littler","fields":{"headline":"Derrik Littler obituary","bodyText":"My former colleague Derrik Littler, a pioneer of nuclear power, has died aged 92. In New Mexico, in July 1945, Derrik witnessed the world's first atomic bomb explosion and was one of the first members of the team to go up to the bomb crater to collect results. After the test, he joined the newly formed Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire. There, he worked on the first British nuclear reactor, the Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile, and developed an oscillation technique for measuring neutron absorption characteristics of a wide range of materials. A major discovery of this work was that magnesium had a low neutron absorption cross-section, and this led to the development of a magnesium alloy (Magnox) for the cladding material enclosing the uranium fuel rods in the first British commercial nuclear power stations. He wrote up this work as a doctoral thesis. Derrik was born in Cheshire and moved to London in 1934 when his father, who worked for ICI, was transferred to head office. He attended Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster) and studied physics at Imperial College London. He took his final BSc examination early, in June 1939, and had to stay on for another year to be awarded his degree so that he had undertaken sufficient study to fulfil the regulations. This research work on electron diffraction at different temperatures would have led to a PhD, but this was prevented by the outbreak of the second world war. Derrik joined the army to work on defusing unexploded bombs, but it was felt that his talents would be better used in the Ministry of Supply measuring the explosive effects of bombs. In 1945 he was seconded to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos to help prepare for the test of the first atomic bomb. He married Patricia in 1953 and, two years later, was seconded to the United Nations in New York to help organise the first International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. On his return he set up the Harwell Reactor School to train scientists and engineers for the design and operation of commercial nuclear power stations. He co-wrote a textbook on the physics of nuclear reactors, and was the editor of The Journal of Nuclear Energy from 1954 to 1972. In 1959 he joined the Central Electricity Generating Board which was setting up the facilities to support the nuclear power stations then under construction. He joined as chief physicist in the research department, and later became director-general of research, responsible for staff in three laboratories. In 1981 he became principal at the new CEGB staff training college. He retired in 1983. Derrik was a keen gardener who produced prize-winning roses, and became a qualified judge of flowers, fruit and vegetables. One of his proudest achievements was to persuade the BBC Gardeners' Question Time to broadcast from his horticultural society in Hatch End, north-west London. He was well-liked by his colleagues and is survived by Patricia, his son John and daughter Anne."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/aug/21/david-cameron-fracking-green-investors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-21T11:52:36Z","webTitle":"David Cameron has become fracking's biggest cheerleader | Matthew Spencer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/21/david-cameron-fracking-green-investors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/aug/21/david-cameron-fracking-green-investors","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron has become fracking's biggest cheerleader","bodyText":"Any new technology has a short honeymoon period where its attractions loom large before practicalities intervene to burst the bubble and a more realistic picture of its costs and benefits emerges. I should know, I helped to raise expectations about the future of UK wave power in the early 2000s. Our hope that large wave farms would be up and running within the decade proved distinctly optimistic. But most politicians develop an instinctive reflex against technological optimism, understanding the power of events and uncertainty to change the future. But there has been no such caution from the prime minister over shale gas. The government were already bullish about exploration, but David Cameron has chosen to become the industry's biggest cheerleader. He hasn't asked us to keep an open mind, he's been determined to \"win the debate\" so that the public \"get behind fracking\". It reminds me of Tony Blair's unsuccessful attempt in 1999 to convince the British public to accept GM food, but looking back at his statements they were far more balanced than those Cameron has been making. Blair admitted the \"jury was still out\" on GM, which remains the case 15 years on. Cameron brokers no doubts and states: \"If we don't back this technology, we will miss a massive opportunity to help families with their bills\". So that's absolutely categorical then. You can start reducing your energy company direct debit now. Why would he do this? Zoe Williams, writing in the Guardian last week, suggested that electioneering has led to this fracking evangelism, but will it really win Conservative votes? Its proponents don't expect shale gas to be in production by the election, so there is no prospect of it impacting on energy bills in 2015. The fact that many exploration sites are in Conservative voting shires, and that 30% of the British public are already opposed to fracking suggests that the prime minister will need extraordinary powers of persuasion to make this a vote winner. So he must be motivated by something greater than electoral calculation. My suspicion is that it's the allure of being responsible for unleashing a disruptive technology with the potential for big economic and political impact. Prime ministers can lose their healthy scepticism after a few years at the top. Weighed down by the inertia of Whitehall, and isolated from real life they become susceptible to \"white heat\" visions that appeal to the desire to be remembered as successful reformers. These technology visions are rarely successful, but they do have an impact. Tony Blair didn't break the public's hostility to GM food, but he did delay the point at which he personally engaged with environmental security. He didn't succeed in achieving a nuclear renaissance either, but he did ensure that nuclear power was put back on the agenda. The opportunity costs of Cameron's fracking push are much more economically significant. He may be right that the shale industry will become significant in the UK, but he has also signalled that the much bigger and more immediate investment the UK is making in renewable energy matters less. Low-carbon energy and transport make up 70% of the UK's infrastructure investment pipeline, but David Cameron has not made a public speech on the benefits of decarbonising the UK energy system or the case for tackling climate change in his three years as prime minister. Investors have noticed, and are interpreting fracking fever as a further sign that the Conservatives have lost their appetite for low carbon energy. There are Conservatives working hard to re-establish the party's narrative on the green economy, but the PM's reticence to make the case publicly means that it is unlikely that the party will find its green voice again before the election. This means that the onus is now on Labour and the Lib Dems to consolidate the centre ground on climate change and reassert the economic and social case for decarbonisation. This doesn't mean that they have to promise a moratorium on fracking, but it does require them to chart a more evidential route to testing its benefits, and to remind the public that we have much bigger fish to fry. It's their opportunity to champion the investment and jobs in the growing cleantech sector, and to pitch an ambitious programme that really would reduce energy bills by helping more people insulate their homes and switch to better appliances. The PM has made a surprising choice to champion fracking above renewable energy investment. A shale gas revolution clearly excites him more than the modernisation and decarbonisation of our energy system. But his vision of shale gas as a game changer for the UK economy is vulnerable to the realities of geology, public opinion and markets, and is unlikely to pay political dividends. • Matthew Spencer is director of the thinktank Green Alliance.

The move underlines growing pressure on the French company's internal finances and has reignited a fractious debate about Communist state-run businesses playing a critical role in sensitive western energy infrastructure. The overtures to Beijing's state corporations – as well as approaches to Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds – come as EDF faces growing investment demands in France and the UK that have sent debt levels rocketing to €39.7bn (£30bn). \"We have always said we were open to the idea of other partners investing in the project. As we approach our final investment decision, it is right to consider funding options including seeking additional partners,\" said an EDF spokesman. \"Plans to build new reactors are advancing well and have achieved a level of maturity to make it attractive to potential new investors,\" he added. \"However, it is too early to say anything about the outcome [of these talks].\" EDF Energy owns and operates eight of the UK's existing 10 nuclear power stations and has plans to expand two of these sites, Hinkley Point and Sizewell, Suffolk, by building four new nuclear reactors. The company plans to make a final investment decision on Hinkley Point C by the end of this year but remains upbeat about the scheme, on which it has already spent £1bn. While EDF would not publicly confirm it, well-placed industry sources say the group, which has a 20% partner in Centrica already, has been in discussions with China's State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC) and China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC). These are the rival state-owned companies that have already teamed up with two Western consortiums vying to buy the Horizon Nuclear Power company from RWE and E.ON. Horizon owns sites at Wylfa, on Anglesey, and Oldbury, South Gloucestershire. SNPTC is in a bidding team with Areva, the French engineering company that is already working with EDF in Somerset, while talks have already been held by Chinese officials with the UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change about independently developing other nuclear sites in Britain such as Hartlepool in the north-east of England. Mark Pritchard, a Conservative MP and member of the parliamentary joint national security committee, said any Chinese involvement in EDF's new nuclear plans would raise concerns on a number of fronts and could even require a direct UK government involvement through some kind of golden share. \"If there is significant Chinese financing, then the coalition government should consider retaining a controlling stake,\" he said. \"There would also need to be national security safeguards over any Chinese design and build.\" \"Restrictions should also apply as to the number of Chinese workers who could work on UK-based nuclear projects. Major nuclear infrastructure projects are an opportunity to create tens of thousands of new jobs for UK workers.\" Nick Butler, a former energy adviser to Number 10, has earlier raised concerns about Chinese involvement in any potential Horizon bids. In a recent FT blog, he wrote: \"They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology.\" Meanwhile, EDF last month revealed its debt levels had jumped nearly 20% in the first half of the year, partly because of €10bn in new spending commitments demanded by the French government on local reactors in the aftermath of the Fukushima atomic crisis in March last year. The energy company – majority owned by the French state – is also facing mounting cost overruns and delays on its planned new reactor scheme at Flamanville in northern France. A final green light for Hinkley Point C depends on receiving an acceptable \"strike price\", agreed with the government, that would guarantee future returns. EDF insists this strike price – seen by critics as unfair subsidy – will be lower than the £140 per megawatt hour that is roughly the current cost of producing offshore wind power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/aug/02/uk-shale-gas-fracking-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-02T05:59:00Z","webTitle":"End this love for dirty fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/02/uk-shale-gas-fracking-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/aug/02/uk-shale-gas-fracking-renewables","fields":{"headline":"End this love for dirty fuels","bodyText":"That blaring noise you can hear could be the sound of the UK missing the boat. A succession of crises over more than a decade revealed the UK's dependence on fossil fuels, increasingly imported, to be both perilous and expensive. The fuel protests of 2000 showed the interconnected vulnerability of our food and fuel systems, while the oil price spike of 2008 revealed the economy as hostage to volatile market. You'd think then, that if only as an exercise in prudent government – forget about climate change for a moment – aggressive energy diversification into abundant, domestic renewable sources would be a good idea. Yet, if anything, flip-flopping on feed-in tariffs and scaldingly negative remarks from the chancellor, George Osborne, and others have, wilfully or not, undermined a whole UK industrial sector just as it could be growing, creating jobs and being a world leader. Renewables are, according to the International Energy Agency, now the fastest growing global energy sector, set to beat gas and generate double the supply from nuclear power by 2016. You might think that any government would look at a market like that, which can only get bigger (while oil, for example, by definition can only do the opposite), and want a big slice. Why, then, would the Treasury go out of its way to remain in ignorance of both the problem and the opportunity represented by climate change and the challenge of resource depletion? In March it was revealed that the most powerful department in government had its head shoved firmly in the sand. A group of senior economists from across Whitehall wanted to review how resource scarcity and climate change would interact with the economy and effect growth. The interests of both industry and environmental groups were to be explored and both sectors were supportive of the study. But the proposal was apparently killed by the Treasury's chief economist as 'too speculative' in its reach. Less speculative unfortunately, is the recent trajectory of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on imported fossil fuels. Even discounting the UK's 'hidden emissions' embedded in the goods we import and consume, carbon emissions rose by 4% in 2012, driven by a surge in the use of coal to generate electricity. In comparison, to reach a fair and climate-safe level, emissions need to fall by something of the order of 10% per year for the foreseeable future. Figures from the Department of Energy and Climate Change also revealed that energy imports rose by 7% meaning that we are now dependent on imports for nearly half (43%) of our energy use. More positively, in spite of the instability introduced to the green energy sector by government policy, in line with the global upswing, electricity generated from renewables went up by about one fifth in 2012 compared to the previous year. Yet, from the apparently 'desolate' north, to the Tory front line of the home counties, political priority is given to the development of shale gas, a difficult, dirty and inefficient fuel to exploit, whose extraction will accelerate climate change. Last month I wrote about how the American petro-state of Louisiana exhibited the characteristics of a developing country suffering the 'resource curse.' It had the paradox of huge revenues from exploiting natural resources leading not to human flourishing, but instead dependency, corruption, environmental damage and appalling social indicators. Since then, Louisiana appears to be having second thoughts. It seems, in effect, to be suing itself for decades of damage resulting from dependence on fossil fuel earnings. Officials from the state body responsible for flood protection are suing a host of energy companies including BP and Exxon Mobil for damage to vulnerable coastal wetlands that are vital to protecting the land from extreme weather, such as the impact of worsening hurricanes. A 'buffer' that took 6,000 years to form, they say has 'been brought to the brink of destruction over the course of a single human lifetime.' It has set experts against politicians, with the Republican state governor accusing his officials of overstepping their authority. Today there is generally a much higher level of awareness about the impact of the fossil fuel industry, both locally and globally. In spite of perverse political backing, its future is less than bright. There are the hard-won lessons of places like Louisiana. Middle class militancy is breaking out on the fracking front line of Balcombe, West Sussex before even a pilot drill has gone down, and former oil engineers turned renewable entrepreneurs like Jeremy Leggett predicting that not a single commercial well will open. Suddenly the renewables boat seems to offer a much smoother and less stressful journey. Time to climb aboard. • Onehundredmonths.org"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/16/pupils-return-to-school-in-fukushima-shadow","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-16T09:35:36Z","webTitle":"Pupils return to school in Fukushima's shadow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/16/pupils-return-to-school-in-fukushima-shadow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/16/pupils-return-to-school-in-fukushima-shadow","fields":{"headline":"Pupils return to school in Fukushima's shadow","bodyText":"Kawauchi has welcomed back its youngest residents with music, applause and speeches – but not a single reference to radiation – as the village, located in the shadow of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, took a cautious first step towards post-meltdown normality. Teachers and parents fought back tears when pupils from the local nursery, primary and middle schools began a new term recently, more than a year after the nuclear accident forced them out of their homes. While workers at the plant struggle to contain thousands of tonnes of radioactive water and begin a decommissioning operation expected to last decades, the government earlier this month lifted evacuation orders in three locations just outside the 12-mile no-go zone. In the coming weeks, 16,000 of the more than 100,000 people displaced by the nuclear crisis could be able to return to their old neighbourhoods, although they will not be allowed to stay overnight until their homes have been decontaminated. \"There were times when we never thought we would be able to return and get on with our lives again,\" Yoshinobu Ishii, the head of Kawauchi board of education, told parents and children. \"There are only a few of us here, and I know you are missing your friends who are still living in temporary accommodation. These things take time. And remember, the whole of Japan wants us to succeed.\" The village of Tamura has also lifted its evacuation order, and Minamisoma is expected to shortly do the same for parts of the city closest to the power plant. But residents of eight other towns and villages located wholly or partially inside the evacuation zone have little idea of when, or if, they will be able to return. The minister in charge of tsunami reconstruction, Tatsuo Hirano, has hinted that a permanent nuclear \"buffer zone\" could be created around the plant due to the persistent threat from radioactive water leaks. Officials in Kawauchi have been preparing to welcome residents back after they reopened the village office in March. The mayor, Yuko Endo, took the controversial decision to encourage people to return after he visited to Pripyat, a deserted town near Chernobyl, scene of the catastrophic meltdown in 1986. Kawauchi, he decided, would not become a second Pripyat. \"You have become courageous over the past year,\" Endo said at a ceremony to welcome new pupils at the village community centre. \"You've had a tough time as refugees, but now you can concentrate on the things that matter, like school and home.\" Endo, rather optimistically, has said he hopes that Kawauchi's population will return to pre-disaster levels in two to three years. Yet of the original population of 2,856, only 533 have returned. Had the nuclear accident never happened, Kawauchi's nursery, primary and middle schools would have had more than 200 pupils on their rolls this year; instead there are just 30. \"I'm still not sure that we've done the right thing,\" says Hirotaka Suzuki, whose 12-year-old son, Hideyoshi, is starting middle school. \"It's not as if there is no radiation at all here.\" Suzuki and his family started living together in their decontaminated home only last week, after more than a year in temporary accommodation in the nearby city of Koriyama. \"I'm glad that some people have decided to come back,\" he adds, \"But I worry that life here will never be what it was.\" In post-meltdown Japan, residents near the crippled plant find their immediate future determined by a new radiation zoning system. The government's panel on nuclear compensation has recommended that people in neighbourhoods where radiation exceeds 50 millisieverts a year – rendering them uninhabitable for at least five years – should receive a lump sum of ¥6m (£40,000) each in compensation. Residents of areas where levels are between 20 and 50 mSv a year will receive 2.4 million yen. The village's three schools and clinic have reopened, but Kawauchi, whose eastern reaches lie inside the 12-mile evacuation zone, is still living in nuclear limbo. The decontamination effort is far from complete, and authorities will have to keep a close watch on radiation levels. Areas in front of the schools measured between 0.114 and 0.16 microsieverts an hour last week – below the 0.23 microsieverts an hour the government considers safe. But in another part of the village the reading rose to 0.25 microsieverts an hour. Workers are decontaminating 23 homes belonging to families with young children, but most shops and restaurants are still shuttered. Fields that once yielded tonnes of rice are now a mass of tangled weeds and grass. The village authorities have told farmers not to plant rice this year, the damage radiation has caused to Fukushima's farming industry would render any crops unsellable. A few farmers say they will plant rice anyway, for use as biofuel. Amid the modest signs of human activity, Kawauchi has the feel of a village under siege. Police cars patrol around the clock to deter burglars, and to ensure that no one enters the exclusion zone. The radiation monitors positioned around the village are a constant reminder of the invisible threat that sent residents fleeing and will keep many of them away for months – perhaps years – to come. Now that he has persuaded about a sixth of the population to return, Endo's mission is to convince the remainder to follow, or accept that Kawauchi may be living on borrowed time. As he told the new intake of pupils: \"I want you to let everyone else know that life is good here, that there is a future for this village.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2013/oct/28/britain-storm-winds-death-flooding","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-28T16:36:00Z","webTitle":"UK death toll mounts as St Jude storm leaves trail of destruction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/28/britain-storm-winds-death-flooding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2013/oct/28/britain-storm-winds-death-flooding","fields":{"headline":"UK death toll mounts as St Jude storm leaves trail of destruction","bodyText":"A huge operation is under way to try and restore power to thousands of homes and reopen transport networks after storm-force winds left four dead and cut a path of destruction across a vast swath of southern England. At least four people were killed in separate incidents, after trees were felled by winds gusting up to nearly 100mph, more than 310,0000 homes were without power, and the rail network was reduced to chaos. Although the storm – named St Jude after the feast day of the patron saint of lost causes – was not as ferocious as the great storm of 1987, and the authorities had better warning and were better prepared, it still brought fatalities in its wake. A 17-year-old girl was killed in Kent when a tree fell on her static home, and a 50-year-old man died in Watford when his vehicle was struck by a falling tree. The bodies of a man and a woman were found in the rubble of a house in Hounslow, west London, where a falling tree is thought to have caused a gas explosion. Another woman was still unaccounted for, while a 14-year-old boy is also feared dead after being swept into the sea at Newhaven, in Sussex, on Sunday. The storm struck overnight, making landfall in the south-west before dawn, sweeping along the south coast – where the Met Office recorded a gust of 99mph on the Isle of Wight at 5am – before heading towards London at the height of the rush hour. East Anglia was the storm's final sting in the tail, before it headed out to the North Sea and towards The Netherlands in mid-morning. In Kent, 17-year-old Bethany Freeman was killed when a tree crashed into her static home at Hever, near Edenbridge, where she was sleeping, at around 7.20am on Monday. Neighbours using chainsaws tried to rescue her but she was pronounced dead by paramedics. A man in his 50s, from Harrow, north London, died when his moving car was struck by a falling tree at the eastern end of the bridge over the river Colne on Lower High Street, in Watford. Police said it was a major artery into town and if it had not been school half-term could have had consequences for transport in the area. He was later named as Donal Drohan, 51, originally from Waterford in south-east Ireland. A statement from his family said: \"He was the best husband and father anyone could wish for. You couldn't find anyone who had a bad word to say about him. He was very supportive to everybody who knew him and couldn't say no to helping out with anything.\" The bodies found in Hounslow, were in a property devastated after a falling tree led to a suspected gas explosion. Three people were rescued by London fire brigade. Station manager Matt Burrows described a scene of utter devastation. \"Debris was scattered over an area of about 50 metres [160ft] and the roof of one of the houses was in a tree across the road,\" he said. David Cameron said the loss of life was \"hugely regrettable\". The prime minister said the government was working to make sure that the emergency services were able to do as much as possible to provide assistance. On a visit to the Mini vehicle plant in Oxford, he said: \"We have to make sure the emergency services can act as fast as they can to help people.\" About 130 flights were cancelled at Heathrow and ferry services were disrupted, with the port of Dover closed for nearly three hours, but the worst disruption was reserved for the road and rail network. Busy commuter stations in London and across the south-east were eerily deserted for the normal Monday morning return-to-work, as rail operators decided to suspend services until Network Rail officials had checked the tracks were clear of obstructions. By Monday afternoon, Southeastern, South West Trains and Southern were running heavily revised and reduced timetables. Most Greater Anglia services into London's Liverpool Street, including the Stansted express, were suspended because of overhead wire damage, and East Coast were unable to operate between London's Kings Cross station and Peterborough. East Midlands were unable to run any trains out of London's St Pancras for the rest of the day, while there were long delays on the West Coast mainline into London Euston. Around 300,000 homes suffered power cuts at some point, the Energy Networks Association said, with energy restored to around 30,000 by mid-afternoon. The Environment Agency said there were six flood warnings in place England and Wales and 115 flood alerts. At the height of the storm, major road bridges, including the Dartford and Severn crossings, were closed, while fallen trees and overturned lorries caused tailbacks on main routes, including the M11 in Essex and M2 in Kent. A double-decker bus \"rolled over\" in Suffolk, injuring the driver and several passengers. Witnesses told police the vehicle blew over at 8am in Hadleigh, rolling on to its side and coming to a stop in a field. Whitehall, in central London, was closed due to a collapsed crane near the Cabinet Office. Staff were evacuated and the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, had to cancel a press conference. A 14-year-old boy feared dead after being swept into the sea in rough weather has been named by sources as Dylan Alkins. The teenager disappeared while playing in the surf at West Beach in Newhaven at about 4.15pm on Sunday. Rescue teams, including a coastguard helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat, scoured the area in what were described as atrocious conditions. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the operation had now become one of search and recovery. A spokeswoman said rescue teams had struggled in difficult conditions and that police were with the boy's family. In Kent, the Dungeness nuclear power station partially shut down after the storm caused power cuts, said EDF Energy. In a statement on its website, EDF said two units at the plant shut down at 7.44am. \"The shutdown was weather-related. The plant reacted as it should and shut down safely,\" a spokeswoman said. Several hundred Network Rail staff worked through the night to deal with disruption caused by the severe weather, with more than 100 trees reported to have fallen onto tracks. Special trains were used to clear tracks, the director of operations, Robin Gisby, said. \"In four cases the train being sent through to inspect the line has hit a fallen tree and we have one train in Devon which is currently disabled following a collision with a fallen tree. We are also dealing with a landslip in the New Forest area. \"While conditions were as forecast during the early part of the morning, the damage caused by the storm has been more severe than expected as it has tracked eastwards to the north of London and across to East Anglia.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/apr/10/war-nuclear-environmentalists-vicious","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-10T11:01:09Z","webTitle":"Vicious words mark the war between pro and anti-nuclear environmentalists | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/apr/10/war-nuclear-environmentalists-vicious","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/apr/10/war-nuclear-environmentalists-vicious","fields":{"headline":"Vicious words mark the war between pro and anti-nuclear environmentalists","bodyText":"The war of words between the pro- and anti-nuclear environmentalists shows no sign of ending, with those writers in favour – George Monbiot, Mark Lynas, Fred Pearce and Stephen Tindale – now slugging it out with those campaigning against – Jonathon Porritt, Tom Burke, Tony Juniper and Charles Secrett. Everyone is pretending to be quite grown-up, polite and cool, but actually it's getting vicious. Apart from a few gratuitous insults on either side, the dispute that has rumbled on for a few years has so far been largely technocratic and conducted with political and personal respect. In the latest skirmishes, the four former heads of Friends of the Earth (FoE) politely wrote to the prime minister advising him to drop nuclear power on cost and other grounds; whereupon the hacks also wrote to No 10 saying this advice undermined government climate change policy. Over the next month Porritt, Burke &amp; co will issue four or five more intellectual blasts, and will convene a press conference, and we can expect the hacks to respond. Until now it has been a classic \"fundi\" and \"realo\" split with the pros' (the realos) desperation to address climate change set against the antis' (the fundis) conviction that nuclear takes too long, is too expensive and won't actually work. But now, the dispute is getting personal and much closer to the political bone with the fallout potentially damaging the whole idea of \"environmentalism\". First we have Lynas suggesting that nuclear protesters are not really environmentalists at all, then Monbiot doubted Burke's commitment to the environment – despite his 40 years' active service. Now, in an extraordinary exchange of emails between Monbiot and Theo Simon – who is one half of the renowned radical protest band Seize the Day – all opponents of nuclear power are said to have made their arguments \"with levels of bullshit and junk science\". Here's part of Monbiot's letter, sent to Simon even as he was occupying a farmhouse in protest against the way that EDF were going about the works at Hinkley: The uncomfortable fact is that the opponents of nuclear power (among whom I numbered until recently) have justified their position with levels of bullshit and junk science very similar to those used by the climate change deniers, and Stop Hinkley is no exception. When I wrote to Katy Attwater [a Stop Hinkley spokeswoman], expressing my concerns about the quality of the scientific evidence on their site, she told me 'I have no faith in the scientific peer review process as it currently works.' Just like James Delingpole, David Bellamy etc when it comes to climate science. Monbiot then begs Simon to give up his protest, which he says is both \"wrong\" and dangerous: We need you too much for the battles that need to be fought. God knows there are enough of them. But the inevitable result of this one, if it succeeds, will be to raise our greenhouse gas emissions, help threaten life on earth and compromise the life chances both of future generations and of people living now in countries poorer than our own. That is not what you or any of us began campaigning for. But as the results of both the German and Japanese experiments demonstrate, it's now clear that this will be the legacy of anti-nuclear campaigning. Please think again before you counteract all the good work you've done on other issues. You can imagine how this appeal from the heart went down with Simon, who last month was given a conditional discharge of six months for the Hinkley protest and has been putting himself on the physical frontline for years. Describing Monbiot's email as \"patronising\", he waited a few days and then wrote back with a series of points that the pro-nukers have not so far addressed - like the assertion that the technology demands a stable and continuous technocratic society to exist for centuries, and entrenches power in the hands of a state-protected, unaccountable and ruthless elite. Here's some of his letter: We need more than ever to champion a vision of the kind of creativity which a democratic revolution would rapidly liberate. Nuclear … can give no ultimate assurance of it's safety or its costs. Neither can it demonstrate the kind of long-term resilience which may prove necessary if runaway climate change does, in spite of our efforts, develop. Resilience is to my mind something which we should be designing into our energy production plans now, as the future is so uncertain for our children. Nuclear requires a stable and continuous technocratic society to exist for centuries. He goes on: [Monbiot and other writers'] public promotions of nuclear have disorientated and disheartened the green movement and the left, while finding a willing audience among the broader middle-class who welcome a chance to salve their guilt about energy-intensive lifestyles with the reassuring news that 'apparently nuclear's OK now, and it's the only way to solve climate change'. You can't really be surprised – or even dismayed - that so many people respond emotively to your propagandising for nuclear. From their point of view you seem to have become a one-man pro-bono PR company! In the letter you just co-authored to Cameron you suggest that nuclear would be a lot cheaper and better by now if Porritt and FoE etc hadn't 'devoted decades' to fighting it. Well they did. Lots of people did. Personally I'm proud of it, even if I regret that our political naivety, coupled with the defeat of working-class representation in that decade, meant that capitalism and it's appetites continued unabated. If we had moved in a more rational direction back then, renewables and other energy options could also have been a lot further developed by now, and the fabled 'energy gap', which you say we need nuclear to fill, might look a lot smaller. Monbiot, who is offline until April 16 after becoming a new father, has yet to reply. We are starting to get to the heart of what it means to be green today. One vision can justify a corrupt and odious state if it can make an odious technology work to overcome a terrible danger. The other argues that there are far better ways to achieve the same end without the resulting damage to society and the long-term dangers that the technology entails. The questions raised are profoundly difficult and need to be debated, but personal attacks are inflammatory and really help no one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/25/ed-miliband-energy-labour-future","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-25T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband, energy and Labour's future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/25/ed-miliband-energy-labour-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/25/ed-miliband-energy-labour-future","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband, energy and Labour's future","bodyText":"A Labour campaign concentrating merely on living standards will be shallow, unimaginative, expedient and stuck in the same old discourse of postwar British politics (Miliband fires up faithful with assault on fuel giants, 25 September). It will ignore the desperate need for a framework of critique and policy to challenge and reform the structures of the inequality which is undermining democracy and intensifying health, economic, environmental and social problems. An understanding of inequality and an account of its ramifications should be the spine of Labour's strategy, informing its positions on every issue, for example housing, taxation, child care, education, health, food, social services, welfare, role of trade unions and constitutional change. Positions grounded in explicit analyses of inequality, challenging conventional wisdoms, will move debates away from blaming victims. It's obvious that Labour needs to be \"for\" something. In the recession and its aftermath inequalities could hardly be clearer. So, will Labour waste the opportunity this crisis offers finally to take on inequality? John Roberts Dursley, Gloucestershire • As a relatively frequent critic of Ed Miliband and Labour policy, I think his pledge to freeze energy prices is a cracker. It means that privatisation was wrong from the start. All that has happened is that we now have half-a-dozen private firms, all with highly paid executives and shareholders to keep happy, running a system which used to run by civil servants, just as efficiently and at a lower cost. What should have been \"liberated\" was the ability for new companies to provide energy to the national system, if they could do so at a lower price. I don't expect we will see nationalisation on any agenda, but hopefully this move will bring some balance back to the energy business. Now how about railways, water and the rest? David Reed London • Ed Miliband could not have picked a better topic to kick off a debate on the future of our economy. Energy is where Britain can tackle serious economic problems at the same time as social ones. There is a growing community energy industry in this country where neighbours are collaborating, creating jobs and growing their social capital as well as economic power. There are social investors helping them flourish. Recent research suggests that community energy could grow to 89 times its current size if existing barriers were lowered. There is much to learn from the way other countries whose companies own our energy providers are developing their own community energy and renewables at a fast pace, while the UK suffers. This debate cannot be about big state versus big business, but about big problems versus big opportunities. The energy market is a perfect illustration of how economic and social policy can and must be mutually reinforcing in 21st-century Britain.

If Ed Milliband ever makes prime minister and attempts to deliver on this headline-grabbing promise, he will spend the rest of that parliament trying to pick up the pieces of an energy system that is already almost broken and will inevitably collapse under this ill-researched piece of political posturing. In this he will fail (since no government in the past three decades has done anything significant to improve our energy infrastructure) and subsequent governments will be haunted by the mess left behind, just as the British people are haunted by the financial shambles left behind by New Labour. We are trying to break away from fossil fuels, but we have failed to replace nuclear power plants at a rate appropriate to the phasing out of the earlier stations. Renewable power (particularly wind turbines) has proved to be more politically motivated hot air than solid power-generating sense. And Labour was forced to pour money into the banking system to prevent its complete collapse – money which could have been spent on energy research and on modernising our energy infrastructure. John S Parris Haresfield, Gloucestershire • If nothing else, the threat of the power companies to turn the lights off in the face of price controls illustrates anew precisely why energy should be owned and controlled by the state. Natural monopolies, as exemplified here by power generation and distribution, should never be in private hands – the risk of blackmail is just too high. Alistair Richardson Stirling • At the age of 92, I have been longing for the kind of speech which Ed Miliband gave on Tuesday, as policies based on real socialist principles are, at last, made clear. Ten years ago, Blair's policies caused me to leave the Labour party; Miliband has encouraged me to rejoin. I hope many other of your readers do the same. Martin Sheldon Oxford • Red Ed? Don't make me laugh! Red Ed would have taken the gas and electricity companies back into public ownership rather than reining in their obscene profits for a couple of years. Alan Wright Worthing, West Sussex • I'm not a man of violence but I have to admit I took enormous vicarious pleasure from seeing Steve Bell's cartoon depiction of Ed Miliband rise up Charles Atlas-style to dob David Cameron straight in the middle of his repellently smooth and smug pink face, something I feel like doing every time I see him on TV. It perfectly caught the feeling of liberation that the Labour leader's spirited speech created, making it seem possible that – at last – a real fightback is possible against this ghastly, overbearing Tory-led coalition, on behalf of \"weaklings\" everywhere.

The drama at Ardrossan windfarm in North Ayrshire – which was caught on film – became a defining image of hurricane-force winds that peaked at 165mph, bringing down power lines and leaving about 60,000 people without electricity. For some, the fire symbolised all that is wrong with wind turbines. Sir Bernard Ingham, secretary of the Supporters of Nuclear Energy group, said: \"They are no good when the wind doesn't blow and they are no good when the wind does blow.\" The Daily Mail columnist Alexander Boot quipped that turbines were more use as firewood. While the turbine grabbed attention, a power line running into Hunterston power station, also on Scotland's west coast, was brought down by the gale, causing the 460-megawatt B-8 nuclear reactor to cease generating for 54 hours. Infinis, which owns the windfarm, and EDF Energy, which owns the power station, both refused to disclose how much energy they were unable to generate. But Dr Ian Lange, director of the MSc in energy management at Stirling University, says the impact of the nuclear outage was much more significant. He points out that while the blazing windfarm hit the headlines, \"severe weather can affect all types of energy generation and nuclear is not immune to it\". He estimates that Hunterston lost around 17,388 MWh compared with the turbine's 1,210MWh even though it has now been out of action for many weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jul/12/faslane-trident-westminster-snp","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-12T20:00:12Z","webTitle":"Faslane: this was a nuclear weapon for the SNP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/12/faslane-trident-westminster-snp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/12/faslane-trident-westminster-snp","fields":{"headline":"Faslane: this was a nuclear weapon for the SNP","bodyText":"The MoD's, or Whitehall's, or whoever's plans to designate Trident's Faslane base \"sovereign UK territory\" earlier this week seemed, at best, petty – an attempt at humiliation timed to balance Andy Murray's cheering victory. It was a gift to the SNP, now denied and passed from hand to hand like a vomiting baby. That the idea was ever floated offers us another reminder of the colonial attitudes so catastrophically embedded in nuclear policy; a fundamental, fatal dismissal of \"ordinary\" people. Once, it was relatively easy to acquire a colony if you had access to industrialised military production when the people you were invading didn't. But by the end of the 19th century there was nowhere desirable left to steal, and industrialised armies finally faced each other. The results were intolerable: massive national debt and casualties that could mount by tens of thousands a day. But then, in the 1920s, Britain's airforce successfully bombed undefended Iraqi villages into quiescence. Italy followed suit in Ethiopia, and Germany in Spain. The age of \"intimidation by bomb\" was born, and with it the dream that killing a high enough percentage of a civilian population from the air would destroy a country and win a war with low military casualties. \"Bomber\" Harris, who served with the British air force in Iraq, went on to lead RAF Bomber Command in the second world war. He led a remarkable body of men into a moral vacuum, area-bombing cities, creating firestorms, killing civilians en masse. Vital targets like ball bearing factories and petrol plants didn't attract him. Railway routes into concentration camps were left intact. Harris aimed to discover the percentage of German civilians he had to kill in order to break the nation.His actions tainted the reputation of bomber command, and may have prolonged the war. Hermann Göring, commander of the Luftwaffe, was equally beguiled by the idea that ordinary people would crack under bombing. Early in the war he largely halted raids against the RAF and moved on to bombing cities – helping to lose the war for Hitler. In the second world war civilians of all nations often behaved extraordinarily under bombing pressure. They didn't break. Conventional, costly combat brought victory. But there was another option, tested in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nuclear weapons had the potential to destroy utterly. They offered the prospect of no survivors, no resistance, no revenge – only a wilderness that would be peace. The UK's military were highly ambivalent about acquiring nuclear weapons, not least because they could not be launched without US permission. Nuclear bases on British soil have always been de facto US bases and we pay US firms for provision and maintenance. But politicians wanted them. Being a nuclear power is almost as good as still having an empire. Trident, the UK's current nuclear weapon system, is in Scotland because London isn't. That's one of the reasons why Trident is hugely unpopular with Scots. Faslane is a deep-water port that keeps mildly unstable weapons far from the politicians disastrously wedded to the idea that if enough civilians of the right type die, almost anything is achievable. Other reasons for Scots' unease include the costs – never mind relocation, the cost of replacing Trident will be at least £115bn over the next 30 years – its uselessness in the \"war on terror\", and its deployment as part of the Nato missile defence system, which involves firing missiles at missiles. Tests have shown this would only be remotely possible if our opponent's missiles were in open silos, or just leaving them, so we fire have to first. This all means SNP plans to make Scotland nuclear-free are popular, even if full independence may not be. So Whitehall manoeuvres once again help to make independence seem more inviting. Scotland can feel that being threatened as if it's a colony is par for the course. England can feel the post-colonial UK project is unable to shake off a legacy of violence and the imposition of massive burdens on those who can afford them least. The SNP are smiling this weekend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jul/10/india-middle-income-country-wealthy","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-10T14:10:45Z","webTitle":"India may be a middle-income country, but that doesn't make it wealthy | Jonathan Glennie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jul/10/india-middle-income-country-wealthy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jul/10/india-middle-income-country-wealthy","fields":{"headline":"India may be a middle-income country, but that doesn't make it wealthy","bodyText":"Last month, I gave evidence to the UK's House of Commons select committee inquiry on the future of UK development co-operation. A range of issues were discussed, but three misunderstandings stood out. First, middle-income countries are not \"rich\". That includes India and any other country with an average daily income of just over $3. It would seem that the term \"middle income\" is causing confusion. It is sensible to make the case that the UK has to prioritise its scarce resources, and should therefore focus on the very poorest countries. But this is an assessment of the relative rather than absolute needs of possible aid recipients. Some countries may be less poor, but that does not make them affluent. To suggest that India is \"wealthy enough to deal with its own problems\" and \"no longer needs aid\" – comments that are quite common – is ridiculous, verging on inhumane. The country has grown in recent years, and has crossed the arbitrary and increasingly unhelpful \"middle-income\" threshold laid down by the World Bank. But the idea that India's meagre increases in human development are cause for wealthy countries to pack up and concern themselves with other things implies an incredibly stingy understanding of poverty. One in three of the world's malnourished children lives in India. Unfortunately, we have been enticed into thinking in this way because the $1 and $2 a day poverty lines are so ingrained in our analysis. We think people above these lines are \"non-poor\"; in reality, their destitution is just slightly less extreme. Some analyses suggest people living on more than $2 a day should be described as \"middle class\", while even the more common $10 a day definition of the middle class is pretty hard to swallow – it's just $3,650 a year. So devising arguments about why not to give aid to India is one thing, saying it's a rich country quite another. The second provocative issue addressed by the inquiry concerned trade-offs in development priorities. Politicians routinely promise more than they deliver, not least in the world of development. Virtuous circles, whereby investment in health and roads leads to better educational outcomes – and more women's empowerment, feeding back into health – doubtless exist. But equally often, governments in developing countries, just like their counterparts in developed countries, need to make hard decisions about what to fund and where to reduce funding. Take primary education, understandably the focus of much aid spending over the past two decades. Some leaders – including, notably, Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia – pushed back at this donor strategy, insisting that investment in secondary and tertiary education would produce the educated engineers and professionals necessary to reduce dependence on external support. But can you really reduce primary education funding in favour of universities? Or focus spending on hi-tech industry to the detriment of investments in small-scale farmers? Getting the balance right is the day-to-day reality of politics and power, just as it is in developed countries; refusing to admit there might be trade-offs is reductive. Third, there is a logical fallacy common among elected representatives that, because a particular analysis won't play well to voters, it is an intellectually weak analysis. MPs struggling to defend aid spending at all have no wish to try to explain aid to big countries like India, a nuclear power, or Brazil, increasingly a competitor in the global market. Nor, if they ever got into a detailed discussion, would they appreciate having to defend to voters investments in university scholarships and hi-tech processing equipment – easier to show pictures of poor kids. But even if something is hard to sell on the doorstep, it does not make it untrue, it simply means it's hard to sell on the doorstep. Differentiating between analysis and strategy is crucial. So when the final question we were asked was about the target to spend 0.7% of GNI on aid, I said that while some try to justify this goal on technical grounds (by suggesting that 0.7% of rich country GDP – no more, no less – is somehow the mathematically correct amount to be spending overseas), it has no research justification. It is a tool politicians use and, as such, is an issue on which the panel of MPs were best placed to opine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/mar/14/threats-opportunities-non-nuclear-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-14T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Threats and opportunities for a non-nuclear Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/14/threats-opportunities-non-nuclear-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/mar/14/threats-opportunities-non-nuclear-iran","fields":{"headline":"Threats and opportunities for a non-nuclear Iran","bodyText":"If a US war with Iran does occur, what will happen with the UK's coalition government (Editorial, 6 March)? All the Conservatives' instincts will be to join in on America's side. Labour will support them. That leaves the Lib Dems. Will they be the ones who keep Britain out of it? Will they at least try to do so, and end the coalition if they can't? It looks unlikely: their history for 30 years suggests that (again) they will be like the Labour left under Tony Blair, not like Gaitskell opposing Eden. But I suppose you never know. This could be their historic opportunity, and their reward at the next election. Roger Schafir London • It was with increasing incredulity that I read your 6 March editorial. At no point did I find that you used such words as \"immoral\" or \"unethical\" to describe the threatened attack by US-Israel on Iran. Why do you consider the framework of international law not to be relevant to the military actions of Israel and the US against Iran? There was no mention of the need to get UN support for such an attack. At least there was an attempt in the lead-up to the Iraq war to obtain UN approval and, when that failed, to claim earlier UN resolutions justified the attack. Dr David Hookes Liverpool • Your editorial urges the US to create \"incentives for Iran to change course on enriching uranium\". Here is a suggestion: in return for stopping all enrichment activity, the US offers to build solar-cell and wind turbine factories in Iran, each capable of manufacturing one GW of electrical capacity a year. This would cost less than a new nuclear reactor. Within 10 years Iran could have more electricity capacity than its nuclear programme will produce in that time. Such distributed electricity generation is also more secure against disruption by earthquakes and hostile neighbours. Keith Barnham Frome, Somerset • Can anyone suggest how many nuclear-armed states (Report, 6 March) have to threaten a non-nuclear one before the threatened state is legally or morally justified in developing nuclear weapons? Abdul Hamed Newcastle upon Tyne • The stakes are rising over Iran and nuclear weapon development (Iran seeking to build long-range missile, warns David Cameron, 7 March). Has the international community ever drawn up an energy plan for Iran, based on renewable technology and conservation, that would render unnecessary nuclear power, with its shadowy companion, nuclear proliferation? It would then be so much easier to see what Iran, or indeed any other state, is up to. Val Mainwood Colchester, Essex • Given the government's track record on truth-telling in recent years, could the prime minister explain why we should believe his and his national security adviser's warnings about Iran's apparent nuclear missile threats? Before the last election Cameron repeatedly referred to no top-down reorganisation of the NHS, no frontline cuts to public services and no VAT rise before doing all three. Cameron may be right this time, but government must understand its serial mendacity leads to justifiable electoral cynicism and resistance to its claims. Charles Secrett Brighton • David Grossman opposes an Israeli attack on Iran (Comment, 12 March) because, in his opinion, the Iranian danger is only a possible disaster in the future, while the result of the attack will be a certain disaster in the present. How can he be sure that the future disaster will not be much more serious than the present one? He ignores the nature of the Iranian regime. Its leaders have repeatedly stated that Israel has to be destroyed. We all hope diplomatic pressure and sanctions will prevent the Iranian government from getting an atomic bomb. But if that fails, the Israeli government should take immediate measures to stop Iran, even if it means loss of lives in the present, as it will prevent a much larger disaster in the future.

Environmental activism is a prominent though not exclusive focus of these activities. The report by the Center for Corporate Policy (CCP) in Washington DC titled Spooky Business: Corporate Espionage against Nonprofit Organizations draws on a wide range of public record evidence, including lawsuits and journalistic investigations. It paints a disturbing picture of a global corporate espionage programme that is out of control, with possibly as much as one in four activists being private spies. The report argues that a key precondition for corporate espionage is that the nonprofit in question: \"... impairs or at least threatens a company's assets or image sufficiently.\" One of the groups that has been targeted the most, and by a range of different corporations, is Greenpeace. In the 1990s, Greenpeace was tracked by private security firm Beckett Brown International (BBI) on behalf of the world's largest chlorine producer, Dow Chemical, due to the environmental organisation's campaigning against the use of chlorine to manufacture paper and plastics. The spying included: \"... pilfering documents from trash bins, attempting to plant undercover operatives within groups, casing offices, collecting phone records of activists, and penetrating confidential meetings.\" Other Greenpeace offices in France and Europe were hacked and spied on by French private intelligence firms at the behest of Électricité de France, the world's largest operator of nuclear power plants, 85% owned by the French government. Oil companies Shell and BP had also reportedly hired Hackluyt, a private investigative firm with \"close links\" to MI6, to infiltrate Greenpeace by planting an agent who \"posed as a left -wing sympathiser and film maker.\" His mission was to \"betray plans of Greenpeace's activities against oil giants,\" including gathering \"information about the movements of the motor vessel Greenpeace in the north Atlantic.\" The CCP report notes that: \"A diverse array of nonprofits have been targeted by espionage, including environmental, anti-war, public interest, consumer, food safety, pesticide reform, nursing home reform, gun control, social justice, animal rights and arms control groups. Many of the world's largest corporations and their trade associations - including the US Chamber of Commerce, Walmart, Monsanto, Bank of America, Dow Chemical, Kraft, Coca-Cola, Chevron, Burger King, McDonald's, Shell, BP, BAE, Sasol, Brown &amp; Williamson and E.ON - have been linked to espionage or planned espionage against nonprofit organizations, activists and whistleblowers.\" Exploring other examples of this activity, the report notes that in Ecuador, after a lawsuit against Texaco triggering a $9.5 billion fine for spilling 350 million gallons of oil around Lago Agrio, the private investigations firm Kroll tried to hire journalist Mary Cuddehe as a \"corporate spy\" for Chevron, to undermine studies of the environmental health effects of the spill. Referring to the work of US investigative reporter Jeremy Scahill, the report points out that the notorious defence contractor Blackwater, later renamed XE Services and now Academi, had sought to become \"the intel arm\" of Monsanto, the agricultural and biotechnology corporation associated with genetically modified foods. Blackwater was paid to \"provide operatives to infiltrate activist groups organizing against the multinational biotech firm.\" In another case, the UK's Camp for Climate Action, which supports the decommissioning of coal-fired plants, was infiltrated by private security firm Vericola on behalf of three energy companies, E.ON, Scottish Power, and Scottish Resources Group. Reviewing emails released by Wikileaks from the Texas-based private intelligence firm Stratfor, the report shows how the firm reportedly \"conducted espionage against human rights, animal rights and environmental groups, on behalf of companies such as Coca-Cola.\" In one case, the emails suggest that Stratfor investigated People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) at Coca-Cola's request, and had access to a classified FBI investigation on PETA. The report uncovers compelling evidence that much corporate espionage is facilitated by government agencies, particularly the FBI. The CCP report examines a September 2010 document from the Office of the Inspector General in the US Justice Department, which reviewed FBI investigations between 2001 and 2006. It concluded that: \"... the factual basis of opening some of the investigations of individuals affiliated with the groups was factually weak... In some cases, we also found that the FBI extended the duration of investigations involving advocacy groups or their members without adequate basis…. In some cases, the FBI classified some of its investigations relating to nonviolent civil disobedience under its 'Acts of Terrorism' classification.\" For instance, on an FBI investigation of Greenpeace, the Justice Department found that: \"... the FBI articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute... the FBI's opening EC [electronic communication] did not articulate any basis to suspect that they were planning any federal crimes….We also found that the FBI kept this investigation open for over 3 years, long past the corporate shareholder meetings that the subjects were supposedly planning to disrupt... We concluded that the investigation was kept open 'beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed,' which was inconsistent with the FBI's Manual of Investigative and Operational Guidelines (MIOG).\" The FBI's involvement in corporate espionage has been institutionalised through 'InfraGard', \"a little-known partnership between private industry, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.\" The partnership involves the participation of \"more than 23,000 representatives of private industry,\" including 350 of the Fortune 500 companies. But it's not just the FBI. According to the new report, \"active-duty CIA operatives are allowed to sell their expertise to the highest bidder\", a policy that gives \"financial firms and hedge funds access to the nation's top-level intelligence talent. Little is known about the CIA's moonlighting policy, or which corporations have hired current CIA operatives.\" The report concludes that, due to an extreme lack of oversight, government effectively tends to simply \"rubber stamp\" such intelligence outsourcing: \"In effect, corporations are now able to replicate in miniature the services of a private CIA, employing active-duty and retired officers from intelligence and/or law enforcement. Lawlessness committed by this private intelligence and law enforcement capacity, which appears to enjoy near impunity, is a threat to democracy and the rule of law. In essence, corporations are now able to hire a private law enforcement capacity - which is barely constrained by legal and ethical norms - and use it to subvert or destroy civic groups. This greatly erodes the capacity of the civic sector to countervail the tremendous power of corporate and wealthy elites.\" Gary Ruskin, author of the report, said: \"Corporate espionage against nonprofit organizations is an egregious abuse of corporate power that is subverting democracy. Who will rein in the forces of corporate lawlessness as they bear down upon nonprofit defenders of justice?\" That's a good question. Ironically, many of the same companies spearheading the war on democracy are also at war with planet earth - just last week the Guardian revealed that 90 of some of the biggest corporations generate nearly two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions and are thus overwhelmingly responsible for climate change.

The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said the temperature inside No 2 reactor – one of three that suffered meltdown after last year's earthquake and tsunami – may have reached 82C on Sunday. Tepco said there was no evidence that the melted fuel inside had reached criticality. The utility reportedly increased the amount of cooling water being injected into the reactor along with a boric acid solution, which is used to prevent the fuel from undergoing sustained nuclear reactions. Confirmation that the temperature has risen above 80C could force the government to reverse its declaration two months ago that the crippled plant was in a safe state known as cold shutdown. Cold shutdown is achieved when the temperature inside the reactors remains below 100C and there is a significant reduction in radiation leaks. Given that Tepco assumes a margin of error of 20C, the actual temperature could have risen to 102C. Plant workers are unable to take accurate readings of the temperature inside the damaged reactor because radiation levels are still too high for them to enter and examine the state of the melted fuel, which is thought to be resting at the bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel. The result has been a series of wildly different readings: two other thermometers positioned at the bottom of No 2 reactor showed the temperature at 35C, local media reported. Tepco said it did not know the cause of the apparent temperature rise, but speculated that it might be due to problems with the supply of coolant or a faulty thermometer. \"We believe the state of cold shutdown is being maintained,\" said Junichi Matsumoto, a company spokesman. \"Rather than the actual temperature rising, we believe there is high possibility that the thermometer concerned is displaying erroneous data.\" Tepco was forced to inject additional cooling water into the same reactor last week after the temperature started rising at the beginning of the month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-agreement-q-and-a","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-24T13:56:24Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear agreement: Q&A","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-agreement-q-and-a","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-agreement-q-and-a","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear agreement: Q&A","bodyText":"What nuclear technology does Iran have? Iran has an almost complete nuclear fuel cycle – the infrastructure to manage the entire process from digging the uranium out of the ground to generating power with it. That includes uranium mines and processing plants to refine the ore into yellowcake. In Isfahan it has a uranium conversion facility that turns the yellowcake into uranium hexafluoride, a gas that can be enriched with the use of centrifuges. It has about 16,000 centrifuges in a big enrichment plant in Natanz and an underground facility at Fordow, and they produce both low-enriched uranium (LEU) and 20%-enriched uranium. The enriched uranium is taken to a fuel fabrication plant in Isfahan to be turned into oxide pellets, which are put in metal tubes to make fuel rods. Iran has two reactors: a nuclear power station in Bushehr on the Gulf coast that was built with Russian help and uses Russian-supplied fuel rods; and a research reactor in Tehran that uses 20%-enriched uranium fuel and produces isotopes for medical, agricultural and other scientific uses. Iran has built a plant to make heavy water (deuterium oxide) in Arak and is building a reactor there that would use natural uranium fuel in the heavy water for its fissile reaction. It does not have a reprocessing plant, the last link in the fuel cycle, which would extract plutonium from the spent fuel from the Arak reactor. That is important as plutonium is an efficient fuel for making a warhead. How does the Geneva deal restrict it? The deal would stop Iran making any uranium enriched to above 5% purity. It would dilute its roughly 200kg stockpile of 20%-enriched uranium, the most immediate proliferation concern, or convert it to oxide which is harder to turn back into the hexafluoride gas, which can in turn be enriched further to make weapons-grade fuel. Iran undertakes not to build a plant for re-converting uranium oxide back to uranium hexafluoride. It would also not be allowed to increase its stockpile of 3.5%-enriched uranium, so any that is produced during the six months of the interim agreement would have to be blended down or converted to oxide. Iran would also have to freeze its enrichment capacity. It would not be allowed to install any new centrifuges and would be able to use only the roughly 8,000 which are currently being used for enrichment. The other 8,000 that have been installed but are not being fed with uranium hexafluoride would have to be \"left inoperable\". Major development work at the Arak heavy water reactor would be suspended for six months. No fuel could be put into the reactor and it could not be turned on. Furthermore, no more fuel rods can be made for the reactor and no major reactor components could be introduced. What is the significance of enrichment levels? The percentage enrichment refers to the concentration of the fissile isotope U235 in uranium. Low enriched uranium (LEU) is defined as under 5%. Highly enriched (HEU) or weapons-grade plutonium is considered to be over 90%-enriched. Because of the technical aspects of centrifuge enrichment, the manufacture of 20%-enriched uranium is considered to be nine-tenths the way along the road to HEU in terms of difficulty. Does the deal recognise Iran's right to enrichment? This is hotly contested. The US says it does not. But the text does suggest that the comprehensive settlement to be hammered out in the next six months would involve at least acceptance. It says: \"This comprehensive solution would involve a mutually defined enrichment programme with practical limits and transparency measures to ensure the peaceful nature of the programme.\" Washington put emphasis on the \"mutually defined\" phrase, suggesting Iran would require negotiated consent. Why did Iran build an enrichment plant underground? The plant carved into the rock under a mountain at Fordow was discovered by western intelligence in 2009. Iran reported its existence to the International Atomic Energy Agency just days before Barack Obama revealed it at the UN general assembly in September of that year. Western states said Fordow demonstrated Iran's desire to cheat and develop a covert weapons programme. Iran said that it needed a protected facility because of the threats from the west and Israel to bomb the Iranian nuclear programme. The Iranian government said it was only required to declare its existence to the IAEA six months before it intended to put radioactive material in it. However, the IAEA argues that is an old rule. It says Iran should inform the agency of new nuclear facilities as soon as they are designed. Could Iran still develop a nuclear bomb under these conditions? It would be hard to develop a bomb in secret, particularly because the deal involves some uniquely intrusive inspections, including daily visits to the enrichment plants at Natanz and Fordow, and for the first time inspections of centrifuge assembly workshops and rotor production facilities. Those inspections are especially important as IAEA experts would be able to check if any extra centrifuges were being made for an undeclared plant. Because the nuclear fuel cycle is checked by the IAEA all the way along, any yellowcake or uranium hexafluoride that was diverted to a parallel programme would be noticed. To escape detection, the Iranians would have to construct an entire covert fuel cycle – which would be very difficult The chances of being caught and the penalties involved would be great. The other way to way make a bomb would be to \"break out\" – to race to build a warhead before inspectors find out and raise the alarm. But by taking away the 20% stockpile and curbing the number of centrifuges, this deal would double the break-out period Iran would need. It would take about three months to make enough HEU for a warhead, but it would take more than that to turn that HEU into uranium metal and shape it into a perfect core for a warhead and then assemble the weapon, let alone test it. Iran would almost certainly be caught before it had made a single weapon. What is likely to happen now? Worst case scenario: The deal falls apart almost immediately in the face of hardliners in Washington and Tehran. A congressional vote now for more sanctions, for example, would almost certainly derail it. Iranian conservatives would see such an act as American perfidy and it would make it extremely hard ever to seal another agreement. Iranian conservatives would be likely instead to accelerate Iranian nuclear development, bringing a conflict closer. Best case scenario: The interim deal holds and the comprehensive settlement is negotiated on time, laying to rest the Iranian nuclear crisis once and for all. The prompt lifting sanctions leads to an economic boom in Iran, strengthening moderates. The end of isolation would strengthen liberals and weaken the hold of the clerical and military elite. Most likely scenario: The interim deal more or less holds despite squabbles, but negotiations over the comprehensive agreement are dogged by disagreements and delays, requiring an extension to the stopgap measures and an erosion of trust. Success would require another vast investment of effort and political capital from relatively weak presidents, and would be hostage to developments elsewhere, such as Syria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/27/fukushima-horse-breeder-radiation-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-27T16:02:21Z","webTitle":"Fukushima horse breeder braves high radiation levels to care for animals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/27/fukushima-horse-breeder-radiation-animals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/27/fukushima-horse-breeder-radiation-animals","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima horse breeder braves high radiation levels to care for animals","bodyText":"Until March 2011, Tokue Hosokawa had only to peer through the window of his home in Iitate village to confirm that all was well with his 100-year-old family business. The 130 or so horses that once roamed this sprawling farm in Fukushima prefecture have sustained three generations of Hosokawa's family. Some were sold for their meat – a local delicacy – but his animals were better known for their appearances in commercials, period TV dramas and films, and local festivals celebrating the region's samurai heritage. For decades, the 62-year-old horse breeder barely registered that his farm was just 25 miles north-west of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. But the rural idyll was shattered on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, when the facility was hit by a towering tsunami that caused meltdowns in three of its reactors. Even as people living in the path of the plant's radioactive plume were fleeing in their thousands, Iitate's 6,500 residents remained in their homes, convinced by official assurances that the village was safe. But two and half years after the accident, Iitate has become a nuclear ghost town. When Hosokawa looks out of his window these days, it is at empty, irradiated fields. Like several other farmers in Fukushima, Hosokawa ignored a government order to exterminate all of his horses and cows. \"I told them that if the animals had been suffering from an infectious disease, then I'd have them destroyed,\" he said. \"But not for something like this. \"Just after the accident one of the horses gave birth. When I saw that foal get to its feet and start feeding from its mother, I knew there was no way I could leave.\" The order to evacuate Iitate did not come until weeks after the meltdown, as local authorities debated the risk posed to the village, which had only recently been voted one of Japan's most picturesque places. Rather than acting as a shield, the mountain forests surrounding Iitate had trapped radioactive particles, turning the village into a repository for dangerously high levels of contamination. Hosokawa, short and wiry with the weathered complexion of a man who spends most of his waking hours outside, sent his wife and their daughter, Miwa, to safer parts of the prefecture. But, unable to bear the thought of leaving his animals to starve, he stayed put and joined the handful of residents who continue to live in the contaminated homes they were ordered to abandon. Although the evacuation order in parts of Iitate has been partially lifted to allow residents to visit during the day, radiation levels are still too high for a permanent return. Last week, visiting officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) urged the government to prepare displaced residents from Iitate and other contaminated towns and villages for the grim news that cleaning up their former homes will take much longer than expected. The IAEA report was published soon after Japanese officials admitted that the 5tn yen (£31.7bn) decontamination effort was woefully behind schedule. \"We will have to extend the cleanup process, by one year, two years or three years. We haven't decided for sure yet,\" said Shigeyoshi Sato, an environment ministry official in charge of decontamination. As Iitate's population plummeted in the spring of 2011, Hosokawa managed to find new homes for more than 80 of his horses. Then, in January this year, he noticed that several among the 30 that remained, mainly foals, had become unsteady on their feet. Within weeks, 16 had died in mysterious circumstances. Autopsies on four of the horses found no evidence of disease and tests revealed caesium levels at 200 becquerels per kilo – twice as high as the government-set safety limit for agricultural produce, but not high enough to immediately threaten their health. Hosokawa recently began legal action against the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], claiming 200m yen (£1,269,534) compensation for the loss of the horses he was forced to sell or give away. The animals that died last winter are not included. Tepco agreed to pay him 10m yen for the loss of 39 horses he could prove were born on the farm, but refused to compensate him for the rest. The family refuses to back down. \"No matter how long it takes,\" said Miwa, \"we will keep on fighting.\" The 30 or so animals left behind are sustained by feed paid for with donations, many of them sent anonymously, from horse lovers around Japan. One woman turned up on their doorstep with a million yen in cash. Hosokawa repays their generosity with gifts of Fukushima's famed peaches. He estimates that he has lost about 100m yen in income since March 2011: the compensation the family received for the enforced evacuation has already been spent on uncontaminated feed from the US and Australia. \"There was nothing left for the family,\" he said. This summer, Miwa, 27, quit her job in Fukushima city to help her father rescue what little is left of their business. But with no end in sight to the evacuation order and a shortage of people willing to take on his remaining horses, Hosokawa reluctantly accepts that the farm's days may be numbered. \"We can't give these horses the same life as they had before the nuclear disaster, and no one wants to buy them,\" he said. \"We can't make a living from them, but unless we feed them they will die.\" As Fukushima's long and bitter winter draws in, the Hosokawas again fear the worst. \"We don't know why the foals died, only that they died in winter,\" Miwa said. \"I'm worried that we'll find more dead horses this winter.\" Almost three years on, one of the few signs of human activity in Iitate is the crews of workers who have the near-impossible task of cleaning up the village's contaminated landscape. As quickly as they remove irradiated soil from around homes, schools and other public buildings, rain washes more radioactive particles down from the mountainous forests that cover much of Fukushima prefecture. Few are convinced by official assurances that their village will again be fit to live in. \"Our neighbours have all gone,\" Miwa said. \"They're scattered all over the place. I don't even know where most of them are. The only people who say they'll come back are old. There's nothing here for people with young children.\" Fellow rebel farmers aside, Hosokawa's only companions are his daughter and the salespeople who frequently cold call with offers of \"anti-radiation\" pills. \"Life here has been very hard for everyone since the disaster,\" he said. \"Most of the people I know want to return, but because of the radiation they know that they never will. This place is awash with tears. It's a village with no tomorrow.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/aug/11/indias-war-on-greenpeace","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-11T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"India’s war on Greenpeace | Samanth Subramanian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/11/indias-war-on-greenpeace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/aug/11/indias-war-on-greenpeace","fields":{"headline":"India’s war on Greenpeace","bodyText":"After deciding not to sleep at all before her 6.50am flight out of Delhi, Priya Pillai felt slow and drowsy as she handed her passport over the immigration counter. It was a few hours past midnight on 11 January 2015; Pillai, a campaigner with Greenpeace India, knew that two full weeks of work awaited her in London. At check-in, she had secured an aisle seat, which made her happy. Now, as the official scanned her passport, Pillai sent idle texts to a colleague in Boston and pondered a plan to visit a friend in the north of England for the weekend. Behind the counter, the official reached for a square of paper and began taking notes. His name was VK Ojha, Pillai remembers, and he looked fresh and alert. He had a neat moustache and wore a white shirt and navy blue trousers. Minutes went by, and Ojha scribbled on. “Is there a problem?” Pillai asked. “Yes, ma’am. Please wait here.” Ojha vanished. From the next counter, a curious official asked for Pillai’s name and, after typing it into his computer, said: “Greenpeace?” Pillai nodded. When Ojha returned, he led Pillai to an office run by the immigration authority. There, he asked Pillai for her passport and told her – most politely, Pillai remembers – that she couldn’t leave the country. Pillai is a voluble person, and she spent the next four hours demanding explanations from immigration officials. She got none. When an Air India employee came by, he was asked to take Pillai’s luggage off the plane, which terrified her. She thought: “They’ll put drugs in my bags, and they’ll say: ‘This is why we’re arresting you.’” Pillai was sure that the state was not beyond framing her. Since 2010, she had been part of a Greenpeace group that was protesting the government’s decision to commission new coal mines in the woods of Mahan in central India. She was travelling to London, in fact, to talk to an informal group of British MPs about Mahan and about Essar Energy, an Indian power and fossil fuel giant incorporated in the UK in 2009 and listed briefly on the London Stock Exchange. Essar Energy was one of two companies licensed to mine in Mahan; Greenpeace argued that the filthy process of mining coal would pulverise acres of forest and displace thousands who lived in the area. The government took a dim view of these protests. Some of Pillai’s colleagues had been arrested in Mahan on flimsy charges that never stuck. Police and intelligence agencies monitored the activists closely; Pillai was sure they were aware of her London trip. “I know my phone has been tapped for years,” she said. “I’ve had experiences [such as] getting on to a train from Delhi to go to Mahan, and even the people there don’t know I’m coming, but the police or the local intelligence people there will call these people in Mahan and say: ‘Priya’s coming, right?’ I’ve had bureaucrats tell me: ‘You should be careful. You’re under surveillance.’” A senior immigration official, Sushma Sharma, came to talk to Ojha. Pillai could hear Sharma insisting: “No, I want a fax. Ask for a fax. I won’t do it without a fax.” Ojha sent off for written authorisation from the government to keep Pillai off her flight, and a fax duly arrived. Pillai marched into Sharma’s cabin and said: “I need to know what’s happening.” “It’s nothing personal against you,” Sharma said. “But we have orders. Your name is part of a database. That is why I cannot allow you to travel.” Pillai and Sharma argued until 8.30am, when Pillai got her passport back, now with a big red-and-blue “Offload” stamp inside. Despite Pillai’s obvious anger, Sharma was patient, but she offered no further information. She only suggested, as Pillai was leaving the airport, that she complain to the Bureau of Immigration. Pillai did this but received no reply. Soon afterwards, though, the government told its version of the tale through anonymous sources, who confided to journalists that India’s Intelligence Bureau (IB) had issued an order a couple of days before her trip, calling her “anti-national” and instructing authorities to stop her at the airport. Two months after that incident, the Delhi high court declared that the IB order was illegal. During the hearing, the government argued that Pillai, had she gone to London, would have created a “negative image” of her country, which might have discouraged prospective investments in India. The court dismissed this. Pillai’s right to travel, the judge wrote, “cannot be impeded only because it is not in sync with [the] policy perspective of the executive … Criticism, by an individual, may not be palatable; even so, it cannot be muzzled.” Pillai’s detention was the most visibly punitive episode in a year of high friction between the government and Greenpeace. Since May last year, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to victory in the general election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has cancelled the licences of nearly 9,000 NGOs receiving some measure of foreign funding, on the grounds that they filed their accounts irregularly. Other NGOs – including the Ford Foundation – were placed on a watchlist, so that every bit of money they received from overseas needed first to be cleared by the home ministry. A simmering suspicion of foreign influences is written deep into the BJP’s nationalist DNA, and it plays marvellously with its most loyal voters – many of whom proclaim their belief, loudly and often, that western powers are eager to throttle India’s rise. In particular, Modi – who steers his government with stifling control – has never hidden his distaste for NGOs and their “five-star activists”, as he once labelled them. After three days of anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002, during which around 1,000 people died, NGOs led the accusations that Modi – then Gujarat’s chief minister – abetted the murderous frenzy of Hindu mobs. In June, one of these NGOs, the Sabrang Trust, was placed under investigation for misusing Ford Foundation grants. Sabrang’s co-founder, the activist Teesta Setalvad, had already been harried for several years by the Gujarat government; now she was accused of diverting the money to a publishing firm she owns and runs, and of embezzling funds to buy wine, a BlackBerry, wet wipes, nail clippers and a copy of the David Baldacci thriller Total Control. The prolonged raids and interrogations were so disproportionate to these alleged misdemeanours that they carried the acrid whiff of vendetta. Even within this hothouse of hostility, no organisation has been lavished with as much unwelcome attention as Greenpeace. State auditors turned up at one of its offices twice to sweat over its books, trying to spot irregularities; British and Australian campaigners were turned away from Indian airports after landing with valid visas; three separate tax notices claim it is millions of rupees in arrears. For a few torrid weeks in April and May, all the money that Greenpeace India had in its bank accounts – those receiving funds from its international parent, but also those holding funds raised in India – was frozen, asphyxiating its operations and raising the prospect of an imminent demise. When a court granted Greenpeace a reprieve by releasing its domestic funds, another government order placed its registration as an NGO under review. “We’re very sure there’s a pattern,” Binu Jacob, Greenpeace India’s fundraising director, told me. “They’re getting all their mechanisms together to do this.” Within the Indian glossary of political derision, the term for a certain sort of old-fashioned leftist is jholawala – after the modest cloth bag, with a long strap slung from shoulder to waist, in which such an individual might carry pamphlets to a protest march or poetry reading. The term applies to liberal intellectuals, NGO workers, and activists – not to mock their meagre finances, but to deflate the staged asceticism of people who are presumed to be well off. In the worldview of Modi and his supporters, the jholawalas are bracketed with other objects of suspicion: the entrenched power elites of Delhi; the liberal media and the politicians of the Congress party; Marxists and academics and foreigners who comment upon Indian affairs. It is not the ideologies or the credentials of these people that come under attack; it is their loyalties, which are suspected to be invested in each other, or in foreign governments, or in international bodies with shadowy agendas. This rhetoric against them has become rooted, knowingly and successfully, in the potent notion of trust. Judgments about who can be trusted to mean well for India, and who cannot, have become a crucial part of government policy. * * * In May, I spent a few days at the main Greenpeace India office, which occupies all four floors of a squat building on a quiet street in the city of Bangalore, Karnataka. It was a strange, unsettled time. Greenpeace’s funds had been frozen the previous month, and its executive director, Samit Aich, revealed that he had no money to pay salaries in June. Every morning, Greenpeace employees – nearly 340 of them across India – received an email update about the legal battle to wrest back their money. Campaigns had seized up. Nobody travelled anywhere. People still held meetings, in long rooms with names such as “Rosa” and “Mandela”; they tramped up and down the stairs, called donors and stared into their computers. But a sense of suspended animation was inescapable. I sat in a small room on the ground floor, talking to Greenpeace staffers about their organisation even as it seemed, day by day, to be melting away around us. The first inkling Aich had of the troubles ahead came in June 2014, when a 23-page Intelligence Bureau report on foreign-funded NGOs and their “concerted efforts … to ‘take down’ Indian development projects” was leaked to the media. The report had been commissioned by the previous government, led by the Congress party. A PDF of the report that can be found online is marked “Secret”; it warns that NGOs are stalling new mines, power plants, genetically modified food and “mega industrial projects”. Foreign donors, the report alleges, disguise their funds “cleverly … as donations for issues ranging from human rights, violence against women, caste discrimination, religious freedom, etc.” Collectively, the report says, such NGOs drag down India’s GDP growth by 2-3% annually. The authors do not offer the mathematics behind this claim. Greenpeace gets a section to itself: 12 bullet points under the heading “Anti-coal activism”, a catalogue of activities that aims for a bare, ominous tone but winds up including observations so plain that they could have been drawn from Greenpeace’s own annual reports. (“In April 2013, Greenpeace supported and screened a documentary film, Coal Curse, directed by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, on the harmful consequences of coal mining in Singrauli region.”) The IB accuses Greenpeace of coordinating protests against coal mines and power plants. Its funds finance studies on health and pollution, and pay for activists to travel to conferences. Its headquarters “regularly receive foreign experts. Recently, a group of cyber security experts upgraded its communication systems and installed sophisticated and encrypted software in its servers and computers.” In this manner, the report first presents a small batch of facts and then quickly links them, through pure elision of evidence, to destructive intent. These NGOs, the IB believes, do not just happen to have objectives that conflict with the government’s plans for development; rather, at the behest of foreign donors, they exert every sinew to slow the velocity of India’s economy. The IB report was leaked the month after Modi was sworn in, having soundly defeated the Congress party. Jairam Ramesh, the Congress environment minister from 2009 to 2011, said he didn’t know his government had commissioned the report, “but I’m not surprised.” Some of his colleagues were deeply suspicious of NGOs, he said. In 2012 and 2013, the Congress government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had forbidden nearly 5,000 NGOs from receiving foreign funds, around the time that protests were mounting over a nuclear power project in Tamil Nadu. Between his government and Modi’s, Ramesh said, there was a strain of continuity, a constituency devoted to economic growth at all costs. It was almost as if the state felt a duty, then but even more now, to bear down with force upon any obstacle perceived to be seriously impeding its plans for economic progress. Ramesh himself had turned from an agnostic on environmental issues into a believer. He first told me that his experience with Greenpeace “was a disaster”. Its campaigns are aggressive and given to hyperbole, he said: “Too high-decibel, too vocal. Greenpeace’s philosophy is that you cannot work with governments, you have to confront governments. That’s a debatable philosophy.” But as we spoke, he softened, saying that he had fine relations with its executives and that Greenpeace was “a necessary nuisance”. For nurturing these views, Ramesh came to be seen as “anti-growth” within his own government. Other ministers squabbled with him: “I was called a jholawala minister.” But this was healthy, he said. “We had different viewpoints, but ultimately the NGOs had access to us. You have to learn to deal with conflict democratically. Now that access to government has stopped, and [NGOs] are seen as an active roadblock to development. The environment ministry is closed.” Aich told me, similarly, that Modi’s government offered no fronts for engagement at all. A short man with slowly silvering hair, Aich talks in a fast staccato, his voice getting higher as he approaches the end of each sentence. When I met him, he had been with Greenpeace for 11 years, seven of those as executive director. In that time, he said, he has never encountered such a tight-lipped, peremptory administration. Last June, after the IB report was leaked, Greenpeace India received some money from its parent in Amsterdam, but was told by its bank that the funds could not be released without the home ministry’s approval. The government had given Aich no advance intimation about blocking this funding channel; when he wrote to the ministry, he was rebuffed with silence. All told, over the year, “I’ve written umpteen letters to the ministry. At least 15 or 20 letters, maybe more. There’s been no response. Nothing at all.” Any communication Greenpeace has received has been in the nature of an order or a notice. The first arrived in September 2014, just as the high court in Delhi began hearing Greenpeace’s petition to access its stopped funds, with the news that a home ministry team would inspect Greenpeace’s books in its office in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Over four days, three officials trawled through ledgers and receipts; it appeared to Binu Jacob, who guided them through a decade’s worth of documents, that they were conducting not so much an exercise in accounting as in Talmudic interpretation. “They told us as much: ‘See, this is the rule book, and we interpret it, and this is what we interpret,’” Jacob said. For instance, citing one rule that allows an NGO to use foreign funds for campaign work but not for more than 50% of administrative costs, the officials argued that air tickets were administrative costs. So was the consultancy fee for a soil analysis expert. “They were defining core campaigning so narrowly. I argued: ‘How would somebody go do a campaign if he can’t get to the location?’” Another day, they wondered why a staffer received 100,000 rupees (£1,011) as a monthly salary. “They said: ‘Isn’t that too much for an NGO?’” Not really, Jacob replied. After all, marketing professionals selling toothpaste earn 500,000 rupees a month, so why should somebody doing research work not earn 100,000? “They said: ‘Binu, these arguments are not valid. We feel, for an NGO, this is too much.’ And they noted it,” Jacob said. He shook his head slowly, almost in marvel. “It was nit-picking.” The report of this inspection, issued after two months, bristles with trivialities. Greenpeace largely works out of its Bangalore premises, even though its registered office is in Chennai; this was interpreted as a violation of an arcane rule requiring NGOs to inform the government of changes in headquarters. Two reimbursements of an employee’s accommodation expenses – for 10,036 and 12,549 rupees – were seen as fraudulent because both bills showed the same dates of stay. Aich’s salary was judged to be exorbitant. Some observations were minor infringements of India’s Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA), whose strictures are so myriad and so comprehensive in their vagueness that they can effect death by bureaucratic strangulation. Jacob helped draft a response, explaining and rebutting where he could. Given the minor scale of the FCRA infringements, Greenpeace expected only raps on its knuckles or, at worst, a levy of small fines. Then, for a while, Priya Pillai’s run-in with the Delhi airport authorities consumed everyone’s attention. When the government responded, on 9 April, it was with a four-page order that took no note of Greenpeace’s clarifications, and ordered a freeze on all of its bank accounts. The timings of these actions, Jacob observed, have been tidy and relentless, one following the other like deft clockwork. The September inspection occurred soon after a court began to consider the first interruption of Greenpeace’s foreign funding. The April notice blocking Greenpeace’s domestic and foreign-currency bank accounts was issued after another court verdict ruled in favour of Pillai in the matter of her detention. In late May, the Delhi high court unblocked Greenpeace’s domestic funds; the next day, officials from the state of Tamil Nadu, where Greenpeace is registered, announced another audit of its books. That report claimed to have identified a string of financial irregularities – one per year between 2005 and 2012 – and threatened to cancel Greenpeace’s registration altogether. Yet again, Greenpeace approached the court, arguing that its accounts were woefully misread, and that there was no “application of mind” in the officials’ examination. Greenpeace’s well-publicised troubles have made Jacob’s job difficult. Its sympathisers have stuck with them, and even given more, but some potential new donors have dithered. “There was this guy I met, with an IT background, just back after his US stint. He had a lot of rich friends and sounded enthusiastic.” Jacob thought he might give at least 200,000 rupees. Then the donor wondered if supporting an NGO so transparently unpopular with the government was a wise move. “He backed out.” Similarly, when Jacob’s team tried opening a new bank account in May, at least four banks dodged their business. “Nobody’s saying: ‘Don’t open an account for Greenpeace.’ No bank would say: ‘I won’t open an account for you.’ But somebody would say off the record: ‘I’m telling you, I don’t think it’s going to happen,’” Jacob said. One bank indicated it would have to seek the home ministry’s permission. “They’re scared.” Finally, Greenpeace persuaded a small bank, with just one branch, to accept its money. “They don’t even have online banking. It’s like, you know, your grandfather’s bank.” Amid all this struggle, Greenpeace went through an internal convulsion. In February, a former staffer alleged in a Facebook post that she had been raped by a colleague and sexually harassed several times during her stint with Greenpeace. The organisation, she said, failed to deal with her complaints of harassment, so she had never filed a formal charge of rape. Aich apologised, admitted to mistakes and promised to make amends, but the pressure mounted until he resigned in June. This fresh tribulation, in tandem with Greenpeace’s ongoing distress, fried everyone’s nerves, Pillai told me the week before Aich quit. We were in Greenpeace’s Delhi office, where she is based. “I haven’t slept for three days. Sometimes I’m emotional, sometimes I’m rational. It’s really stressful. Every day, you find two or three people crying in the office, saying they’re just too stressed, and that they can’t take this any more.” * * * Among the most ambiguous of the rules in India’s Foreign Contributions Regulations Act is one that prevents any foreign-funded NGO from comporting itself as an “organisation of a political nature”. Political parties fall within this classification, but so do organisations thought to be propagating an ideology or conducting “political activities”. In theory, there is little manoeuvring room within this rule for NGOs in a country where the state is a huge, powerful presence in every station between birth and death. To propose to change a life for the better is to posit that the government has failed. The personal is political everywhere, but nowhere more than in India. I asked Pillai if she thought Greenpeace’s activities were political. “Every issue on this earth is political,” she said. “Women’s rights is a political issue. Child rights is a political issue. Energy policy in this country is a hugely political issue. But we don’t get engaged in mainstream politics, party politics.” For months, I tried to approach some of the arms of the government, wanting to understand what they viewed as legitimate and illegitimate NGO activity. Soon after Modi’s election, his administration became known for being thoroughly watertight, letting no information leak and keeping reporters at bay. But upon sustained exertion, the boards started to give. On the other hand, Essar and Hindalco, the companies whose mining plans in Mahan had been disrupted by Greenpeace, proved more taciturn. An Essar representative told me that his company would not participate in this story; no one from Hindalco responded. Sudhanshu Trivedi, a BJP spokesperson, met me in a five-star hotel, in a hushed bar with the sort of tinkling music that sounds as if it is made by flipping coins into glassware. Trivedi is a composed man with heavy-lidded eyes and an unexcitable manner of speech. He insisted, with as much emphasis as his languor would allow, that NGOs were free to do whatever work they chose, as long as they complied with the law. The government, he said, had only deregistered NGOs that had not filed their tax returns in years. Greenpeace was a different matter: “They were selectively targeting those projects that were of great national importance for industrial growth and development. It’s a very thin line between creating environmental awareness and creating social unrest.” The government was also concerned that the foreign money flowing in to Greenpeace was being misused or improperly accounted. He was unclear on the technicalities, but he was confident that Greenpeace’s dubious finances were the source of its trouble. When I noted that the government had not been able to gather enough evidence to suspend Greenpeace outright, he shrugged and changed the subject. I asked Trivedi about Pillai. Why was she stopped from going to London? “Because she had already visited twice,” he said, as if he was a nanny whose ward pined for the candy shop. “This was the third visit.” I found out later that this was correct; Pillai had visited the UK twice when she had been working for Oxfam. “But she can visit any number of times,” I said. “It’s a free country.” “That’s OK. But you are going to meet British MPs, your objective is not clear, you are unable to comply with the clarifications which were asked of you, and again you want to go. So some suspicion arises.” In fact, as I learned, the government did not contact Pillai at all before her trip, whether to seek clarifications or to tell her she could not travel. A home ministry official, who asked not to be named, insisted that this had been the government’s only mistake. The decision to stop Pillai’s trip was taken three days before her scheduled departure: “We couldn’t locate her earlier,” he said. “And it was the weekend. So we could only do it at the airport.” Apart from that, the official argued, the government’s logic was perfectly lucid. “We have our own system of inputs. We received some inputs that she’d made some statements on overseas trips.” The intent of these statements, he said, was “to denigrate our country globally. So if your activities, whether inside the country or outside, are found to be incompatible with the government’s view, it can take action.” He tried, very sincerely, to persuade me of the strength of this argument. Greenpeace, as an international NGO, was a guest in India, he said. “A guest should know his limitations.” Within government circles, I frequently heard the view that Greenpeace’s motives are malign. Modi came to power on a din of promises about industrial growth and economic progress; to raise concerns that differ with these particular visions of growth and progress is to run the risk of being regarded as anti-national. “In Mahan, they tried to stop a project after it was already commissioned,” an environment ministry official told me. “That suggests an agenda, that they are anti-development.” Last year, the supreme court cancelled a host of coal mining licences – including the one for Mahan – because of corruption in the auction process. When Modi’s government set up a new auction in March, it left Mahan out, pulling its forests back under protection. I pointed this out, suggesting that Greenpeace had been justified in opposing the licence. “Yes,” the official said, “but Mahan can always be revived. India deserves its development. And there’s an agenda to stop it.” Here it was again, the reflexive invocation of malevolence. To encounter it on social media, that amplifier of acrimony, was one thing; to run into it in a serious conversation with a government official, and to think that it informed policy, felt far more troubling. One evening, I met Prakash Javadekar, India’s environment minister, in his office, interrupting him in the middle of a snack of diced papaya. For activists, Javadekar’s tenure has been distressing. The government has peeled away several safeguards that protect forests and people who live around them, lifted a moratorium on new industries in eight areas designated as “critically polluted,” and reconfigured regulatory authorities to shrink the role of independent voices. More than once, I heard the remark that Javadekar measures his ministry’s value by how speedily it approves new projects and not how effectively it protects the environment. This was the case in our conversation. Javadekar told me that he had taken care of pendency – the numerous cases awaiting clearances – and moved many procedures online. Only secondly, he said, “We’ve taken more care for nature than the earlier regime.” He counted off items on his fingers: the introduction of an air pollution monitoring system, a revision of emission norms and a bill to plant trees in degraded forest areas. I asked him how NGOs such as Greenpeace fit into his plans for environmental management. “There are thousands of NGOs with whom we partner,” he said. “Many schools, many colleges. Yesterday, I was in the district of Chitrakoot, and more than 2,000 youths from four NGOs participated in a river-cleaning scheme.” Greenpeace had fallen afoul only of the home ministry: “As far as we’re concerned, we’re talking to everybody. There’s no issue.” Did Greenpeace do any good work in India? “I don’t know,” Javadekar replied. “But your ministry must have tracked the work they do.” “We track thousands of NGOs that do field work,” he said. When I asked if Greenpeace was one of them, he said: “I don’t know. We must have given … we have taken their help. I take criticism also. I’m always open.” I persisted. “Don’t you think an NGO like Greenpeace brings any benefit to your field?” “I really don’t know about Greenpeace,” Javadekar said, his face impassive. “But they’re such a big player in your field.” “No, but there are thousands of NGOs, baba.” His ministry, he said, focuses on working with those that are active on the ground. “And not so much with Greenpeace?” “No, I’ve not said anything.” Javadekar became animated again when I inquired if he had a tough job. He did, he said, although his government believed that economic progress and environmental protection could coexist. He raised a point that India has made frequently and successfully at international forums: that poorer countries must be allowed to depend on fossil fuels to lift people out of poverty. “The principle of equity says that every citizen of mine deserves development – his or her carbon space. We have 17% of the world’s population, and 17% of the world’s cattle, but only 2.5% of the world’s land mass. So asking the west to vacate carbon space is a real challenge.” * * * Greenpeace has never been popular with governments; in fact, its activists strain to be unpopular, stopping aircraft from taking off, busting into power stations, or breaking the law in other ways. In 2013, Russia arrested 30 Greenpeace activists in the Arctic for trying to board a Gazprom oilrig. Last year, Greenpeace ran into criticism for damaging the Nazca Lines, an ancient set of etchings in the Peruvian desert, during an ill-judged protest. In Australia, Greenpeace risks losing its status as a tax-deductible society, as it has done in Canada and New Zealand. The rationale behind these disqualifications is similar to the Indian government’s grouses with Greenpeace. A New Zealand judge, in 2011, found that Greenpeace’s “political activities … cannot be regarded as ‘merely ancillary’ to Greenpeace’s charitable purposes”. The same year, Stephen Harper, Canada’s prime minister, worried that “significant American interests” were pouring money into environmental groups to stop projects including an oil pipeline. In all likelihood, Greenpeace – and other campaigning groups – will face these situations increasingly in the coming years. As in India at the moment, the pressures upon governments to ramp up economic growth and to drain every ounce of extractable resource out of the earth are immense. Simultaneously, the environment edges closer to peril. For anyone who has breathed the air of Delhi or Mumbai, or witnessed the alarming degradation of the country’s water bodies, or understood how Indian governments and crony capitalists connive to bypass environmental laws, the need for NGOs seems obvious, even urgent. Activists fire themselves up to be bolder and louder. Collisions with the state are inevitable. In dealing with Greenpeace, though, the Indian government has been clumsy and heavy-handed, achieving nothing except a display of intolerance for dissent. To harp upon the dangers of Greenpeace’s foreign funding, for instance, seems trivial: only 60m rupees (£606,000) out of its rough annual budget of 260m rupees (£4.75m) comes from overseas. In comparison, Essar – whose leaked emails have shown a propensity to bestow favours upon politicians – had planned to invest roughly 40bn rupees (£404m) in two coal-fired power plants in Mahan. But perhaps the heaviness of hand is deliberate, one person in Delhi’s NGO community suggested. (“You can’t quote me,” he cautioned. “We get foreign funding too.”) The government is signalling to industry and “to a core of voters that indulges in conspiratorial nationalism: ‘See how we’ve taken on these purveyors of false ideologies?’” he said. These “false ideologies” could find their champions in any number of people and groups the government regards as its opponents: ardent environmentalists, rival politicians, media houses, non-profits, social media warriors, critics of Hindu nationalism. In an instance from last week, the government issued notices to three television channels, threatening to kick them off air for broadcasting interviews that had criticised the execution of a convicted terrorist; the interviews, the notices rumbled, “cast aspersions on the integrity” of the judiciary. The result of harassment of this type, this person said, “is that people fear this government more”. Meanwhile, all the heat and noise of the government’s actions against Greenpeace has drowned out the truly consequential debates about growth and environmental protection in India. Sejal Worah, the programme director of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in India, said that Greenpeace is effective at pulling issues into public attention, but that it does not acknowledge the complications of what people want. “When I talk to people in villages about conservation, there’s a real pushback from people on the ground, who’re basically saying: ‘We want development. At this point in time, we see the environment and forests and forest conservation and all that stuff as simply holding us back from developing,’” Worah said. “There’s an impatience, and it’s scary, this groundswell of people who’re saying: ‘You’re sitting in your air-conditioned room, and you’re telling us we can’t have a road to our village because of a few hundred trees being cut.’” Given this, Worah said, an obdurate stance against coal, for instance, is not practical. “Greenpeace is usually black or white.” The WWF, on the other hand, spent more than a year internally debating its global position on coal. “We go through this whole process of consultations, understanding what each country’s context is, and then we come up with a complicated three-pager which says: ‘This is the thing, we don’t like coal, but for developing countries, this is the phase-out period’, and so on. What we don’t have, as a result, is a Greenpeace-type, jump-out-there statement saying: ‘No coal.’” The intransigence of its positions can spark some doubt about how Greenpeace India makes decisions. This doubt, said Ambuj Sagar, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, has nothing to do with the paranoid perception of some vast global plan to derail India’s economy. Rather, Sagar, who studies environmental policy issues, worries that Greenpeace International formulates a plain, one-size-fits-all agenda, without considering the needs of different countries. During a conference in Bali in 2007, he recalled by way of example, Greenpeace India released a report titled Hiding Behind the Poor, claiming India’s per-capita emissions figures masked the voraciousness with which rich Indians consume carbon. “I had a flaming row with them, sitting in a bar,” Sagar said. The title applied perfectly, he argued – but only if the report dealt with how wealthy western countries hid behind poorer developing ones. “Most rich Indians emit like typical middle-class Americans, at most. They don’t have three cars or centralised heating.” After the shouting match, one Greenpeace staffer came up to Sagar and admitted that the idea for the report had come from Greenpeace International. “So these issues are really complex, and I often find them misrepresented,” Sagar said. “I don’t want to put coal on a pedestal. It’s a shitty and horrible energy resource. I’d like us to have no coal if possible. But we don’t have anything else.” * * * In early July, I returned to Bangalore to find the Greenpeace building draped with two vertical banners, worn like bright yellow braces. One read: “DEMOCRACY”, the other “FREE SPEECH”. I stood looking at them, talking to a staffer. “They were hung by our action team, which includes a few women,” she said. “So a crowd collected when that was happening, because they were fascinated to see these women doing this. But they’ve been trained to scale buildings.” “Really?” I asked. “Of course,” she said, laughing. She referred to a famous Greenpeace stunt from January 2014, in which 12 activists in tiger costumes draped a banner reading “We Kill Forests” upon the 180-foot glass facade of Essar’s headquarters in Mumbai. “How else would we scale an Essar building?” In the ground-floor conference room, I met Vinuta Gopal and her daughter, who is not yet two. Gopal, who has been with Greenpeace since it began working in India in 2001, had switched her contract to a consultancy after the birth of her daughter, to gain a more flexible schedule. But Aich had resigned the previous week, so Gopal returned full-time as one of two interim directors. Her daughter now came to the office every day; during our conversation, she applied herself diligently to a Kit-Kat and then, replete, stretched out on her mother’s lap for a nap. Having heard so many people criticise Greenpeace for its adamant stances, I asked Gopal if, on an issue such as coal, her organisation had misjudged its communications. In fact, she replied, the bluntness was part of the strategy. “Our position is that India needs to transition away from coal, not that India needs to stop using coal,” she said. “Greenpeace isn’t saying: ‘Shut down all your coal plants.’ That’s unreasonable. But what people get from us is our banners and our photographs. A banner will say ‘Forests Not Coal’, so it seems the message is India should protect all its forests and keep all its coal in the ground.” Was it not a burden for Greenpeace to be constantly judged by its stark messaging and its confrontational activism? Gopal thought about this. “Greenpeace certainly has to reinvent itself,” she said, slowly. “It’s something we’re working on across the globe. Merely hanging off a building or a power plant isn’t going to make a difference. It has to be arguments that people believe in, investigations, exposés. Ultimately, it’s going to be the power of the people that brings about change, not a small group saying: ‘This is the way things should be.’” But the messaging “isn’t something you dismiss. Otherwise, why would we be in the position we’re in, facing a crackdown?” The weeks leading up to my meeting with Gopal had been the hardest Greenpeace India had ever faced. The storm over the sexual harassment charges had blown high; Aich had quit; Greenpeace’s registration was newly imperilled. Morale had plummeted. In all likelihood, the shakedown of Greenpeace, and of other civil society groups, will continue. It is in the character of this government to persecute its adversaries, and the convolutions of the law provide many ways for the state to install difficulties in their paths. Keeping up both the appetite and the funds to continue fighting was “the real challenge”, Gopal said. “But now we’re no longer shocked by anything that happens to us. We’ve gotten used to expecting trouble.” Samanth Subramanian is the India correspondent for The National and the author of This Divided Island: Stories from the Sri Lankan War • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/oct/25/serco-christopher-hyman-overcharging","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-25T18:42:00Z","webTitle":"Serco chief's exit shows companies need to think before they boast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/oct/25/serco-christopher-hyman-overcharging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/oct/25/serco-christopher-hyman-overcharging","fields":{"headline":"Serco chief's exit shows companies need to think before they boast","bodyText":"One moral of the Serco saga, which saw the departure on Friday of its long-standing chief executive, Christopher Hyman, is that big companies should pause before making boasts like this: \"Our products and processes differentiate us from our competitors. But this goes deeper. The fundamental difference at Serco comes from the unique culture and values that underpin the way we run the company and the way we behave.\" That's from the company website and it amounts to a claim that Serco not only possesses superior \"values\" but that management has the skill to enforce good behaviour in the ranks. Nobody should doubt Hyman's intention to run a decent company. The question is whether, when you've got 120,000 employees, any services business can hope to avoid regular catastrophes. At Serco, of course, there have been more than a few recently. Allegations of overcharging on a tagging contract and dodgy record-keeping when escorting prisoners are the biggest issues. But there was also a damning official report on the state of Serco-operated Thameside prison. And \"substandard\" was the public accounts committee verdict on the company's operation of out-of-hours GP services in Cornwall. In the circumstances, and given the Cabinet Office's insistence on \"corporate renewal\", Hyman's departure was inevitable. His successor will be recruited from outside, which is sensible. But the next chief executive should do more than determine how best to install \"full-time ethics officers\". Is Serco just too big to be managed effectively? The company seems to be nodding in that direction by saying the UK &amp; Europe division will be split into two. The new boss should go further and ask whether Serco long ago passed the point where the directors stood a chance of detecting a scandal before it erupts. Smaller may be better in the services game. Miliband and Major winning battle of half-truths Ed Miliband, with the assistance of Sir John Major, seems to be winning the political fight over energy bills. But the tit-for-tat Westminster exchanges are becoming tiresome. Both Labour and the coalition government are throwing around half-truths and still dodging the question of how the lights will stay on, and at what cost. Miliband's call for a price freeze rests on two contradictory statements. On the one hand, the Labour leader asserts that excessive profits are definitely being earned by the big six energy firms. On the other, he says that integration between suppliers and generators has so clouded the energy picture that nobody can tell what is going on. As Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, said this week in an analysis of Labour's policy: \"It is very hard to reconcile the notion that current arrangements are not transparent with the apparent certainty that Labour knows what the returns have been – and should have been.\" Quite. It is not surprising therefore that the big six respond by pointing to their accounts and asking where the excess profits are meant to be. Scottish Power, for example, this week reported a £23m loss in its supply and generation business for the first nine months of this year. Yes, it also reported profits of £396m in its networks business, but that is a ring-fenced operation where returns are regulated. If Labour thinks companies are bamboozling Ofgem with accounting tricks, then the logical response is to call for a full independent inquiry by the powerful Competition Commission. If foul play is proved then many options open up – break-up, prosecution, nationalisation or regulation of returns. David Cameron, making policy on the hoof, has now alighted on a \"competition test\". But as John Fingleton, former chief executive of the Office of Fair Trading, wrote in the FT this week, \"a competition test which reports back in spring without reference to the Competition Commission will simply be a waste of time\". Cameron's other idea is to fiddle with green and social levies. Fine, but unless the government wants to abandon the UK's binding decarbonisation targets (how?), the prime minister should explain who will pay the subsidies for renewables and nuclear. Meanwhile, the coalition asks us to swallow the wild proposition that the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station represents value for money. Come on, at a guaranteed and index-linked £92.50 per megawatt hour, EdF and co admit they will make an internal rate of return of 10%. Juiced up via the use of debt carrying loan guarantees, call it a 15% return on equity for 35 years with protection against inflation. Very few investments can match that. Put it another way. Deutsche Bank calculates that the Hinkley Point contract will only be cheaper than gas generation if the crude oil price averages more than $150 per barrel in real terms over the next 40 years. \"This is around three times the average oil price over the last 40 years, and a 50% premium to the average oil price over the last five years,\" it explains. Maybe nuclear is required regardless, but one conclusion is obvious: decarbonisation, however it is pursued, will be costly for consumers. So, from Labour we have a few good ideas, but the centrepiece is a price freeze that can only deter short-term investment. From the coalition comes a hideously expensive nuclear contract negotiated with a single bidding consortium plus an irrelevant shuffle with green levies. Neither is a good way to tackle an energy crisis. Ineos isn't off the hook over Grangemouth One part of the Grangemouth dispute is clear: Unite over-played its hand. But maybe there's more to it than that. Petrochemical industry insiders make two points about Ineos. First, unlike one-time owner BP, it didn't run the plant as an integrated business, choosing also to close operations that were customers in ethylene. Second, poor industrial relations should have been addressed long ago. None of which is to deny that refining and producing petrochemicals in Europe is a tricky business in the era of cheap US shale gas. But Ineos's long-term decision-making, not just the union's, should be under the microscope. More reasons to get angry at Royal Mail sale If you didn't get the shares you wanted in the great Royal Mail bonanza, here's news to make your blood boil: the fund management arms of some of the banks advising on the float received a combined 13m shares. This, apparently, is normal practice in the City, where faith in so-called Chinese walls somehow survives. Whether it's standard practice or not, the government should have spotted a row in the making over conflicts of interest. This one is a two-parter. If advisers on selling Royal Mail know that colleagues are buyers, what incentive is there to price the shares at the maximum possible price? And where is the encouragement to advise the government to prefer applications from retail investors? As Royal Mail shares hit 555p yesterday, versus a 330p float price, the profit on 13m shares stands at £29m. Nice work if you can get it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/23/fukushima-nuclear-power-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T17:35:43Z","webTitle":"Fukushima shows us the real cost of nuclear power | Craig Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/23/fukushima-nuclear-power-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/23/fukushima-nuclear-power-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima shows us the real cost of nuclear power","bodyText":"The full fallout of Fukushima is still unknown. There has been a great deal of focus on the potential health dangers – understandable given the fears of local people, but easy to downplay in the wake of a wave that killed more than 10,000 people. However, the effect on the nuclear industry will go much further than headline-grabbing concerns around the health impacts. Following the incredibly expensive evacuation, there has been a suspension of sales of food from the area, and now even fears about drinking water in Tokyo. These measures will hopefully ensure the health impact remains minimal. As well as being incredibly distressing for the people living nearby, this is all costing a fortune. Add to it the clean-up costs, more stringent safety regulations and an inevitable increase in insurance arrangements, and the economics of nuclear will be forever changed. And they weren't particularly healthy to start with. Our energy secretary, Chris Huhne, has said all such costs would be borne by the industry in the event of anything similar happening in the UK. (While we're not at risk of major earthquakes and tsunamis, our nuclear stations are vulnerable to sea surges, rising sea levels and terrorist attacks.) This would make for an eye-watering insurance quote, especially now the industry has lost its no-claims bonus. No nuclear power station has been built without state cash – as our government recognises. No subsidies means no nuclear. Supporting nuclear means getting behind taxpayer-funded subsidies for, in George Monbiot's words, the \"liars\" who run the industry. In contrast to the billions spent on nuclear, there remains real reluctance to invest in renewable energy. Only last week ministers cut support for small-scale renewable power. Their plans for electricity market reform will not support the development of offshore wind and other marine renewables. For decades governments have fawned over fossil fuels and nuclear power at the expense of renewable power and energy saving. Nuclear has had billions of pounds of taxpayers' money – and still cannot produce electricity at a competitive price. By contrast, after just a few years' support in Germany, solar panels are expected to be producing power without the need for public subsidies. Energy saving is much the same – our dilapidated buildings leak much of the energy we spend billions producing. A nationwide refit of homes – kickstarted by the government via its current energy bill – would create jobs as well as saving energy, but progress remains slow and halting. Fears that the public won't accept large-scale renewable power because of the impact on our landscapes are understandable. But there is currently more public support for investment in renewable energy than in nuclear. Friends of the Earth has launched a new petition for those who want an energy future based on saving energy and renewable power. The tide is turning. It's time to highlight the growing body of evidence showing we can keep the lights on with renewable power if we cut the amount of energy we waste. Experts from the Department of Energy and Climate Change's chief scientific adviser, David MacKay, to the respected European consultancy Ecofys, agree that it is possible to provide the energy we need and reduce carbon emissions without nuclear. Nuclear power offers no safe solution for waste, economics that don't add up, and dangers of nuclear proliferation. An energy future is possible without these negatives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/23/france-doubt-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T12:09:55Z","webTitle":"Is the French public beginning to doubt nuclear power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/23/france-doubt-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/23/france-doubt-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Is the French public beginning to doubt nuclear power?","bodyText":"The presence of the Gravelines nuclear power plant in northern France is unmissable for miles around, where dozens of lines of enormous pylons march six abreast across the landscape, each hung with heavy cables that carry 7% of France's electricity across the country. Gravelines, on the French coast between Calais and Dunkirk, about 30 miles from Dover, is the fifth biggest nuclear reactor in the world, and one of the hardest working – last year, it became the first to produce more than one terawatt-hour of electricity. Its six reactors cover 150 hectares (370 acres) and are tended by nearly 2,000 people. It is also on Greenpeace's list of \"reactors of particular concern\", because of its age. Work began on the plant in 1970, with the first reactors entering service in 1980, and the rest following in 1981 and 1985, the year before the Chernobyl disaster. But for the people of Gravelines, a small village dwarfed by the hulking presence of the nearby plant, the power station is simply a fact of life. \"It has always been there,\" says an unconcerned Debbie Bourdelle, in the local hairdressers, Coiffure A Petit Prix. \"We don't think about it.\" \"Why would we think about it?\" asks Michel Rodriguez. \"It's just there, and there is so much security – and we have confidence in the engineers.\" France's relationship with nuclear power is rivalled only by Japan. The country embarked on a massive building programme in the 1950s and 60s as a nationalist effort to be independent of energy imports, and France now generates more than 70% of its electricity from its 58 reactors, of which several are on the north coast with others on the borders with Belgium and Germany, and a string in the south. Virtually every French region has one. The nuclear industry in France is closely bound up with the government – ministers strongly support the industry, and the national electricity company, EDF, receives high approval ratings. Areva, the nuclear technology company whose headquarters tower over Paris's business district, is defended as a \"national champion\". \"People just took nuclear for granted,\" says Sophia Majmoni of Greenpeace France. \"They preferred not to have to think about where their energy came from. Even with Chernobyl, they said that couldn't happen here, we are safe.\" However, that cosy relationship with atomic power may be unravelling. Even before the near-meltdowns at Fukushima, there was a small but growing current of unease, particularly among younger people, who have tended to be more environmentally aware than their parents. Since the Japanese incidents, a few politicians on the left of the French political spectrum have begun to question the country's reliance on a single source of energy. \"This is a big change for France,\" says Majmoni. \"People are starting to ask questions. We have an election coming up and the Green party is campaigning on the issue, and [if they do a deal post-election] they will make this the main point. But changing people's minds might take a long time.\" Just how long is evident at Gravelines. \"What happened in Japan does not mean there is any more of a risk here,\" says Bourdelle, while her fellow worker nods. \"It's not the same.\" This is despite reports of several \"level one\" incidents in the past five years at the plant, including an emergency evacuation in 2009 when a fuel rod being cleared out of number one reactor got stuck. Much of the local economy, as in towns and villages around France, depends on the enormous power station. Virginie Daubercourt, a receptionist at the Hostellerie du Beffroi hotel, says: \"We have people stay here, people from Areva and EDF. People locally have confidence in the way the plant is run.\" \"Everyone knows somebody who works there – a brother, a sister, a partner who works there,\" says Joseph Capelle in the Queen Mary cafe on Gravelines' main square. \"Because we know people who work there, we aren't worried – we know it is well-controlled, super-controlled in fact.\" He demonstrated against the plant when it was first being built in 1970. \"The ecologists persuaded us that we should, we were manipulated by them. I was young then, I thought it was dangerous. I don't now.\" \"I'd rather live here than near a coal-fired power station – there's no pollution here,\" says Joseph Meuquelan, a former ferry worker. Only a few people are willing to admit to any anxiety about the plant, even in the wake of the Japanese incidents. \"I wouldn't work at the nuclear plant,\" says Philippe Cozette, whose claim to fame locally is that he was the first worker to break through to the English side of the channel tunnel. \"People are worried, I think, they are concerned about their children. They are nervous.\" \"Some people may ask questions, after Japan,\" says Maurice Boansville, a bus driver. \"They may start to look at it again in a different way.\" • The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday 1 April 2011.

The withdrawal has further hampered efforts to secure safety at the atomic power plant and avert a major radiation leak. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said the emergency crew, which had been dousing the plant's reactors with seawater in an attempt to stabilise their temperatures, had no choice but to pull back from the most dangerous areas. \"The workers cannot carry out even minimal work at the plant now. Because of the radiation risk we are on standby,\" he said. Radiation levels dropped later, but it was not immediately clear if the workers had been allowed back in, or how far away they had withdrawn. Emperor Akihito said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the nuclear crisis and was praying for his people. In his first public comments since last Friday's massive earthquake, Akihito appeared live on television to offer his condolences to the victims of the disaster. \"I am deeply concerned about the nuclear situation because it is unpredictable,\" he said. \"With the help of those involved I hope things will not get worse.\" The nuclear plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said it was considering using helicopters to spray the crippled No 4 reactor with water and boric acid in an attempt to slow down the nuclear reaction and cool the core. But strong winds have meant that helicopters have been unable to take off. Earlier, Edano warned that the plan might not work. \"It's not so simple that everything will be resolved by pouring in water. We are trying to avoid creating other problems,\" he said. \"We are actually supplying water from the ground, but supplying water from above involves pumping lots of water and that involves risk. We also have to consider the safety of the helicopters above,\" he said. The 70 or so engineers, working around the clock in harsh conditions, spent Wednesday morning trying to put out a fire at one reactor and to cool others at risk of overheating and reaching criticality. To compound problems, a fire broke out at the No 3 reactor, where a fuel storage pool had overheated and may have let off radioactive steam. Live TV footage showed a large cloud of light grey smoke rising above the plant. All six of the reactors at Fukushima are experiencing problems following the earthquake and tsunami, in which an estimated 10,000 people died. The workers were ordered to leave the facility after the level of radiation at the plant soared to 10 millisieverts per hour – above the level considered harmful to human health – possibly as a result of radioactive substances being emitted from the No 2 reactor. The reading later fell to around six millisieverts per hour, reports said. The evacuation followed another day of crisis at the plant, which has become the focus of the world's attention, even as rescue workers sift through the damage caused by the tsunami along a vast stretch of Japan's north-east coast. Earlier, officials from the nuclear and industrial safety agency said that 70% of fuel rods at the No 1 reactor had been significantly damaged, as well as 33% of rods at the No 2 reactor. The cores of both reactors are believed to have partially melted, Kyodo news agency said. \"We don't know the nature of the damage,\" said Minoru Ohgoda, spokesman for the country's nuclear safety agency. \"It could be either melting, or there might be some holes in them.\" Before they were moved to safety the workers had been trying to cool spent nuclear fuel pools at the No 5 and No 6 reactors, where temperatures have risen above normal levels. Edano said that there was \"a possibility that the No 3 reactor's containment vessel is damaged\". A blaze also broke out again at the No 4 reactor, which was already feared to be at risk of leaking radioactivity. The nuclear safety agency reported that flames and smoke were no longer visible half an hour later, but were unable to confirm that the fire had been extinguished. The No 4 reactor is an increasing cause for concern. Tepco believes that the storage pool may be boiling, raising the possibility that exposed rods will reach criticality. \"The possibility of re-criticality is not zero,\" a Tepco spokesman said. The government has ordered 140,000 people living within a 19-mile radius of the plant to remain indoors after a spike in radiation levels. A further 70,000 residents had already been moved to safe distances. The government said it had no immediate plans to widen the evacuation zone. The crisis unfolding in Fukushima continued to raise anxiety levels in Tokyo, 150 miles to the south. Radiation levels in the capital were 10 times higher than normal on Tuesday evening, but posed no health hazard, the government said. The meteorological agency said winds near the power plant would blow from the north-west and out into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday. The winds were expected to strengthen in the afternoon, the agency added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/blog/2011/mar/24/fukushima-radiation-levels","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-24T14:55:00Z","webTitle":"Visualising radiation from the Fukushima nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/mar/24/fukushima-radiation-levels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2011/mar/24/fukushima-radiation-levels","fields":{"headline":"Visualising radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear power plant","bodyText":"There's been a lot of talk in the media over the past two weeks about radiation levels surrounding the Fukushima nuclear power station that was wrecked in the recent earthquake and subsequent tsunami. I've posted a couple of examples below of how the radiation data being made public by the Japanese authorities can be represented. Rather than the static information you'd get in a print article, citing X microsieverts per hour, for example, these visualisations give you a sense of how the situation has evolved. These have been created by Alasdair Allan, a senior research fellow at Exeter University, with Gemma Hobson, a senior intelligence analyst with Devon County Council and Pete Warden, the creator of the Data Science Toolkit. This first visualisation shows how the radiation levels picked up around Japan via monitoring stations have changed over time. The radiation is measured in microsieverts per hour. Dark green corresponds to 0.25 microsieverts/hour, a medium green is 0.13 microsieverts/hour and light green is 0.01 microsieverts/hour. This next visualisation might be more interesting, because it plots the radiation levels as a multiple of the typical maximum radiation measurement taken at a particular site. So a red circle means the radiation is 2.25x the normal max level for that site, and blue corresponds to 4.5x the typical maximum. If you want to take a look at the full data set, click here. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency has begun issuing daily updates on the status of each reactor, alongside timestamps for significant actions taken at each.

So said John F Kennedy in September 1962 as he pledged a manned lunar landing by the end of the decade. The US president knew that his country's space programme would be expensive. He knew it would have its critics, but he took the long-term view. Warming to his theme in Houston that day, JFK went on: \"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others too.\" That was the world's richest country at the apogee of its power in an age where both Democrats and Republicans were prepared to invest in the future. Kennedy's predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, took a plan for a system of interstate highways and made sure it happened. Contrast that with today's America, which looks less like the leader of the free world than a banana republic with a reserve currency. Planning for the long term now involves last-ditch deals on Capitol Hill to ensure the federal government can remain open until January and debts can be paid at least until February. The US is not the only country with advanced short-termism. It merely provides the most egregious example of the disease. This is a world of fast food and short attention spans, of politicians so dominated by a 24/7 news agenda that they have lost the habit of planning for the long term. Britain provides another example of the trend. Governments of both left and right have for years put energy policy in the \"too hard to think about box\". They have not been able to make up their minds whether to commit to renewables as Germany has done, or to nuclear as France has done. So, the nation of Rutherford is now prepared to have a totalitarian country take a majority stake in a new generation of nuclear power stations. Politics, technology and human nature all militate in favour of kicking the can down the road. The most severe financial and economic crisis in more than half a century has further discouraged policymakers from raising their eyes from the present to the distant horizon. Clearly, though, the world faces long-term challenges that will only become more acute through prevarication. These include coping with a bigger and ageing global population, ensuring growth is sustainable and equitable, providing resources to pay for modern transport and energy infrastructure, and reshaping international institutions so they represent the world as it is in the early 21st century rather than as it was in 1945. Pascal Lamy had a stab at tackling some of these difficult issues last week when he presented the findings of the Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations, which the former World Trade Organisation chief has been chairing for the past year. The commission's report, Now for the Long Term, looks at some \"mega trends\" that will shape the world in the decades to come, and lists the challenges under five headings: society, resources, health, geopolitics, governance. Change will be difficult, the study suggests, because problems are complex, institutions are inadequate, faith in politicians is low and short-termism is well-entrenched. It cites examples of collective success, such as the Montreal convention to prevent ozone depletion, the establishment of the Millennium Development Goals, and the G20 action to prevent the great recession of 2008-09 turning into a full-blown global slump. It also cites examples of collective failure – fish stocks depletion, the deadlocked Copenhagen climate change summit of 2009. The report suggests a range of long-term ideas worthy of serious consideration. It urges a coalition between the G20, 30 companies and 40 cities to lead the fight against climate change. It would like \"sunset clauses\" for all publicly funded international institutions to ensure they are fit for purpose; removal of perverse subsidies on hydrocarbons and agriculture with the money redirected to the poor; introduction of CyberEx, an early warning platform aimed at preventing cyber attacks; a Worldstat statistical agency to collect and ensure quality of data; and investment in the younger generation through conditional cash transfers and job guarantees. Lamy expressed concern that the ability to address challenges was being undermined by the absence of a collective vision for society. The purpose of the report, he said, was to build \"a chain from knowledge to awareness to mobilising political energy to action\". Full marks for trying, but this is easier said than done. Take trade, where Lamy has spent the past decade, first as Europe's trade commissioner then as head of the WTO, trying to piece together a new multilateral deal. This is an area in which all 150-plus WTO members agree in principle about the need for greater liberalisation but in which it has proved impossible to reach agreement in talks that started in 2001. Nor will a shakeup of the international institutions be plain sailing. It is a given that developing countries, especially the bigger ones such as China, India and Brazil, should have a bigger say in the way the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are run. Yet it's proved hard to persuade developed world countries to cede some of their voting rights, and the deal is still being held up by US foot dragging. These, remember, are the low-hanging fruit. Another conclave of the global great and good is looking at what should be done in the much trickier area of climate change. The premise of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate is that nothing will be done unless finance ministers are convinced of the need for action, especially given the damage caused by a deep recession and sluggish recovery. Instead of preaching to the choir the plan is to show how to achieve key economic objectives – growth, investment, secure public finances, fairer distribution of income – while at the same time protecting the planet. The pitch to finance ministers will be that tackling climate change will require plenty of upfront investment that will boost growth rather than harm it. Will this approach work? Well, maybe. But it will require business to see the long-term benefits of greening the economy as well as the short-term costs, because that would lead to the burst of technological innovation needed to accelerate progress. And it will require the same sort of commitment it took to win a world war or put a man on the moon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/southern-crossroads/2013/dec/19/environmental-defenders-office-defunded-potoroo","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-19T08:26:19Z","webTitle":"You won't believe which environment group the Australian government has de-funded now | Alexander White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/southern-crossroads/2013/dec/19/environmental-defenders-office-defunded-potoroo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/southern-crossroads/2013/dec/19/environmental-defenders-office-defunded-potoroo","fields":{"headline":"You won't believe which environment group the Australian government has de-funded now","bodyText":"Stay with me on this one. The joke started something like this: a cockatoo, a potoroo, a skink and a brown tree frog go into a bar... Unfortunately, this isn't' a very funny joke, because the Glossy Black Cockatoo, the Long-nosed Potoroo, the Eastern She-oak Skink and the Large Brown Tree Frog are all threatened species. The Glossy Black is a fussy eater, a bit like a vegan hipster. It only feeds on the seeds in cones of she-oaks, and even then, only from selected individual trees. Like someone who's found their favourite barista and doesn't want to risk getting a bad coffee somewhere else, the Glossy Black will return to eat at the same tree time and time again, even other trees are overflowing with oak-cones. We don't really know why Glossy Blacks are so particular, but since each one can live up to thirty years, we should be able to take the time to get to know them properly. If we don't wipe them out first. If the Glossy Black Cockatoo is a hipster, the Long-nosed Potoroo is like a shy and lonely emo with a preference for eating fungi when the stars are out. Closely related to kangaroos, the Long-nose makes up for its shyness during its twice-yearly mating season, and is notorious in the Australian outback for having a prodigious number of sexual partners. A big threat to the Long-nose's rutting, fungi-eating lifestyle is feral cats, foxes and human development. The She-oak Skink and the Large Brown Tree Frog are less warm and fuzzy than the other two. In fact, they're scaly and slimy. I'm not clear why it's named after the She-oak, but the She-oak Skink lives the lizard equivalent of a ski-bum lifestyle in the alpine regions of Victoria around Mt Hotham and Falls Creek. (There's also a Tasmanian She-oak Skink.) The Large Brown Tree Frog is actually pretty small, around 45 mm in length, and like a mad sports fan it looks like it has painted its face with dark stripes like war-stripes. I said the joke was not very funny. Here's why. The Victorian government has a legal obligation to protect threatened species, but a remarkable loop-hole allows state-owned, loss-making corporations like VicForests to log their habitat so long as there was no conservation plan. This includes the picky-eater Glossy Black Cockatoo, and the war-painted Large Brown Tree Frog. The ABC reported at the time: A statement from the Department of Environment and Primary Industries confirmed there were 689 species, communities or processes (such as pollution of waterways or removal of species) that did require action statements. Of these, the department said 60 per cent had either been \"drafted, published or were due for review\". The implications of only 60 percent of these \"species, communities or processes\" having a conservation plan is ghastly; what does it say about the Victorian government's attitude to the environment? And the Glossy Black and his three friends? They've been without conservation plans for at least 10 years. This sense of moral affrontry is no doubt what drove Environment East Gippsland and the EDO to go to court to demand the Victorian government follow its own laws. Dick the Butcher may have once suggested that we \"kill all the lawyers\", but there are some lawyers we should probably spare. The non-profit lawyers from the Environmental Defenders Office are definitely amongst them. The EDO in Victoria recently took the Victorian government to court for breaking its own laws by not preparing conservation plans (called \"action statements\") for the Glossy Black Cockatoo, the Long-nose Potoroo, the She-oak Skink and the Large Brown Tree Frog. The Environmental Defenders Office is a small network of nine state-based non-profit community legal centres (they're collectively the Australian Network of EDOs). They are a small but highly effective group of lawyers who make sure that Australia's environmental laws are upheld. Since they were founded in the 1990s, they've held governments and big business accountable when their actions would threaten species like the fungi-eating potoroo. While multi-national mining companies and cashed-up developers can plough nearly unlimited funds into running roughshod over our environmental laws, everyday communities rely on organisations like the EDO. The punch-line to this joke was delivered by Tony Abbott on Tuesday 17 December. That's when he announced that federal funding for Environmental Defenders Offices would be removed. As a community legal centre, the EDO was until Tuesday funded through the Attorney General's office. This was worth, nationally, about $10 million, to do priceless environmental protection work. Why exactly would Prime Minister Abbott, and the Attorney General George Brandis do this? Your guess is as good as mine. Brandis himself says that: the government was having to make savings across all portfolios in a \"fiscally constrained environment\". \"The government has prioritised the funding of legal financial assistance to frontline services,\" he said. (Here's what economist Stephen Koukoulas says about the LNP's recent mid-year economic forecast, and Greg Jericho on the fraud that is their \"fiscally constrained environment\".) But another reason may be something that NSW Mineral Council boss, Stephen Galilee, said in October. The Australian reported: Mr Galilee said it was \"ridiculous\" that taxpayer funds were being used to appeal and reject approved projects. \"We will be seeking to take up the issue of commonwealth funding of the NSW EDO with the new Attorney-General and the new government,\" he said. \"We were dismayed when former attorney-general Mark Dreyfus decided in June to provide a $300,000 grant (per year) of taxpayer funds to the NSW EDO. (And since we're on the topic of use of taxpayer funds, is it worth raising the $10 billion in fossil fuel subsidies that may financially benefit some members of the NSW Minerals Council? More about that here.) This funding cut really is just yet another example of the Abbott government's ideologically driven war against the environment, and their Nixonian hatred of an enemies hit-list which includes anyone who cares about the environment. Senior ecologist for the Australian Conservation Foundation, Dugald Murray put it well when he said: The cost of the government's decision to cut federal funding for EDOs will be borne by Australian communities and by our unique and fragile environment. Glen Klatovski, from The Wilderness Society, echoed those views: \"For thousands of people around the country one of their only avenues to protect their community, often against illegal activity, has been seriously cut,\" he said. Driven by climate change denial, and by the far right in the Liberal-National party, Tony Abbott and George Brandis are engaging in a dangerous first-hundred-day fantasy romp against environmentalists. The abolition of the Climate Commission, the snub at CHOGM and the UN climate talks, the attacks on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the scare campaign against the carbon price, the review of the renewable energy target, the obsession with building a nuclear power plant, and the building of one of the world's largest coal ports on top of the Great Barrier Reef. The defunding of the Environmental Defenders Office. This is yet another morbid symptom of Abbott's climate denial-driven war, and his agenda of handing over Australia to global mining companies and billionaire coal barons. Humble, harmless native Australian animals deserve to treated better than a joke; Abbott's actions this week show precisely what he thinks of them. If you feel, like I do, that the Australian government should re-fund the Environmental Defenders Offices, please share your support. Proud to support Environmental Defenders Office.

Cable also announced that Sir Adrian Montague, a City of London grandee, would be the first de facto chairman of the bank, in the first formal step towards establishing the institution. He will initially be chair of an advisory group rather than a formal board for the bank, because the government must satisfy EU state aid rules before it can formally set up the bank. Sir Adrian is chairman of venture capital group 3i, and formerly worked for British Energy and Network Rail, as well as serving as chief executive of the Private Finance Initiative Taskforce at the Treasury. The prospect of the green investment bank financing flood defences came as a surprise, though officials indicated that it was likely to take several years before any such projects were funded. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is facing severe budget cuts that will make less money available for vital flood defence projects. From 2015, the bank would also be able to provide finance to nuclear power plants, under the plans. This will be controversial, as the coalition has previously promised not to publicly subsidise to new nuclear reactors. Cable sought to pre-empt such concerns by pointing out that money for nuclear would not be the first priority, with offshore wind farms, industrial energy efficiency projects and waste likely to attract the bulk of funding in the first four years. \"We are not ruling out [nuclear] forever. But there is absolutely no prospect that nuclear in the near future will be supported by the bank,\" he said. Cable also appeared to clash with his boss, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, over whether the bank should have the power to borrow money from the private sector. In a speech to investors on Monday, Clegg made it clear that the bank must be allowed to borrow in the public markets just as private sector institutions can. \"It will borrow independently ... it is going to be able to borrow as a proper bank,\" he said. However, in Cable's briefing he laid an alternative option, by which the bank would have to borrow through the Treasury – a limitation that Clegg dismissed as \"going round in circles recycling public money\". Cable said on Tuesday: \"We are some years from having the borrowing capability and defining it in advance is not helpful.\" Referring to Clegg's comments, he said: \"The deputy prime minister was simply being positive – I do not think he was ruling out any of the options.\" The bank has been the subject of repeated rows over the last year between the business department and the Treasury, on one side, arguing for greater government control over the bank, and the department of energy and climate change on the other, arguing for greater independence. Investors also support greater independence for the bank. John Cridland, the director general of the CBI, said on Monday: \"The bank would not work if it needed the Treasury's permission to blow its nose.\" The government said the bank's initial £3bn of funding from the public purse – to be ring-fenced by the Treasury – would lead to £15bn in new investment in green infrastructure by 2015, as the bank's funding would act as a catalyst to other investors. Although the legislation for the bank may take longer than a year, funds should be released within 11 months so companies can already start to make plans to apply for funding for green projects, including offshore wind farms, waste and industrial energy efficiency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-nuclear-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T13:26:55Z","webTitle":"Germany can no longer pretend nuclear power is safe | Roland Nelles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-nuclear-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-nuclear-germany","fields":{"headline":"Germany can no longer pretend nuclear power is safe","bodyText":"The catastrophe in Japan has sparked debate internationally on nuclear energy, but it is especially fierce in Germany. After Fukushima, it can no longer be viewed as a viable energy source for the future. German chancellor Angela Merkel must alter her pro-nuclear stance. There are, of course, several arguments in favour of nuclear energy. In contrast to coal-fired power plants, atomic reactors produce little in the way of CO2 emissions – which is good news for the climate. In addition, the technology is helpful for regions which may not have natural gas reserves, for example. Nuclear energy means a certain degree of independence and a modicum of political autonomy when it comes to determining energy policy. Furthermore, energy produced from nuclear power plants tends to be cheap, making it popular with consumers. But none of that counts – at least not any more. After the earthquake and tsunami in Japan followed by the ever-worsening stream of terrible news relating to the country's nuclear power facilities, even the last remaining advocates of the technology must realise that we can't go on like this. It is over. Done. Finished. Nuclear energy cannot be controlled by humans, no matter how good the arguments might be in its favour. The danger of disaster is real, and it can happen at any time – even in a super high-tech country such as Japan. And it could also happen here in Germany. A sense of security when it comes to atomic reactors is no longer possible. Not anywhere. The earthquake in Japan is emerging as a decisive turning point in the history of nuclear technology. People learn from experience, and the lesson is clear: not everything that is technically possible is a good thing. New ways need to be found to cover the energy needs of a growing population. And people need to move faster on this issue than they have so far. That is true worldwide and also, of course, in Germany. After the events of the weekend, anyone who tries to claim that it couldn't happen here looks ridiculous. In Japan there was a chain of unfortunate events: the devastating earthquake followed by the disastrous tsunami. That is true. But what is a disaster apart from a chain of unfortunate events? Be it plane crashes, car accidents or core meltdowns, something will always go wrong when people are involved. At some point this unfortunate chain of events will also hit us – or our neighbours, such as France, a nation which is so fond of nuclear energy. And what will happen then? Merkel and her government want to review the safety standards at German nuclear power plants. By doing so, they hope to stifle the atomic energy debate. But why do the security measures need to be checked? Haven't we always being told that German nuclear power plants are the safest in the world? Crisis meetings, security summits, special checks, those are the signs of a dying industry and the rearguard action of its political helpers. At some stage Germany will exit nuclear power – and sooner than advocates of the technology like to think. Old fears of a massive nuclear meltdown have resurfaced in Germany. Traditional nuclear critics within the Green party and the center-left Social Democrats will exploit these fears. A diehard pragmatist such as Merkel will certainly recognise this. And she will change her course. That much is certain. But how quickly will Berlin be able to shift its tack on the issue? Is the country really moving quickly enough in its adoption of sustainable energies? Certainly not. The companies operating Germany's nuclear power plants are earning billions, but only a tiny fraction of those profits are being channelled into the expansion of the country's use of alternative energies. That must change. Of course it would be nonsense to switch off all of Germany's power plants overnight just to appease the critics. But the development of sufficient quantities of renewable energies requires political resolve. And that resolve can only be generated once it becomes clear that Germany's nuclear power plants will soon be taken off the grid permanently. That was the logic behind the decision to phase out nuclear energy in Germany by 2022 – a policy established over a decade ago by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats and their coalition partners, the Greens. But that plan was reversed last autumn when Merkel's Christian Democrats, together with the business-friendly Free Democrats, put a halt to the phase-out and passed legislation extending the operating lives of Germany's nuclear power plants. Now it is clear: that decision was a mistake. And that mistake must now be corrected. No, it is no longer tempting to argue in favour of nuclear power. Not any more. • This article has been provided by Spiegel as part of a special arrangement with the Guardian.

This last option would, as some commentators have lately observed, have been a winner. Salmond could not believe his luck. From then on he has wallowed in the extended period up to his chosen election date spinning his tartan dream world, firing up people who may never before have voted with spurious promises of milk and heather honey.

And not a thought is spared for the cold, dark mornings of the long Scottish winter to come. If the Scottish government has resolutely refused to use the devolved tax-raising powers it has long had, that now looks very much like cynical bribery, one of the many unanswered questions Salmond declines to address. As Peter Hetherington points out (Society, 10 September), £1bn is the sum the SNP could have spent on an infrastructure fund. Instead we have a referendum, costly in so many ways – not least in the divisiveness and hostility within Scotland and the overt antipathy shown to anything or anybody English.

But simultaneously shout to the rooftops about the emotional “high” we all gain from Scotland being a leading nation within the UK! Heaven knows there’s a lot to be proud of. Why else are immigrants bypassing countless countries to queue at Calais? Why else are the British parliament (warts and all), the British civil service, the BBC, the British military, the British NHS, the British Red Cross, British sport and arts, so globally admired? British farming methods are also renowned, and even “Made in Britain” is again becoming a proud boast. Scots are deeply involved in all these very British things, with great affection, too, for our Queen and royal family – again, the subject of huge overseas envy – but who’d quickly be removed by President Salmond’s republican bedfellows. Scotland and the Scottish diaspora are intimately interwoven throughout the fabric of Britain, and we only have a few days left to convince the undecided that this is a cause for celebration and retention. Graeme G Crawford Edinburgh • In my heart I hope the Scottish people, including many of my relatives, vote no next week. However, I am puzzled that more people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland haven’t started to discuss the many benefits to them that might be realised from Scottish Independence. For example, there will be many job opportunities, as the departments like DWP and National Savings will have to relocate. In the past these have been allocated to areas where there has been low employment due to the loss of industries. Surely many cities would benefit from having these additional workforce requirements? This is one example, I’m sure there are many others. If we seriously want the Scottish people to reflect on what they might lose by becoming independent, it may be better to phrase the argument in terms of what the rest of the UK will gain. Sadly I suppose it’s a bit late for that now. Jenny Page Sidmouth, Devon • Should Scotland vote to separate from the rest of Britain then all our lives will be diminished at every level: cultural, political and economic. It is not scaremongering to remind people that a win for Alex Salmond could plunge the whole of the United Kingdom into an economic crisis the following day. The sharks are circling: our hard-earned, steady economic recovery is threatened. We are better together, but we should not remain together in the same way as we are today. There is a deep malaise in our current system of government. Far too much power has been centralised in Westminster. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are rightly demanding more political and economic control of their own futures. England, where 85% of British people actually live, has had no distinct voice on the constitutional changes that have taken place over the last five decades. Local government has been emasculated year on year since Margaret Thatcher won in 1979 and there is a compelling argument for some form of regional government that empowers business, industry and local communities. Voter turnout for all elections is so low that our democracy is undermined by non-participation. Perhaps the one thing we might be pleased about is that over 80% of eligible Scots are expected to vote in their referendum. We need a full constitutional convention. It is time to stop tinkering with our system of government. It is broken – let’s fix it. Ian Jones Chair, North East Liberal Democrats, Middlesbrough • Let us be quite clear, if there is a yes vote it is for ever. There will be no chance for second thoughts. Antagonistic attitudes will harden as if every issue was like a football match between the two nations. Before we get to this point of no return, could we plead for the matter to be looked at in a longer-term perspective? Let us reflect back say 200 years or so and forward say 25 years. If Scotland leaves the UK, it is most likely that the “little Englanders” goaded by the popular press will ensure that the rump of the UK leaves the EU. Even if Scotland is accepted into the EU, which is by no means guaranteed, it will have little chance of influencing the much-needed reforms of that institution compared with what a well-led UK government could do. Over the last two centuries or so the UK has fought hard and made significant sacrifices to ensure that the continent of Europe is not dominated by one national group for the clear reason that it would most likely be to the detriment of ourselves. The reunification of Germany, coupled with the investment and determination of the German people to make it a success, followed by the formation of the euro using political rather than economic criteria, and then the banking crisis, has put Germany in a dominant economic position which looks like growing at the expense of France, Italy and the rest. Of course, Germany is a good democratic European at present but who is to say as it gets even stronger that this will always be its stance. The UK’s “special relationship” with the Americans will die once we have no influence in the EU. That will, of course, mean that we will no longer have to help them in their unwise wars, but they will not intervene on our behalf. They will be busy coping (or not) with their own decline in world influence as China becomes the dominant economic power. Our trading relationships with the EU could well suffer and our bloated banks will most assuredly be sidelined. Yet nationalised French and German companies will be dominating our electricity supply. We will both be impotent to look after our joint interests. So, dear Scottish friends and partners, please reflect on the tough times ahead for our children and grandchildren and help us all to hold our own. Graham Cooper Smethcott, Shropshire • The yes campaign hype has succeeded – so far – in masking its own hypocrisy and conning the electorate in the process. Here are just three examples: First, ridding Scotland of Trident while still hiding behind the nuclear skirts of Nato. Really? The SNP and the yes campaign have proclaimed that Nato has a number of non-nuclear states, yet hidden the fact that none of them eschew Nato’s nuclear umbrella, part of which happens to be based in the UK. Second, disavowing new nuclear energy, yet tacitly supporting extending the lifetimes of Scotland’s existing nuclear power stations and, through Scottish Enterprise (the Scottish government’s economic development agency) encouraging Scottish industry to “tool up” to support the nuclear energy industry outwith Scotland. And third, proclaiming the Scottish government’s avowed holier than thou foreign policy, yet happy to hawk the Clyde shipyards around the world as the place to build warships for foreign powers with whose foreign policies it disagrees. On this, and on many other issues, the SNP/yes claims of the moral high ground are totally dishonest. Social justice and equality of opportunity are felt just as strongly throughout the UK. The SNP’s moral and social concerns seem to stop at the border. Professor Paul W Jowitt Edinburgh • Scotland is no more homogeneous than the rest of the UK. The Shetlands were effectively a wedding present to the Scottish king in 1469. Is it safe to assume, therefore, that, if the Shetlands vote no, the SNP would respect their decision not to be part of an independent Scotland (what would that do to their sums?). It is also notable that, despite the SNP’s negative rhetoric, the rest of the UK wants Scotland to stay – and no one else seems to care about the financial impact either way. Nationalism is an ugly force, accentuating and exaggerating minor differences, creating and exploiting perceived grievances. It also creates simplistic, unrealistic solutions that will only be tested when it’s too late. The SNP’s unnecessary obsession with independence drowns out all else. It is a wonder drug, a panacea that solves everything. It gives rise to unrealistic expectations, not least in Alex Salmond’s attempt to treat the union as a pick ‘n’ mix where they can blackmail the rest into allowing them to choose unilaterally what they keep and what they reject. It is worth pointing out that, in the event of a yes vote, it would be the fiduciary duty of the rump UK government to negotiate the absolute best deal for the rest of the UK, and that means no favours for Scotland. The SNP will reap what they sow, but it is the ordinary citizen throughout the UK who will ultimately lose out. We will all be diminished. Stewart Fergus London • The Scots have been warned that there will be no currency union and they will have to abandon the pound. It is deeply troubling that so many people seem willing to ignore the facts. However a major reason for the growth of separatist feeling is the behaviour of the Tory and Ukip right wing. The Tory party lost Scotland several decades ago, and the growth between the largely social democratic Scots and the Thatcher brigade is massive. Nothing could be better calculated to remind the Scots of what they loathe about the English Tories than Douglas Carswell’s idiotic decision to trigger a byelection, in the run up to the referendum. Carswell is not the only one to undermine David Cameron and his attempts to hold the UK together. Boris Johnson is making it very obvious that he wants Cameron’s job and is prepared to play the anti-European card. As the Tory party is going to be divided and dominated by its right wing, and in government, for the foreseeable future, is it any wonder the Scots may think, wrongly, that separatism is for them? But they are at least conscious about wanting to destroy the UK. Do the Tory right even grasp that by boosting Ukip they are helping destroy the union they claim to support? Trevor Fisher Stafford • As a Scot living in England, I am sad, ashamed and angry at the level of support for the yes campaign. Sad when I think of the great Scots of the past like Andrew Carnegie, John Buchan and David Livingstone: principled, selfless and courageous – are these characteristics shared by Alex Salmond? Ashamed when I think how Scots’ emotions, especially Anglophobia, are being cynically manipulated by a rabble-rouser, supported by a spin doctor. Ashamed too at the bullying tactics and cheap jibes of the yes campaign and the resulting lasting damage to relationships between Scots. Angry because in the event of a yes vote my daughter and son-in-law will probably have to uproot their family to find work elsewhere, as they stand to lose their jobs in a national bank and an international energy company respectively. Such huge employers plan to leave Scotland because of certain financial chaos and because most of their business comes from elsewhere. Wake up: it’s not Westminster making fools of you, but a coterie of Scots hungry for power but irresponsibly clueless on policies. Frances Edge Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk • There are three things about the yes campaign that have convinced me to remain a no vote: their rose-tinted speculation, their insistence that everything will remain the same when it will not, and the arrogance of the SNP leaders of the campaign. The first two of these reasons were well illustrated during a television debate when the question of science research funding came up and it was stated that Cancer Research UK would continue to fund its research in an independent Scotland. CR UK does not fund any research outside the UK, but no one commented on the possibility that in the future this rule may be applied to Scotland if donors in the rest of the UK do not want their donations going to a foreign country, which is what Scotland will be. Having worked in academia I know how easy it is to move research groups; they will just follow the money out of Scotland. The question of oil revenue has been hotly debated, but the main thrust of the yes campaign is that Scotland would get the majority of the tax revenue assuming the division of the North Sea between the UK and Scotland will lie on a line running due east from Berwick. However I believe that under international law the UK could claim that the boundary between the Scottish and UK parts of the North Sea should follow approximately the direction of the land border between the countries, giving Scotland the area north of a line from Berwick to roughly Bergen. This puts more production platforms in the UK area than the yes campaign have counted on. Also, Norway may insist on negotiating to increase its oil production zone as the original division was between Norway and the UK, not Norway and Scotland. As for other things remaining the same, the yes campaign has remained silent over the domestic changes that will take place, for example: any product or special personal financial arrangement made by the UK Treasury will cease. Do you have Premium Bonds? They will be worthless but the UK Treasury will no doubt repay you their face value. Do you have any deposits in UK National Savings? These accounts will be frozen. Do you have an Isa? It will also be frozen. Has anyone in the yes camp said anything about car insurance? If Scotland becomes independent in March 2016 the law governing car insurance will become Scottish law. UK insurance companies will not insure drivers resident outside the UK, so to renew car insurance for a year after March 2015 two insurance contracts may be needed with all the extra expense that will no doubt bring. Of course if you then drive into the UK after March 2016 you will only be insured as a foreign driver, and what is to happen about drivers who are Scots-based but spend most of their time driving for work in the UK? As for arrogance, has anyone ever heard any SNP leader ever concede that any criticism of the yes campaign may be worth considering? To me Salmond, Sturgeon and Swinney are taking on the mantle of the old high Tory elite, putting the SNP up as the party with the manifest destiny to run Scotland. They are supporting the yes campaign with promises (increased state pension, reduction in corporation tax, increased agricultural subsidies) that they can only fulfil if they win both the yes vote and the 2016 election. Make no mistake, the yes campaigners outside the SNP have been hoodwinked into thinking they are doing the best for Scotland, but all they are doing is giving the SNP the right to split the UK and have the glittering prize of their own country to run. Finally a question that I have never had answered by a yes campaigner: if Scotland is so well run, why does the yes campaign want to remove from the Scottish people any influence that it may have in the rest of the UK?

But that is not a reason to ditch nuclear power","bodyText":"Power corrupts; nuclear power corrupts absolutely. The industry developed as a by-product of nuclear weapons research. Its deployment was used to shield the production of weapons from public view. Though the two industries have now been forced apart, in most parts of the world the nuclear operators remain secretive, unaccountable and far too close to government. Last week the Guardian revealed that the British government connived with corporations to play down the impact of the disaster at Fukushima. Comments from the nuclear companies, a business department official suggested, should be incorporated into ministers' briefings and government statements. It is through such collusion that accidents happen. The latest report by the International Atomic Energy Agency shows that Tepco, the firm that ran the stricken plant at Fukushima, had under-estimated the danger of tsunamis, had not planned properly for multiple plant failures and had been allowed to get away with it by a regulator that failed to review its protective measures. Nuclear operators worldwide have been repeatedly exposed as a bunch of arm-twisting, corner-cutting scumbags. In this respect they are, of course, distinguished from the rest of the energy industry, which is run by collectives of self-abnegating monks whose only purpose is to spread a little happiness. How they ended up sharing the names and addresses of some of the nuclear companies is a mystery that defies explanation. The front-page story in Friday's Guardian quoted \"former government environmental adviser\" Tom Burke saying the following about the government's relationship with the nuclear companies. \"They are too close to industry, concealing problems, rather than revealing and dealing with them.\" What the article did not tell us is that Burke currently works for Rio Tinto, one of the world's biggest coal-mining corporations. It has, of course, always refrained from colluding with governments. All the big energy companies – whether they invest in coal, oil, gas, nuclear, wind or solar power – manipulate politicians, bully regulators and bamboozle the public. Their overweening power causes many kinds of harm; among them is the damage it has done to the case for nuclear technology. Strip away the interests and the arguments are strong. Let's begin with safety. The best evidence for the safety and resilience of nuclear power plants can be found at Fukushima. Not at Fukushima Daiichi, the power station where the meltdowns and explosions took place, but at Fukushima Daini, the plant next door. You've never heard of it? There's a good reason for that. It was run by the same slovenly company. It was hit by the same earthquake and the same tsunami. But it survived. Like every other nuclear plant struck by the wave, it went into automatic cold shutdown. With the exception of a nuclear missile attack, it withstood the sternest of all possible tests. What we see here is the difference between 1970s and 1980s safety features. The first Daiichi reactor was licensed in 1971. The first Daini reactor was licensed in 1982. Today's technologies are safer still. The pebble bed reactors now being tested by China, for example, shut themselves down if they begin to overheat as an inherent property of the physics they exploit. Using a plant built 40 years ago to argue against 21st-century power stations is like using the Hindenburg disaster to contend that modern air travel is unsafe. Even the Daiichi meltdown, the same energy agency report tells us, has caused no medical harm. While the evacuation it necessitated is profoundly traumatic and disruptive, \"to date no confirmed health effects have been detected in any person as a result of radiation exposure\" from the accident. Compare this to the 100,000 deaths caused by air pollution from coal plants every year, and you begin to see that we've been fretting about the wrong risks. Compare it to the damage and death that climate change will cause, and you find that our response is so disproportionate as to constitute a form of madness. It's a straightforward pay-off. Germany's promise to ditch nuclear power will produce an extra 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. In June Angela Merkel announced a possible doubling of the capacity of the coal and gas plants Germany will build in the next 10 years. Already Germany has been burning brown coal, one of the most polluting fuels on earth, to make up the shortfall. The renewable technologies which should have replaced fossil fuels will instead replace nuclear power. This is the point at which anti-nuclear activists reach for one of four arguments. The first is that we should concentrate on reducing energy demand. Dead right we should – regardless of which technology we favour. But even with a massive cut in overall demand, getting the carbon out of transport and heating means increasing electricity supply. The Centre for Alternative Technology's radical and optimistic plan for decarbonising Britain envisages a 55% cut in energy consumption by 2030 – and a near-doubling in electricity supply. Contest this by all means, but you'll have to explain what it got wrong. The second is that it takes 10 to 15 years to build new nuclear plants. This, they argue, is too long. It is. So is the 10 to 15 years it takes to roll out a major renewables programme. The third is that uranium supplies will run out. They will, one day. The Committee on Climate Change estimates that they're good for 50 years. Long before then, we should have switched to fourth generation technologies, which would run on the waste produced by current nuclear generators. This leads us to the fourth objection: that nuclear waste cannot be disposed of safely. Even if we assume that we'll want to get rid of them, rather than use them as a valuable fuel, the claim that it's unsafe to put fissile materials underground is inexplicable. Isn't that where they came from? Why is it less safe to leave uranium several thousand metres below the surface, encased in lead, backfilled with bentonite and capped with concrete than it is to leave it, as nature did, scattered around the planet, just beneath the surface? And is it plausible that a future civilisation would possess the technology to extract our waste from those astonishing depths, but not to figure out that it might be harmful? All these arguments have been obscured by the justifiable distrust bred by industry spin and collusion. There is no contradiction between favouring the machines and opposing the machinations. A new generation of nuclear power stations should be built only with unprecedented scrutiny and transparency – and the same applies to all our energy options. Corporate power? No thanks. • A fully referenced version of this article can be found on George Monbiot's website"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/16/david-king-fracking-shale-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-16T16:42:23Z","webTitle":"Sir David King warns against fracking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/16/david-king-fracking-shale-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/16/david-king-fracking-shale-gas","fields":{"headline":"Sir David King warns against fracking","bodyText":"Sir David King, former chief scientific adviser to the government, has warned of the \"enormous environmental consequences\" of attempting to fulfil the UK's gas needs by fracking and has played down the idea that it would have a major impact on the UK's energy market. King, who left his government post in 2007, has been appointed special representative on climate change to the foreign secretary, William Hague, with effect from 1 October. But, in contrast to many of the coalition's senior figures, who are eagerly espousing shale gas as an alternative to investment in renewable energy, he does not believe gas from unconventional sources can be relied on to power the UK. \"It will not be a game-changer here as it has been in the US,\" he told the Guardian in his first interview since his new appointment. \"You will not be able to do that and there would be enormous environmental consequences.\" He said that the role of gas in future would be much reduced, with the fuel providing only a back-up service in power generation, turned on at periods of peak electricity demand and then turned off again in favour of renewables and nuclear power. This view is in stark contrast to ministerial urgings for a new \"dash for gas\" that some in the coalition have said should take over from the push for renewable energy. George Osborne, chancellor of the exchequer, has introduced new tax breaks for shale gas exploration. David Cameron has said that shale gas will reduce bills. And Ed Davey, the climate change minister, said last week that fracking would not endanger the UK's climate targets. King's reappointment to a government role – primarily to guide the UK's stance in international climate negotiations, but he also to advise on aspects of the UK's greenhouse gas reduction – will cause consternation among some green campaigners, because of his controversial views on the progress of UN climate negotiations. He does not believe that the current style of talks, aimed at producing a global agreement similar to the Kyoto protocol of 1997, will bear fruit in the way their backers hope. His view is that the US, which declined to ratify the Kyoto protocol, will not sign up to a legally binding international treaty on climate change because that would require a majority in favour in Congress, which he sees as unlikely. At the same time, he notes, China – the world's biggest emitter – is refusing to countenance a global agreement if the US stays outside. King said that a \"considerably more creative\" solution was needed. This would be most likely to take the form of a \"bottom-up\" arrangement by which each country could set its own targets on greenhouse gas reduction, and meet them at a national level, rather than having to submit to internationally set goals. Many green campaigning groups deplore such a suggestion because they see it as much less rigorous than a formal treaty and easier for countries to wriggle out of, leaving greenhouse gases to continue their rapid rise. The consequences of such a rise are expected to be set out in stark terms later this month, when scientists meet for the first time in seven years to hammer out the final details of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They are expected to say that climate change is 95% likely to have been caused by human actions, and that if greenhouse gases are allowed to continue their rise, the results will be felt around the world in the form of sea level rises, glacial melting, storms, droughts and floods. King said the climate negotiations were \"one of the biggest challenges for diplomacy\". His new role will take him centre stage at the next round of the UNFCCC talks in Warsaw this November, in vital negotiations that are supposed to form a staging post on the way to a major conference in Paris in 2015, at which governments have pledged to forge a new global climate agreement. King's views on shale exploration come as anti-fracking campaigners celebrated a partial victory in the high court on Monday. Protestors camping at a potential fracking site in Sussex were told they could stay in place until early October. The Balcombe protestors were challenging an eviction notice from the local council, and they gained a partial victory, as the court ruled that the notice from the council was flawed, and adjourned proceedings. Hundreds of protesters gathered at the site over the summer, with numbers reaching thousands during the most intense period of the protest. Cuadrilla is exploring for oil in Balcombe, at a site abandoned by Conoco in the 1980s. The company, the first to embark on hydraulic fracturing in the UK, has no immediate plans to frack the area but will seek permission to do so if its current conventional drilling for oil does not succeed. The company has suffered a series of setbacks in its UK operations, including the protests at Balcombe which forced it to stop work temporarily, as well as small earthquakes at its Blackpool fracking site which halted work there for more than a year. The Balcombe case has been adjourned by the judge until 8 October, and the council must decide by then whether it is in the public interest to proceed. Many local people are opposed to fracking and support the protest, but others are \"fed up\" with the inconvenience of the protest camp on their doorstep. Vanessa Vine, a local resident who helped to set up the Balcombe protest camp, said: \"We are delighted to see sanity and justice prevailing for the Balcombe protectors. When will West Sussex county council take action to evict those who are genuinely posing a threat to the local community -those within the gates of the drill site who are putting us at grave risk, for short term ecocidal corporate gain?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jul/01/reducing-britains-nuclear-capability-grave-mistake","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-01T16:31:03Z","webTitle":"Reducing Britain's nuclear capability would be a grave mistake | David Blagden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/01/reducing-britains-nuclear-capability-grave-mistake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/01/reducing-britains-nuclear-capability-grave-mistake","fields":{"headline":"Reducing Britain's nuclear capability would be a grave mistake","bodyText":"The Cabinet Office will this month publish its review into alternatives to like-for-like replacement of the UK's Trident nuclear deterrent – or, more specifically, the Vanguard class of Royal Navy submarines that currently carries the Trident D5 ballistic missile. While the review will shy away from making firm policy choices (for intra-coalition political reasons), we know that alternatives to a replacement Trident system will be presented as \"compelling\" options, but exposed as both less capable and more costly, and therefore unlikely to be pursued. The move towards a reduced deterrent posture, however, is likely to come in the form of a suggestion that only building two or three boats in the new Trident-carrying submarine class would be a plausible option – a concession dear to senior Liberal Democrat defence figures, and one that may be tempting to other leaders in search of savings – in the place of the four outgoing Vanguards. Such a choice would be a grave mistake. Regardless of where one sits on the left/right political spectrum, if Britain is to possess a nuclear arsenal at all – as all three of the major parties still think we should – then it must be configured to promote caution rather than aggression in international crises. Moving from four ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to only two or three would end the Royal Navy's ability to keep one boat of the class permanently deployed at sea, as the then First Sea Lord made clear in 2009. This posture – known as continuous at-sea deterrence, or \"kaz-dee\" (CASD) – has been maintained without interruption since 1968. The rationale behind CASD is that if at least one submarine is always deployed, then Britain's ability to retaliate against nuclear aggression would be assured even if the UK – including the Royal Navy's bases – was attacked with little or no warning. In short, a continually-deployed SSBN provides a \"secure second-strike\" retaliatory capability. The great thing about secure second-strike nuclear arsenals is that they stop there being rewards for aggression, thereby helping to stabilise international diplomatic and military crises. An opponent does not have an incentive to strike you first, because doing so does not diminish your ability to inflict devastating retaliation – a potent deterrent to potential aggressors. A submarine tied up alongside HM Naval Base Clyde, by contrast, is not a deterrent – it's a \"target\". A potential aggressor contemplating an attack on Britain would face powerful incentives to destroy it before it left port. Faced with this reality, the government would have a terrible choice to make at the beginning of any international dispute with another nuclear power. Do they send the submarine to sea, a tremendously escalatory move that would turn a mere dispute into an acute crisis, not to mention the incentive faced by an opponent to target the submarine before it was safe in the open ocean? Or do they leave it in port, in which case, we are not only failing to generate deterrence, but are also incentivising our opponent to target Faslane? Part of the problem here is linguistic: nuclear weapons are not themselves \"the deterrent\"; rather, they \"produce\" deterrence when deployed correctly. Deployed incorrectly, they produce aggression incentives, crisis escalation, and elevated nuclear danger. If the Liberal Democrat wing of the government wants to make the case for complete unilateral disarmament, that is their prerogative: the wisdom of such a policy recommendation should be contested vigorously, but it should at least be an internally coherent argument. The argument that the world is dangerous enough to still necessitate keeping a residual nuclear arsenal, yet not dangerous enough for deterrence to be worth doing properly, by contrast, does not make sense. If the government believes that the future is threatening enough for a nuclear deterrent to be worth preserving, as it should, then it is worth an extra £5bn – less than the cost of a year's operations in Afghanistan – on the cost of procuring a new submarine class to buy the four boats necessary to ensure that the arsenal is survivable, deterrence credible, and Britain's future international crisis response capability stable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-clegg-cable","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-15T20:02:36Z","webTitle":"Lib Dem conference: Clegg and Cable at odds over economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-clegg-cable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-clegg-cable","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dem conference: Clegg and Cable at odds over economy","bodyText":"A growing dispute at the top of the Liberal Democrats emerged on Sunday as the business secretary, Vince Cable, refused to join Nick Clegg's attempt to crush a call from the party's left for the government do more to stimulate the recovery. Leftwing delegates want the party to distance itself from the Conservatives by adopting a more flexible policy on the pace of deficit reduction. They also want to allow councils \"with a sustainable business model\" to borrow more to build an extra 300,000 homes a year, including 50,000 homes for social rent. The row also reflects a wider strategic dispute within the party between those who want to embrace the recovery and those who would rather express concern that the chancellor, George Osborne, may be stoking a house price bubble. In an attempt to take credit for the emerging recovery, Clegg has decided to stage what Cable and some on the left regard as an artificial showdown over economic policy during a set-piece two-hour debate and vote on Monday. Clegg wanted Cable to speak in favour of the call not to break from the coalition's agreed deficit reduction plan, with his aides pointing out that the deputy prime minister expected all Lib Dem MPs to turn up for the vote. But Cable's aides said he will stay away from the debate, which is being billed as a test of Clegg's authority. Cable believed a compromise could have been reached between the leadership and the left over their amendments to the economic motion, especially the right for councils to borrow more to build. Cable will instead be preparing for his own speech on Monday, which will focus on zero-hours contracts and the disqualification of reckless directors, the aides said. There is also growing frustration in the leadership at Cable's apparent scepticism about the basis, pace and sustainability of the recovery. In a Guardian interview on Saturday, Cable was dubious about the recovery's strength, saying \"the danger lights had been flashing for some time\" over rising house prices. He proposed the government's help-to-buy mortgage guarantee scheme should not go ahead in areas where house prices are rising fast, such as in the south-east. The scheme will underwrite home purchases worth up to £600,000 with a deposit as low as 5% of the value of the property. On Sunday the Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander said: \"We're a million miles away from a housing bubble in this country.\" Clegg also insisted the scheme would remain nationwide, and that it could not be sacrificed simply due to what was happening in Kensington and Chelsea in London. Clegg's aides said that if the Lib Dems did not try unambiguously to own and celebrate the recovery after three years of Labour criticism, the credit the party deserves for sticking to the deficit plan will be \"hoovered up\" by Osborne. The energy secretary Ed Davey reflected Clegg's views, saying: \"We should be proud of what we have done in government. To turn our back now on what we have achieved would make no sense.\" The Social Liberal Forum (SLF) said its relatively mild amendments to the economic motion did not tear up the fiscal mandate and reflected positions adopted by the party in negotiations with the Treasury over the last two years. The SLF said it still hoped to win the argument on the issue of council borrowing. Clegg on Sunday won the support of the conference to back nuclear power and shelve any criticism of tuition fees by deferring the issue until after the election, as he tried to sell the principle of coalition politics. He said a return to single-party government after five years of coalition would mean squandering the sacrifices made in the period of austerity. A majority Labour government would wreck the recovery, while a Conservative-only administration would deliver \"the wrong kind of recovery\" by allowing the proceeds of growth to go to the rich, he said. Another coalition of balanced politics could finish the job started five years ago. The Lib Dem manifesto for the 2015 poll will be explicitly written with post-election negotiations in mind - identifying the policies which they are ready to \"die in the trenches\" for, as well as others which are open to compromise in coalition talks. He implied one likely red line is a commitment to take anyone earning the minimum wage out of income tax by raising thresholds to around £12,500, which Clegg said would be a \"signature tune\" of the Lib Dem campaign. He suggested that the Lib Dems' cherished \"mansion tax\" on residential properties worth over £2m was also likely to feature, though he insisted final decisions will not be taken until nearer the election. Party leaders tried to brush away the perennial question of whether they would prefer a second coalition with the Conservatives or instead a deal with Labour, the preferred option of most party supporters according to many polls. The education minister David Laws said: \"We have to work with the verdict of the British people, not the gut instincts of Lib Dems. I don't think we should allow central London to wag the dog of this policy.\" Clegg, meanwhile, is being urged by senior MPs closely involved in May's European elections campaign to say clearly before Christmas that the party will support an in-out referendum on Europe in the next parliament. There are fears the party will be cut down, partly due to the rise of Ukip, with one source saying: \"It is conceivable that we end up with no MEPs.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/11/watermelon-climate-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-11T10:10:23Z","webTitle":"Why a watermelon tells you what's wrong with the climate debate | James Randerson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/11/watermelon-climate-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/11/watermelon-climate-debate","fields":{"headline":"Why a watermelon tells you what's wrong with the climate debate","bodyText":"Watermelon is a word that tells you what is wrong with the climate change debate. For some libertarians, it is the insult that expresses what greenies and climate scientists are really up to. Behind all the acronyms and the jargon, they say, is a conspiracy to promote a nakedly political aim – anti-big business; anti-free market; pro-tax increases. In short, green on the outside but red on the inside. The full conspiracy theory requires an impressive degree of paranoia, but one of the reasons the jibe is so persistent is that, if we're honest, there is a grain of truth to it – at least among some in the green movement and on the left. Many of the policy responses to the climate change problem – consume less, regulate businesses, curb big oil and coal, restrict car use – feel more comfortable to those on the left than the right of the political spectrum. And as a result, right-leaning politicians and thinkers are in danger of losing grip on the most important issue of our age. That has already happened in large measure in America. It would be disastrous if it happened in the UK too. This is the backdrop to the parliamentary science and technology select committee's inquiry into the communication of climate science, to which I gave evidence on Monday. The Met Office is being questioned on Wednesday. The MPs on the committee are trying to get to the bottom of why the public is still confused about climate science when the core science has been pretty clear for years. The thrust of many of their questions was \"what could the media be doing better to communicate the science?\" Here's my answer in a nutshell: • Don't confer scientific expertise on people who do not deserve it. • Avoid false balance. In a field where 97% of peer-reviewed publications support the mainstream position we don't serve the readers well by giving undue prominence to those on the fringes (think scientists who argue HIV does not cause Aids or that smoking has no link to cancer). • And perhaps most importantly, make clear where scientific uncertainty lies and where it does not. While the precise impacts and timescale of climate change may be uncertain, the basic tenets are well-established science. The projections from climate scientists indicate that there is a significant risk of profound changes to climate if we continue to release greenhouse gases at the current rate. But if it was just a question of putting across complex science to a lay readership whose attention must be grabbed from the numerous other shiny news stories on offer that would be, if not easy, at least no harder than your average science story. Science journalists' stock in trade is making unfamiliar ideas intelligible, compelling, relevant and entertaining. And let's face it, climate science may be complex, but the Higgs boson is harder to grasp than global warming. The elephant in the room at the parliamentary inquiry though has been that, consciously or not, there are people on all sides of the climate debate who argue backwards from a cultural or political position. As a result, arguments about the science of climate change become a proxy for what is really a political argument. If you like the prescription, then you embrace the diagnosis. If you don't, you undermine the diagnosis or attack the doctor. Here's an example of former chancellor Nigel Lawson doing just that: \"There is now a new religion – the AGW [anthropogenic global warming] religion, of which scientists are the new priesthood, preaching their dogma with precisely the same claim to authority as the medieval catholic church.\" It is perhaps understandable that some on the right have reacted strongly to what they perceive as a left-wing agenda masquerading as science. But it is also a catastrophic mistake. Mark Henderson, in his book The Geek Manifesto, argues: \"The result has been to create a powerful constituency that delightedly seizes on any indication, however poorly founded, that the science of climate change might be less robust. If the problem can be discredited, then so can the solutions.\" The irony is that the radical green camp and the libertarian camp are not so far apart. Environmentalist Mark Lynas (quoted in the Geek Manifesto), argues: \"The rightwing climate contrarians and the greens actually agree that climate change means we have to dismantle industrial civilisation. The greens want this, the right wing doesn't. It leads them both to manipulate the science.\" The truth is that we don't need to return to the Stone Age, but all this has made it much harder to have a sensible discussion about policies to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change. We need a vigorous – and yes political - argument about nuclear power; carbon capture and storage; climate diplomacy; windfarms, air travel and much more. Not to mention how much it will all cost. But that has been twisted by those who prefer to park their tanks on the lawn of climate science. The reality is that atmospheric physics does not care which party you vote for. So politicians of all stripes need to come up with a coherent response to the profound societal questions raised by climate change. Hiding behind bogus uncertainty about the science as an excuse for inaction is not an option. So I repeat the plea I made to the select committee for centre right politicians, thinkers and cultural figures to reclaim the climate change issue and talk about it in language their supporters will understand and warm to. With admirable exceptions (here's one interesting recent initiative) there is a big void here to fill. Only then can some of the political poison be drawn from the debate and the watermelon jibe finally be laid to rest. That would be good for both left and right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/20/observer-editorial-nuclear-power-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-20T00:04:31Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: Fukushima must not skew the energy debate | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/20/observer-editorial-nuclear-power-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/20/observer-editorial-nuclear-power-japan","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: Fukushima must not skew the energy debate","bodyText":"The Fukushima nuclear power plant was designed, as are most buildings in Japan, to withstand a huge earthquake. In a sense, it did. The tectonic shock that struck the country last week was much more powerful than any in recent memory and yet the tremor itself did not cause an atomic calamity. It was the following tsunami that overwhelmed power supplies at Fukushima, resulting in overheating, fire and panic at the prospect of radiation leaking into the atmosphere. Which particular facet of a natural disaster broke Fukushima hardly matters to those engineers bravely struggling to bring the reactor under control. Nor does quibbling over causes comfort those people who have had to flee their homes. What good is a nuclear power plant on a coastal fault line that survives earthquakes but not tsunamis? The point is worth making, however, to underline quite how unusual the seismic event that devastated Japan was and so to put in some perspective the problems at Fukushima. That perspective is vital because the plant's problems are already having an impact on debate over the long-term viability of civil nuclear energy. It is 25 years since a fire at Chernobyl sent a plume of radioactive smoke into the skies over Europe. It took many years, a concerted public relations effort by the nuclear industry and advances in safety technology for public opposition to atomic reactors to soften. A key factor has been the alternative threat posed by climate change, a risk accelerated by carbon emissions from power plants run on fossil fuels. Some environmentalists have reluctantly accepted nuclear as an imperfect way to generate high volumes of low-carbon energy. For others, it creates more ecological problems than it solves. This is not a theoretical dilemma. Britain is commissioning eight new nuclear plants. As energy secretary Chris Huhne acknowledges in today's Observer, events in Japan could make it harder to find investment for those projects. But around 13% of the world's electricity is produced by nuclear plants. It is unrealistic to expect that capacity to be dismantled or quickly replaced. The threat to human safety, while real, is not unfathomably vast, nor beyond management. Radiation is harmful, but not apocalyptically deadly. It was the Earth's crust, not a manmade power station that caused tragedy in Japan. For Britain, events at Fukushima are a timely reminder of the need for vigilance over safety, but not a definitive argument for abandoning atomic reactors altogether. Nuclear power will doubtless remain part of a diverse portfolio of energy sources, but the solution to the problem of low-carbon power must ultimately lie in renewables. In the UK, that points to tidal and wave power, to which we are geographically well-suited, alongside carbon capture and storage technology. Britain is currently a leading centre for the innovation of these processes. Their successful development could create huge economic advantages in manufacturing and exports of the technology, alongside the strategic benefits of energy self-sufficiency. We cannot uninvent civil nuclear power. The great danger is not the technology but the possibility that we come to depend on it as much as we now depend on fossil fuels. The environment and our security would not be helped by substituting one toxic addiction for another."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/13/climate-change-survivors-guide-global","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-13T17:15:00Z","webTitle":"Climate change: a survivors' guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/13/climate-change-survivors-guide-global","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/13/climate-change-survivors-guide-global","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: a survivors' guide","bodyText":"1 Stay cool, dry Britain is expected to get more extremes of heat and rainfall, so prepare for more severe floods, longer droughts and more powerful storms. No one knows quite what the effect over time will be of a slowing Gulf stream, or the melting of arctic sea ice, but climate scientists confidently expect temperatures to rise up to 4C by 2100. That could mean big shifts in rainfall patterns and a more unpredictable climate. So clear your drains, fix your roof and move to Wales – or at least to somewhere with good water supply. The worst that could happen? Your grandchildren will inherit inexorably rising temperatures that render much of the Earth uninhabitable. Their problem? Yes, but yours, too. 2 Move Sea levels are rising gradually and by the end of the century could be nearly 2ft higher than they are today. So don't pass on that beach hut to your children, and expect to lose acres if you live near the coast in East Anglia and other low lying areas. You won't have to head for the hills for many years, but prepare to view the seaside from behind higher walls and from the dykes that will be needed to protect many coastal towns. By 2100 the map of Britain will be smaller and many cities are likely to be besieged by climate \"refugees\" arriving from low-lying areas such as Norfolk. 3 Adapt Climate change is going to be very, very expensive, and the poor, the old and the vulnerable will be the most affected because they are least likely to have the money to move house or adapt. Economists such as Lord Stern and Jim Yong Kim, the new president of the World Bank, expect a 4C temperature rise to result in global economic meltdown – unless countries rapidly shift their economies towards less energy-intensive industries. Stern predicts that warming will knock at least 5% off GDP per year and Kim expects food shortages and conflicts over natural resources and water. Abnormal events such as Hurricane Sandy, which cost $65bn (£40bn) and the 2011-12 US drought, which cost $35bn (£21bn) may be just foretasters of the price to be paid. On the other hand, there's serious money to be made adapting cities and industries to climate change and reducing emissions. 4 Grow your own More heat and a longer growing season should make it easier to grow some crops in northern countries such as Britain, Russia and Canada, and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere theoretically should increase plant growth. But don't expect climate change to feed the world. You are likely to have to change diets because bigger droughts, flash floods, heatwaves and storms may devastate harvests and reduce the amount of foods available. Countries such as Britain, which depend heavily on food grown abroad, may be able to grow fruit that farmers only ever dreamed about, but there will be less land on which to grow and imported grub will be much more expensive because other climate-affected countries will keep their smaller harvests for themselves. If coral reefs vanish there will be fewer fish in the sea and if the oceans continue to soak up CO2 they will become more acidic. That would be very, very bad, but the scientists say this won't impact heavily in the next few lifetimes. 5 Take a shower Don't take fresh water for granted. Longer droughts are likely to dry up large parts of southern and eastern England, and underground water suplies will be more stressed. We've always muddled through heatwaves and droughts, but as temperatures climb, a run of dry winters becomes more and more likely. So prepare for droughts not just once a decade but perhaps every other year. Get used to yellow lawns, taking showers with chums and watering your garden with waste water. 6 Be charitable Humanitarian groups such as Oxfam expect many more food shortages and natural disasters in countries where even a small shift in the rainfall pattern or increase in temperature is enough to reduce harvests and leave millions more hungry. Worst-case scenarios? A shift in the Asian monsoons is expected to reduce the amount of water in rivers coming off the Himalayas, and because this is needed for nearly a third of the world's population, there could be disastrous food shortages. Further drying out of the Sahel and African rangelands will force millions of people to move. 7 Get a spanner Things are going to go wrong much more often, so expect mini-disasters. Cars, trains, roads, and buildings, flood barriers, drains, underground systems, reservoirs, power stations, ports and all are designed for existing temperatures, sea levels and rainfall, and may be overwhelmed in future. Railway lines will buckle more easily, nuclear power stations will get flooded more easily, building cooling systems will be inadequate, flat roofs will leak more and concrete structures will be like ovens. Designers will have to rethink the way things are made. 8 Watch your health Warmer winters mean fewer deaths among the old, but far more heart and respiratory diseases in the hot summer nights. Even worse, the warmer, wetter conditions will encourage the fungal, algal, tick-and-mosquito-borne diseases we usually only see in the tropics: Dengue fever was detected in France and Croatia in 2010; West Nile virus and Rift valley fever have become common in the US; and a 4C increase in Britain probably means malaria-carrying mosquitoes, and ticks infected with Lyme disease. Equally possibly, the already crumbling system of urban drains is likely to be overwhelmed by extreme weather events, which will discharge pathogens into heavily used rivers and seas, possibly heralding the return of diseases such as typhus. 9 Don't get angry Life in many of the world's cities is already nearly unbearable in some months. The scorching urban nights expected with climate change will be a recipe for social disorder, ill–health and mass grumpiness. If there are water and power cuts, as expected, then get ready for migrations out of urban areas to cooler countryside. Best advice? Stay out of town. 10 Prepare for the big burn A 4C temperature rise doesn't sound much, but it is quite enough to kill off trees, wildlife, garden plants, insects, and river life. On the positive side, we may get faster-growing rainforests and enhanced plant growth, but many animals will not be able to adapt to higher temperatures. Don't expect to grow the same plants in your garden, or see the same trees in the parks. Change will be gradual, but profound."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/26/peter-mandelson-new-labour-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-26T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"Letters: Peter Mandelson and New Labour's bankrupt policies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/26/peter-mandelson-new-labour-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/26/peter-mandelson-new-labour-policies","fields":{"headline":"Peter Mandelson and New Labour's bankrupt policies","bodyText":"Lord Mandelson is wrong in his criticism of Ed Miliband's energy plan (Report, 26 September), yet was also wrong when he was business secretary. In 2009 his lordship recognised after meeting French business leaders that France was better at setting strategic goals, citing examples such as nuclear energy, high-speed rail and aerospace, then claiming that: \"We have something to learn from continental practice [but] we are not talking about public ownership.\" Yet public ownership was central to the success of France in these sectors. It was crucial to its state-owned Électricité de France achieving the target of gaining four fifths of national energy through nuclear power, without a Three Mile Island meltdown. It was through the state-owned SNCF that it gained its TGV national rail system, now in its second generation. Without long-term public finance in sustaining Concorde, despite it never covering its development costs, France would not have retained the advanced engineering capacity in aircraft that made Airbus possible. Also, while praising French industrial strategy in 2009, Mandelson was proposing to privatise the Post Office, apparently oblivious that France's publicly owned Caisse des Depôts et Consignations is investment manager for both savings banks (Caisses d'épargne) and the French Post Office. It is through these public institutions that France for decades has assured a long-term supply of savings for productive investments in both its public and private sectors. Further, while denigrating allegedly Old Labour, and the risk of returning to it, Labour's industrial strategy of the 1970s was modelled on French planning agreements which made the long-term investments by Électricité de France, SNCF and Concorde-Airbus possible. This was both better informed and more up to date then than his lordship is now. Stuart Holland Faculty of Economics, University of Coimbra, Portugal • The idea that this is a backward step in Labour's industrial policy reveals only the extent to which Mandelson, the architect of Blairism, continues to cling on to the bankrupt policy of cosying up to big business which precipitated the banking crisis with disastrous effect. Let us not forget that Mandelson, while a minister, was obliged to resign under a cloud, not once but twice. Remember too that he publicly declared himself relaxed about people \"getting filthy rich\" under New Labour and has counted among his contacts Russian oligarchs and owners of luxury yachts who have entertained him alongside, not so ironically, George Osborne. That Ed Miliband has the courage to stand up to the energy companies that have blatantly ratcheted up prices by eye-watering margins under the current administration is admirable. It is to be hoped that as a result of this policy, come 2015, a UK government will no longer turn a blind eye to the obscenity of the preventable deaths each year of those who cannot afford to pay for the unreasonable profits of energy company executives and their shareholders. Barbara Cairns Leicester • Lord Mandelson presumably still supports the principle of a minimum wage. In a monopsonistic labour market, paradoxically the demand for labour goes up when employers are forced to pay a minimum wage, assuming that the level is set correctly. That is the way of profit maximisation under the minimum wage constraint. In a market where employers have to compete with each other for labour, this paradox may not obtain, and the argument for a minimum wage is one of fairness. If Mandelson accepts these arguments, he cannot criticise the mirror image argument for a price ceiling in a monopolistic energy industry. Such a ceiling may, paradoxically, even lead to higher production of energy by the logic of profit maximisation in that industry. SP Chakravarty Bangor • What a pity that Peter Mandelson can't use his analytical abilities to help Labour craft a more responsible form of capitalism in the way that Lord Sainsbury has attempted, rather than simply seeking to defend his own \"legacy\" as business secretary. His accusation that Ed Miliband's planned energy price freeze is taking Labour policy backwards smacks of someone who just doesn't \"get it\" – that voters feel that unfettered markets do little to protect the consumer from being ripped off. The challenge for Labour is to devise mechanisms to ensure that the markets for energy, water and rail deliver the investment that any decent long-term strategy shows we need, while protecting the consumer from companies such as Centrica, which plead poverty one day and then find plenty of cash to reward shareholders the next. Perhaps Lord Mandelson could apply his skills to this challenge, rather than uncritically supporting the current energy market framework. John Rigby Exeter • Critics accuse Ed Miliband of a lurch to the left and say his energy price freeze is unworkable. Up pops Mandelson to agree that the proposals are a step backwards and won't work. Instantly, fears and doubts are swept away. It's a brilliant stroke by Mandelson to ensure that the public supports Labour's energy policy. Martin Freedman London • Curious to know how Mandelson, Milburn and assorted other New Labour types think their incessant chorus of public criticism of their leader helps the party? Why should people join and work locally for the party if national figures constantly weigh in with comments that undermine progress at this critical time? What's wrong with a discreet call, an email or a face-to-face meeting if they want to log concerns with the leadership? And don't tell me Labour is \"a broad church\". This is tribal, egocentric nonsense. Richard Clifford Huddersfield • Perhaps Mandelson's cry of anguish expresses his fear that if Miliband is right on this then New Labour's backside-licking of big corporations might eventually come to be viewed as most people now view its insistence that Britain be involved in Iraq – a moral outrage and a gross disservice to the British people that New Labour were elected to serve. Peter Freeman Chislehurst, Kent • The acutely perceptive Baron Mandelson has noticed that the Labour leader's speech was driven by politics. Surprise, surprise! Whatever next?

Er, no, chancellor, that's not how your hosts during your five-day bridge-repairing visit to the People's Republic will be thinking about it at all. Leaving aside the demotic and faintly patronising tone of Osborne's on-air interviews, the awkward fact is that Qin (pronounced Chin) Shi Huangdi, who united the six previously \"warring states\" to become first emperor of China – an imperial structure which survived until 1912 – ruled from 221 to 207BC. At that time Celtic Britain was still a foggy offshore island which left cultural fragile artefacts of great beauty, but no record of its civilisation. We need not hang our heads too low, though a spot of serious humility would not go amiss. The Chinese elite remain intrigued by what the foggy little island (copyright Vladimir Putin?) went on to achieve in its heyday. And China's own future is uncertain, according to many experts – the question is hotly disputed – on economic, environmental and political grounds. As a well-read friend of mine put it over supper only last night: \"Rich Chinese don't seem to think much of China's future. They're all trying to emigrate.\" But whether triumph or disaster looms for 21st-century China – global primacy and political pluralism or smog, polluted water and political disorder – it may be bad for the rest of us. \"When China catches a cold we all get pneumonia,\" as someone has yet to say. In its scale and durability only Rome can match China among western empires – though plenty rose and fell, not least Persia, another truly ancient empire whose residual pride we and the Americans constantly fail to appreciate in proper historical context. Pre-imperial Rome was still fighting the Carthaginian general Hannibal (247-182BC) for dominance of the western Mediterranean when Shi Huangdi united China. The Chinese are still united by Mandarin, as we no longer are by Latin. So Osborne is on the right track but still with a long way to go. Thirty years ago, when Deng Xiaoping was opening up China – to make it the superpower it is close to becoming once more – Margaret Thatcher patronised the Chinese on a trip to Beijing, not far from parks where European \"no dogs or Chinese\" signs from the \"century of humiliation\" still rankle in official memory. As every schoolboy doesn't know, there's lot more like that (the British-enforced opium trade into China created to correct a previously one-sided trade balance for one thing) which makes China's irritation at something like David Cameron's meeting with the Dalai Lama or routine Foreign Office lectures on human rights understandable, albeit wrong. The real worry is that too many Brits are still behaving towards China as the imperial court did towards the sweaty pink-faced European merchants who turned up in ever-increasing numbers from the 16th century: what need do we have of these people? They may have invented gunpowder, paper and so much more when we were barely literate, but in the 19th century the Chinese elite learned the hard way. As British manufacturing struggles to survive at the high end and middle-class futures look as shaky as the working-class present is uncertain, is it our turn to learn hard lessons? It's not just the handbag trade, alarming though it is to grasp that tabloid immigration panics – not entirely wrong, but shooting at the wrong targets – have so restricted UK visa access for Chinese business folk and tourists that Paris is cleaning up on luxury goods at London's expense. A super-priority fast-track visa is one gift the chancellor has taken to his hosts this week. Chinese tourists are now global No 1; they spent $102bn worldwide in 2012 and the UK did not get enough of it. Handbags are pretty trivial compared with the prospect that the China General Nuclear Power Group may take a 49% stake in the latest nuclear plant finally being authorised for Hinkley Point in Somerset. The implications of that are pretty startling in terms of technology, investment flows and the capacity to keep British lights on. There are plenty such stories now. We cannot fund our own infrastructure investments from our own resources – since too much of what we earn collectively is being spent on private consumption or public services – so we must find the money, if we can, from foreigners, even the once-derided Chinese. Given the way the US economy and public finances have been managed in recent decades – kept afloat by cheap Asian goods and borrowed Asian savings – the greater shame is Washington's, whose similar dependance is both tragic and a scandal. The interesting fact is that, unlike the Russians who have never lost a sense of inferiority and whose state is less ancient than even ours, the Chinese never lost their sense that the Middle Kingdom of China is still the centre of our world, despite the ceding of global dominance to those pushy and aggressive Europeans after about 1500. For us the good news is that – though the French and Germans are much better dug in – British exports have been rising sharply in China and a succession of ministers and business bigwigs, like those travelling with Osborne, regularly fly to Beijing (whenever they can get a flight from crowded Heathrow). Boris Johnson, himself a popular British export, is there to outshine his Tory rival this week, as tireless blogger Andy Sparrow explains here. What we don't want to see is the kind of caper Damian McBride reports in Power Trip, his eye-popping memoirs (Biteback, £20), of spinning for Gordon Brown. In 2006 the new shadow chancellor, one George Osborne, went to Japan where he told the travelling press that he wanted Britain to build a new high-speed magnetic levitating train. It should have been a good scoop for the FT. But McBride, who sometimes took time off from attacking the Blairites to undermine the Tories, got to hear about it. A genius at online research, he rapidly dug up enough stories of mag-lev accidents, fires and underperformance to kill the story. All in a day's work for Damian, but a touch short-sighted in the longer view. The Japanese won't have liked it, nor will the Chinese if something like that happens this week. Open and accountable politics and a combative media are a good thing. The Chinese corruption cases show Beijing is \"having a conversation with itself\" about governance, the chancellor optimistically opined on Monday. But cheap headline-grabbing for party advantage and no regard to the long-term interests of Britain is another thing the ancient civilisation of the east does not need to learn from us. Down with British short-termism! Fortunately the Chinese have a long-established habit of taking the long view."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/nov/18/cut-health-and-education-john-parker","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-18T14:58:31Z","webTitle":"Protect industrial base from spending cuts, says Sir John Parker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/18/cut-health-and-education-john-parker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/nov/18/cut-health-and-education-john-parker","fields":{"headline":"Protect industrial base from spending cuts, says Sir John Parker","bodyText":"The foundations of Britain's industrial base, including transport links and research funding, must be protected from severe spending cuts if there is a new wave of public sector austerity after the next election, according to one of the UK's leading industrialists. Amid warnings that the chancellor, George Osborne, may have to prolong austerity measures until 2018, Sir John Parker said investments in infrastructure and innovation – such as nuclear power stations and the technology strategy board – should not lose out to health or education. Before this week's CBI conference, Parker, chairman of mining group Anglo American and former chief executive of shipbuilder Harland and Wolff, said there must be enough government funds left for areas that produce a \"long-term return\", such as scientific research. \"Cash used to support education and health needs to be distinguished from cash that is utilised to build long-term infrastructure, be it nuclear power stations, better transportation links or research and innovation funding, that is ensuring the future of our industrial base,\" he said. \"I worry that if you secure education and health and don't make cuts you are left with a small pool [of money] to do the things that BIS [the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills] has to do. It is important that in any future cuts science and innovation funding, which is the corn of future industrial success, is not eroded.\"Referring to David Cameron's Mansion House speech this month, in which the prime minister backed a \"modern industrial strategy\" that promotes Britain's strongest manufacturing sectors, Parker said a coherent approach was emerging. \"It was the first time that I have heard a prime minister talking about modern industrial strategy. That is encouraging. One of the things that we need is a very clear signal from the top of government that we mean business and there has got to be coherent policy in support of industrial activity and industrial growth. We are beginning to get there.\" In an interview at the Royal Academy of Engineering, where he is president, Parker said the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats must co-operate on a long-term commitment to Britain's industrial base, which accounts for 10% of GDP. \"The next stage of the industrial strategy is … to have buy-in across political parties to the fact that such a strategy needs to straddle administration change,\" Parker said. \"We need long-term vision. Anything up to 20 years is critical. It would be great to see all of the leaders come out in support of a modern industrial strategy that straddles governments and that we don't have chopping and changing. One of the things is not so much where the goalposts are placed but that they should remain in position in the longer term.\" Parker welcomed the \"energy and drive\" of Lord Heseltine's report into the government's growth policy last month, which warned of an incoherent state-led industrial strategy. Parker added that all government procurement contracts, from train-building to school construction, should include a levy that will go to a central innovation fund and pay for research in industrial and manufacturing sectors. The Royal Academy of Engineering, which exists to \"advance and promote excellence in engineering\", has created an enterprise hub that makes its members available to give advice on turning research into industrial products. Referring to Heseltine's report, Parker said it would add to the imperative for a consistent industrial strategy, in line with continental rivals such as France and Germany. \"We may think that German industrial policy is some sort of paragon, but one thing that they can rely on is consistency.\" Parker added that the consequences of inconsistency can be seen in Britain's energy policy, where the construction of nuclear and gas power stations is on hold pending an agreement about the level of government support for the projects. The delay has made Britain's energy strategy vulnerable, he added, creating concerns about the security of energy supply to manufacturers.\"It is the consistency from one administration to the other,\" he said. \"Energy policy, for example, is one that we have not yet nailed down and by now we should have nailed down. By now we should be building nuclear power stations and other critical infrastructure associated with that. But we have delayed. At the end of the last administration and at the beginning of this one we have not yet found our way ahead.\" • The headline to this article was amended on Sunday 18 November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/29/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2011","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-29T10:34:01Z","webTitle":"UK greenhouse gas emissions down 7% in 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2011","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/29/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2011","fields":{"headline":"UK greenhouse gas emissions down 7% in 2011","bodyText":"Last year's mild winter helped UK greenhouse gas emissions fall 7% in 2011, as people used less gas to heat their homes, provisional figures published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change reveal. The fall follows a 3% rise in 2010, the first in almost a decade, which green groups called a \"wake-up call\" that showed government policies weren't cutting emissions fast enough to tackle climate change. The fall in 2011 was in part due to it being the fifth warmest year on UK temperature records, leading to the residential sector showing the largest fall in emissions, of 22% on 2010 levels. The Met Office confirmed the winter of 2011 was \"significantly milder than the last three\", and across the year maximum temperatures were 1C above normal in much of the UK, and as much as 1.5C in parts of England. Nuclear power came back online at the country's biggest reactor, Sizewell B, which also helped to cut emissions. Maintenance work had shut down the plant in Suffolk for six months in 2010. There was an 11% increase in the use of nuclear power in 2011. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said the fall – which covered the first full year of emissions records with the coalition in power – showed government policies were working: \"This is more evidence of how the UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change. Carbon emissions are down, homes are more energy-efficient and low-carbon power is up. Thanks to the green deal and the government's reforms to the electricity market I hope to see this trend continue and gather pace.\" Emissions were down in other sectors too, with those from energy supply down 6.1%, business 8% and transport just 1.4% compared with 2010 levels. David Symons, director at global environmental consultancy WSP Environment &amp; Energy, said: \"These figures are to be welcomed, but it's important to understand the underlying reasons for the downward trend. The government can take credit for some of the emissions reductions – particularly through the 35% increase in renewable electricity generation over 2010 – but not all. In reality, other factors out of government control – such as the warmer weather and global energy prices could well have had a greater impact over the past year.\" He added that higher gas bills, as well as the milder weather, also played a role: \"The largest emissions reduction comes from home gas heating. The government attributes this to winter 2011 being significantly warmer than 2010, but we believe that the 20% increase in domestic gas prices over the same period is also significant. Hard pressed households will have been putting on an extra jumper rather than the heating.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/11/hs2-domestic-afghan-war","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-11T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"HS2 isn't the next Olympics.

It's a domestic Afghan war","bodyText":"The plan for a new high-speed train has become the Afghan war of British domestic policy. There is no more debate about whether it makes sense. The only question is how long can its apologists hold out, as costs soar and supporters slip away in the night. Has Patrick McLoughlin, the brave, embattled transport secretary, the guts to tell his bosses in Downing Street that the line cannot be held and retreat is in order? The latest body blow to the benighted project came on Monday from parliament's \"unofficial opposition\", Margaret Hodge's ever trenchant public accounts committee. It dismissed HS2 as based on \"fragile numbers, out-of-date data and assumptions that do not reflect reality\". This follows a scathing report from the National Audit Office. Even the official cost has risen to £50bn, with the Institute of Economic Affairs putting it at £80bn. To Hodge's committee, that there are better uses for such lavish transport spending is beyond argument. Ministers are trapped. They are surrounded by a praetorian guard of public relations and project consultants hired with £253m of taxpayers' money. This political-industrial complex is the sort that develops behind every \"grand project\"; firms know they will lose a fortune if the project is cancelled. Meanwhile David Cameron and George Osborne, scarred by U-turns everywhere, are determined to portray HS2 as the next Olympics. They cannot bear to climb down from something so spectacular, so glorious and so \"tomorrow\". Like aircraft carriers and nuclear power stations, high-speed trains are toys for Tory boys, no questions asked. In a desperate attempt to regain enemy ground, McLoughlin staged a weekend breakout. He said that high-speed rail was not, after all, about high speed but \"capacity\". His train from Derby was \"bloody crackers\". It irked him that no new railway to the north has been built \"for 120 years\", which seemed reason enough to blow £50bn. Meanwhile Cameron, never knowingly out-cliched, said HS2 was \"vital to Britain if we are going to succeed in the global race\". Osborne declared himself \"passionate\" about it. In infrastructure, as in war, when politicians take refuge in the flag and national prestige it is a safe bet they know they have lost. HS2 is crazy. The biggest infrastructure project in British history is for \"club class\" passengers on just one line, requiring a donation of £1,700 from every taxpayer, excluding revenue subsidy (£3,000 if the IEA is right). This in turn has been calculated at a third of a million pounds for each potential traveller diverted from the present line. High-speed rail is no longer tomorrow's transport but yesterday's. Its development has ground to a halt even in long-distance France and Spain as using too much energy and too much subsidy. It has all but vanished from consideration in America. The benefit is to a small number of premium fare travellers, minimising the relief of capacity on existing services. HS1 from the Channel Tunnel to London may delight those few who use it, but the National Audit Office points out its passenger forecasts were \"hopelessly overoptimistic\". McLoughlin may direct attention to capacity, but that is not how this line was planned or justified. If capacity is the issue, everyone knows that intercity first class is not under pressure. Commuter lines in London, the north and the west desperately need £50bn, not to mention the road network, used by far more businesses than rail. Lines into Euston are not London's most crowded, compared with Waterloo and Paddington – the latter host to the two most overcrowded services, from Henley and Didcot. The rise in intercity passenger numbers is slackening off. As for pretending that HS2 will help \"compete\" with China and Japan, their trains are far more crowded than ours. Expanding rail capacity is costly and complex, but not as much as driving a brand new pathway to Euston. Here it will not even link with Heathrow, Crossrail or the continent via St Pancras. It will not even go to Birmingham New Street. It will blitz much of London's south Camden because decades ago a rail planner thought businessmen deserved a more comfortable trip to Euston, and no one had the gumption to think otherwise. The project is completely out of date. There are not just better ways of spending money on trains, every other way makes more sense. A book out this week is the closest politics gets to pornography. It is called The Blunders of Our Governments, by those veteran voyeurs of politicians at play, Anthony King and Ivor Crewe. It analyses decisions – such as on poll tax, child support, ID cards and individual learning accounts – that were taken for the best of reasons, only to be blighted by the failure of those in power to show the guts to call a halt when they could see things had gone wrong. Pride, ambition, a desperation to succeed and a terror of the press drive those charged with spending public money ever deeper into the mire. None of their officials dares tell truth to power. Lobbyists, especially computer salesmen, clamour for more. Only money talks, and the talk is from those getting the money, not those supplying it. As in war, true courage lies not in splurging ever more blood and treasure to mask yet another mistake. It lies in stopping, thinking and, just sometimes, admitting a policy was wrong. The curse of British politics is not a U-turn. It is treating a U-turn as a weakness rather than a strength."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2013/aug/20/ethical-investment-completely-right","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-20T06:01:02Z","webTitle":"Ethical investment: can you ever get it completely right?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2013/aug/20/ethical-investment-completely-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2013/aug/20/ethical-investment-completely-right","fields":{"headline":"Ethical investment: can you ever get it completely right?","bodyText":"Ethical investment, normally a topic consigned to the specialist press, had a rare moment in the national spotlight last month after it emerged that the Church of England held an indirect stake in one of Wonga's principal financial backers. This came a day after the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, had spoken out against payday lenders and told of his intention to \"compete [Wonga] out of existence\". The specific circumstances were no doubt less than ideal, and certainly not expected or desired by the CoE. The surge in media interest even less so. On many levels, this appeared to be the disaster story waiting to happen – the media reporting a contradiction between a charity's mission or public statements and its investment activity – and one that could open the floodgates for many more such headlines. Although the investment was a mere £75k from a £5.5bn fund, hardly significant when viewed in context, and tiny within the CoE's own ethical investment portfolio, it still mattered in the public eye. On the surface, investments such as this one simply don't look good. More fundamentally, they directly contribute to the harm the charity is ultimately working to deter. The golden rule for the sector when investing ethically, or indeed at all, appears clear; actively avoid companies that contravene your mission. It sounds obvious and no doubt many assume it's what charities already do, but if the CoE, a well-regarded ethical investor, can slip up and hit the headlines in the process, could anyone? And why is it so hard to get it right? On a fundamental level, it's not always clear what \"ethical\" means in the context of a particular charity. Often, it will be obvious, but other times less so, particularly when considering issues that go beyond the charity's direct aims, to activities that could be classified as generally harmful to society. Take a charity set up to improve children's wellbeing in the UK; the arguments in favour of avoiding tobacco are fairly straightforward and well-rehearsed. Sufficient evidence exists to demonstrate that smoking can damage children's health. But are the arguments about avoiding investments in animal testing and nuclear power as clear cut? Dig deep enough in almost any organisation, and you will probably find activity that some people consider unacceptable, for example excessive bonuses and salaries, tax avoidance, excessively low wages, pollution, breaches of privacy. Where do you draw the line and what if some of your supporters hold a different view? How does a charity decide on what's right for its ethical policy? Defining what's \"ethical\" often boils down to individual values, and correlating these views is no mean feat in any trustee board. This is further complicated when you consider the financial return the charity needs. For a large grant-making foundation, the return will fund much of its work, and for a service delivery charity, the vital services it provides. But taking the definition of ethical investment to the nth degree would mean many of the blue chip, or investible, companies that generate a reliable return would be struck off instantly. With more limited investment opportunities, the risk can be increased, there is less chance to diversify and the return the charity is relying on may not be realised. While pooled funds may seem a way around this, again there may be hidden snags. The lesson from the CoE experience is to look carefully under the lid, but therein lies another challenge. Does a charity really have time to monitor every single underlying investment, and the business models and future plans of those organisations. So while off-the-shelf solutions may appeal, they require time to get absolutely right; a resource in limited supply in many charities. None of this is to dismiss efforts at ethical investment, provide a reason for apathy, or attempt to put charities off. On the contrary, charities may not always get it right, but in a sector that is rightly proud of its moral leadership and campaigning, we should all at the very least strive to put our money where our mouth is and aim to deliver as much social and public benefit as is reasonably possible with all our resources. The harsh realities of the markets mean there are limitations, and there is a risk that the occasional hypocrisy will be found – but that isn't a reason not to aim to do it right and do it well. It's not always a case of avoid questionable investments at all costs either – shareholder activism, basically using your voting power to bring about change, is on the rise and in the future, as social investment markets develop, we may see more funds that actively invest in social enterprises and similar, making investments options easier for charities. Our resources are another tool in our armoury for creating the type of society we want to see, and I can only hope that the CoE case has given charities more cause to consider forms of ethical and social investment, not less.

The parallel with the Royal Mail is not exact, of course. The state is retaining a 30% stake for the time being, and it would not be sensible for a government to try to scrape every last penny from a privatisation when retail punters have been invited to the show. That is especially so when those private investors, under London's antiquated flotation system, have to dispatch their orders before the share price has been set. But neither is the parallel with the house sale entirely off-beam. One of government's main duties in privatising Royal Mail – in fact, the overwhelming duty – was to ensure the public purse received a good price. When the first-day trading premium is 35%, non-shareholders – aka most of the public – have a right to know why the shares were not priced more keenly than 330p. This was the second highest-ever first-day premium on a privatisation offer, despite official assurances that the lessons of the 1980s had been learned. Cable is right to plead that judgments must be reserved until the share price has settled. The first-day pop is indeed irrelevant. It's the price after a few weeks that matters, and let's not forget that a strike looms at Royal Mail. But if, after Cable's \"spivs and speculators\" have departed, the shares are still above 400p the government and its advisers must explain their thinking in detail. A \"lost\" 50p of value equates to £300m (the government is selling 600m shares, or a 60% stake). That's hardly peanuts, even if, as said here last week, it buys only two miles of HS2 railway. A key issue will be the advice given by Lazards, the government's City firm on the job. Forget the entertaining sub-plot of whether Labour's Chuka Umunna over-excited retail investors by talking about an undervaluation. The price was set by demand from City institutions. Did Lazards, presented with 800 would-be institutional buyers, establish if the order-book could have been filled at more than 330p? If not, why not? If so, what conclusion did it reach and how? And what advice did it give ministers? To repeat, Cable and Lazards will be vindicated if the \"froth\" evaporates to reveal a share price closer to 330p. That may happen once investors avert their gaze from Royal Mail's juicy dividend and debate its operational challenges. But if 400p-plus is sustained, this is not an idle matter of being wise after the event. The government has a privatisation programme in place and we need to know that ministers can sell assets at decent prices. Don't cry for the big six No tears should be shed for the big six energy firms, now getting a walloping from every politician in town, not just Ed Miliband. They've led a sheltered life, their directors pay themselves small fortunes and they were allowed to get away with their disgracefully complex price tariffs for far too long. Yet it's depressing that the politicians, as they quarrelled over energy bills this week after SSE's 8.2% price hike, still pretend that they possess a magic cure-all. For Labour, Miliband courts popularity with a price freeze but fails to explain how the market can be \"reset\" within 20 months to bring forth investment in new generation capacity from private companies. His idea for a new \"consumer-friendly\" watchdog will raise a cheer but any benefits from splitting generation and supply may turn out to be tiny. Risks, and thus capital costs, for non-integrated companies may simply go up. From the coalition side comes the cry that \"more competition\" in the supply market is required. Well, maybe, but even a battalion of new entrants couldn't change the fact that energy prices are set by international markets and that the huge costs of the UK's transition to low-carbon energy have to be funded somehow. Indeed, any day now the government will sign a 40-year contract with EdF and a Chinese state-owned company to produce nuclear power at Hinkley Point in Somerset at roughly twice the current market rate. There's another big cost for consumers to carry. The long-standing political error may have been to underestimate the challenges. As Liberum Capital's Peter Atherton, who has long warned of a crisis in UK energy policy, warned in April: \"Moving from a largely fossil fuel-based power system to one dominated by renewables and nuclear in just a decade and a half, whilst keeping the lights on and consumer bills affordable, may simply be impossible.\" What's to be done? One step would to admit that the well-intentioned \"foot to the pedal\" approach to subsidising nuclear and wind will not succeed if consumers refuse to pay; in the end, the investments won't be made and the policy mess will become worse. Alternatively, politicians could switch more of the bill to general taxation, which is SSE's big idea to escape the spotlight. Or the UK – controversially – could decide that more gas-powered generation is a useful \"transition\" source of energy while 2030 decarbonisation targets are pursued by driving down the costs of renewables and carbon-capture infrastructure via research. These are all issues being debated in energy circles but they were absent from this week's political punch-ups. Yes, let's see what returns on capital the big six are really making in supply and generation. But the energy debate is also about politicians deciding what infrastructure they think should be funded, at what price, and who should pay. These questions barely get a look-in these days. Nationwide is yet to decide And then there was one. As Barclays finally signed up to the second stage of George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme, Nationwide is left as the only major lender yet to say whether it wishes to dish out state-sponsored 95% mortgages. Maybe it's a case of the bureaucratic wheels turning slowly at Nationwide. But it would be nice to think the building society will come out with a blistering statement explaining why, as a responsible lender, it will have no truck with a scheme that will do no long-term good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/08/invest-greener-recovery","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-07T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"UK is urged to invest £50bn in a greener economic recovery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/08/invest-greener-recovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/08/invest-greener-recovery","fields":{"headline":"UK is urged to invest £50bn in a greener economic recovery","bodyText":"Campaigners have warned that Britain is hurtling towards a new economic crisis, and call for a £50bn \"Green New Deal\" to create more sustainable growth and better-paid jobs and equip the country for a low-carbon future. After two quarters of better-than-expected GDP growth and a batch of positive economic indicators – including rising house prices and upbeat business surveys – the coalition is hoping the summer economic bounce will turn into a longer-term recovery. But five years on from their first demands for a radical reworking of Britain's business model, the Green New Deal group, which includes Green party MP Caroline Lucas, economist Ann Pettifor and tax expert Richard Murphy, says the need for an alternative approach is greater than ever. In a report published on Monday, and seen by the Observer, it argues that recent growth has been based on unsustainable rises in consumer spending and house prices and could end in \"the mother of all credit busts\". \"Recovery is an interesting word to apply to an economy that is marked by rapidly rising personal debt, highly insecure and often low-paid work, and rising underlying carbon emissions. What we're calling a recovery is poor, divided, indebted and polluting,\" said Andrew Simms, chief analyst at thinktank Global Witness and an author of the report. Central banks have poured cheap money into financial markets to drive down interest rates and prevent deflation and depression. But Green New Deal says this is a dangerous gamble: \"Given the choice, they prefer to have the problem of asset prices going through the roof than the problem of deflation. If they are wrong and the bubble bursts before the recovery arrives, it will be the mother of all credit busts,\" it says. Under an alternative plan in the Green New Deal report, the government would invest £50bn into expanding green technologies over five years, building low-cost housing, and employing a \"carbon army\" to insulate hundreds of thousands of homes and reduce energy use. The authors say these measures would create more, and better-paid, jobs than the current debt-fuelled bounce, which Pettifor described as an \"Alice in Wongaland\" recovery. Lucas, who is the MP for Brighton Pavilion, said a grassroots workforce could be trained to lag Britain's chilly lofts \"within weeks\". \"Ministers want to cut a nice big ribbon on a new nuclear power station – but this would be far more effective in getting our emissions down quickly,\" she said. Real incomes have continued to fall over the past year, as above-target inflation has outpaced pay growth, in what the TUC has described as the greatest wage squeeze since the 1870s. Green New Deal argues that if more workers were paid a living wage it would help to create more sustainable consumer demand. Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, which begins its annual congress in Bournemouth on Sunday, supported the Green New Deal initiative, saying: \"The green economy already employs nearly a million people, in areas from electric-car manufacturing to wind-turbine installation. Implementing some of the ideas in this report could help these industries create more of the skilled and well-paid jobs we need if we are to build a sustainable recovery.\" The authors suggest their pro-growth policies could be paid for by scrapping the controversial HS2 rail project; cracking down on tax evasion; and launching a fresh round of quantitative easing. Instead of using electronically created money to buy government bonds from City investors, as the Bank of England has done with almost all of the £375bn-worth of QE it has undertaken since 2009, the proceeds this time would be used to invest in green projects, and pay off private finance initiative debts, freeing up public money to be spent elsewhere. The report argues that investing in affordable housing, in particular, would benefit those on lower incomes more than the better off. \"It can mean that people have more disposable income after housing costs, which in turn boosts spending in the local and national economy,\" the report says. The authors argue that a rapid boost in the supply of housing would also help to \"dampen the housing bubble beginning to appear in response to government measures such as Help to Buy, which facilitates prospective homebuyers to find a deposit\". The controversial Help to Buy scheme was the centrepiece of George Osborne's March budget, and has been questioned by a number of critics, from the former governor of the Bank of England, Lord King, to the International Monetary Fund, amid fears that it could create a new property boom. Mark Carney, the Bank's new governor, has said he is \"very alert personally\" to the risk that a housing boom is emerging – and said he was ready to burst any bubble, by targeting mortgage lending. Reforming the bailed-out banking system is another central proposal of the report, suggesting that Royal Bank of Scotland, which is majority-owned by the taxpayer, could be broken up into a series of regional lenders that would build relationships with local industries. \"All the mechanisms which have been brought into play to encourage lending to the productive part of the economy don't seem to be working,\" says Simms. Labour has promised to introduce a British Investment Bank, to boost lending to businesses; but it has eschewed much of the Green New Deal agenda over the past five years, focusing on an emergency VAT cut as the centrepiece of its policies to create a recovery. Other members of Green New Deal include Charles Secrett, former director of Friends of the Earth; Jeremy Leggett, chairman of green energy firm Solarcentury; and Larry Elliott, economics editor of the Guardian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/09/nuclear-safety-global-energy-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-09T07:15:04Z","webTitle":"Global accord on nuclear safety needed urgently – World Energy Council","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/09/nuclear-safety-global-energy-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/09/nuclear-safety-global-energy-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Global accord on nuclear safety needed urgently – World Energy Council","bodyText":"A new international accord on the management and safety of nuclear power plants should be a priority for governments, an influential global energy organisation has said. A year after Japan's Fukushima reactor was shut down, the World Energy Council – whose members include many of the biggest energy companies from around the world – said an agreement was possible and should be a matter of urgency. \"Global nuclear power is one of the rare issues on which an international accord could be achieved with a reasonable level of efforts— the need to act is urgent, and the time is right,\" its report found. \"Very little has changed in respect of improving global governance of the nuclear sector, highlighting the need for action. There is critical need to inform the public about issues relating to nuclear generation technologies, safety, costs, benefits and risks.\" The WEC also found that nuclear energy continues to be a popular choice when governments around the world are setting their future priorities, despite concerns over the safety of reactors following the Fukushima disaster last March. Although many countries have paused their work on nuclear power developments, and some – including Germany, Italy and Switzerland – have withdrawn altogether, the WEC study concluded that the impetus for nuclear development in key parts of the developing world would continue. Christoph Frei, the secretary general of WEC, said: \"The nuclear renaissance is continuing. But there is a strong need for the public to be informed, and for more discussion around safety procedures. Safety should not be a competitive issue – it should be something where companies collaborate to ensure that everyone is using the best practice.\" The WEC study found that most countries had not materially reduced their plans for new nuclear reactors, and that 60 plants were still under construction. \"Very little has changed, especially in non-OECD [developing] countries, in respect of the future utilisation of nuclear in the energy mix after Fukushima,\" was the report's verdict. However, some nuclear experts disputed the claims, pointing out that proposed new reactors can take many years to come to fruition, and that while countries' plans for new nuclear development may remain in favour of the technology on paper, this was far from a guarantee that the plans would be carried out in reality. Steve Thomas, professor of energy studies at the University of Greenwich, said on Wednesday that while construction began on 38 new reactors between 2008 and 2010, construction only began on two between 2011 and 2012. He said estimates from the nuclear industry more than a decade ago that nuclear power would cost about $1,000/KW of capacity to construct had now been revised upwards to about $6,000. Mycle Schneider, a nuclear energy consultant speaking at a conference held by the Greens/EFA party at the European parliament to discuss the impact of Fukushima on the nuclear industry a year on, said there had been a \"dramatic decline\" since the 1980s in the number of nuclear plants around the world. Keith Baverstock, of the University of Eastern Finland, added that the three major examples of nuclear accidents – Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima – showed that nuclear power was \"very dangerous and very accident-prone\". Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's climate chief, warned that the costs of nuclear power had probably increased after the Fukushima incident. \"I'm sure that nuclear power has not gone down in price, because of the extra security.\" But the WEC said it was essential for a public debate on nuclear to include the question of how safety and governance could be co-ordinated at an international level. Pierre Gadonneix, chairman of the World Energy Council, said: \"It is clear from the report that nuclear energy will play a full part in the future energy mix, especially in developing countries, provided nuclear safety and transparency are continuously being reinforced. I believe there is a real opportunity for our world leaders to promote a consensual solution to this issue and thus demonstrate that real international governance, where emerging economies fully participate, can be successful.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/08/us-nuclear-regulator-safety-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-08T13:30:00Z","webTitle":"US nuclear regulator chided for slow safety reforms after Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/08/us-nuclear-regulator-safety-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/08/us-nuclear-regulator-safety-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"US nuclear regulator chided for slow safety reforms after Fukushima","bodyText":"In the aftermath of the March 11, 2011 tsunami and nuclear meltdown in Japan, the US government advised its citizens living in Pacific island nation to stay at least 50 miles away from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant as a precautionary measure. Yet as we near the first anniversary of the Japan tragedy, the emergency evacuation zone around all nuclear reactors in the US, at least 23 of which are the same kind as the Fukushima reactors, is still limited to a 10-mile radius. This is just one among many safety measures that haven't been adequately, and speedily, addressed when it comes to protecting nuclear plants and US citizens against severe, unexpected accidents, says nuclear industry watchdog, Union for Concerned Scientists (UCS). In a report on Tuesday, UCS called out the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), that oversees the country's commercial nuclear power plants, for failing to implement key recommendations made by NRC's own task force last summer that would bolster plant safety. The report, \"U.S. Nuclear Power Safety One Year After Fukushima,\" also criticizes the nuclear industry of jumping the gun by investing cheap and generic safety equipment before the NRC has even had time to examine if the equipment would actually help protect the public. A major flaw in the NRC's approach, the report says, is that it has relegated to the bottom of the priority list, the task force's \"first and primary recommendation\" — to clarify its \"patchwork\" regulatory framework for dealing with severe, unprecedented events (\"beyond design basis\" event, in tehno-speak) that US reactors aren't built to withstand, such as combined earthquake and tsunami like the one at Fukushima or a terrorist attack. At present, the regulations for what safety measures should be taken, what kind of equipment should be used etc., in the case of such \"beyond design basis\" events are not all clearly specified. Many of these measures are \"voluntary,\" that is plant owners aren't legally bound to implement them. Nor is it required that these extra measures meet any uniform high quality and reliability standards. The NRC task force's first recommendation sought to change that. By not addressing it before doing anything else, the NRC \"has put the cart before the horse\" and \"potentially undermined the effectiveness of the other recommendations, which all hinge on this critical issue,\" says Dave Lochbaum, director of the UCS Nuclear Safety Program. For instance, the NRC task force recommended that NRC should require plant owners to install diesel-fuel pumps and generators to protect against \"station blackouts\", when the plant loses both on-site and off-site backup power during a \"beyond design basis\" event like a terrorist attack by air. But the recommendation doesn't require that this equipment meet high quality and reliability standards, or be hardened to withstand other potential threats, such as say floods or earthquakes. \"It didn't consider the potential for multiple unit accidents at the site and as a result the current US standards aren't good enough to protect against a Fukushima like disaster,\" says Edwin Lyman, another senior UCS scientist who co-wrote the report along with Lochbaum. Most of the safety measures at American plants are based on science and assumptions that are decades old, says Lyman. Regarding the evacuation zone, NRC spokesperson Scott Burnell told the Journal today that the 10-mile evacuation radius (which the NRC did review last year and decided to stick with) is based on sound research. There were provisions to expand the scope of evacuations in the event of a serious accident, especially since research shows that such accidents progress slowly, over several days, he said. Besides, he said, \"the situation in Fukushima could not be duplicated in the US.\" UCS scientists disagree on that last bit. And they counter that the agency has yet explain how it would expand the scope of evacuations during an unprecedented crisis. \"If you are talking about a reactor in a rural, lightly populated area that's one thing,\" says Lochbaum. \"But if you are talking about a reactor in a densely populated area like Indian Point in New York or San Onefrey in LA's Orange County metropolitan area, then it would really strain credulity to think that in the aftermath of the an accident like Fukushima they would be able to effectively evacuate people within a day or two that would be need to actually protect them. Instead of a \"one-size-fits all\" approach, evacuation zones should be evaluated on a site-specific basis because much depends on the particular meteorological conditions of the region, the terrain and other specific features of the plant sites, he says. The NRC too has admitted that it was behind schedule in improving safety at the plants. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal yesterday, NRC chairman Gregory Jaczko said the agency \"risked failing to meet its goal of making all the regulatory changes within five years.\" But spokesperson Burnell defended the delay, writing in an emailed statement that implementing the recommendations \"efficiently and appropriately\" requires time. \"Issuing rushed, incomplete requirements would waste both the NRC's and the industry's resources and complicate the overall goal of enhancing U.S. reactor safety,\" he said. (Tardiness does seem to be a problem with the NRC though. It appears the commission took 10 years to fully implement new security measures in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.) Meanwhile, it seems the nuclear industry itself is practicing no such caution, moving ahead as it is with changes on the ground under a new initiative, also announced yesterday, called the Diverse and Flexible Coping Capability, or FLEX, program. As part of this initiative, plant owners are stocking up on, and installing, additional emergency equipment like generators and pumps, much to UCS' dismay, which believes that in this case \"speed is not a virtue.\" None of these equipment have been vetted by the NRC. Buying the equipment without waiting for NRC guidelines, just makes it difficult for the agency to later implement standards that could force the industry to replace the equipment, says Lyman. \"The rationale for what the industry is doing is pretty clear,\" he says. \"The logic here is if you buy a lot of relatively cheap, commercial grade equipment, you scatter it around and you hope for the best that some of it will still be there [during a major disaster].\" No big surprise there surely. Meanwhile, a new survey conducted for the nonprofit and nonpartisan Civil Society Institute shows that \"Americans continue to want to keep the brakes on more nuclear power in the United States.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/conflicting-reporting-hinder-risk-water-strategies","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-26T14:11:06Z","webTitle":"Conflicting reporting systems may hinder companies' water risk strategies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/conflicting-reporting-hinder-risk-water-strategies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/conflicting-reporting-hinder-risk-water-strategies","fields":{"headline":"Conflicting reporting systems may hinder companies' water risk strategies","bodyText":"Water risks such as floods, scarcity and pollution are increasingly chipping into corporate bottom lines. The financial sector is taking notice – and taking action. Calvert Investments asked HanesBrands to evaluate its losses from cotton-supply shortages due to the 2011 US drought, determining that the company lost $5.2bn. Trillium Asset Management is now asking companies in its portfolio to factor water risk into their financial projections. And Moody's Investor Service released warnings about risk to credit ratings in the mining industry, as companies spend more on infrastructure in response to growing water risks. More and more investors are clamouring for sustainability reports and disclosure initiatives to identify corporate water risks, but the process of actually evaluating water supply risks is challenging. Definitions and interpretations of several key concepts have proven to be difficult to define and track in a consistent way. This hurdle was discussed earlier this month at Stockholm Water Week's UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate meeting – and soon, there may be a solution. Inconsistent terminology, inconsistent results A growing number of corporate assessment tools – such as the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, WWF Water Risk Filter, and WBCSD Global Water Tool – are available to help companies evaluate their water risks. The issue is that all of these tools were created using varying parameters, and their underlying methodologies continue to evolve. These differences have created a wide range of definitions and sometimes competing interpretations of terms such as water stress, scarcity and risk. This is problematic because consistency in reporting methods and terminology are critical if investors are to adequately compare water risks among their portfolio companies. Companies also need to identify their water risks as accurately as possible. Reporting more or less risk than they actually face could be misleading to investors and other stakeholders. It could also lead companies to make poor decisions around where and how to respond to risks. Water risk reporting to avoid power cuts The experiences of Exelon Corp offer a prime example. As the US power generator analysed water risks for its 2012 sustainability report, it saw definition-related challenges firsthand. Evaluating and mitigating water-related risks is a top priority for Exelon. Most of the company's 35,000 MW of electric generating capacity nationwide relies on adequate, affordable and reliable sources of water. The majority of Exelon's fossil fuel and nuclear power plants, which supply electricity to millions of customers annually, need water. And thermal power plants rely on water to dissipate excess heat created during power production. Changes in supply and usage can also affect surrounding communities, businesses and the environment, because each depends on the same watersheds that the power plants do. Exelon recently used the water risk atlas, finding that it faced low to medium water stress in the Mississippi and surrounding watersheds, where approximately 40% of its operations are located. This finding was significantly different than results of a prior assessment. Previously, the company used the UN definition of water stress – an average of 1,700 cubic metres of available water per person. Under this definition, none of the company's facilities faced water stress. Evaluating water risk is the first step in mitigating it. Conflicting definitions, then, can ultimately hinder a company's ability to create a comprehensive strategy for overcoming water risks. Exelon's more detailed understanding of water stress will help the company communicate its risks and mitigation strategies, and better equip it to work with communities, businesses, and other decision-makers to ensure ongoing water availability. Settling the differences Exelon's experience is just one example of the challenges companies face due to inconsistent terminology and risk reporting methodologies. But the good news is that there's an initiative to streamline corporate water risk reporting. The UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate asked a team of experts – including the WRI – to reconcile the differences between various terms and reporting methodologies. While the results of this initiative won't be published until the revised UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate Corporate Water Disclosure Guidelines come out in 2014, the discussions are already yielding practical results. The working group is uncovering some of the important differences among scarcity, stress, and risk as captured in these working definitions: • Water scarcity assesses the health of a river system by evaluating the amount of water available within a given area. Scarcity describes the total supply in an area minus a specific type of demand, called consumptive use (eg water consumed by crops as they grow). • Water stress illustrates where there's competition and potential conflict among all water users, including human and ecological uses. It takes into account total water supply as well as consumptive demand, but also includes all other water demand, or non-consumptive demand (eg power plant water used for cooling that is returned to river where it can be used downstream). • Water risk is a comprehensive term, describing all water-related concerns, such as pollution, social and regulatory issues, that may affect governments, communities, businesses and other water users. The 2014 CEO Water Mandate guidelines will be an important first step in reconciling these differences and advancing corporate water risk reporting for investors and businesses alike. As more and more companies use the same definitions, investors will be able to accurately compare companies in their portfolios, and therefore make better investment decisions. The companies themselves will benefit, too. Environmental managers will be able to make more informed decisions about which stress, scarcity, and risk reporting processes to use. This will allow them to more accurately identify their water-related risks, and put in place strategies to protect their bottom lines. Of course, companies must decide whether they will report with common metrics at all. Several major international corporations faced scrutiny this month for reporting carbon emissions with their own internal metrics, rather than through the standardised CDP carbon emissions report. Companies will face similar questions about water stewardship within five years, and those who join the standardised definition and reporting processes now – through initiatives like the CDP Water programme – will have a valuable headstart.

The cynics claim Teather, who announced her decision in the Observer, has just seen the writing on the wall, jumped rather than face ejection by her inner-city electorate in 2015. Alastair Campbell, the former press secretary to Tony Blair, was typically acerbic. He tweeted: \"#Sarah Teather - a looming lost seat dressed up as look-at-me 'principles.' Her voting record speaks louder than today's self-pitying whinge\". Others say she genuinely found the need to square her personal beliefs and the party's official position more difficult than many hardened politiicans. Menzies Campbell, the former Liberal Democrat leader, made the point on Sunday that you need to be tough in politics. The implication was that kitchens induce heat, and she could not stand it. Teather is a controversial figure in the party due to her decision on a free vote earlier this year not to back gay marriage. Her decision to stand aside will resonate with party activists on the left who are preparing to defend a raft of long-standing policy positions facing a challenge at the party conference next week in Glasgow. Economy, tuition fees, nuclear power, an independent nuclear deterrent, a 50p top rate of tax, the bedroom tax, fracking and immigration are all up for grabs at a conference that could either end up as a slow-motion identity crisis, and a fiesta for split-hungry reporters, or a healing of some deep party wounds. Some on the left deny Teather simply walked before she was pushed, pointing out she had won in two difficult general elections, worked like a Trojan locally, and had helped prevent the party being wiped out at local elections. Gareth Epps from the Social Liberal Forum, a left of centre group within the Lib Dems, sprung to her defence, saying: \"There can be no dispute that the news is a serious blow to the party's leadership which has so few female role models, at a time when it has taken a confrontational stance towards activists, and on the eve of what will be a challenging conference.\" He adds: \"One of the sharpest dividing lines in the coalition is between those who understand and empathise with the pressures faced by those most disadvantaged, and those who do neither; and the depressing conclusion is that on the Liberal Democrat frontbench in particular there are too few of the former and too many of the latter. Sarah is not the only prominent Lib Dem not restanding in 2015 for that reason.\" Others on the left say the reason she feels isolated within the party is because she alienated many by voting against gay marriage due to her religous beliefs. She was for instance, on Sunday, the subject of sustained abuse on one prominent party website, Liberal Democrat Voice, for her illiberalism. Others claim she only found her conscience after she was sacked as schools minister last year. \"She was a careerist without a career,\" said one. It is a charge Teather strongly denies, claiming she generated opposition to plans for a cap on welfare spending from within government. In a statement to her local party setting out why she would not stand again, Teather said: \"I have disagreed with both government and official party lines on a whole range of welfare and immigration policies, and those differences have been getting larger rather than smaller. Disagreements with the party on other areas of policy I have always felt could be managed, but these things are just core to my own sense of calling to politics. \"I have tried hard to balance my own desire to truthfully fight for what I believe on these issues with the very real loyalty and friendship I feel to party colleagues, but that has created intense pressure, and at times left me very tired. I don't think it is sustainable for me personally to continue to try and do that in the long term.\" She has said she is not clear what her next step will be. Teather, a former charity worker, shot to prominence a decade ago, when at 29 she became the youngest MP. But whatever the controversies surrounding her personal politics, her resignation, Nick Clegg will not welcome her resignation ahead of the party conference in Glasgow. By chance or circumstance, the party has loaded a great deal of internal controversy onto the party agenda. The left has shown in recent years that they can win conference votes if they organise, such as on secret courts, the NHS reforms or whether the economy should even be debated. However, it appears unfeasible so close to an election that conference would be in the mood to inflict serial defeats on Clegg, even if they were capable of doing so. On the key issue of the economy, the Social Liberal Forum has tabled one motion urging the Treasury in the short term to lift the straightjacket on councils borrowing more to build social housing, and a second that does not endorse the coalition's current deficit-reduction plan, and calls for more flexibility in how the mandate is implemented. It is possible that Clegg, who is due to sum up the debate, will accept amendments. He is due to hold a press conference on Monday likely to focus on Syria and his party, but he will also be pressed to say if he will accept the amendments. The attitude of the business secretary, Vince Cable, will be critical to Clegg's thinking. • This article was amended on 9 September to correct the spelling of Alastair Campbell's first name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/23/wind-shale-gas-icm-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-23T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"UK public favours wind turbines over shale gas wells, poll finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/23/wind-shale-gas-icm-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/23/wind-shale-gas-icm-poll","fields":{"headline":"UK public favours wind turbines over shale gas wells, poll finds","bodyText":"More than two-thirds of people would rather have a wind turbine than a shale gas well near their home, according to a new opinion poll published on Tuesday. Asked to choose between having the two energy sources within two miles of their home, 67% of respondents favoured a turbine, compared to just 11% who would support the gas development. The findings of the UK-wide ICM survey shows that only nuclear power and coal are less popular than shale gas developments. The ICM poll, together with a second new poll from YouGov, show public opinion is against George Osborne's push for a new \"dash for gas\" as the central plank of the government's energy policy. The polls come at a critical time for the government's energy bill, which aims to deliver the £200bn required to replace and develop the nation's ageing energy infrastructure, due to be published on 5 November. The investment required will be added to household energy bills that are already rising and proving a political headache for David Cameron. \"This [ICM] poll puts to the sword the myth that the public are set against onshore wind and wish to rush into a second dash for gas,\" said Paul Monaghan, head of social goals at the Co-operative, which commissioned the ICM poll for the launch of the Co-op's Manifesto for a community energy revolution which it is backing with £100m of investment. The poll showed 49% of people would support a wind turbine being erected within two miles of their home, with 22% against. But if the project were community-owned, support rose to 68% and opposition plummeted to 7%. In Germany, where 65% of its huge renewable energy capacity is community-owned, opposition is much rarer than in UK where community ownership is less than 10%. Onshore windfarms have become an increasingly divisive issue, with 100 backbench Conservative MPs demanding subsidy cuts from Cameron earlier this year. Negotiations over the energy bill have been severely hampered by a feud between Osborne and the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey. But new energy minister and Tory MP, John Hayes, told the Guardian the onshore wind controversy has cast a shadow over the wider energy debate and that it could be resolved by the current consultation over community benefits from renewable energy projects, which could see local people getting lower bills, for example. \"Appropriately sited onshore wind has a role to play, but if we're to make this work in a way that garners popular support, we've got to see a big improvement in how developers engage with local communities, new ways of ensuring a sense of local ownership and more obvious local economic benefits,\" said Hayes, when launching the consultation. \"The new research demonstrates we need to see a stronger deployment of community-owned projects, especially in those parts of the country where a small, but highly vocal, minority are blocking progress,\" said Monaghan. \"The UK has made massive strides in recent years with its renewables generation capacity, and it's essential this continue.\" In his battle with Davey, Osborne won a commitment to a new gas strategy, also due to be published on 5 November. But the chancellor's enthusiasm for gas is not shared by the public, according to the poll. Natural gas was the most preferred energy source of just 7% of people polled by ICM, behind solar, hydro and offshore wind power, although ahead of onshore windfarms. The YouGov poll showed that 55% of people want more windfarms, compared to just 17% who want more gas power stations. It also showed that less than one in three people thinks the government should give the go-ahead to fracking. RenewableUK's deputy chief exective, Maf Smith, said: \"Support for renewable energy is consistently strong, in this and other independent polls. One stark message from this survey is the public's evident disenchantment with fossil fuels, including the unpopularity of fracking.\" Osborne announced recently \"generous\" tax breaks for fracking and the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, pledged to make licensing as simple as possible by setting up a \"one-stop shop\". Independent experts argue that shale gas may make a small contribution to UK energy supply in a decade or so, but say it will not have the dramatic impact it has in the US. Former energy minister Charles Hendry, sacked in September's reshuffle, said on Sunday: \"Our future can't depend on gas alone … betting the farm on shale brings serious risks of future price rises.\" The energy bill will also attempt to make building new nuclear power stations sufficiently attractive to investors, while attempting to keep the coalition's pledge not to subsidise the reactors. But nuclear power remains deeply unpopular with the public, with the poll showing it is by far the least preferred energy source. The poll showed significant differences between younger and older people, with 19% of those over 65 choosing nuclear power as their most preferred energy source compared to 6% of those aged 18 to 34. The over 65s showed far less support for local wind turbines (38%) versus those in the 18-34 age group (64%) and more enthusiasm for local shale gas rather than local wind (19% of over 65s, 10% of 18-34s)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/history-banking-money-society","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-21T16:37:34Z","webTitle":"A brief history of banking: the link between money and society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/history-banking-money-society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/history-banking-money-society","fields":{"headline":"A brief history of banking: the link between money and society","bodyText":"Do you know what happens to your money when you put it in the bank? If you are like the majority of the population, including, it would seem, the majority of politicians, then you believe that your money is kept safe in the bank. In fact, quite a number of the people who still use branches are older people coming in to visit their money and check it is all still there. However, the word bank (with all its connotations of solidity and stability) is in fact rooted in the latin meaning \"bench\" and refers to the seating in any Roman forum where money lenders used to hang out. Money lenders who could be bankrupted (literally their bench was broken so they couldn't sit there) if their loans went bad. Bankers ancient and modern relied on the confidence of the public to trust in their ability to pick good credit risks from the bad and deposit money with them in return for interest. The ensuing credit crunches which are the result in the collapse of that trust and confidence are as ancient as credit itself. So where did your money go? Well, in theory, the bank has turned your money from a liability on one side of its balance sheet (an IOU to you as the depositor) into a credit on the other side, such as a loan or bond to a business. This loan or bond, despite it representing money owed to the bank, is counted as an asset and is given a real value on the balance sheet based on an assessment of the risk that it won't be paid back; the higher the risk, the lower the 'book' value of the asset. The loan also provides new money to the bank in the form of interest, a small portion of which is paid to the depositors as reward for their trust in the bank. The rest is profit after the wages of the bankers are taken into account. This is important because what the bank does with your money really does affect the world around you. It is money that produces the activities and companies (such as those engaged in fracking) whose actions we might fundamentally disagree with. However, you don't need to feel powerless in the face of the big banks and their current dominance over how money works for us in the economy. In the 21st century we have seen new communities emerging which have done away with the need for increasingly complex banks to mediate between borrowers and lenders, businesses and investors. Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding use the internet and social media to bring together people in networks to facilitate lending, donating and investing money. While the deposits with these new platforms are not covered by government compensation schemes, their aim is not to encourage people to hoard cash, but to invest directly in an individual's or business' ability to repay a loan or make a return on your investment. When setting up Abundance Generation, around the time of the financial crisis, we started with the goal of creating this more democratic form of finance. Investments in renewable energy infrastructure were a great place to start because they represent a stepping stone towards a revolution in the way ordinary people can invest their money. We called it democratic finance, because of the control an individual has over how their money is used and what activities it generates in the real world (and the impact of those activities for future generations). With crowdfunding, for the first time people can be sure that their money is being used to not only generate a profit (returns on renewable energy infrastructure investment range between 6-10%) but also do so in such a way which fits the moral choices we face as individuals and as a society. Renewable energy projects are by their very nature ripe for democratisation. They are decentralised, discrete, local and smaller in scale than, say, the investment required for a new nuclear power station (and its 150 year clean-up bill). They provide an opportunity for people to put their money to work directly in the real economy, generating clean renewable energy and getting a return that is in turn directly linked to the cash earned from selling the energy to the grid. As with any investment there are risks. In the case of Abundance, the investment is in the form of debentures, official IOU's issued by the projects. Debentures are long term investments (lasting up to 20-25 years) and returns are variable which means that you may not get back all of your original investment. The project risks are well known for the established technologies such as onshore wind and solar with estimates based on many years of experience. Renewable energy investment offers a unique opportunity to change perspectives on money in society, shifting away from the idea that the best place for your money is in an account and reacquaint ordinary investors with the idea of assets and putting their money to work in the real economy.

On Wednesday, the Irna state news agency quoted a senior Iranian official as saying that the spies it claimed to have arrested had been gathering intelligence from Iran's security and military units as well as its highly sensitive nuclear programme. \"The main mission of this act of espionage was related to Iran's progress in the fields of nuclear technology and also military and security activities,\" said Parviz Sorouri, a member of the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, in quotes carried by Irna. Sorouri told the agency that the network had been uncovered by an operation involving the Iranian ministry of intelligence. \"The US and Zionist regime's espionage apparatuses were trying to damage Iran both from inside and outside with a heavy blow, using regional intelligence services,\" he said. \"Fortunately, with swift reaction by the Iranian intelligence department, the actions failed to bear fruit.\" Sorouri's comments follow reports on Monday that Iran and the Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah had identified alleged CIA informants. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, said in June that his group had uncovered at least two CIA informants within its ranks but his claims were met with scepticism at the time. But former US officials told Reuters this week that those arrested were indeed working for the CIA. The officials claimed the agents were \"believed to be local recruits\" working for the CIA rather than US citizens. Iran did not specify the nationality of the individuals it has arrested and the CIA has declined to comment on the recent reports, saying \"it does not, as a rule discuss allegations of operational activities\". In October, tensions between Tehran and Washington escalated after US authorities said military factions inside the regime have conspired to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington. Iran denied the allegations and one Iranian diplomat told the Guardian that the US had resorted to a so-called \"entrapment technique\" in order to smear Tehran in the eyes of the international community. US allegations were met with widespread scepticism because of the sloppy nature of the alleged assassination plot and the limited evidence provided by the US. In a tit for tat reaction in November, Iranian officials accused the US of committing acts of terrorism in the Islamic republic. Iran said at the time that it had evidence showing the US had been behind \"terror\" operations in Iran, including the assassination of its nuclear scientists. \"We have 100 unbeatable documents on the US role in directing terror and terrorists in Iran and the region,\" the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed. \"By releasing these documents, we will dishonour the US and those who claim to be the advocates of human rights and campaign against terrorism among the world public opinion.\" Iran claimed it had sent the documents to the UN but has so far not provided them to the media. In recent years, Iran's nuclear programme has experienced a series of dramatic setbacks after the assassinations of its scientists and the Stuxnet computer worm, which was designed to sabotage its atomic facilities and halt its uranium-enrichment programme. This month, an explosion at a military base near Tehran killed the architect of Iran's missile programme. Iran has pointed the finger at the US and Israel for what has been widely seen as a covert war against the country's nuclear programme and military capabilities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/sep/06/south-korea-fish-japan-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-06T14:32:58Z","webTitle":"South Korea bans fish imports from Japan's Fukushima region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/06/south-korea-fish-japan-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/06/south-korea-fish-japan-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"South Korea bans fish imports from Japan's Fukushima region","bodyText":"South Korea has banned all fish imports from a large area of Japan in response to growing concern over the possible environmental impact of recent leaks of highly toxic water at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In Japan, the row over the plant operator's handling of the leaks deepened on Friday when the head of the country's nuclear watchdog issued a stern rebuke to Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) for causing unnecessary alarm overseas by releasing \"scientifically unacceptable\" information about radiation levels. Seoul's decision came as Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, prepared to make a final pitch for Tokyo's bid to host the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo is the bookmakers' favourite but international concern over contamination at Fukushima Daiichi is fuelling speculation that the Japanese capital could lose out to Madrid or Istanbul. The International Olympic Committee will name the host city at a meeting in Buenos Aires on Saturday evening. South Korea said it had imposed a total ban on fish from Fukushima and seven other prefectures in response to growing public fears over the safety of produce from the region. The fisheries vice-minister, Son Jae-hak, told reporters that the ban would stay in place indefinitely, adding that Japanese authorities had failed to provide timely and detailed information about the water leaks. South Korea imported 5,000 tonnes of fish from the affected region last year, including stocks from Aomori in the far north, to Chiba, located east of Tokyo. Despite assurances by Japan that it rigorously tests food for radiation, China has also maintained a ban on dairy, vegetable and seafood imports from several prefectures, including Fukushima, since March 2011. \"We have provided the South Korean government with relevant information since the contaminated water leaks,\" the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said . \"We will continue to ask South Korea to take measures based on scientific facts.\" In a statement carried by the Yonhap news agency, South Korea's fisheries ministry said the ban had been necessary \"as the government concluded that it is unclear how the incident in Japan will progress in the future and that the information the Japanese government has provided so far is not enough to predict future developments\". The impact from the recent water leaks was being felt as far away as Buenos Aires, where Japanese officials were besieged by questions about Fukushima ahead of the IOC's decisive vote. Hiroshi Hase, an MP and former Olympic wrestler, told reporters in the Argentinian capital that contamination from Fukushima was \"not even an issue\" for the health of people in Tokyo, located 150 miles south of Fukushima Daiichi. With the IOC decision imminent, Shunichi Tanaka, chairman of Japan's nuclear regulation authority, criticised Tepco for inflating fears around the world by releasing misleading data about the water leaks. Earlier this week, the utility said it had detected measured radiation of 2,200 millisieverts an hour at a hotspot near a water tank. Tanaka said the measurement was misleading, and had prompted alarmist reports in the domestic and international media. \"What Tepco is talking about is the level of contamination,\" he said, \"So to describe it with the unit 'millisieverts per hour' is scientifically unacceptable. It's like describing how much something weighs by using centimetres.\" He said Tepco should have used the unit becquerel, which signifies the radioactivity levels in the water itself rather than the potential human exposure levels. \"I have come to think they need to be spoon fed,\" Tanaka said of Tepco. \"It is regrettable that Tepco has caused confusion and fear in the international community by spreading misleading information.\" The 2,200-millisievert an hour reading, confirmed by Tepco, is accurate, however. The firm has been at pains to point out that most of the radiation was emitted as beta rays – as opposed to far more dangerous gamma rays – which travel only short distances and are easily blocked by protective clothing. Concern has been voiced over the danger posed to the health of nuclear workers. Until recently, only two workers were responsible for checking the water tanks, and devices used to measure radiation have had to be replaced because they could not detect radiation levels of more than 100 millisieverts an hour. The number of workers checking the tanks has since been increased to almost 100, Tepco said. Tanaka said reports that the water leaks represented another catastrophe at the plant had been overblown, adding that the quantity of radiation leaking into the Pacific Ocean would have \"no meaningful effect\" on the environment. Criticism of Tepco's failure to to deal with the buildup of huge quantities of radioactive water at Fukushima Daiichi has intensified since its belated admission last month that the plant was leaching 300 tonnes of contaminated water into the ocean every day. The cleanup operation has been further blighted by leaks from water storage tanks and high levels of radiation. About 1,000 tanks containing a total of 335,000 tonnes of water have been built behind the plant, but efforts to remove dangerous radioactive substances from the water have been held up by technical glitches. Earlier this week, Tanaka offered assurances that the stored water would not be discharged into the sea unless radiation levels had been brought down to legally acceptable levels. Coolant water that is being pumped into the wrecked reactors becomes contaminated when it comes into contact with melted uranium fuel. It then mixes with groundwater flowing in from the hills behind the plant, requiring workers to pump out and store an estimated 400 tonnes of the toxic liquid every day. This week, the Japanese government announced almost 50bn yen (£320m) in emergency funds to build a frozen underground barrier to prevent groundwater from leaking into the reactor basements, and to develop a reliable water treatment system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2014/mar/20/internet-of-things-security-dangers","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-20T13:00:21Z","webTitle":"There are real and present dangers around the Internet of Things","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/20/internet-of-things-security-dangers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/mar/20/internet-of-things-security-dangers","fields":{"headline":"There are real and present dangers around the Internet of Things","bodyText":"As with any buzz topic in the tech world, there’s a lot of bunkum around the Internet of Things. And in the security sphere, there’s much unnecessary FUD - Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt – spread by industry vendors to get people suitably scared so they splash cash on purportedly necessary protection.  Take the case of the spamming refrigerator. Researchers suggested the smart fridge had been compromised to relay reams of annoying emails, as often happens to normal PCs. Yet Symantec discovered the fridge was simply on the same network and using the same IP address as a hacked Windows PC, which was really the thing responsible for the spam. Digital listeria this was not. Yet there are reasons to be fearful of the Internet of Things (IoT), a name covering the networks of embedded devices, from smart meters to connected automobiles, which communicate with each other in an automated fashion to help make our lives more efficient. Such connected, autonomous machines have been around for years, but the reason it is now on the tips of tech firms’ PR tongues every day is that the number of connected devices is escalating rapidly into new areas, like toothbrushes and bathtubs. According to Gartner estimates, the IoT will consist of 26 billion units by 2020, and by that time the industry will be worth $300 billion. The problem is that many of the manufacturers of these machines are not taking the secure-by-design approach. “They are learning on the job at this point in time,” says Gunter Ollmann, chief technology officer at IOActive, a consultancy firm that has done much research on IoT security. Hacking vehicles There are a handful of real and present threats. In automobiles, trucks are a major concern. Many contain standardised code to manage vehicles, such as the control area network (CAN) bus protocol, used for internal communications between devices in a vehicle. “CAN messages that control physical attributes are standardised. Therefore, if you figure out a hack for one manufacturer others will be quite similar if not identical,” says Chris Valasek, director of security intelligence for IOActive.  One of the functions that has understandably worried onlookers in the trucking and security industries is the kill switch that powers the vehicles down. “Some fleets use the GPS tracking and ‘check-out’ systems to control access to the trucks when they are in depots or secure overnight storage locations to prevent the truck being stolen,” Ollmann adds. “The open architecture of the trucks CAM bus has made it much easier for the integration of fleet tracking and control technologies like these. But conceptually, any wireless technology that can receive remote commands and affect the operation of a truck is a potential target for researchers and targets. What if someone figures out the master shutdown code for all the trucks, and they get all the trucks in London to stop at 7am?” It’s a nasty thought, but this isn’t science fiction. Trucking companies are working with Ollmann and his team to close off any potential flaws that could lead to disaster. “We’re working with some of them and doing additional research on this now … they’re worried about it.” The car industry is alive to the problems too, at least in its more progressive corners. When Valasek and noted security researcher Chris Miller showed on video how they could hack a car when inside the vehicle (below), it gave rise to both mirth and misery in the car industry.  Tesla has reacted the most positively. Having recruited some noted security pros, including former Apple “hacker princess” Kristin Paget, it has set up a vulnerability disclosure programme rewarding researchers for uncovering flaws. It’s similar to bug bounty programmes run by major software firms, like Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Evidently, the Rubicon has been crossed.  Hacking the home The home is a viable target too, amusingly highlighted by the discovery of a hackable Japanese smart toilet last year. More recently, IOActive detailed flaws in home automation kit made by Belkin, including switches to turn electrical devices on and off, which could have been used to cause real-world damage, possibly a fire. Those vulnerabilities were eventually addressed, but Ollmann says there are numerous flaws in connected home technologies from other manufacturers that will be disclosed in the near future. TVs that run Google’s Android operating system are vulnerable to many of the same attacks that affect smartphones. MWR Infosecurity, a consultancy, has tested out an Android exploit on a Kogan TV running Android. The attack took advantage of a documented weaknesses that allow hackers to use of a piece of code known as a JavaScriptInterface, included in ad libraries to let further actions be initiated on Android machines. In theory, anyone hacking a TV in this way could take photos, if the TV had a built-in camera, or create invasive applications to spy on viewers. That weakness has been found in numerous ad libraries used by many of the world’s top free apps. “It should affect any TV running Android and definitely if they’re running apps which use the flawed ad networks,” says David Chismon, researcher at MWR.  Home routers are ridden with vulnerabilities too, as uncovered by digital security non-profit Team Cymru in March. It found a network of 300,000 home and office routers had been compromised, thanks to worrying weaknesses in the devices’ software, from predictable or non-existent passwords to flaws in the web applications used to control them. The hackers decided to use these security holes to redirect victims to whatever website they wanted when they started using the internet.  Taking over industrial controls Connected, and therefore hackable, devices can also be found in control systems running nations’ critical infrastructure. Researchers across the world have been panicking about supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, used to monitor and manage industrial machines, from nuclear power plants to oil and gas pipelines.   SCADA machines produced by various manufacturers have been shown to contain various weaknesses, like those exploited by Stuxnet, the infamous malware that disrupted centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear plant. What’s worrying is that more vulnerabilities continue to emerge.  In January, the US government’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) issued a warning about a buffer overflow vulnerability, a type of weakness that allows an outside hacker to write code to a device and which has been largely eradicated from modern systems. The Guardian knows of one major security firm that is aware of a number of theoretical flaws, ones that could be used to play with the power controls on SCADA systems, but they do not currently have the right labs to test the potential for real-world impact. This is another key problem: the threat is poorly understood, with many apparent vulnerabilities that may or may not be exploited to endanger critical infrastructure. “We keep seeing small examples of attacks that may or may not be cyber attacks against SCADA systems, but it’s still a theoretical threat in terms of spectacular and long lived degradation of a specific service,” says Steve Santorelli, a researcher at Cymru. His outlook for the future of SCADA-like machines is not optimistic, though. “The internet is not secure frankly, in any way at all. That matters when it comes to control systems.”  Send in the Cavalry Santorelli has a similarly bleak prospectus for IoT in general. “Someone asked me recently: is my fridge going to DDoS me and, frankly the answer is, yes … probably,” he adds. “Anything with an IP address is a commodity in the underground economy, to be bought or bartered for if there is a way to make money from it.”u “The privacy and criminal implications are diverse and they need to be at the heart of the design of these new technologies. The bottom line is that we’ve never truly seen security be at the heart of a new technology and anything that connects to the internet will be inherently insecure by its very nature. The future is not looking bright.” Time to batten down the hatches and prepare for cybergeddon then? Perhaps not. Help is on the way, even if it’s not from government. A movement started by noted security professional Josh Corman has been gathering pace in recent months, since it was first conceived at last year’s DEFCON hacking convention. Its name is I Am The Cavalry. Its intention is to act as a hub for vulnerability research that affects four areas: medical devices, automobiles, home services and public infrastructure. The plan is to give altruistic researchers a place to share their findings in a pro bono fashion, in the hope that the weaknesses will be covered off by whatever manufacturers are affected. I Am The Cavalry will act as a hyperactive middleman, coordinating vulnerability disclosures and pushing for more than just quick fixes. It wants to encourage total cultural change to instil security across organisations’ processes. It’s an ambitious plan, born out of a sense of responsibility in a world ridden with hackable technologies. But will researchers really give away their secrets for free, especially the most technically gifted who can make millions by selling just a handful of the most serious flaws to nation states? Corman believes the ethical side of the hacking community will come out in force. “I’m not making an economic argument yet,” he says. “Our role and what sets us apart is that we’re speaking to those who have something in them ... that altruistic gene. We’re describing something that is a shared risk and a shared concern and if that appeals to someone, they should gravitate to us.” Praise for Tesla Even ahead of its formation as an official organisation (it is consulting with lawyers on whether to become an educational foundation or an industry association), I Am The Cavalry has already facilitated some vulnerability disclosures. Corman says the body has had successes in both the car and medical industries, but can’t disclose whom they involved. He has also been invited to consult with car manufacturers in the US and Europe, and is particularly impressed with the way in which Tesla has responded to the problems at hand.  “We are very encouraged to see such a policy [at Tesla]. A fear we’ve had as a research community is that we would have a 10-15 year learning curve where this new industry was in the denial and lawsuit stage towards researchers,” says Corman. “If this is an indicator of how the rest of the automotive industry will respond in kind, this will dramatically accelerate the maturity and the engagement of white hat researchers who wish to help.” As a sign of his sway with mandarins walking the murky halls of power, Corman has already met with Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who recently urged car makers to act on cyber security issues, and others on Capitol Hill to discuss the weaknesses that urgently need addressing. Despite limited “in the wild” attacks, Internet of Things threats are real. As connected devices proliferate, the hope is that they do so securely. If they volunteer for the Cavalry, that might just happen. Then we can go about our quotidian lives feeling a little less insecure. • Help!

Six years ago an Aboriginal clan group, the Northern Land Council (NLC) and the then Howard government signed a secret deal to develop Australia’s first purpose-built national radioactive waste dump at Muckaty, north of Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory. The commercial-in-confidence plan saw the clan group \"volunteer\" an area of the shared Muckaty Land Trust for the burial and above ground storage of radioactive waste in return for federal payments, promises and a \"package of benefits\" worth around $12m. The deal was not known about or supported by the rest of the Muckaty Traditional Owners and remains the source of bitter contest, deep opposition and a Federal Court challenge. Now Gray is back to talk with the NLC about a second site nomination on Muckaty. Unfortunately the new plan appears to follow the old pattern of secrecy, exclusion and contest. The original Howard plan was energetically embraced and promoted by former resource minister Martin Ferguson, despite conflicting with Labor policy and senior ALP figures describing the legislation to make the dump possible as \"sordid\" and \"arrogant\". Ferguson’s approach to radioactive waste management was characterised by a closed mind and a locked door. Aboriginal Traditional Owners opposed to the dump plan had their meeting requests rejected and correspondence effectively ignored. Unsurprisingly, community confidence in the process eroded. Radioactive waste is a serious and growing international challenge. Despite decades of industry assurances and high cost government projects, not one nation has a final disposal facility for high level radioactive waste. Division and debate runs deep over how best to manage this material. But while the disagreements are many, there is a growing consensus about some fundamental approaches to radioactive waste management, especially when it comes to community consent. In a 2006 report, an expert UK committee on radioactive waste management stated “it is generally considered that a voluntary process is essential to ensure equity, efficiency and the likelihood of successfully completing the process. There is a growing recognition that it is not ethically acceptable for a society to impose a radioactive waste facility on an unwilling community.” The current Muckaty plan and process is at sharp odds with this common sense and common decency approach. It is also in conflict with Australia’s international obligations under the UN declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples which explicitly requires that “states shall take effective measures to ensure that no storage or disposal of hazardous materials shall take place in the lands or territories of Indigenous peoples without their free, prior and informed consent.” The Muckaty plan lacks consent at home and credibility abroad. It is flawed and failing and it is time for a new approach – one that reflects and is informed by best practise, sound science and respect. Radioactive waste management is difficult. Only time can take the heat out of the waste – but transparent and robust processes and policy development can take the heat out of the waste debate. Australia has never had an independent assessment of what is the best (or least worst) way to manage our radioactive waste. Decades ago unelected bureaucrats decided a centralised remote dump was the best model and ever since a chain reaction of politicians have tried – and failed – to find a compliant postcode. Australia is better placed than some countries to do things differently – and better. We have much less radioactive waste than nations with domestic nuclear power and ours is mostly stored at two secure federal sites – the Woomera prohibited area in South Australia and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation’s Lucas Heights nuclear facility in southern Sydney. ANSTO, which produces and houses most of Australia’s radioactive waste, is upgrading its storage facilities. It and the federal nuclear regulator agree ANSTO has the ability and capacity to securely manage all radioactive waste on site, including material due for return from overseas. This reality provides Australia with some much needed breathing space. For more than two decades, politicians have talked big and listened little – and they have spectacularly failed come up with an agreed, credible and mature approach to radioactive waste management. It is time to move away from the obsession with finding a place to dump and instead build a space to discuss. We need to get the policy architecture right so future generations of Australians will not have a radioactive legacy that is badly wrong. A public and independent national commission would advance the discourse on what constitutes responsible radioactive waste management and to move all stakeholders out of the trenches and to the table. In a long overdue and most welcome change of style, if not yet of substance, the latest federal minister with responsibility for this issue has acknowledged that there are deep Aboriginal and wider concerns over the Muckaty plan. A minister named Gray should be well-placed to show leadership on an issue of inter-generational national importance that is not – and should never be – just black and white."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/may/11/nuclear-renewables-japan-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-11T12:09:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: If Japan and Germany don't need it, why does anyone? | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/may/11/nuclear-renewables-japan-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/may/11/nuclear-renewables-japan-germany","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: If Japan and Germany don't need it, why does anyone?","bodyText":"If the third and fourth biggest economies in the world believe they can cut their carbon emissions and keep the lights on without building nuclear power stations, then why can't the sixth? That's the question I am asking after Japan (3rd) yesterday followed Germany (4th) in abandoning their plans for a new generation of nuclear reactors in the aftermath of the catastrophe at Fukushima. In contrast, the UK (6th) remains committed to building a new fleet of reactors. The question may soon become even more stark if a referendum in Italy (7th) next month also cancels their future nuclear programme. These are not small statements by Japan and Germany. About 30% of Japan's electricity comes from nuclear and a rise to 50% was projected by 2030. In Germany, up to 25% of electricity came from nuclear. Currently, the UK gets just 16% or so from nuclear and government plans only to replace - not expand - existing capacity. Adding fuel to the fiery debate is Monday's report stating that 80% of the world's energy (not just electricity) can be provided from renewable from sources by 2050. The report, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was signed off by all the world's governments. It's worth noting the pie chart in the report showing that in 2008 just 2% of global energy came from nuclear power, with renewables (largely biomass) accounting for 12%. And don't forget improving energy efficiency, mentioned specifically by the already efficient Japanese as a way to compensate for lost nuclear power. A different conclusion came, also on Monday, from the UK government's advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, who said that nuclear power could provide 40% of the UK's electricity by 2030. In particular, it says: \"Nuclear generation appears likely to be the most cost-effective form of low-carbon power generation in the 2020s (i.e. before costs of other technologies have fallen), justifying significant investment if safety concerns can be addressed.\" As regular readers will know, I have travelled in the opposite direction to my colleague George Monbiot, in moving from supporting nuclear power to opposing it, based on five key questions I drew up. I believe there is a low-carbon, affordable and secure energy future without new nuclear power.

Disturbing \"messianic-style\" leadership (à la Tony Blair) and schoolboy humour (à la David Cameron) have no place in these circumstances – or in any circumstances of serious government decision-making. What is needed is careful attention to appropriate process (as with Green MP Caroline Lucas calling for MPs to be able to read the full version of the attorney general's legal opinion on launching an attack) and an honest, sober assessment of the legal, UN-based way forward – as Caroline was also suggesting in focusing on the role of diplomacy and the international criminal court. The demeanour of the media debate after the vote reflects the inappropriate tenor of too much of the Commons debate, with Lord Ashdown being notable for his inaccurate shrillness. It is clear that the majority who voted against the government's motion emphatically do not believe that Britain should do nothing or stand idly by. On the contrary, the Green party, and many others, believe there is now an urgent need to increase aid to Syria's neighbours to help them support the refugees forced to flee their homes. And we must be straining every sinew to try to find non-military solutions through regional, international and UN diplomatic routes. Natalie Bennett Leader, Green party • You are quite right that the mood is \"not never again\" but \"not now, not again, not like this\" (Editorial, 31 August). The proposed limited strike would harm people and make no difference to the regime. It is likely that Assad instigated the gas attack; it is certain that the regime dropped an incendiary bomb on a school. Our response should be to arrest Assad and his top colleagues, imprison them in The Hague to await trial, get the UN to make the Arab League form an interim government in Syria and charge them to write a constitution acceptable to all factions. Any faction that would not co-operate should leave. Negotiations would be hard and take many months; they should include a decision about the place of religion in politics. The interim government should also be charged with keeping order and assisting rebuilding, it should report to the UN every six months and be pressured to get on with it. The actual arrests would probably require the SAS, and if it became necessary the Assads could be shot. Evelyn Adey Athelington, Suffolk • It is a grim irony that news of the Chilcot inquiry's delay has been drowned out by the drumbeats of a new war in the Middle East. An attack on Syria would – as with Iraq – have no UN mandate and no legal justification. Our politicians must learn the lessons of our recent bloody history in the region. Now more than ever, the delay of the Chilcot inquiry is a gross abdication of responsibility. If it had not been kicked into the long grass, the inquiry could have played a constructive part in informing the debate around Syria. It was supposed to shed light on how the UK was dragged into an illegal war in Iraq, on spurious grounds, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. But without scrutiny of these issues – of war crimes and dodgy dossiers – we are doomed to make the same mistakes. Dr Kate Hudson General secretary, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament • Just as the madness of war is contagious, so too is the sanity of peace. The courageous decision of the House of Commons to support the will of the people despite the loud beating of the drums of war is already having major consequences. Within days the US government paused in its rush to commit an act of war against Syria. Now the French are rethinking their belligerent stance. The historic decision of 8/29 is the antidote to 9/11. This points the way to putting the \"Great\" back into Great Britain. Let the House of Commons carry on as it has now started and express the will of the people in the matters of nuclear weapons, nuclear power and the arms trade. Jim McCluskey Twickenham, Middlesex • \"You have to realise that after Iraq nobody trusts any of us,\" Ed Miliband reportedly told David Cameron and Nick Clegg in their recent discussion on Syria (Labour forces Cameron to make tactical retreat, 29 August). As it was the anti-Iraq war movement that played such a crucial role in highlighting the Blair government's deceit over Iraq, those who marched through London on 15 February 2003 – often derided for wasting their time – now know that they played a central role in stopping Britain's involvement in another war 10 years later. Ian Sinclair Author, The March That Shook Blair: An Oral History of 15 February 2003 • A point ignored in all media coverage: the Labour amendment, opposed by all Conservatives (and I think all Lib Dems), while expressed in different words, effectively meant the same as the government's motion. It said that there should be no military attack until the report of the inspectors had been given to the UN security council and discussed there, and a vote held, that anything done should be legal, and that there would have to be a further vote in the Commons before any British forces could be involved. Kevin McGrath Harlow, Essex • The heroes of this vote are still unsung; they are neither Cameron nor Miliband but the Conservative and Lib Dem MPs who defied the whip. Most of the people I know outside politics have no idea how difficult it is to defy the whip.

The election on 16 December could damage global confidence in Japan's attempts to steer its economy away from its fourth recession since 2000, and further damage ties to China over competing claims to a group of islands in the East China Sea. Polls show that the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) leader, Shinzo Abe, a hawkish conservative who has promised to take a tougher stance towards China, is tipped to win. Noda, who took office in August 2011 after Naoto Kan resigned, defied fellow Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) members who had urged him to delay calling the election until the party's poll ratings improved. He had promised to dissolve the lower house of parliament after securing opposition support for key bills on electoral reform and budget finance. The DPJ controls the lower house but depends on other parties to get legislation through the upper house. Speculation about the election date began in August when Noda promised the LDP he would go to the polls \"soon\" after it supported his plans to raise the sales tax. At least nine of the DPJ's 244 MPs in the 480-seat lower house are reportedly planning to defect in anticipation of a heavy defeat, effectively depriving the party of its majority. But it is not clear whether the LDP, which governed Japan almost without interruption for more than 50 years until 2009, will win enough seats to form a government with its traditional ally, New Komeito. Abe could be forced to court smaller rightwing parties to prop up his government, leaving open the possibility that Shintaro Ishihara, the former governor of Tokyo who launched the party of the Sun this week, could return to national office. Ishihara is attempting to create a \"third force\" in Japanese politics with the populist mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, leader of the newly formed Japan Restoration party. The two met in Tokyo on Friday in an attempt to iron out differences over tax rises and nuclear power, and could reach agreement to merge their parties over the weekend, according to Kyodo. Abe, who this week called on the Bank of Japan to print \"unlimited yen\" and take interest rates to below zero to boost the economy, described the election as a historic battle. \"We must achieve victory,\" he told party officials. \"That is our mission, and it's with that in mind that I will fight this historic battle. The LDP and the public have been waiting three years for this day to arrive.\" If he wins, Abe, who served as prime minister for a year from 2006, will come under pressure from inside his party to reverse Japan's recent decision to abandon nuclear power by around 2040."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jun/17/iran-opportunity-hassan-rouhani-editorial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-17T21:48:17Z","webTitle":"Iran: an opportunity to be seized | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/17/iran-opportunity-hassan-rouhani-editorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/17/iran-opportunity-hassan-rouhani-editorial","fields":{"headline":"Iran: an opportunity to be seized","bodyText":"Amid the storm clouds thickening and darkening over Syria, there was one shaft of sunlight at the weekend: the election of a moderate cleric as Iran's president. Whether it is because of the west's bungled intervention in Iraq, or simply the law of unintended consequences, Iran's influence has indisputably grown. Today its decisions affect Arab lives from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, from the Turkish border to the Gulf. Of all the options available to the US in trying to roll back this power – punitive sanctions, military confrontation or arming the Gulf states – negotiation is still the most attractive. In Hassan Rouhani, a partner for negotiation may have finally arrived. This is about more than one man – the way he came to power matters, too. To take one small snapshot, Qom, a city full of clerics, voted for him, not against. To have Qom vote against the five regime candidates left in the race, defying the will of the guardian council who vetted them, sends a powerful signal in its own right. Mr Rouhani's warning that Iran's stand over nuclear fuel must not come at the cost of its economy plainly won the backing of a broad swath of Iranian opinion, transcending conservative and reformist camps. In 2009, Iran's nuclear policy was not centre stage of the election campaign; this weekend it was. This alone should put the ultra-conservative group around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on the defensive. Mr Rouhani's victory also showed that the reformist camp had learned the lessons of the stolen election in 2009. The two reformist leaders backing him, Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, showed their hand for Mr Rouhani only at the eleventh hour. This took skill. Until then, the regime had no idea who really lay behind his candidacy. Mr Rafsanjani and Mr Khatami did not go for the most outspoken reformist in the race. By persuading Mohammad-Reza Aref to stand down, they showed the reformists could play Iranian politics. Since the crackdown which followed the election of 2009, they have lowered their expectations, deciding that small steps forwards are better than large steps backward. The character of Iran's new president also matters. Unlike his confrontational predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mr Rouhani is a consensus builder. He is a seasoned diplomat who knows the west. Under him, Iran suspended enrichment and allowed international inspectors in. Full suspension of the uranium-spinning centrifuges is unlikely to be repeated, and the west must understand that much power still lies in the hands of Mr Khamenei and Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Mr Rouhani clearly represents an opportunity to unwind Iran's ticking nuclear clock. But the US and its allies must also learn important lessons from years of stalemate. The draconian sanctions need to be reversible: for Mr Rouhani to be able to make concessions, he must be able to go back to his people with tangible economic gains. Iran's sovereignty must be respected, including that which relates to properly monitored civil nuclear power, and it must also be engaged in a growing non-nuclear agenda, principally Syria. The clearest indication of that came not from the wary G8 leaders assembled yesterday, but from Cairo. President Mohamed Morsi cut diplomatic relations with Damascus, while calling both for Hezbollah to leave Syria and for a no-fly zone. The man who tried and failed to convene a conference including Iran and Saudi Arabia was expressing his frustration with Shia-led attacks on Sunni Muslims. Before Sunni jihadis start flocking into Syria, Iran must realise what is at stake – and back down. Posing as a champion of the Shia is one thing; fighting a war with Sunni Arabs is another – and it is not a fight Iran will win. Russia cannot be counted as an intermediary on Iran. Vladimir Putin has not got the strategic vision to do that in his current mood. Few other countries have got the clout. Thus it is only America which can engage Iran. If it does so, Barack Obama's prematurely outstretched hand might finally find a recipient."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2011/dec/25/energy-industry-nuclear-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-25T12:00:20Z","webTitle":"UK taxpayers face extra £250m bill for nuclear waste clean-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/25/energy-industry-nuclear-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/dec/25/energy-industry-nuclear-waste","fields":{"headline":"UK taxpayers face extra £250m bill for nuclear waste clean-up","bodyText":"The taxpayer will have to stump up almost £250m more to bail out the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in the next financial year after falling asset sales and rising expenditure cut its income by 17.5%. The shortfall is revealed in the NDA's just-published draft business plan for 2012-15, which shows the impact of being unable to offload land to the private sector for new nuclear plants and the end of the contracts to supply Japan with mixed-oxide fuel. The setback will give more ammunition to environmentalists and other critics who argue that the wider nuclear industry is infamous for cost overruns and calls on public funds. NDA income for 2012-13 is shown dropping from £867m to £717m, while expenditure is expected to rise from £2.88bn to £2.96bn, leaving the government needing to increase its total grant to the organisation, which oversees the dismantling of the UK's atomic legacy. A spokesman for the NDA said the figures should not surprise ministers. \"We have been spelling out to government every step of the way and there is no question of any slowdown of our programme,\" he added. The figures for the current financial year were flattered by a £157m one-off sale of land near Wylfa, on Anglesey, but the NDA has also been affected by the Japanese decision to announce the end to its future nuclear programme following the Fukushima nuclear crisis. This in turn persuaded the NDA to shut down the Sellafield mixed-oxide reprocessing plant (SMP) in Cumbria, with the loss of contracts worth £78m a year. The NDA declined to say how much the SMP plant had cost to run, citing commercial confidentiality, but ministers admitted its failure to work properly meant operating losses of £626m had been accumulated by 2009 and it was said to be costing £90m a year to operate. There is now talk of the plant, which cost an additional £500m to build and will cost at least £100m to dismantle, being used as a temporary store for fissile materials. There will also be a loss of income next year from the Oldbury nuclear plant in south Gloucestershire, which is now scheduled for closure in February. Greenpeace said the latest cost overrun proved that the nuclear power industry's financial viability was fundamentally flawed. Doug Parr, chief scientific officer at Greenpeace, said: \"For all the claims of the government that it will be the power giants like EDF that will foot the cost of the next generation of nuclear, the reality yet again is that the hard-pressed taxpayer will end up footing the bill.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jan/30/nuclear-expansion-thwarted-cumbria-no","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-30T19:31:55Z","webTitle":"Nuclear expansion plan thwarted after Cumbria no vote to underground store","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/30/nuclear-expansion-thwarted-cumbria-no","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jan/30/nuclear-expansion-thwarted-cumbria-no","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear expansion plan thwarted after Cumbria no vote to underground store","bodyText":"Plans to expand the UK's nuclear industry are in disarray after the only area to show interest in hosting an underground radioactive waste storage centre decided to thoroughly reject the idea. Cumbria county council's cabinet voted by more than 2-1 to pull out of feasibility studies, following expert critiques of the fractured local geology and an international outcry over the threat to the western Lake District. The decision is a major blow to government ambitions to build new nuclear power plants, with ministers accepting that the UK needs a credible and permanent solution to dealing with current and future waste. Green MP Caroline Lucas said the government's nuclear ambitions were now \"completely derailed\". Copeland district council in the heart of the 'nuclear coast', where Sellafield employs nearly 10,000 people directly and many more in related jobs, voted 6-1 in favour of staying in the search for somewhere to host the waste store. But the energy secretary, Ed Davey, knocked down local offers to \"go it alone\" and said that the county's vote ruled the district out. He thanked Cumbria for taking part and reassured anxious unions that the area would continue to play a \"central role in the energy and power sectors\". While the search for underground storage resumes, funding and jobs will also be created by major improvements to Sellafield's above-ground waste storage, which was scathingly criticised by the National Audit Office in November. Davey highlighted the benefits of up to 1,000 new jobs from the proposed £12bn underground project which would open for storage by 2047. Although nowhere other than Cumbria has shown interest, he said: \"We remain firmly committed to geological disposal as the right policy for the long-term, safe and secure management of radioactive waste. We also remain committed to the principles of voluntarism and a community-led approach. \"The fact that Copeland voted in favour demonstrates that communities recognise the benefits associated with hosting such a facility. For any host community there will be a substantial community benefits package, worth hundreds of millions of pounds. That is in addition to the hundreds of jobs and major investment that such a huge infrastructure project could bring.\" The chair of the union consortium Trade Unions for Safe Nuclear Energy, Kevin Coyne of Unite, said that Cumbria county council's no vote was \"extremely short-sighted\". He said: \"The workforce at Sellafield will be immensely disappointed with the decision. Seventy per cent of Britain's radioactive waste is based in Cumbria and the Sellafield workforce are responsible for it. \"The people of Cumbria were not going to be making any commitments to a waste repository by agreeing to continue with this study. This waste is not going to disappear but because of today's decision there are no answers for how we can effectively deal with it.\" Opinion in West Cumbria has been respectful of Sellafield's huge economic importance since the 1950s but public meetings were swayed by the strength of scepticism from geologists. The huge depot, covering an underground area the size of Workington, was also required to meet unprecedented standards, including a guarantee of no leaks for a million years. The other killer issue was the whittling down of suitable strata to an area of outstanding natural beauty by the Solway Firth and – to widespread incredulity – the national-park jewels of Ennerdale and Eskdale, which would have seen roads and prospecting-cabin clusters even in the research phase. The Conservative leader of Cumbria county council Eddie Martin said: \"Cumbria has a unique and world-renowned landscape which needs to be cherished and protected. While Sellafield and the Lake District have co-existed side by side successfully for decades, we fear that if the area becomes known in the national conscience as the place where nuclear waste is stored underground, the Lake District's reputation may not be so resilient.\" Academics said ministers were in a hole. Prof Neil Hyatt, professor of radioactive waste management at Sheffield University, said: \"What happens now is an open question. There are currently no other local communities with a declared interest in hosting a radioactive waste disposal site.\" EDF, the French energy provider, is at the forefront of government-backed plans to construct new power plants at Hinkley Point in Somerset and at Sizewell in Suffolk but the process is already dogged by delays and arguments over the levels of subsidies needed. Greenpeace's energy campaigner Leila Deen said: \"This represents another major blow for the Government's attempts to force the construction of costly nuclear power plants. \"The prime minister admits that we need a plan to store waste before we can build a single new plant and ministers should now reconsider their nuclear ambitions and turn their attention instead to clean, sustainable and renewable energy.\" • This article was amended on 31 January 2012 because the original said incorrectly that Allerdale borough council had voted against hosting the proposed underground radioactive waste storage centre in Cumbria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/29/open-government-not-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-28T23:05:45Z","webTitle":"Open government?

David Cameron said when he came to power that he wanted to lead \"the most open and transparent government in the world\". One can imagine how pleased and puffed up he will be when the world comes to his capital and applauds his achievements. At a preparatory gathering, Cameron's Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, recruited that great enabler of the free flow of knowledge Sir Tim Berners-Lee to stand alongside him and endorse the coalition. \"Once people see the advantages of transparency,\" Maude boomed, \"the democratic impetus for open government will be irresistible and there will be no turning back.\" I doubt British ministers will tell wide-eyed visitors from foreign shores that they are driving open government out of Britain. They will not admit that the coalition, with the collusion of illiberal judges, is shutting the British public up and closing it down: nowhere more conclusively than when the public seeks to discover how corporations spend and misspend its money. Public services have always moved from daylight into darkness when private managers take them over. Ever since Labour passed the Freedom of Information Act in 2000, MPs, journalists, bloggers, academics, campaign groups and concerned citizens have been able to examine a prison, say, or medical service up to the moment of privatisation when the possibility of scrutiny vanished. In one sense, nothing new is happening. But quantitative change can become qualitative if it grows for too long. The scale of the privatisation the coalition is authorising is taking us into a new and more secretive country. If you think that only policy wonks are bothered by these concerns, you should know that freedom of information requests have exposed the police concocting evidence against demonstrators, the strip-searching of children, state nursing homes that were also fire traps and unsafe practices at the Sellafield nuclear power station. Sadiq Khan, Labour's justice spokesman, grasped the need to extend freedom of information to cover the private recipients of public money when he tried to investigate a case of equal importance: the death of Jimmy Mubenga. The Angolan died on board a plane at Heathrow as three private security guards from G4S hustled him out of the country. One witness told the inquest that security men were \"standing over him and trying to push him down or keep him down\". Mubenga shouted: \"Help, help, I can't breathe. You are killing me.\" He was dead within minutes. The jury found that he had been unlawfully killed. The coroner worried that G4S gave cash payments to guards who succeeded in keeping a detainee quiet. She noted \"pervasive racism and loutish, laddish behaviour\" among G4S officers. Most grotesquely, she found evidence of a dangerous restraint technique the boys called \"carpet karaoke\", where they held detainees' down to prevent them provoking the captain into ordering the posse and its captive off the plane. As it is the job of parliament to hold the executive to account, Khan set a test for G4S. He asked for details of its restraint techniques. The company replied that it could not respond to freedom of information requests. The Ministry of Justice would, even though G4S trained the guards and knew what they did while the ministry did not, The cloak of secrecy may soon be draped over the public sector as well. The Campaign for Freedom of Information is alarmed – to put it mildly – that ministers are talking about making it all too easy for civil servants to refuse to disclose information that the public needs to know – and once had a right to know. The keenness with which the coalition is protecting commercial interests explains a ministerial manoeuvre that baffled me at the time. When libel reform came before parliament, I, along with everyone else, assumed that the private contractors moving into the NHS, prison service and just about every other service would not be allowed to sue their critics for libel. Under the far-from-liberal existing law, public authorities could not sue because in a democracy voters were free to speak their minds about the providers of public services even if what they said was not in the best possible taste. Indeed, as taxpayers and as the recipients of services, we had a dual justification for saying what we wanted without the threat that crushing financial penalties would bully us into silence In the new market-orientated order the coalition was so keen to embrace, any restriction on robust debate would be unfair as well as undemocratic. A failure to allow free speech would mean that businesses and charities could say what they liked about a local authority bidding for a service, but the local authority could not respond in kind for fear of a writ. The Conservatives would not give an inch. In the name of libel reform, they insisted that the freedom to argue in the public square must be restricted and gave private interests an exemption from criticism they denied to public services. As privatisation gathers in pace, such restrictions will only bite deeper. I don't want to go over the Leveson debacle again, but I should warn you that his desire to pile costs on newspapers will kill investigative journalism. Already media organisations, whose business models are collapsing, back away from the very corporations and oligarchs we ought to be writing about. If you could sit in a newspaper office, you would see lawyers and editors muttering nervously whenever the name of a litigious plutocrat or commercial outfit is mentioned. If the price of taking them on goes up, and if Leveson's plan to make newspapers pay costs even if we win a case is accepted, the future is plain to see: we won't touch them. In a doomed but magnificent attempt in 2010 to stop rightwing judges on the US Supreme Court allowing corporations to pour resources into political propaganda during American election campaigns, Justice Stevens dryly noted: \"While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.\" British democracy has its imperfections too. Yet few would have thought that corporations acting in the public's name and using the public's money needed less rather than more scrutiny. Unfortunately for us, those few are our masters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/12/liberal-democrat-wipeout-hunch-defy-polls","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-12T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"The great Liberal Democrat wipeout?

I have a hunch it won't happen","bodyText":"Should one trust a political commentator's hunch? Andrew Marr said the other day that he had a hunch that the Scottish referendum a year from now would be a close run thing. Lots of worldly-wise observers tend to agree. Yet the consistent lead for a no to independence in the Scottish opinion polls mocks this view. There is no evidence to support Marr. Against that, though, there is the hunch. From time to time, I also give voice to a hunch. Mine is that the next general election could very possibly produce another hung parliament. Here again quite a lot of political lags seem to agree. Yet on what basis of fact? Day after day the opinion polls give no support to such an outcome at all. The rolling average of the polls is that Labour will win comfortably in 2015 – a majority of 76, they say this week. Yet I continue to trust my hunch. No party in British politics clings more firmly to its collective hunches than the Liberal Democrats. As the Lib Dems prepare for their conference in Glasgow this weekend, the polls are as bad for the party as they have ever been. On Tuesday YouGov put the Lib Dems on 9% – down from 23% in the 2010 election. The rolling average of all polls gives them 11%, and has been there or thereabouts for nearly three years. With a year and a half to go before the next general election, the signpost pointing towards electoral disaster could hardly be any clearer. When they get to the banks of the Clyde on Saturday, the logical thing for the Lib Dems to do would be to jump in. Yet the party mood in the runup to Glasgow remains strikingly resilient. I have talked to a lot of Lib Dems this week, and I have not found a single one – from senior figures down to the grassroots – who believes that the party is marching towards a wipeout. On the contrary, most Lib Dem people are in guardedly good spirits about the future. Their hunch is that the worst is over, and that in 2015 they will hold on to most of their 2010 tally of 57 MPs – and perhaps even gain some. On the face of it, this is nothing short of delusional. If the party remains at around 10% in the polls, the chances are that the Lib Dems will lose upwards of 45 seats. Even if they managed to recover to 15% nationally – and there is absolutely no sign of that – they could still be looking at losing about 30 seats. Either result would leave them a humiliated rump with minimal leverage, even in a hung parliament. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats' local government base – built up so assiduously over so many long years – continues to haemorrhage councillors. Several things help to explain this almost perverse refusal to panic. The first is that the party as a whole still owns the situation in which it finds itself. The party voted for the coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. They believe, almost to a man and woman, that they must therefore make the best of it without recrimination. Even Sarah Teather, though deciding to walk away in 2015, is not putting herself at the head of a revolt. A second explanation can be given in a single word: Eastleigh. Mike Thornton's victory six months ago in the byelection caused by Chris Huhne's resignation gave the whole party a confidence transfusion. It was interpreted as bankable proof of the claim that Lib Dem activists have long made – that the party can defend its fortresses in spite of horrible national poll ratings. No Lib Dem fails to mention Eastleigh when you ask about the party's chances. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the Lib Dems' strategy for 2015 is to fight 57 Eastleighs. Eastleigh partly explains why the party's internal mood has steadied in the past 12 months. It is easily forgotten that, a year ago, a Liberal Democrat Voice survey found half of its respondents wanting Nick Clegg to quit before the election. Support for Vince Cable as an alternative leader appeared strong. Today, that mood seems to have ebbed. If Eastleigh had been lost, that would not be the case. Clegg's ratings among the general public remain dire – he has a net negative rating of minus 53 among the electorate as a whole, compared with minus 58 a year ago. Significant proportions of his party's activist base remain very critical of him – Teather undoubtedly speaks for many – but internal surveys suggest that support for Clegg has stabilised since a bad dip a year ago. Even strong Cable supporters accept that there isn't much of a leadership issue this year. The thought that Clegg would not lead the party into the 2015 election, quite common 12 months ago, now looks fanciful. There seems a bit more grudging respect out there. If so, it is not down to Eastleigh. It also reflects a more pragmatic sense of comfort with the way the coalition is now conducted and perceived. Most Lib Dem members are temperamentally uncomfortable with being in coalition with the Conservatives. They remain closer to Labour in terms of general values. But the much clearer differentiation between the two coalition parties over the past year – particularly since the collapse of Lords reform and boundary changes – is a more comfortable coat to wear. Cable's speech on Wednesday, in which he sharply cautioned against George Osborne's economic recovery triumphalism, embodies the point. Any Liberal Democrat party conference is inherently more rewarding as an expression of party mood than any Tory or Labour conference – for the simple reason that the Lib Dems still allow proper debates about causes. Glasgow will be no exception. There will be serious arguments over Trident, the 50p income tax band and nuclear power. But this is a party that likes being in government, believes it has made the coalition work, and is convinced it has some signature achievements to be proud of. The Lib Dems' hunch is that the electorate is more open to giving them a hearing than it was a year ago. And that's my hunch too, whatever the polls say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/apr/12/science-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-12T12:36:00Z","webTitle":"The politics of posterity: expert advice and long-term decision making | Natalie Day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/apr/12/science-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2013/apr/12/science-policy","fields":{"headline":"The politics of posterity: expert advice and long-term decision making","bodyText":"Four months into the UK's coalition government, Nick Clegg gave a speech on \"governing for the long term\". It wasn't a premature pitch for re-election; rather, the deputy prime minister wanted to highlight how a culture of short-termism pervades political life, and how \"the longer-term vision we are adopting in government will help to wipe the slate clean, and ensure that future generations can thrive.\" Clegg would struggle to make such a speech today. Difficult decisions such as those required on nuclear power, a third runway at Heathrow, House of Lords reform and Britain's place in Europe have been delayed, or are beset with uncertainty. The constraints of a fixed, five-year coalition agreement have been exacerbated by the erosion of Whitehall's capacity to think long term, through the scrapping of bodies like the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit, the Sustainable Development Commission and the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. Despite the chronic short-termism of our politics, exacerbated by the news cycle and the immediacy of social media, we need politicians and policymakers who are willing to look beyond the next election. Across a host of pressing social and environmental agendas, long-term perspectives are required. How can we extend our time horizons? Environmental enlightenment Part of the answer is through creative institutions. In 1970, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution was created as an independent body, to consider environmental policy issues facing the UK and the world. Over the course of four decades, RCEP is credited with having \"influenced the content, even the fundamental tenets, of policies affecting the environment, with a reach that often extended into the wider international arena\". More than 30 RCEP reports were produced, on topics ranging from nuclear power and industrial pollution; to the environmental impact of housing; genetically modified organisms; and managing waste. Although it then fell victim to the \"bonfire of the quangos\" in the government's 2011 austerity drive, there is much to learn from the influence of RCEP over its long life. RCEP was considered influential because it was authoritative, autonomous and trustworthy. Its independent status allowed it to consider issues of its own choosing, and importantly, it took a longer-term view, so was able to enter into politically sensitive debates. In some cases, RCEP's recommendations were immediately accepted. In others, the gradual process of acceptance took up to 20 years. Beyond its formal reports, Susan Owens (a former RCEP member who has also analysed its work) argues that the commission's wider \"atmospheric influence\" was powerful in promoting fundamental principles such as precaution and transparency in environmental policy over many decades. It was a significant source of \"enlightenment\"; enabling knowledge and ideas to percolate gradually into policy over time through processes of diffusion that were only possible because of its longevity. The politics of pensions The Pensions Commission, led by Lord Adair Turner from 2002 to 2006, is another example of a novel institution which brought expertise to a long-term issue. In a highly charged arena, it sought to depoliticise the pensions debate and build consensus by analysing the future trends likely to impact an under-resourced UK pension system. In 340 fact-packed pages, its first report debunked a number of assumptions and highlighted how increased life expectancy, low predicted birth rates and a two-fold increase in the population over 65 by 2050 would place significant strain on the pension system. Its second report, released in 2006, concluded that Britons needed to work longer, save harder and pay more tax to achieve a more secure pensions system. Describing these as \"clear and unavoidable trade-offs\", Lord Turner argued that an increase in the state pension age, in line with rising life expectancy, was essential to keep the system affordable and fair. Remarkably, given the sensitivity of this recommendation, the Pensions Commission eventually received cross-party support. By May 2006, Tony Blair, who was passionate about pension reform, had set out a two-stage legislative programme to reform the UK system. Fast forward to 2013, and the recommendations of the commission are still influential. A recent House of Lords inquiry, led by Lord Filkin, acknowledges the progress in pension reform as a result of Lord Turner's work, but argues that government may now need to go further. Foresight and horizon scanning The government's Foresight programme provides another useful template for longer-term analysis and horizon scanning. Established in 1994, Foresight is charged with \"helping government think systematically about the future\" and reports to the government's chief scientific adviser (GCSA) and to the Cabinet Office. From food, farming and floods to finance and future disasters, Foresight projects tackle diverse topics, and are well respected in the policy community. Each project typically runs for two years, guided by a high-level stakeholder group and chaired by a government minister. Elsewhere, the capacity for deep analysis and systemic review of longer-term issues across government is patchy. A recent review, led by the Cabinet Office, acknowledged this and sought to improve horizon-scanning functions. But at a time of government austerity, longer-term perspectives can seem a distraction from the more pressing demands of the day. There is concern across Whitehall that – despite Nick Clegg's warm words – this government has eroded strategic capacity at its centre. In particular, the decision at the end of 2010 to close the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit sent a worrying signal about the place of longer-term analysis in the new government. The Strategy Unit, established by Tony Blair in 2002, was the primary source of futures thinking at the centre of government throughout Labour's time in office, conducting reviews across education, healthcare, energy, social mobility and risk. The unit's former director, Stephen Aldridge describes how it could \"step back a bit from the events of the day, the immediate crises, and offer a more considered view to the prime minister and No 10\". Nudging forward Downing Street argues that these functions have been absorbed elsewhere, within its now-enlarged Policy Unit. In its place, there has been a lot of interest in the Behavioural Insights Team or \"nudge unit\", based in the Cabinet Office. By their nature, however, \"nudge\" interventions suggest modest, incremental change rather than longer-term, more visionary approaches to policy. The nudge model is arguably well-suited to the pragmatic realities of fixed-term coalition government. There is a danger, however, that the UK nudges forward at the expense of bolder action on challenges such as industrial policy, energy, infrastructure, climate change and ageing that all demand a longer-term view. Improving the evidence base and extending the time horizon of decision making should be twin priorities for every responsible government. But more thinking about how to do this is required. In September 2012, the Oxford Martin School established a Commission for Future Generations, chaired by Pascal Lamy, the director-general of the World Trade Organization. Frustrated by the gap between knowledge and action in relation to many of the most pressing policy challenges, the commission will consider how governments and global institutions can look beyond the pressures of short-term crisis management. The commission's report, expected in late 2013, will provide practical advice drawn from examples around the world. Clegg spoke in 2010 of ensuring that future generations can thrive, without being burdened by the \"dead weight\" of earlier policy failures. Our fear is that without appropriate action on critical longer-term issues, the burden for future generations will prove unbearable. Natalie Day is head of policy at the Oxford Martin School and coordinates the Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations, which holds its second meeting this weekend.

While Japan is fighting to keep the disaster from escalating, the public debate over nuclear power confines itself to broad generalisations. Yet to simplify matters draws down accusations of callousness. Take the recklessness of Der Spiegel's \"Fukushima is everywhere\" line, and the anti-nuclear theatrics that took place during the spontaneous protest at the Brandenburg Gate, when actual images coming in from Japan would have sufficed. Debates about the local radiation exposure (in Germany, many thousands of kilometres from Fukushima) followed hard and fast. This provoked Klaus Hartung in the Tagesspiegel to such an extent that he diagnosed a certain Angstlust amid the outrage – a flirting with disaster for thrills. Psychoanalysts call this an \"obsession with imagined experiences of loss\", which is then rewarded with a reassuring leap back to safe territory. Angela Merkel's reaction, to shut down nuclear power plants in Germany immediately, was mocked at home and abroad as just plain daft. This indignation with indignation is itself insensitive. Insensitive because it diverts attention from the longlasting threat to Japan. Worse still, it betrays itself as a malicious attack on those opposed to nuclear power because it does not dish out at the same time criticism of those in favour of this dangerous technology. The German words Angst and Lust are familiar ones in Anglo-Saxon: the concept Angstlust was also developed by the British-Bulgarian psychoanalyst Michael Balint. There is a phrase that has entered the language in recent years, \"flipping the tortilla\". It refers to the technique of flipping an argument on its head so quickly that the opponent fails to notice the sizzle. Suddenly, he's holding the losing side of it. It's a flip of the tortilla indeed when opponents of nuclear power, of all people, are accused of insensitivity to individual human fates and of delighting in the very apocalypse they are warning against. To get rid of the reason for your discomfort as quickly as possible, the first thing is to reduce the doomsayers to silence. After all, they have been repeating themselves for decades now, with a note of desperation in their voices – a vicious circle. Honestly, who wants to be against nuclear power? Only people who like getting on our nerves. Most of the time they are probably whining about dead birds beneath wind turbines as well. Compared to this, the comfortable stance of not being against nuclear power looks laid-back and sexy. The summit in the art of self-deception has been scaled by the Guardian journalist George Monbiot, who has written here that Fukushima has convinced him that nuclear is our only option. His reasoning is simple: A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting. Yet, as far as we know, no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation. How cynical. Monbiot wrote this while firefighters were risking their health and possibly their lives to protect citizens. He wrote this while the nuclear plant was radiating, the levels climbing around it, and still no prospect of an end to the leaks. He wrote this while the people of Fukushima looked on from emergency shelters as their livelihoods were destroyed, possibly for generations, and while tap water in Tokyo was forbidden to babies. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the plutonium threat in reactor No 3 is still not under control. Yes, I hope the reactor can indeed withstand many more thousands of tonnes of sea water, if this proves necessary, even though it will flow back into the sea contaminated. Because we still do not know how much worse it's really going to get. Radioactivity – and this is no beautiful thing – is an insidious killer. That's why the Japanese interviewed in the street by television crews are also voicing their fears – oh, my apologies: their concerns. By the way, it makes you sick first. And when I say this, I am not suffering from anxiety, my Angstlust. On the contrary, I've been wondering for decades just what inspires appeasers to blow their horn while mounting the gangway to Noah's ark. Is it a longing for apocalypse, a wonderful yearning for the abyss now that one has been plucked to safety yet again? Yes, Germany is a country with advantages and disadvantages, and Merkel's motives [for shutting down Germany's reactors] are transparent. But the next accident will be completely different. So it's a good thing that even a few nuclear power plants have been unplugged. We can only hope they will be well looked after while cooling down. Because that takes a long time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/26/conversation-monbiot-caroline-lucas-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-26T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"The conversation: Is nuclear power still the answer to our energy problems?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/26/conversation-monbiot-caroline-lucas-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/26/conversation-monbiot-caroline-lucas-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Is nuclear power still the answer to our energy problems?","bodyText":"This week George Monbiot wrote that the Fukoshima disaster had won him over to nuclear power. Green MP Caroline Lucas believes the technology is costly and dangerous. Susanna Rustin brought them together, and heard the arguments. Caroline Lucas: There are cheaper, faster, safer, more effective ways of getting our emissions down than going nuclear. George Monbiot: But we're asking that renewables replace our fossil fuel-based electricity system. We're asking that they replace much of our domestic heating, and supply much of our transport. If, added to all that, we are requesting that the current nuclear generation is replaced with renewables, then we make that task a whole lot tougher. And one of the things Fukoshima has done for me is to show that the side-effects of nuclear power are less grave than I had imagined them to be in a disaster of this magnitude. CL: In what George has just said, and in his article, the most extraordinary omission is any reference to demand reduction, energy efficiency or conservation. I think those three things are going to play a huge role in any sustainable energy scenario, and I'm frankly quite shocked that George isn't putting more stress on them. There is recent modelling suggesting demand could be reduced by 35% by 2050, and we know that our UK homes are so poorly insulated that £1 in every £4 spent heating our homes is wasted. A second thing is George's assumption that nuclear and renewables can coexist relatively happily. I would assert very strongly that they cannot – first of all there are huge opportunity costs. In other words, if the signal being given to investors is that the government is serious about nuclear, then that is where they are more likely to come from. EDF and E.ON are on the record as having said they do not think nuclear can happily coexist with significant renewables – they want to keep renewables small. We've got a government that is explicitly designing electricity market reform regulations so as to make renewables less viable than nuclear. It is far too soon to say the side-effects of Fukoshima are not grave. There is a huge debate around the dangers of low-level radiation. GM: It's true I didn't mention energy consumption, and there are two reasons for that. One is that I've said it so often. But even if we were to reduce energy consumption by 20 or 30 or 40%, we still have to ask ourselves: where is our energy going to come from? Regardless of the cuts we make, we're going to need a major expansion both of renewables as a percentage of the total electricity supply and of the total supply as a whole, because we want to replace other fuels with low-carbon electricity. So let's not make this hill that we have to climb any steeper than it needs to be. As for the dangers, I'm beginning to feel that there's as much nonsense talked about low-level radiation as there is about the undetectable health impacts that doctors can't see but homeopaths can. CL: I've simply said there is a debate going on about the impacts of low-level radiation. But I am basing my argument on economics, and you've not yet addressed the fact that nuclear power is completely impossible without government subsidies. The costs of decommissioning are upwards of £73bn, and we know that if there's an accident it will be up to the taxpayer to bail nuclear power out, because no insurer is going to. Are we trying to look at how we use energy today, and asking simply how we replace it? Or are we asking how we could redesign the way we live in order that we can live in a sustainable and safe way into the future? GM: Taking the costs issue – we're not looking at cheap sources of electricity any way we do this. When you have a relatively low penetration of renewables on the grid – 10, 20, 30, even 50%, the costs will not be that high. But once you get beyond 50% or maybe 70%, they are likely to escalate dramatically, because you need a lot more redundancy and storage. So while you can say wind at the moment costs less than nuclear, it's much harder to be confident that wind, once we've got 60% of all our electricity being produced by renewables, will cost less than nuclear. My guess, because I haven't yet seen a comparative study, and I don't believe one exists, is that when we get up to those sorts of levels, nuclear is likely to be quite a lot cheaper.The other issue is that there are lots of extravagant ways of producing low-carbon electricity, and I hope Caroline will agree with me that the current arrangement whereby rooftop solar power is being subsidised – to the extent that householders are receiving 41p per kilowatt-hour – is grossly inefficient. CL: There is a world of difference between giving support to emerging new technologies, and subsidising a technology that has been around for decades. We are blessed in the UK with some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, and I would put my money in technologies where we know the potential is there. You are deliberately provocative and that's great, but it's misleading to suggest that rooftop solar is wasteful. There is a role for micro-renewables. You were saying you thought when you got to 50-70% penetration of renewables on the grid, they would be more expensive than nuclear. Now I've gone away to try to find some evidence for that assertion, and I can't find any. GM: Are you seriously trying to tell me that the cost of wind at 5% penetration is the same as at 70%? CL: I am not trying to tell you that, George, but neither have I found the evidence to back up your assertion. GM: Beyond a certain proportion of renewable energy on the grid, the environmental costs as well the financial costs escalate. One of the questions we must ask ourselves is, are those costs a price worth paying for replacing our nuclear power stations with renewables? CL: I'm afraid I think George has lost all sense of proportion here. Of course when we're talking about big offshore marine developments there are some negatives, but when you compare that to the fact that we are, with nuclear power, creating waste that will be radioactive for tens of thousands of years, you're not comparing like with like. The next 10 years are going to be critical, and we're not going to have new nuclear power stations in the next 10 years. We could be investing massively in renewable energies and energy efficiencies, but you're going to have the money from the green investment bank supporting nuclear when it could be supporting proper house-to-house insulation. GM: The tougher we make the task of decarbonising the electricity supply, the more climate change is going to escalate to truly dangerous levels and cause suffering out of all proportion to that we are talking about today. Climate change is far more dangerous than any of the issues we're talking about, and the tougher you make it, by rejecting nuclear power, the more likely it is that runaway climate change takes place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/may/22/griff-rhys-jones-green-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-22T10:10:52Z","webTitle":"Griff Rhys Jones attacks green energy 'desecration' of countryside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/22/griff-rhys-jones-green-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/may/22/griff-rhys-jones-green-energy","fields":{"headline":"Griff Rhys Jones attacks green energy 'desecration' of countryside","bodyText":"The comedian Griff Rhys Jones has accused the government of \"random desecration\" of the countryside and despoiling \"pristine landscapes\" through its subsidies to wind turbines and solar power. Responding to criticism of his objection to a solar farm near his home in Suffolk last week, he said it was \"not really a Nimby issue,\" that he was not a climate sceptic and he thought the UK should be powered by new nuclear reactors, not renewable energy. \"We surely need better solutions to global warming than randomly scattered whirly-gigs [sic], and thousands of acres of glinting solar panels, however soothing to our consciences,\" he wrote in a letter to the Guardian. Jones has criticised wind turbines as \"green tokenism\" in the past but his new broadside ups the temperature and broadens his criticism to taxpayer support of green energy, the planning system and the reliability of wind and solar power. \"[The] government is hiding behind subsidy-hunting free enterprise. The result of this has been and is random desecration, with little or no accountability,\" he said of windfarms that he felt were badly sited. He also suggested the intermittent nature of renewable energy undermined its environmental credentials. \"How can we effect [sic] to be green, when we use gas from uncertain fossil fuel driven sources as back up? It is logical to ask why we are assaulting our shrinking countryside in the name of this apparent hypocrisy.\" A \"distorted\" planning system was failing to protect green spaces, he added, but \"aiding and abetting an exponential grab at the countryside.\" Instead of solar power, which \"doesn't operate\" at night, he said he would like to see more nuclear power, such as two new planned reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk, because it would cut carbon emissions, provide more power than solar and had a small physical footprint. \"I am not a climate change sceptic. I am a solution sceptic,\" he said. Jones has emerged as one of the most prominent celebrity opponents of renewable energy. He is not the first well-known TV personality to do so – in 2004, Noel Edmonds gave his backing to anti-wind campaigns following plans for windfarms near his home in Devon. A spokeswoman for trade body RenewableUK said: \"RenewableUK has always advocated a balanced mix to decarbonise our power system and achieve security of supply. The benefits of this can be seen for example when Sizewell B was offline for several months and wind generated the equivalent of electricity for 400,000 homes annually. While no power source generates for 100% of the time, therefore back-up is needed on the system, every unit of wind produced saves us burning polluting imported fossil fuels.\" Adam Royle, a spokesman for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said that solar farms were of increasing concern to its members. \"Solar energy has a role to play in helping the UK to meet its renewable energy targets, as part of a mix of renewable technologies. However CPRE's members and supporters are increasingly concerned about the size and scale of some proposed solar parks, and the impact they could have on the landscape. Applications that would take high grade agricultural land out of productive use are particularly concerning. There is a vacuum in planning policy that the government needs to address so that solar farms do not spoil the countryside, are directed to brownfield sites and are of appropriate size and scale.\" Jeremy Leggett, whose comment article in the Guardian Jones was responding to, said: \"I'm glad that Griff's whole belief system on energy is out in the open now. It's more useful to have these kinds of debates in a holistic context. Let's see how his case fares in reversing the opinion polls that show big majorities of people favouring 'scattered whirly-gigs, and glinting solar panels', and believing – as the Germans are showing every day – that in fact they do a rather good job of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/07/iran-working-on-advanced-nuclear-warhead","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-07T22:38:23Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear report: IAEA claims Tehran working on advanced warhead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/07/iran-working-on-advanced-nuclear-warhead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/07/iran-working-on-advanced-nuclear-warhead","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear report: IAEA claims Tehran working on advanced warhead","bodyText":"The UN's nuclear watchdog will publish new details on Wednesday on alleged Iranian work on an advanced design for a nuclear warhead developed with the help of a former Soviet scientist, according to nuclear experts. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which will also identify a suspect site where warhead components have been tested, is the most detailed presentation to date of its evidence for recent nuclear weapons research in Iran. It is expected to raise tensions in an already volatile region, amid reports that Israel, the US and the UK are weighing military options aimed at setting back the Iranian nuclear programme. Israeli officials are telling western capitals that the report represents the \"last chance\" for a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear crisis. Iranian officials have already denounced the report as \"counterfeit\" and there are doubts, even in Washington and London, whether the IAEA evidence will be enough to convince Russia and China to abandon their opposition to further economic sanctions, let alone countenance air strikes. The report will use information provided by western intelligence agencies, and although it will cite only evidence that has been corroborated by the IAEA's own research, its provenance is likely to become a focus of debate. The IAEA report will say the Iranian studies on weaponisation have been downgraded since 2004 from building and testing components to mostly computer modelling. \"This will not be a smoking gun,\" said Olli Heinonen, formerly the IAEA's chief inspector now at Harvard University. \"But there are areas of concern, and much of it is alarming.\" One of the biggest areas of concern for the IAEA is evidence that Iranian scientists have conducted research on hemispherical arrays of explosives, of a type used in the construction of nuclear weapons to crush a spherical core of fissile material and thereby trigger a chain reaction. The central evidence for the research is a five-page document outlining experiments with the device, codenamed the R265 because it has a 265mm radius, but the UN inspectors are said to have gathered other corroborating evidence. David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector who now runs an independent thinktank, the Institute for Science and International Security (Isis), said the device, first described in a 2009 article in the Guardian, relies on a complex system to ensure a large number of explosives are triggered simultaneously. \"It is a hemispherical aluminium shell system that contains a distributed array of explosive filled channels which terminate in explosive pellets,\" Albright told the Guardian. \"The pellets simultaneously explode to initiate the entire outer surface of a high explosive component in hemispherical form under the shell. These explosive would compress the core. The whole hemispherical system is initiated by one initial point of detonation, or two points for an entire device of two hemispheres.\" Previous IAEA reports have said Iran appears to have received foreign assistance in its experiments with advanced explosive devices, and the Washington Post named Vyacheslav Danilenko, a Russian former atomic scientist, as a key advisor, who is said to have given lectures and contributed papers on explosives at Iran's now defunct Physics Research Centre, which had ties to the country's nuclear programme. Danilenko did not reply to emails seeking comment, but sources close to the IAEA said he told its inspectors that he believed his advice was being used for civilian purposes. He is now carrying out research for a Czech-based company which uses explosives to make tiny diamonds for industrial uses. Press reports from Vienna, where the IAEA is based, said Wednesday's report will also give details of the agency's suspicions that a steel bus-sized chamber spotted in satellite photos at a military complex at Parchin, 18 miles south-east of Tehran, has been used for testing explosive components for a nuclear weapon. The IAEA has previously conducted two inspections of parts of the Parchin complex in 2005, but found no evidence of nuclear activity. However, large parts of the complex were not subject to inspection. The Tehran government has rejected the evidence. The foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, has rejected it as \"counterfeit\". In an interview with an Egyptian newspaper, Al Akhbar, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said: \"The bullying powers of the world should know that Iran will not allow them to take any measure against the country.\" The IAEA report comes at a time of an unprecedented public debate in Israel over whether the country should take military action to try to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon, amid reports that the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is seeking to convince his coalition government to support such action. Earlier this year the US supplied Israel with 55 bunker-busting bombs, and last week the Israeli air force conducted drills at a Nato base in Sardinia for long-range attacks. Reports from Israel have suggested that any raid against Iranian nuclear sites could be routed over Iraq, which has no anti-aircraft batteries. However, Avner Cohen, an expert on Israel's own nuclear arsenal and a professor at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said: \"I think it's 70%-80% bluff that we are planning to attack. I don't think Israel is planning to do anything right now, but it wants to leverage the report to put maximum pressure on Russia and China to agree to very new sanctions or risk a new war.\" Cohen added: \"Everybody recognises it will be counter-productive, that the costs outweigh the benefits. Iran would leave NPT [nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] throw out the IAEA, and declare it has the right to nuclear weapons. I don't think they have a majority even in the inner cabinet to do it, but there is no question they are building capabilities.\" He said they thought that even hawks did not believe that Iran would use a nuclear weapon against Israel, but they believe it might be necessary to go to war to preserve Israel's relative power in the Middle East. \"Ultimately this is a fight over the Israeli nuclear monopoly in the region,\" Cohen said. Jeffrey Lewis, arms control expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said that the details of the IAEA report would be crucial in judging its significance. \"If the allegation is that the Iranians have continued to do research at university level, the question whether these things are unambiguous. The precise level of government involvement is the key,\" Lewis said. He added: \"If Iran is moseying towards a bomb option, there are all sorts of things they can do legitimately which taken in sum support the hypothesis they are taking that path. The thing they want to avoid is making that final choice [to make a bomb]. \"We are going to have to accept there is going to be some risk, but maybe it's worth living with ambiguity in the hope of somehow heading them off from exercising that choice, because if you strike the Iranian programme you guarantee they are going to turn around and try to make a bomb. You buy yourselves a few years but it's pretty sure they end up with a bomb.\" Explosive charge: The scientist accused of aiding Tehran Vyacheslav Danilenko, a Russian former atomic scientist, was alleged in the Washington Post to have provided advice on explosives to Iranian scientists which was incorporated into Tehran's design for a nuclear warhead. Sources close to the IAEA confirmed he was the \"foreign expert\" referred to in its past reports on Iranian weaponisation. It said he had given lectures over a number of years to Iranian specialists on how to rig simultaneous explosions: mastering such explosive force is critical in building an implosion-type nuclear device, in which high explosives compress highly enriched uranium or plutonium until it reaches critical mass, triggering a chain reaction. However, in interviews with the IAEA, Danilenko is said to have insisted that he had been under the impression his advice would be used for purely civilian applications of explosive technology, sources close to the agency said. Although he did not specify what those applications were, he now works for a company called Nanogroup, based in the Czech Republic, which specialises in the use of explosives to make tiny diamonds for industrial purposes. On its website the company describes itself as \"the first industrial manufacturer of nanodiamonds in the world market\". Danilenko, who is said to be writing a theoretical textbook on high explosives, did not respond to requests for comment. • This article was amended on 8 November 2011 because the original said Jeffrey Lewis is a nuclear expert at the New America Foundation.

Eight people have occupied the semi-derelict Langborough farmhouse on land due to be cleared within weeks to make way for the twin-reactor Hinkley Point C power station. The £100m preparatory earth works, which were formalised today in Paris with David Cameron and Nicholas Sarkozy signing an agreement, will remove a volume of soil and rock four times the volume of Wembley stadium from the 500ha site, destroy a site of special scientific interest and several historic buildings. EDF today admitted they did not have permission to start building the power station but said the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) had accepted their application for a Development consent order (DCO). The IPC will take around a year to decide on the DCO and, if EDF's bid is successful, would allow the company to build on the site. In addition, a spokesman said the company had received permission from West somerset district council to begin \"preparatory works\". \"We have consent for site preparatory works, which is essentially doing the levelling and putting in infrastructure like roads. We have a separate application with the IPC. If we do not get the DCO then we would reinstate the earthworks,\" said a spokesman. \"We hope to start work soon, in the spring.\" But the protesters said the preparatory works were so large they constituted the effective start of the power plant construction and rendered the consultation period, when arguments for and against the power station could be heard, meaningless. \"The government has steam-rollered this through. Either EDF is behaving in a grossly insensitive way by clearing 500 hectares of land, or they know that they will get permission to build the nuclear station. If it is a done deal then the consultation is bogus. The democratic process has been dispensed with completely\", said Theo Simon, one of the eight protesters now in the farmhouse. The group, who call themselves the Barnstormers, have been issued iodine pills in the case of a nuclear accident by the local council. \"We are here for the long haul. We have a lot of support from local people who have brought us food and wood. We are hoping other people will come to the site,\" said one. The IPC's examination and decision making is likely to take nearly a year, by which time the site will have been cleared of all vegetation. \"This is like someone who has not got planning permission digging the foundations of a new house. The extent of the activity, the clearance of most vegetation, hedges and trees, the excavation of more than 4 million cubic metres of soil and rocks, the re-routing of underground streams, the creation of roads and roundabouts, major changes to the landscape ... mean it is effectively the beginning of construction of the proposed Hinkley C nuclear power station,\" said the Stop Hinkley C spokesman Crispin Aubery. In a separate development, the local authority warned EDF that the planning process for the reactor had stalled because the company had not given them the money to allow them to scrutinise the planned work. \"There are still key issues to be resolved at a local level before this development [of the building of the reactor, not the preparatory work] can take place. The legitimate rights and concerns of the local community are far from settled – in fact, the planning process is currently stalled while we wait for the developer, French company EDF, to agree vital funding for the necessary scrutiny of the development process,\" said the Sedgmoor district council leader, Duncan McGintty. \"This scrutiny is fundamental to make sure that the interests of the residents who will bear the impacts of the development are fairly and properly represented. It is also a part of a legal requirement under the formal consent procedure set out by the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC).\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/apr/30/green-party-largest-number-candidates","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-30T18:39:40Z","webTitle":"Green party fields largest number of candidates in its history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/30/green-party-largest-number-candidates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/apr/30/green-party-largest-number-candidates","fields":{"headline":"Green party fields largest number of candidates in its history","bodyText":"The Green party will field more candidates than ever in Thursday's local elections, with more than 900 people standing – ensuring that nearly all of the county council constituencies voting have a Green candidate on their ballots. The party is hoping to capitalise on disaffection with the main three political parties, much as Ukip is. The Greens are pinning their hopes on a highly localised style of campaigning, with candidates loudly opposing plans for shale gas fracking, incinerators, landfill sites and roads. Natalie Bennett, leader of the party, told the Guardian the campaign would be a test of localism. \"In some areas, it's about 20mph zones near schools, hospitals, parks or play areas,\" she said. \"In other areas, it's about planning protections or development of green spaces.\" The Greens have been associated at a national level (the party has one MP, Caroline Lucas of Brighton Pavilion) with issues such as climate change, pollution and opposition to nuclear power. Its members see the key to local elections as a focus on communities, particularly those that feel alienated from the Westminster bubble. But the party has been campaigning on certain national issues – such as for a living wage, higher than the minimum wage in most areas. Her message for those who thought the Green party was only about environmental issues, is that localism is about making the whole community sustainable. \"Equality and the environment go hand in hand,\" Bennett said. \"People have to have a sustainable life – a sustainable job, security – so they can think about the bigger issues. It's about people having jobs they can build a life around,\" she said. That means local artisans selling in local shops, protected from competition from multinationals and supermarkets by a deliberate emphasis on creating the conditions where small businesses can flourish. Bennett, a former Guardian journalist, has made a point of visiting food banks in the areas where she has been campaigning. She has been stunned by the increasing number of the banks, and by reports that demand for their services is increasingly dramatically. \"It is truly terrifying, how much they are planning to have to grow next year,\" she said. The scandals involving Ukip candidates – with one accused on Tuesday of giving a Nazi salute in a photograph and others accused of racist, homophobic and xenophobic expressions that Nigel Farage insists are not in line with the party's views – are far away from the Green party, according to Bennett. \"Ukip is nasty, and toxic,\" she said. \"We trust our local parties.\" Although the Green party has probably even less financial resources at its disposal than Ukip, which has said it lacks the money to vet all its candidates thoroughly, Bennett is confident that no one standing in elections for the Green party will be found lacking. \"These are people who come from the local community, they are known to the local community, they have usually been active for years,\" she said. \"They are local people, teaching in local schools, NHS workers, people who are embedded in the societies they are standing for. We have great confidence in the quality of our candidates.\" For all the grand plans, however, the Green party's aims are still modest. Bennett refuses to be drawn on how many council seats the party can hope to gain, saying only it should be \"approaching double figures\". For a party with 138 councillors already in principal authorities, that seems a small ambition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2012/feb/02/nuclear-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-02T12:58:43Z","webTitle":"We cannot wish Britain's nuclear waste away | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/feb/02/nuclear-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/feb/02/nuclear-waste","fields":{"headline":"We cannot wish Britain's nuclear waste away","bodyText":"Duncan Clark's article in the Guardian today should cause even the most determined anti-nuclear campaigner to think long and hard about the choices that confront us. He reveals that Prof David MacKay, chief scientific adviser to the UK government's energy department and author of Sustainable Energy: Without the Hot Air, has endorsed a remarkable estimate. The UK's stockpile of nuclear waste could be used to generate enough low-carbon energy to run this country for 500 years. If the material we have seen until now as waste is instead seen as fuel, it has the potential to solve three problems at once: the UK's contribution to climate change, possible future energy shortfalls and a significant component of the massive bill - and massive headache - associated with cleaning up the current nuclear mess. The technology with the potential to solve these problems is the fast reactor, ideally the integral fast reactor (IFR), which I wrote about in December. It exploits the fact that conventional nuclear power plants use just 0.6% of the energy contained in the uranium that fuels them. IFRs, once loaded with nuclear waste, can, in principle, keep recycling it until only a small fraction remains, producing energy as they do so. The remaining waste is both unusable for anyone who might hope to make a weapon from it and presents much less of a long-term management problem, as its components have half-lives of tens, not millions, of years. An IFR plant could melt down only by breaking the laws of physics: if the fuel pins begin to overheat, they expand, stopping the fission reaction. GE Hitachi has offered to build a fast reactor to consume the plutonium stockpile at Sellafield, though not yet the whole kit (the integral fast reactor). It has offered to do it within five years, and to carry the cost if it doesn't work out. This is the proposal the government is now considering. I would like to see it go further and examine the case for the full works: an integral fast reactor (incorporating a reprocessing plant) that generates much more energy from the waste pile. We are confronted not just with a choice between nuclear power and gas or coal - whose consequences I have explained elsewhere - but also with a choice between different nuclear technologies. This is a choice that has to be made, because we have a monstrous pile of nuclear waste, a legacy of both the irresponsible short-termism of those who ran previous generations of nuclear power plants and of the nuclear weapons industry. We cannot wish this waste away. It exists and something must be done about it. There are currently three serious options on the table. The first is to bury it. We get nothing from this except a bloody great hole in the ground and a bill to match. The second is currently the government's favoured option: mixed oxide processing (Mox). This has already proved to be an expensive fiasco. It produces (when it works at all) fuel that hardly anyone wants, at great cost, and more waste plutonium than we possess already. Its contribution to the electricity supply is feeble, raising the energy extracted from nuclear fuel from 0.6% to 0.8%. Most importantly, it can deal only with plutonium waste, whereas IFRs also consume depleted uranium. Even the government admits that \"the value of the fuel to reactor operators is significantly less than the cost of its manufacture\". The third option is fast reactors, ideally integral fast reactors. This is the one I favour, and unless you can provide me with a powerful reason why it should not receive serious consideration, it is the option I will continue to promote. Whichever of the three choices we make, we will be choosing a nuclear technology - and a major contract for a nuclear operator. We will be favouring one branch of the nuclear industry at the expense of two others. If, for example, we prevail on the government to develop IFRs, not Mox, then Areva, which hopes to profit from mixed oxide processing, will be sorely disappointed. The same goes for whichever company might have secured the contract for burying the waste. So which of these options do you support? None of the above is not an answer. Something has to be done with the waste, and unless you have invented a novel solution, one of these three options will need to be deployed. But it is a choice that opponents of nuclear power are refusing to make - and that is not good enough. Let me give you an example. After I first wrote about integral fast reactors, Ruth Balogh, the nuclear issues campaigner for West Cumbria &amp; North Lakes Friends of the Earth, sent a furious letter to the Guardian. She accused me of \"proposing a technical fix for nuclear waste.\" Yes, that is exactly what I'm proposing. Does she have an alternative in mind? A non-technical fix perhaps? No fix at all? She went on to lambast both deep disposal for nuclear waste, the design for which, she claims, has \"more than 100 flaws\" and the Mox plant, whose evident drawbacks she lists. She then goes on the propose … a grand total of nothing. Her solution is to attack the people suggesting an alternative to both the treatments she abhors - without suggesting one herself. That's not just irresponsible. It's dumb. She then suggests that IFRs could cause a \"nuclear catastrophe at Sellafield\" big enough to cause the \"ruination of the western Lake District\". If she can propose a mechanism which does not break the laws of physics by which an IFR plant could achieve this, I will ask the Guardian to provide space for her on this site to explain it to our readers. But all of us, if we have a serious interest in doing something about nuclear waste, should make this choice. What do you want to see done with it and why? Simply shouting down other people's suggestions won't make it go away. • Get the Guardian's environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+ www.monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-21T19:43:00Z","webTitle":"Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power","bodyText":"You will not be surprised to hear that the events in Japan have changed my view of nuclear power. You will be surprised to hear how they have changed it. As a result of the disaster at Fukushima, I am no longer nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology. A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting. Yet, as far as we know, no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation. Some greens have wildly exaggerated the dangers of radioactive pollution. For a clearer view, look at the graphic published by xkcd.com. It shows that the average total dose from the Three Mile Island disaster for someone living within 10 miles of the plant was one 625th of the maximum yearly amount permitted for US radiation workers. This, in turn, is half of the lowest one-year dose clearly linked to an increased cancer risk, which, in its turn, is one 80th of an invariably fatal exposure. I'm not proposing complacency here. I am proposing perspective. If other forms of energy production caused no damage, these impacts would weigh more heavily. But energy is like medicine: if there are no side-effects, the chances are that it doesn't work. Like most greens, I favour a major expansion of renewables. I can also sympathise with the complaints of their opponents. It's not just the onshore windfarms that bother people, but also the new grid connections (pylons and power lines). As the proportion of renewable electricity on the grid rises, more pumped storage will be needed to keep the lights on. That means reservoirs on mountains: they aren't popular, either. The impacts and costs of renewables rise with the proportion of power they supply, as the need for storage and redundancy increases. It may well be the case (I have yet to see a comparative study) that up to a certain grid penetration – 50% or 70%, perhaps? – renewables have smaller carbon impacts than nuclear, while beyond that point, nuclear has smaller impacts than renewables. Like others, I have called for renewable power to be used both to replace the electricity produced by fossil fuel and to expand the total supply, displacing the oil used for transport and the gas used for heating fuel. Are we also to demand that it replaces current nuclear capacity? The more work we expect renewables to do, the greater the impact on the landscape will be, and the tougher the task of public persuasion. But expanding the grid to connect people and industry to rich, distant sources of ambient energy is also rejected by most of the greens who complained about the blog post I wrote last week in which I argued that nuclear remains safer than coal. What they want, they tell me, is something quite different: we should power down and produce our energy locally. Some have even called for the abandonment of the grid. Their bucolic vision sounds lovely, until you read the small print. At high latitudes like ours, most small-scale ambient power production is a dead loss. Generating solar power in the UK involves a spectacular waste of scarce resources. It's hopelessly inefficient and poorly matched to the pattern of demand. Wind power in populated areas is largely worthless. This is partly because we have built our settlements in sheltered places; partly because turbulence caused by the buildings interferes with the airflow and chews up the mechanism. Micro-hydropower might work for a farmhouse in Wales, but it's not much use in Birmingham. And how do we drive our textile mills, brick kilns, blast furnaces and electric railways – not to mention advanced industrial processes? Rooftop solar panels? The moment you consider the demands of the whole economy is the moment at which you fall out of love with local energy production. A national (or, better still, international) grid is the essential prerequisite for a largely renewable energy supply. Some greens go even further: why waste renewable resources by turning them into electricity? Why not use them to provide energy directly? To answer this question, look at what happened in Britain before the industrial revolution. The damming and weiring of British rivers for watermills was small-scale, renewable, picturesque and devastating. By blocking the rivers and silting up the spawning beds, they helped bring to an end the gigantic runs of migratory fish that were once among our great natural spectacles and which fed much of Britain – wiping out sturgeon, lampreys and shad, as well as most sea trout and salmon. Traction was intimately linked with starvation. The more land that was set aside for feeding draft animals for industry and transport, the less was available for feeding humans. It was the 17th-century equivalent of today's biofuels crisis. The same applied to heating fuel. As EA Wrigley points out in his book Energy and the English Industrial Revolution, the 11m tonnes of coal mined in England in 1800 produced as much energy as 11m acres of woodland (one third of the land surface) would have generated. Before coal became widely available, wood was used not just for heating homes but also for industrial processes: if half the land surface of Britain had been covered with woodland, Wrigley shows, we could have made 1.25m tonnes of bar iron a year (a fraction of current consumption) and nothing else. Even with a much lower population than today's, manufactured goods in the land-based economy were the preserve of the elite. Deep green energy production – decentralised, based on the products of the land – is far more damaging to humanity than nuclear meltdown. But the energy source to which most economies will revert if they shut down their nuclear plants is not wood, water, wind or sun, but fossil fuel. On every measure (climate change, mining impact, local pollution, industrial injury and death, even radioactive discharges) coal is 100 times worse than nuclear power. Thanks to the expansion of shale gas production, the impacts of natural gas are catching up fast. Yes, I still loathe the liars who run the nuclear industry. Yes, I would prefer to see the entire sector shut down, if there were harmless alternatives. But there are no ideal solutions. Every energy technology carries a cost; so does the absence of energy technologies. Atomic energy has just been subjected to one of the harshest of possible tests, and the impact on people and the planet has been small. The crisis at Fukushima has converted me to the cause of nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/07/uk-nuclear-risk-flooding","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-07T12:28:37Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear sites at risk of flooding, report shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/07/uk-nuclear-risk-flooding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/07/uk-nuclear-risk-flooding","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear sites at risk of flooding, report shows","bodyText":"As many as 12 of Britain's 19 civil nuclear sites are at risk of flooding and coastal erosion because of climate change, according to an unpublished government analysis obtained by the Guardian. Nine of the sites have been assessed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as being vulnerable now, while others are in danger from rising sea levels and storms in the future. The sites include all of the eight proposed for new nuclear power stations around the coast, as well as numerous radioactive waste stores, operating reactors and defunct nuclear facilities. Two of the sites for the new stations – Sizewell in Suffolk and Hartlepool in County Durham, where there are also operating reactors – are said to have a current high risk of flooding. Closed and running reactors at Dungeness, Kent, are also classed as currently at high risk. Another of the sites at risk is Hinkley Point in Somerset, where the first of the new nuclear stations is planned and where there are reactors in operation and being decommissioned. According to Defra, Hinkley Point already has a low risk of flooding, and by the 2080s will face a high risk of both flooding and erosion. Other new reactor sites that face some risk now and high risk by the 2080s are Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Bradwell, Essex. The huge old nuclear complex at Sellafield, Cumbria, is said to face a medium risk of flooding now and later. The analysis was conducted by officials from Defra's floods and coastal erosion team as part of a major investigation into the impact of climate change on the UK. But when the results were published in January only summary numbers for the 2080s were mentioned and no individual sites were named. Defra has now, however, released its full analysis in response to a request under freedom of information legislation. As a result, the department's assessments of the risks for individual sites can be disclosed for the first time. Many of the sites date back to the 1950s and 1960s, and are unlikely to be fully decommissioned for many decades. Seven of those containing radioactive waste stores are judged to be at some risk of flooding now, with a further three at risk of erosion by the 2080s. Experts suggested the main concern was of inundation causing nuclear waste leaks. \"Sea level rise, especially in the south-east of England, will mean some of these sites will be under water within 100 years,\" said David Crichton, a flood specialist and honorary professor at the hazard research centre at University College London. \"This will make decommissioning expensive and difficult, not to mention the recovery and movement of nuclear waste to higher ground.\" The French nuclear company EDF Energy was confident that all its nuclear sites in Britain were adequately protected against storms and floods. \"Without these arrangements in place the regulator would have the authority to close us down,\" said an EDF spokeswoman. Reports by the government's Office for Nuclear Regulation since the Fukushima nuclear accident a year ago had confirmed the \"fundamental safety\" of Britain's nuclear plants, the spokeswoman said. \"Protection from flooding has also been factored into our new-build plans and will be covered by a robust regulatory regime, should consent be granted.\" The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the government body responsible for dismantling old nuclear plants, said flood risk at every site was reviewed at least every 10 years. New climate change hazards were likely to emerge slowly giving \"time to develop and implement credible solutions\", said an NDA spokesman. He continued: \"Existing power stations are designed with flood protection measures to protect against a one-in-10,000-year flood event and planning requirements state that new nuclear plants are also designed to take account of climate change impacts.\" But Greenpeace accused the government and nuclear industry of covering up the real extent of flood and erosion risk. \"It makes you wonder what other important information about the safety of our nuclear plants the government and EDF might be hiding,\" said the group's chief scientist, Doug Parr. A Defra spokesperson said: \"As the nuclear regulator has said the UK's nuclear sites are fundamentally safe with protection against current and future flood risk built in. The Climate Change Risk Assessment analyses possible outcomes by 2080 if no actions were taken to protect against the effects of climate change. This is clearly not the case - nuclear operators are already well aware of the risk of flooding, now and in the future, and are taking the action necessary to protect sites.\"‬‪"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/nov/30/ge-hitachi-nuclear-reactor-plutonium","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-30T17:41:11Z","webTitle":"GE and Hitachi plan new reactor to burn UK plutonium stockpile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/30/ge-hitachi-nuclear-reactor-plutonium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/nov/30/ge-hitachi-nuclear-reactor-plutonium","fields":{"headline":"GE and Hitachi plan new reactor to burn UK plutonium stockpile","bodyText":"General Electric set out proposals on Wednesday to build a new nuclear reactor at Sellafield that would convert the UK's stockpile of radioactive plutonium into electricity. The multibillion pound project would take plutonium – the residue from the UK's nuclear power plants – and use it as fuel for a 600MW reactor that could provide power for 750,000 homes, according to GE Hitachi. The company's \"Prism\" reactor has been in use for more than 30 years in the US, but if the new plant goes ahead it would be the first such plant in private operation outside the US. However, the government has still not decided which option it prefers for dealing with the UK's plutonium – others include long-term storage, converting it for use in a thorium reactor or building a new mixed oxide fuel ('mox') processing plant – and GE's proposal is likely to face competition. Ministers have been increasingly talking about the future of the stockpile, which costs about £2bn a year to maintain, and some in government want the plutonium to be classed as an asset rather than a liability. Sir David King, former chief scientific adviser, urged ministers earlier this year to find a use for the stockpile. A government decision is expected \"shortly\", but no firm date has yet been set. Some nuclear experts contacted by the Guardian were sceptical of GE's proposals, pointing out that the company had provided little data on which to assess its credibility as a solution to the UK's plutonium stockpile, and that government-sponsored research into the available options had suggested that a mixed oxide plant was the best use. The Prism reactor works by taking the existing plutonium oxide powder in cans, and converting it to metal. That metal is in turn converted into an alloy and mixed with uranium and zirconium, which is put into a fuel bundle and used in a fission reactor. After the fuel is spent, the waste product that is left would be safer than plutonium in the form in which the UK stores it today, because it would be less liable to be used in weapons and would be more easily stored, the company said. \"The waste is much the same as that produced by new light water reactors,\" said Eric Loewen, chief engineer on the Prism project. The new plant could be built on Sellafield property. There would also be enough room to construct a separate new nuclear power plant, as one of the newbuild reactors that the government wants to see built. GE would not say how much the plant would be likely to cost, or how much profit it could make, but said the investment would be \"multibillion\" if it went ahead. One alternative is to convert the plutonium into fuel that could be used for a thorium-based plant. Thorium was explored several decades ago as an alternative to current reactors until the research was discontinued, but some experts believe it could provide a safer, cleaner and more environmentally friendly alternative to current nuclear designs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/06/climate-activists-sentenced-gas-fired-power-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-06T16:15:00Z","webTitle":"Climate activists receive sentences for gas-fired power station occupation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/06/climate-activists-sentenced-gas-fired-power-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/06/climate-activists-sentenced-gas-fired-power-protest","fields":{"headline":"Climate activists receive sentences for gas-fired power station occupation","bodyText":"Twenty-one climate change activists were sentenced on Thursday for aggravated trespass after occupying a gas-fired power station last year. Sixteen of the activists were given community service orders of 150-200 hours, while the other five received 18-month conditional discharges. The activists occupied EDF's newly built West Burton power plant in Nottinghamshire in October, with several protesters remaining strapped to a cooling tower at the site for more than a week, the longest such occupation in the UK. During sentencing at Nottingham magistrates court, district judge Leo Pyle said: \"It is right to say that I took into account the conscientious motives of all of you.\" He added: \"What you planned, you executed to perfection.\" The protesters, from the No Dash for Gas group, said they were campaigning against plans for a new generation of gas plants in the UK. They argue these will endanger attempts to curb global warming by reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and will force more households into fuel poverty. One of the activists, Ewa Jasiewicz, who received 150 hours' community service, told the Guardian: \"We feel relieved. This chapter is over now but the action to stop the dash for gas needs to keep going. We are all still committed to climate and social justice.\" A spokesman for EDF Energy said: \"Today's sentencing was solely a matter for the magistrates court. We have invited a range of groups and individuals – including No Dash For Gas – to discuss the company's response to such demonstrations in future.\" He added: \"We share the protesters' commitment to tackling climate change. We are Britain's largest generator of low-carbon electricity.\" Mike Schwartz, a solicitor from Bindmans acting for the defendants, said: \"It was right for the judge not to send them to prison, but the fact remains that protest around urgent climate issues is being tackled with ferocious effort by companies and government. This has to change.\" The prosecution had sought anti-social behaviour orders on six defendants, but this was rejected. \"These people were acting for the best of social motives, not the worst,\" said Schwartz. In March, after a public backlash, EDF abandoned a civil lawsuit seeking £5m in damages from the protesters. An online petition launched by the parents of one of the activists attracted 64,000 signatures, including those of Richard Dawkins, Mark Ruffalo, Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky. Several hundred apparent EDF customers claimed they had switched their energy provider. EDF said it dropped the civil action as part of a settlement with the protesters, who agreed to accept a permanent injunction preventing them from entering EDF sites. Climate campaigners scaled chimneys at Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in 2008, stopped a coal train to Drax power station in 2009, planned to shut down Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired power station in 2009 and disrupted flights at Aberdeen airport in 2009. None have received jail sentences. North Sea gas supplies are in decline and the UK has become a net importer of the fuel as volatile gas prices have led to large increases in the price of energy to households and businesses. The government says gas will be needed to \"keep the lights on\" as many of the UK's ageing coal-fired and nuclear power stations are taken out of service in the next few years. In December, government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said the so-called dash for gas backed by the chancellor, George Osborne, was \"completely incompatible\" with the nation's legally binding carbon emissions targets. Canadian author and activist Naomi Klein said: \"Our governments have been negotiating about the climate crisis for 23 years. In that time, emissions have soared by 54%. Clearly the official, respectable, legal means of dealing with this crisis are not working. That means that what used to be radical is now rational. The people who scaled EDF's smokestacks are not criminals, they're heroes.\" Klein was arrested outside the White House in Washington DC in 2011 while protesting against the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/blog/live/2014/aug/15/markets-end-week-on-a-higher-note-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-15T14:04:01Z","webTitle":"UK economy grows at fastest rate since before the financial crisis - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/15/markets-end-week-on-a-higher-note-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/15/markets-end-week-on-a-higher-note-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK economy grows at fastest rate since before the financial crisis - as it happened","bodyText":"Markets seem totally unfazed by this development.

Thanks, as ever, for all your comments. Graeme Wearden’s back in on Monday and will keep you up to date with all the developments in the eurozone and beyond. Rasmussen confirmed that a “Russian incursion” into Ukraine had occurred overnight, but stopped short of characterising is as an invasion. Reuters reports him saying: Last night we saw a Russian incursion, a crossing of the Ukrainian border. It just confirms the fact that we see a continuous flow of weapons and fighters from Russia into eastern Ukraine and it is a clear demonstration of continued Russian involvement in the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. NATO’s secretary general Anders Rasmussen sees a “high probability” that Russia could intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine, according to Reuters. He says he sees no sign of withdrawal of Russian troops from close to the Ukraine border. James Knightley at ING says the auto data seems “improbably large” and suggests “there may be some seasonal issue relating to retooling of factories going on”. All in all it is a decent outcome which is backed up by the strength seen in the ISM manufacturing report earlier in the month and the fact that the sector has added over 50,000 jobs in the last two months alone. The Empire manufacturing survey, released a little earlier, did fall quite a lot, but this shouldn’t be too concerning given that it really spiked significantly in the past couple of months. The moves were much larger than seen in other regional surveys and even after today’s fall it is still at very levels. US industrial output was driven by a 10.1% jump in auto production, driving the measure to its sixth month of gains. More data out of the US, where industrial output has risen faster than expected. Industrial output was up 0.4% in July, compared with forecasts of a 0.3% rise. June’s output growth was revised up to 0.4%. Reuters is running a headline saying that Finnish president Sauli Niinisto says there is agreement on Russian humanitarian aid delivery between Russia, Ukraine and Red Cross. More on that as it comes... Over to the US, where price inflation remains low. Producer prices inched up 0.1% in July, easing from the 0.4% growth the previous month. The US Labor Department said the “core” gauge of producer prices, excluding the volatile categories of food, energy and trade, rose 0.2% last month. Producer prices rose 1.7% in July from a year earlier, slipping from annual gains of 1.9% in June, 2% in May and 2.1% in April. The PPI report tends to be a signal of future inflation as companies pass their costs along to consumers. The rain in Spain isn’t falling on the olive groves. A drought in the world’s biggest producer of olive oil has prompted fears of widespread shortages. Neena Rai of the WSJ reports: This year’s crop from some Spanish farms could be down 40% from 2013, according to oilseeds forecasting agency Oil World. Very dry weather in the key olive-producing region of Andalusia in May and June ravaged the olive trees during their flowering period, when they need moisture for the fruit to ripen correctly. “The drought in Spain and its impact on the olive market is potentially very significant,” said Lamine Lahouasnia, head of packaged food at Euromonitor International. “If the drought does end up adversely affecting Spanish yields, it is very likely that we’ll see rising consumer prices in 2014.” Shares continue to rally, with markets up at lunchtime on hopes of central bank support.

Germany’s DAX up 0.9% France’s CAC 40 up 1% Spain’s IBEX up up 1% Italy’s FTSE MIB down 0.3% There are always plenty of comments asking how far we can trust the stats. Well, now the Office for National Statistics appears to be questioning its own stats. Last year, the ONS upgraded an experimental measure of inflation, CPIH – which includes housing costs – to the status of a National Statistic. But this week it stripped it of its status, noting that it could be significantly understating inflation. Independent economist Shaun Richards says it is “rather embarrassing” for the statistics authority, in a detailed post on his blog Mindful Money. He notes: The purpose of putting housing costs into an inflation measure is to teach us something that we would not otherwise know. After a credit crunch mostly caused by over-inflated asset prices turning to bust such a measure gives us an opportunity to do better next time around. But the methodology behind the statistic is faulty, as it fails to take proper account of rental prices and therefore tells us nothing at all. NATO has accused Russia of escalating the Ukraine conflict, Reuters reports. NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu told Reuters that the alliance was checking the eyewitness reports in two British newspapers that a column of at least 23 Russian military vehicles had crossed into Ukraine overnight. She said: If confirmed they are further evidence that Russia is doing the very opposite of what it’s saying. Russia has been escalating the conflict, even as it calls for de-escalation. It is high time that Russia did what it says it wants to do, which is to contribute to a peaceful solution. Russia needs to pull back its troops, stop the flow of arms and fighters over the border with Ukraine, stop supporting the separatists and engage in a genuine and sincere dialogue with Ukraine. The UK economy performed better than any other G7 nation in the year to June, notes the Telegraph. Peter Spence writes: Only Canada is yet to report growth for the second quarter, and it appears unlikely that it will knock the UK off the top when it does, on August 29. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker reported last night: The Guardian saw a column of 23 armoured personnel carriers, supported by fuel trucks and other logistics vehicles with official Russian military plates, travelling towards the border near the Russian town of Donetsk – about 200km away from Donetsk, Ukraine. After pausing by the side of the road until nightfall, the convoy crossed into Ukrainian territory, using a rough dirt track and clearly crossing through a gap in a barbed wire fence that demarcates the border. Armed men were visible in the gloom by the border fence as the column moved into Ukraine. Kiev has lost control of its side of the border in this area. Philip Hammond, the UK’s new foreign secretary told reporters at the meeting that he was “alarmed” at reports of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine overnight, saying it could have “very serious consequences”. I’m very alarmed by reports that Russian military vehicles may have corssed the border this morning... If there are any Russian military personnel or vehicles in eastern Ukraine, they need to be withdrawn immediately or the consequences could be very serious. The EU foreign ministers have gathered in Brussels, and no-one appears to be too miserable about having to come back from their holidays. Main topics will be Russian sanctions and aid to Iraq. The Office for National Statistics has been having fun with the most popular baby names last year. Our favourite of the infographics... There were, apparently, 50 girls called Khaleesi and four called Daenerys, writes George Arnett. The debate over quantitative easing in the eurozone has emerged again after yesterday’s data showing growth in the region’s three largest economies had ground to a halt. It looks likely that the ECB will take action soon. Mario Draghi said last week that the ECB had hired a consultant to design an ABS purchase programme (or quantitative easing by any other name), with the expectation of using it but no final decision has been taken. The decision is fraught with difficulties, not least because of Draghi’s previous insistence that monetary policy can only achieve so much and countries must engage in structural reform. Michael Hewson writes: The fact is while QE might be part of a solution, it is not the whole solution and the reluctance of the Germans to countenance it is simply because French and Italian politicians will carry on exactly as before, doing nothing to reform their sclerotic economies. EU authorities would also stand accused of hypocrisy having insisted on painful reforms in Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, but then changing the rules for France and Italy. The UK’s GDP data has failed to stop the pound’s decline. Faster than expected economic growth should bring the prospect of a rate rise closer, but the GDP data only offered partial support to the pound, which looks set to decline against the dollar for the sixth week running. The pound has declined by as much as 1% over the past two days. Reuters reports: With the day’s main focus a raft of US data that could add to the pciture of a solidifying recovery there, traders and analysts said the pound was at risk of another push higher for the dollar. In corporate news, banana firm Chiquita has rejected a takeover bid by Brazil’s Cutrale and Safra groups, saying it is sticking to its plan to merge with European fruit seller Fyffes. The BBC reports: Chiquita said the offer from Brazil was “inadequate” and that it would not hold talks with the groups “at this time”. Fruit juice firm Cutrale and investment bank Safra made a $611m (£363m) bid for US-based Chiquita on Monday. In March Chiquita and Irish fruit group Fyffes agreed to merge. Monday’s offer from the Brazilian businesses sent Chiquita shares 31% higher, while Fyffes fell 15%. Pretty chart from Berenberg Economics The FTSE’s continuing to rise on the back of the buoyant GDP data, up 0.7% at last count, or 46 points at 6731. Paul Hollingsworth at Captial Economics notes that the tweaks to the initial estimates of GDP, show a slightly less balanced economy than first thought. Today’s second GDP estimate confirmed that the economic recovery was strong, but became a little less balanced in the second quarter. Growth in industrial production was revised down from 0.4% to 0.3%, and construction output is now thought to have held steady, where it was previously estimated to have fallen by 0.5%. Meanwhile, output in the services sector is still thought to have risen by a robust 1% in Q2. The strength of the latest retail sales figures and surveys of firms’ investment intentions alongside a still wide trade deficit in Q2 suggest that the economy is still struggling to rebalance towards the external sector. And with this week’s euro-zone GDP figures highlighting the fragility of the recovery there, the UK’s economic recovery seems likely to remain a distinctly domestic-led affair over the second half of this year. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: Today’s figures confirm that our economy has recovered all of the output lost in the Great Recession, and is now bigger than its previous peak in the first quarter of 2008. The government’s long term economic plan is working, with the economy growing at its fastest annual rate in six years. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the realistic assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future. A bit more detail on the UK GDP figures. Yearly growth of 3.2% is the fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2007. It beat analyst expectations that it would remain unchanged from the initial estimate of 3.1%. Services output was up a healthy 1% on the quarter, while industrial output was 0.3% higher. Construction was unchanged. Services has grown 3.6% in the year to June, its fastest growth since February 2008. The economy is now 0.2% bigger than it was at its pre-crisis peak. Britain’s GDP grew at 3.2% in the year to June, the fastest rate of growth since before the financial crisis. The data is the first revision of second quarter GDP data. Growth over the quarter remained unchanged from the initial estimate of 0.8%. Interesting graph showing a troubling (from the EU’s point of view) divergence in industrial production from Europe and the US. Overnight, Japan said it would consider cutting growth forecasts for the full year. Masahiro Hidaka at Bloomberg reports: The Bank of Japan may cut its growth forecast for this fiscal year for a fourth time, as exports fail to bolster an economy weakened by April’s sales-tax increase, according to people familiar with the central bank’s discussions. It said the bank is likely to cut forecasts from 1%, citing unnamed sources. Bloomberg forecasts are for 0.4% growth over the year. Markets have opened higher, as investors bet on more central bank support following miserable economic data. UK’s FTSE 100 up 0.5% or 33 points at 6718 Germany’s DAX up 0.4% France’s CAC 40 up 0.4% Spain’s IBEX up 0.05% Italy’s FTSE MIB down 0.3% EU foreign ministers have interrupted their summer break to meet in Brussels today, to discuss a response to Russia’s food import ban, as well as aid for Iraq. Of the 28 EU foreign ministers, 20 are expected to attend. An EU official said ministers would assess the consequences of possible measures and decide whether to legally challenge Moscow. He also noted that filing a suit to the World Trade Organization is the prerogative of the European Commission, however, the ministers could send out a political signal backing such a move. Ria Novosti (a Russian news service) reports: The EU representative stressed that discussing new sanctions against Russia is not on the agenda. “With regard to a new round of economic sanctions, I think it is a little bit too early at this stage,” he said. Also, the Foreign Affairs Council meeting is to clarify the future of contacts between Brussels and third countries which can potentially replace European states in food exports to Russia. The diplomat said the EU was not going to ask these countries to join the sanctions, but would explain them the reasons for anti-Moscow economic restrictions. The EU has pledged to support farmers hit by the Russian ban on food imports from the West. Euractiv reports: The European Commission, the EU executive, has already announced support for peach and nectarine growers which had already been suffering a price collapse that has since been exacerbated by the Russian ban. In all, EU farm exports to Russia are worth around €11 billion a year, roughly 10% of all EU agricultural sales. Some nations are more affected than others. Poland is suffering from the loss of its biggest apple buyer, and France, the bloc’s leading agricultural economy, is nervous that their own produce will be driven down by the hundreds of thousands of Polish apples Russia does not import. Hungary is heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia and this year signed a €10bn deal with Russian power company Rosatom to expand Hungary’s only nuclear power plant. Prime minister Viktor Orban said today: The EU should not only compensate producers somehow, be they Polish, Slovak, Hungarian or Greek, who now have to suffer losses, but the entire sanctions policy should be reconsidered. His comments came a day after the Slovak prime minister said the sanctions were “meaningless”. Robert Fico said in a news conference yesterday: Why should we jeopardize the EU economy that begins to grow? If there is a crisis situation, it should be solved by other means than meaningless sanctions. Who profits from [the] EU economy decreasing, Russia’s economy having troubles and Ukraine economically on its knees? My colleague Jennifer Rankin would disagree. She argues that Russians will pay the heavier price. The west has banned Russian companies from taking its credit or buying its most advanced technology. Russia, in contrast, has stopped its own people from eating food they enjoy and made their grocery bills more expensive just as the economy teeters on the brink of recession. It is impossible to predict how long this economic war will drag on, but we already know who is paying the biggest price. The prime minister of Hungary Viktor Orban has called for a rethink of sanctions towards Russia. He said in a radio interview: The sanctions policy pursued by the West, that is, ourselves, a necessary consequence of which has been what the Russians are doing, causes more harm to us than to Russia. In politics, this is called shooting oneself in the foot. We’ve got the latest UK GDP data coming out at 9.30am, which should show the Britain faring considerably better than its European counterparts. Second quarter GDP growth is expected to come in unchanged at 0.8% on the quarter, and 3.1% from the second quarter last year, contrasting sharply with this week’s weak European numbers. European markets are expected to open higher, after a slew of poor economic data from the eurozone yesterday. The news got into the territory of ‘so bad it’s good’, as investors started betting on more central bank support. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets writes: With prices falling sharply across the euro area, the siren calls for the European Central Bank to do more are starting to become deafening. With these calls for full blown QE getting louder and louder it would appear that markets are betting that Germany and the Bundesbank will ultimately bend to the will of the crowd, hence yesterday’s drift higher. Shares in Asia closed the week up. The FTSE Asia Pacific Index has gained 2.7%, rebounding from last week’s 2.4% tumble. The geopolitical tensions that got investors so worried last week have certainly not gone away, but the feeling is that poor economic data have overtaken those concerns. Patrick McGee at the FT writes: Evan Lucas, strategist at IG, suggested investors were refocusing their attention away from geopolitical risks and back to central bank policy, after weak US retail sales and downbeat gross domestic product reports across the eurozone highlighted that low interest rates would continue to support markets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jun/27/fracking-energy-futures","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-27T21:53:17Z","webTitle":"Fracking: energy futures | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/27/fracking-energy-futures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/27/fracking-energy-futures","fields":{"headline":"Fracking: energy futures","bodyText":"It is the kind of bonus politicians can usually only dream of: a source of energy capable of reliably providing decades of low-cost, relatively low-emission gas. But yesterday's much trailed report from the British Geological Survey suggesting unexpectedly large deposits of shale gas seems – especially to Conservatives who hate renewables – to hold out the promise of a golden future of long-term cheap fuel for domestic and industrial consumers. Much like the one the US is already beginning to enjoy, as cheap natural gas from fracking drives down energy prices and drives out coal. Energy security would be a reality. Industries such as chemicals could confidently plan for expansion. Hi-tech jobs would proliferate. Foreign policy would be liberated from the constraint of energy diplomacy. And the balance of power in the tricky negotiations with EDF over the precise terms on which they will build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley would be tipped in favour of the government. All this as fossil fuel imports reach their highest levels since records began in 1990, and with Ofgem warning that the UK's power safety net of surplus capacity will soon be at a dangerously low 2%. According to the BGS, beneath the Blackpool rock in the Bowland basin there could be 1,300tn cubic feet of shale gas, far more than previously estimated. Even if, as current knowledge suggests, only 15% of it could be extracted, that is still enough to guarantee supply for a generation. And that is only one field in one area; there are shale gas deposits stretching in a fat belt from Lancashire and Yorkshire across the Midlands to most of southern England. In an indication of the new confidence in fracking futures, earlier this month British Gas's parent company, Centrica, bought into Cuadrilla, the only company that has so far done any experimental drilling. Other big suppliers are expected to follow. Energy policy is always contentious territory, and the battle lines are already clear between those who would go for growth and others who prefer environmental caution. Tory ministers, led by the chancellor and the energy minister, Michael Fallon, are talking up the dash for gas. They propose tax breaks and less stringent planning controls, including a £100,000 bounty for local communities to encourage them to accept shale oil development: compare that with tighter planning and a mere £5,000 windfarm bonus. Even so, it is seems unlikely that the largely rural, and Tory, communities that are so hostile to renewable development will warm to the development of a shale gas field in their backyards. The process of fracking is plainly not a cost-free option. Breaking up gas-bearing rock thousands of metres below the Earth's surface by pumping in a mix of sand, water and chemicals under high pressure is a process still in development, and quite apart from the unavoidable threat of industrialising stretches of some of Britain's most beautiful countryside, there are serious questions over its environmental safety. Exploration in Lancashire was halted in 2011 after two small earthquakes, and in the US pollution of the water table and unintended methane gas leaks have both provoked critics. Nor is there any certainty about the future viability of British reserves. As the BGS survey concluded yesterday, it is not clear that they can be exploited commercially, let alone how great a contribution they could make to the energy supply mix. So there may be scope for optimism, but it must be judged on the evidence, and it must not be at the expense of low-carbon objectives. Yesterday, the energy secretary, Ed Davey, spoke for the environmental wing of the coalition when he offered revived support for green initiatives, including guarantees for loans to the nuclear industry to help the Hinkley negotiations, set subsidy levels for renewables, and introduced a (small) borrowing facility for the green bank. But the much vaunted green deal for energy efficiency is a long way from proving itself. An energy revolution may, possibly, be at hand. But no one should count on it. • This article was amended on 9 July 2013 to correct the BGS's estimate of the the shale gas resource in the Bowland basin. Its figure was 1,300, not 13,000, trillion cubic feet. A description of the process of fracking, which said sand, water and hydrogen were pumped in at high pressure, was also corrected. Sand and water are used, but not hydrogen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/02/previous-attempts-iran-nuclear-programme","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-02T15:23:57Z","webTitle":"The west's previous attempts to derail Iran's nuclear programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/previous-attempts-iran-nuclear-programme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/02/previous-attempts-iran-nuclear-programme","fields":{"headline":"The west's previous attempts to derail Iran's nuclear programme","bodyText":"For many years US, British, German and Israeli intelligence agencies are said to have helped to supply Iran with faulty parts designed to self-destruct and cause damage to surrounding equipment.

In January 2010 a particle physicist, Masoud Ali Mohammadi, was killed by a remote-controlled bomb strapped to a motorcycle as he was leaving his Tehran home on his way to work. In November last year Majid Shahriar, of the nuclear engineering faculty at the Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, was killed by a bomb stuck to the side of his car by an assassin on a motorbike. On the same day Fereidoun Abbasi-Davani, a nuclear physicist suspected in the west of involvement in nuclear weapons development, was injured in a similar attack. Three months later he was made head of the Iranian nuclear effort. In July a university physicist, Darioush Rezaie, was shot dead by a gunman on a motorbike in an eastern Tehran street. In 2010 a computer worm called Stuxnet infected operating systems at the Natanz enrichment plant, making large numbers of centrifuges crash and causing the temporary suspension of enrichment work in November that year. Enrichment restarted a few days later and Iran has made up the backlog in production, although its centrifuges have appeared to be less efficient since the Stuxnet attack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/may/15/griff-rhys-jones-live-solar-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-15T14:52:00Z","webTitle":"Griff Rhys-Jones ignores the fact that someone has to live near solar farms | Jeremy Leggett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/may/15/griff-rhys-jones-live-solar-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/may/15/griff-rhys-jones-live-solar-farms","fields":{"headline":"Griff Rhys-Jones ignores the fact that someone has to live near solar farms","bodyText":"In opposing a solar farm near his home in Suffolk, Griff Rhys-Jones makes the point that the government is struggling with its energy policy, and has made a \"willy nilly\" decision to allow such developments. I feel like saying to Griff, look we need lots of solar, and it's got to be near someone. The government is indeed struggling with its energy policy. So are most if not all other governments. Many countries live with the threat of their lights going out. All countries live with the threat of unchecked climate change. For we are en route both to recurrent energy crisis and to six degrees of global warming, unless we accelerate the deployment of low carbon technologies like solar. One of the reasons governments are struggling so badly is that there are no free lunches with energy. All forms of energy have downsides, somewhere. All of them have their opponents, as well as their supporters. We know that the lights will start going out in Britain in 2016, unless new electricity generation comes onstream. It can't be coal. That much most of us agree on, if not because of the emissions, then because the EU has already made the decision, in its Large Combustion Plants Directive and other climate commitments. Could it be gas? In principle yes. But increasingly we'd have to rely on overseas favour, because anyone outside the Treasury who knows what happens in a Texan shale-gas fracking operation knows in their hearts that – whatever we might feel about the desirability of gas – there would be civil war in rural England if there are attempts to produce it on land at any scale here. So maybe nuclear. But even if you could tolerate a nuclear power plant or two in Suffolk, just check the builders' track record in recent years, and how much taxpayers' money would be needed to underwrite their ten-year – if they are lucky – build cycle. That leaves renewable energy. Wind has largely been driven offshore in the UK, unlike Germany. A marked minority in the population is succeeding, in that regard, in imposing their preferences on a consistent majority, so polls on the issue tell us. So what are we left with? Solar. That's it. Biomass and marine renewables are in their infancy in the UK still, long held back by the conventional-energy incumbency. Hydro power has limited additional potential. I have said that all forms of energy have their downsides. Solar's are that it doesn't work at night, and yes, can be a bit on eyesore if you don't like blue or black marble. But solar sits low to the ground, can be surrounded by hedges and screened from view, can be mixed-use land with sheep grazing, plants growing, biodiversity thriving between the rows of panels. Most forms of energy also have upsides, and in the case of solar, these greatly outweigh the downsides. They start with the fact that solar is set on becoming the cheapest option, within a few years. Many analysts forecast that solar electricity will cost less than any other form in multiple countries by 2015, or not long thereafter. It works really well when mixed in strategic harness with otherforms of renewable energy, as experience in Germany is showing. And it offers hope, amid all the gloom about the future. Griff should visit one of the hundreds of solar schools around the country, and talk to the kids about it. He should check out what solar can do for developing countries, where it is way cheaper than extending the grids, and as such is often the only option. The more solar we do in cloudy Britain, the easier it becomes for developing countries – often sunny places – to believe it can work for them, and not replicate the same mistakes we have made with conventional energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/jun/04/hugh-muirs-diary-margaret-thatcher","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-04T22:00:01Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary: A room with a view.

Examining the letters sent by Ukip leader Nigel Farage and the Tory man, Martin Callanan, it appears that Ukip got in first, submitting its request to European parliament president Martin Shultz on 25 April. The Tory request was sent almost a month later. We claim her, said Farage. \"The change of name is important for our group and for the European parliament,\" because it will show that \"a political leader can actually make and implement decisions which can change the fate of a country and influence the history of Europe.\" We claim her, said Callanan. \"She was, of course, an iconic figure in the politics of my own country as well as being one of the most influential figures to have emerged in European politics in the latter part of the 20th century.\" They're in a right old fix, and it's causing much amusement because usually these requests are nodded through – but then usually there is no hint of competition. With rivals squaring up, how will the parliament make a decision – on the basis of who asked first, or which of them has the most logical claim, which must suggest the Tories? If we are really going to be Thatcherite about this, shouldn't they flog her name to the highest bidder? • A difficult time for the Greens who, having seized the reins of power in Brighton, find that life looks different without the rose-tinted, recycled spectacles. Brighton, where the party holds municipal sway, has been a troubled place of late, with turbulence mainly caused by the administration's attempt to cut the pay of those who empty bins. As a result, many bins went unemptied, a boon for the rats and a downer for the local populace. Will there be order and tranquillity from now on? No one really knows. And so it can only be prudent that, despite their love affair with Brighton, the Greens may be likely to hold their national party conference somewhere else. Somewhere that will allow proceedings to occur without the backdrop of embarrassing worker protest. \"Please do not book accommodation or travel for Brighton until further notice,\" members are warned by email. No alternative city as yet. But at a guess, it will be a place without bin bags in the street. • Caroline Lucus, pioneering Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, co-authored the email, and she has also been busy in the mother of parliaments. Some great speakers quote Goethe or Thomas Paine or Kierkegaard. At Westminster they aim less high. Is the minister \"not acting rather like Humpty Dumpty in Through the Looking Glass, in that he is making words mean what he wants them to mean?\" asked Lucas, in a debate on nuclear power. Meanwhile in the other place, Lord Dear, scourge of gay marriage legislation, sauntered through his peroration, also aided by Lewis Carroll. He read peers a nice chunk and concluded: \"As Humpty Dumpty might have said: 'There's a nice knock-down argument for you. Marriage means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less'.\" Still, it beats quoting Churchill. • Fancy a coffee? Plenty of choice, but we can't go to Starbucks, can we?

This post is an attempt to answer her. If you scream \"I totally heart science, the Royal Society has teh awesomist mindz ev-er, you cannot dispute their pure and good genius\" in one breath before voicing suspicion at these strange, corrupt and elitist would-be-wizards in pay of big pharma/ag/oil/ [insert your own bogey-man] in another, then yes, you are being a bit silly. But such silliness is pretty rare. Moreover, I'm not sure we should expect a homogeneous response to something as diverse as science. When people use the term \"anti-science\", I want to know what definition of science they've based their concept of anti on. Who'd be simplistic enough to be \"pro\" the whole of science? What sort of shallow, shampoo advert \"science bit\" approach to the complexities of modernity are they living by? This crude term \"anti-science\" is not only facile, it is all too often applied to close down debate. To steal a great line from Jack Stilgoe, it's \"a privatisation of the idea of progress\". It's terribly convenient, for example, for UK environment secretary Owen Paterson to use the anti-GM stance of many greens as a sign the movement is somehow largely wrong-headed on the whole of science, because it weakens their arguments with him over climate and energy issues, when really they are quite different issues. It's also a lot easier for the GM lobby to play a game of \"you are wrong on science\" rather than acknowledging that the bulk of the critique against them is economic and political. Similar points could be made for nuclear power, and even climate change, where sceptics are easily laughed off as not getting the science when all the time they are shouting economics. Fracking is a good example, as dissenters are dismissed as wrong about geological risks, somehow brushing questions of climate change and the energy market under the carpet in the process (eg last year's Royal Society report). Green campaigners sometimes play into this. The idea that they are simply about the science can be an attractive allusion. As Mike Hulme argued in 2009, for all the Climate Campers claimed to be \"armed only with peer-reviewed science\", they were armed with a much larger vision of the future which connected science to a range of ethical, economic and political points. Why hide that? I've seen people utilise \"it's the economy stupid\" to avoid discussing particular dimensions of environmental policy, too, though. Science isn't the only rhetorical trump card in the deck. At this point, it might be tempting to rally against any attempts to close down debate; to celebrate the importance of constant scepticism, doubt and open debate as the lifeblood of science. Except doubt has a politics to it too, and attempts to keep debate open can be as disingenuously applied as the idea of \"anti-science\". As Naomi Oreskes and Eric Conway argue in their seminal 2010 book Merchants of Doubt (if you haven't read it, do) a small number of scientists found ways to manipulate the uncertainty inherent in any scientific question as a way to disrupt or simply delay a range of health and environmental policy decisions which they (or their funders) found politically and economically uncomfortable. Doubt can be dangerous. In his review of Merchants of Doubt (Nature paywall), Brian Wynne argues Oreskes and Conway's thesis is incomplete. They fail to examine those areas of politically sensitive science and technology where doubt is routinely downplayed, rather than amplified. I have some sympathy with this analysis, but I don't think a \"complete\" book on the ways science is used in society is possible. It's just too variable. There are very different social and scientific contexts at work in GM and in climate change. Just as we shouldn't let the way certainty was overstated in BSE frame MMR, we'd do well to appreciate that the complex philosophies, communities and politics of scepticism work differently in different debates. Doubt's just different in different areas of science, for different reasons, interacting with different political, ethical and economic networks. None of this is to deny that many people – green, red, blue or other – are regularly wrong about some area of science or another. Neither is it to ignore large social and cultural gaps between science and political activists which can lead to systemic and repeated problems. If you see a problem, call it. But call the specific problem, not some loose idea of \"science\". If you want to be clever about science, ask for evidence about particular claims and be prepared to change your mind when the evidence changes. Ask questions about this evidence too, including what's missing, what the doubts are, and whom all of this serves.

Then a loud groan reverberated around the hall as the damning number of 4.7% flashed up, dashing the party's hopes of remaining in government. Shock was mixed with deep disappointment as the gathered liberals – until Sunday junior coalition partners in Angela Merkel's government – huddled in silence and contemplated the worst result in the party's 65-year history. The outcome of the election was shaped by the disappointing results of all of the smaller parties, but the biggest upset of the night was the FDP's apparent failure to reach the 5% threshold necessary to enter parliament. The party, founded in 1948, has long been seen as one of the forces underpinning postwar German politics. It had been in coalition with Merkel's conservatives since 2009, and throughout the election, the chancellor had made it clear she hoped to continue in government with the FDP, which has held the balance of power in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, for most of the Federal Republic's history. But voters were not convinced enough by the pro-business grouping to ensure it remained in power. Initial results showed it had seen a 10% drop in its support since 2009. Rainer Brüderle, its chief candidate, flanked by Germany's vice-chancellor Philip Rösler, did not attempt to hide his disappointment. \"This is a difficult evening … It's clearly the worst result we've ever had as the FDP … and I take responsibility as the main candidate,\" he said, addressing the party faithful. He added the faintly conciliatory note that the FDP \"is not a spent force\", and would continue as a party. By mid-evening, both Brüderle and Rösler had offered their resignations. But there was widespread consensus last night that the FDP had only itself to blame, having turned increasingly in recent years from a party of the centre to the centre right interested primarily in liberal economics rather than social justice. Its position had already been in grave doubt after it failed by a considerable margin to enter the Bavarian assembly in last Sunday's state election. Its call for CDU voters to give their second votes to the FDP had irked the CDU leadership, who feared a repeat of the scenario in January when the CDU narrowly lost the state election in Lower Saxony based on the number of second votes that its members had \"lent\" the FDP. The wildcard of the election, the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), stood at a tantalising 4.9%, leaving its members desperately hoping that it would claw the missing 0.1% needed for it to enter parliament and reshape Germany's political landscape as the first anti-euro party in the Bundestag.As the first exit polls flashed up at the party's post-election gathering at a hotel in central Berlin last night, one man in the crowd pulled a black, red and gold flag out of his trouser pocket and leapt in the air. But when he realised his party was still 0.1 percentage points away from being able to enter parliament, the flag quickly disappeared. The seven-month-old party remains confident that its time will come. The party's founder, economist Bernd Luck, told supporters: \"We have already changed this country. If it stays at 4.9% it is a still a great success. We have given the other parties a real scare.\" Several in the room willingly admitted they felt an affinity with Britain's Ukip. One, a disillusioned FDP voter who declined to give his name, said he had turned to the AfD because he believed Germany's seeming success was an illusion. \"Germany is like a house that is about to be battered by a thunderstorm,\" he said. \"The tiles on the facade are already dropping off – it won't be long until our feeble foundations start breaking\". Frauke Petry, an AfD spokeswoman said the secret of the party's success lay in the fact that it had addressed issues that other parties had tried to ignore. \"We have to rethink the euro crisis. We have to allow weaker countries like Greece and Spain and Portugal to leave the euro and rebuild their economies and then maybe return. We don't think we should pay for debts that have been accumulated by these countries,\" she told the Guardian. Over at the gathering of Die Linke – the leftwing party made up of the remnants of the former East German Communist party, West German socialists and former SPD members disgruntled with their party's move to the centre – celebrations were in full swing, despite a drop in support of around 3%, as the party enjoyed its apparent emergence as the third strongest force in German politics for the first time in its history, narrowly overtaking the Green party. Initial polls suggested it had secured just over 8% of the vote, a fraction of a percentage point more than the Greens. Gregor Gysi, its leader, who had repeatedly stated his willingness to enter a coalition with the SPD and Greens despite those parties' refusal to work with it, told party members in Berlin he was delighted with the result. \"Who would have thought in 1990 that this party would become the third strongest force in the Bundestag,\" he said. The Greens, who had become a model for other environmental parties in Europe, were licking their wounds after a disappointing performance – well short of their record 10.7% result in 2009. The party appeared to be polling at just over 8%, with one of its two main candidates, Katrin Göring-Eckhardt, admitting the party had to \"rethink\" its place in society. \"We need to have a very honest and clear look at how we can win the centre of society over to our ecological way of thinking,\" she said to supporters. \"It will be a difficult time for us, but together we'll manage to get out of this hole\". Alongside longer-term criticism that the party has become a haven for the bourgeois and had lost its campaigning edge, analysts pointed to their poor election campaign, in which policy proposals such as tax rises and a Veggie Day to be introduced in public canteens went down badly. A scandal over its support of paedophilia in the 1980s, plus the fact that much of its pro-environmental thunder was stolen by Angela Merkel's decision to abandon nuclear power following the Fukishima disaster, meant that the party, which was founded in 1980, was left floundering and unable to set the agenda. • This article was amended on 24 September 2013. An earlier version referred to the FDP's 75-year history. That should have been 65-year history. As the text makes clear elsewhere in the article, the party was founded in 1948, not 1938."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2013/aug/30/fracking-climate-change-fossil-fuels-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-30T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Fracking  brings climate debate closer to home | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2013/aug/30/fracking-climate-change-fossil-fuels-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2013/aug/30/fracking-climate-change-fossil-fuels-debate","fields":{"headline":"Fracking  brings climate debate closer to home","bodyText":"Many of those who deny that climate change is taking place reached that position as a result of their opposition to windfarms. This, for example, was the route taken by David Bellamy, who stumbled disastrously into the debate a decade ago. During one of our discussions, he set me the following challenge: \"Why are the so-called greens backing a cartel of multinational companies which are hell bent on covering some of the best of our countryside with so-called windfarms, which can neither provide us with a sustainable source of future energy nor have any measurable effect reducing the amount of carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere? If he [George Monbiot] can disprove the latter – which is the mathematical truth – I will fall into line over global warming\". In other words, if I could disprove his contention that windfarms are useless, he would accept climate change science. I don't mean to disinter an ancient and long-settled debate, but to use this as an example of a common phenomenon, to which all of us succumb from time to time. When we don't like an outcome, we reject the premise. Some of those who oppose an airstrike on Syria, for example, are more inclined to question the premise that Bashar Al-Assad ordered a chemical weapons strike against his own people. Those who support the intervention are more likely to disregard calls for hard evidence. Once the UK government decided that it would instigate a badger cull, it began dismissing or downplaying the results of the £49m trial commissioned by its predecessor, which showed that the cull is likely to be useless or worse than useless. Those who oppose the cull, on the other hand, are more inclined than its supporters to reject the evidence that badgers are a source of bovine tuberculosis. In other words, we reason backwards. It's a constant temptation, to which none of us is immune. It explains, I believe, much of the refusal to accept the overwhelming evidence for manmade global warming. For people who reject regulation or other restraints on profit-making, or who believe they have a fundamental right to use as much fossil fuel as they wish while driving or flying or heating their swimming pools, or who hate the thought of wind turbines spoiling their view, the temptation to reject the science seems overwhelming. Conversely, those of us who lament the ever-escalating pace of life, who love peace and quiet, who hate the damage done to the natural world by the extraction of fossil fuels, who believe society has become too materialistic and self-serving, are inclined to embrace the science with fervour. Doing so does not necessarily make us more scientific or more rational than our opponents: it's just that in this case the weight of evidence happens to accord with our values and beliefs. In other cases, the same instincts are just as likely to estrange us from the evidence (our wildly exaggerated fear of radiation from nuclear power plants comes to mind, but I'll leave that for another occasion). Accidents of history and geology have ensured that, in the UK and many other parts of the world, our backwards reasoning has made people disinclined to accept the science of manmade climate change. The problem can be summarised as follows: most of our means of generating power seldom intrude into people's consciousness. Thermal power stations are highly concentrated sources of electricity, which means that few people have to live close to them and suffer from the visual intrusion and local pollution they cause. Most of our gas and oil is either imported from far away or extracted from under the seabed, through rigs situated beyond the horizon. Opencast coal mines are mostly dug close to former mining communities, whose people tend to have little political power and little access to the media. So they are seldom the subject of major campaigns, and are largely ignored by most of the public. This was the basis of my old argument with the Campaign to Protect Rural England, and the, er, electric encounter with its chief executive that the Guardian filmed. CPRE was campaigning fiercely against wind farms, but not against opencast coal mines. Since then, I'm glad to say, CPRE has amended its policy, and is now campaigning against opencast coal. In other words, fossil fuels seldom bother us, so we seldom consider their wider impacts. Wind turbines, on the other hand, are widely distributed, close to home and highly visible. They intrude upon the views of rich and poor alike: both unemployed miners and Telegraph leader writers. Many people don't like them, and follow the irrational evolution of thought to which David Bellamy succumbed, rejecting climate science because they don't like low carbon energy. So perhaps we should thank the fracking companies for bringing fossil fuel infrastructure to people's doorsteps. If people's dislike of low-carbon power production drives them to reject climate science, their dislike of high-carbon power production could drive them to accept it. For the first time in decades, prosperous, well-connected people in this country are having to face the reality of fossil fuel extraction, and they don't like it one bit. Some of us have long been arguing that oil, coal and gas do far more harm at every stage of production than most forms of renewable energy. Now the fracking companies have obligingly chosen to demonstrate it. I suspect that as fracking - and its attendant protests - spreads, we'll see a renewed surge of concern about global warming. After all, climate change is the most powerful of the many arguments that can be deployed against fossil fuels, and those who oppose their extraction would be foolish not to use it. As fracking companies move into the leafy suburbs, the well-preserved villages, the haunts of Conservative voters and Telegraph columnists, I think we might see the manufactured debate on global warming subtly shifting. Embracing junk science and promoting the claims of cranks and fossil fuel lobbyists will start to look a lot less clever, and will begin to be more fiercely challenged by constituents and readers. And perhaps, as a result, this country might begin to take its responsibilities more seriously."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2013/jun/17/clinical-social-network-transforms-patient-care","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-17T07:31:00Z","webTitle":"Can a clinical social network be the solution to transforming patient care?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/jun/17/clinical-social-network-transforms-patient-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2013/jun/17/clinical-social-network-transforms-patient-care","fields":{"headline":"Can a clinical social network be the solution to transforming patient care?","bodyText":"The DocCom idea was born when we were two young trainee surgeons frustrated by the ineffective communications that restricted our ability to make a difference. We saw that communication processes were broken in the NHS. We felt that a clinical social network with Facebook-like capabilities could be the solution that truly transformed patient care within UK hospitals. You have to have worked in healthcare to understand how archaic the systems are. Technology that is commonplace in most people's lives is absent in healthcare. Bleeps, pagers and fax machines are still used for communicating vital information. These technologies are outdated and unreliable, yet they are still relied upon by busy, highly mobile clinical staff. This communication is not just inefficient – it's fundamentally unsafe. Any delay in information leads to delayed treatment which can, in turn, lead to a worse patient outcome and then require longer and more costly treatment. Healthcare is a sensitive environment, where the ability to react quickly to a patient's changing situation can mean the difference between life and death. To give a clinical example, automatically alerting doctors when patients show signs of deteriorating kidney function can prompt cheap, simple, effective treatment that can prevent acute renal failure and long-term kidney damage. Despite this, vital information still currently sits in a computer system, waiting for a busy professional to check it. Only when a patient's condition deteriorates will a clinician be paged. At the very least, proactive detection and automatic alerts would mean a shorter length of hospital stay which, of course, saves valuable resources. Communication failures such as these would simply be unacceptable in other high-risk industries such as nuclear power, the military or aviation. These industries have transformed their services through the provision of real-time information and robust communication tracking. We know this improvement is also possible for healthcare, and an essential change if we are to avoid more tragedies such as those reported at Mid Staffs. Driven by this vision to make healthcare safer we have built networking software that includes some of the best aspects of social media but caters specifically to the unique privacy and security requirements of healthcare. The DocCom system is like Facebook, and enables clinicians to find colleagues, connect, collaborate, and share information securely. The privacy of networks is protected by identity, validation and authentication checks for users. Once registered, users are then able to use a smartphone app for secure messaging in place of texts which are unofficially being used in hospitals, but are inappropriate for the transmission of patient information. With a DocCom network in place, hospitals have the communication in place to link people up with virtually any type of clinical or operational information. Although we have built a world-class system in terms of its security and functionality, communication is not just about the technology. We know that healthcare is being forced to employ vast numbers of people who spend much of their time chasing up information to compensate for a lack of intelligent automation. DocCom's vision is that rather than relying on people to chase results, the information itself needs to drive clinicians' behaviour. To do this, we have created a Clinical Alerts &amp; Responses Extended via Social Media project, a communication system that can enable secure, virtual collaboration, and that can then track read and receipt of messages. Our funding award of £207,000 from the UK's Technology Strategy Board allows us to accelerate the rollout of the CARES project, and partner with a hospital to link up vital clinical information flow. It means that for the first time, clinicians will be able to have critical information sent securely to their smartphone, allowing more informed decision-making and better care for patients. The communication possibilities are endless, but our next project will probably see DocCom facilitating collaboration in mobile multi-disciplinary teams who work outside of the hospital setting. What is driving us is the genuine need and desire across healthcare teams for real-time and actionable clinical information.

Does that mean I'm becoming more rightwing? | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/13/older-more-rightwing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/13/older-more-rightwing","fields":{"headline":"I'm getting older. So am I becoming more rightwing?","bodyText":"How do you know you've turned 40? According to the veteran comedian Jackie Mason, it's when you bend down to tie your shoelaces and think, \"What else can I do while I'm down here?\" When I first heard that gag, I only half got it. Now that I'm deep into my forties, and bending down is no longer, shall we say, effortless, I really get it. But what are the other tell-tale signs of getting older? There's the greying at the temples, not knowing what song is No 1, and, politically, the steady drift rightward. That last one is not controversial, is it? After all, to quote the aphorism regularly, andwrongly, attributed to Churchill, \"If a man is not a socialist by the time he is 20, he has no heart. If he is not a conservative by the time he is 40, he has no brain.\" Evidence of this hoary wisdom appeared to come with this week's publication of the British Social Attitudes survey. The standout finding was that Britain had changed its collective mind on homosexuality since the first such study in 1983. Back then, 50% regarded same-sex relationships as \"always wrong\". Now that figure is down to 22%. The hold-outs were the old. Among those born in the 1940s, 46% still thought homosexuality was wrong; only 18% of those born in the 80s said the same. Indeed, when pressed to explain the overall shift, researchers explained that it wasn't so much that individual Britons were softening their previous hostility to gay people. Rather, those older people who had been implacably hostile were, to put it baldly, dying out – replaced by youngsters who were more tolerant. It's the same picture on, say, women working outside the home – broadly accepted by most, still difficult for many over-65s. But it also fits with the archetypal image we have of the old – regularly reinforced by popular culture – as grumpy, stubborn and a little bit bigoted. This, we presume, is just how it is – an organic part of the ageing process, as inevitable as wrinkles. But it's not quite like that. Talk to those who study these patterns and they'll explain that it's not the fact that people are in their late 60s or 70s that gives them these attitudes, but rather the specific period in which they were raised. On gay rights, many of today's senior citizens were shaped in a climate that saw homosexuals as deviants and criminals: for many, those views have simply stuck. It's not as if they were once tolerant and have hardened their hearts as they've grown older. Equally, there's no reason to believe that today's twentysomethings will become anti-gay as they age. On the contrary, the data suggests the attitudes forged now will be theirs for life. Viewed like this, what matters is not someone's age so much as what Rick Nye, director of the Populus polling company, calls the \"consciousness-defining events that happen when you're at your most porous\". For the oldest Britons, that was the war. As that generation dies out, so too do many of its values. (To take one example: pollsters have noticed a steady disappearance of the old Edward Heath brand of pro-Europeanism, formed among those who had witnessed a European war close-up and did not want to see another one.) For the baby boomers, the formative experience was the 1960s, leaving a legacy of permissiveness that endures to this day. They may now be knocking 70, but they still have liberal attitudes. In an intriguing aside, Glasgow University's professor Patrick O'Donnell says that, though many boomers have given up on the drink and drugs, they have not abandoned the sexual mores of their youth: clinics now report a rise in sexually transmitted diseases among the over-70s. \"That had never been a problem before,\" he says. This pattern – of generations shaped by epochal events – shows itself often. Who has misgivings about nuclear power? Not the old or the young, but those in between who came of age at the height of the \"No Thanks\" campaigns. Who remains sceptical about collectivist, non-market ways of organising society? Those whose worldview was formed as the Berlin Wall came down and who saw trade unions crushed at home. The Iraq war has, it seems, convinced a generation to recoil from armed intervention abroad, especially in the Middle East. The evidence suggests such beliefs remain all but fixed for that generation – and influence the generations that follow. By this logic, it would be perfectly possible for the old to stand to the left of the young. Indeed, the Social Attitudes survey found more sympathy among the over-65s for government redistribution of income than among any other group. But it's not the whole story. There are some political changes that do indeed come upon us as we grow older, no matter when we were born. Just as new parents suddenly find themselves interested in the previously tedious topics of childcare and education, so older voters start thinking about, say, pensions. That, though, can cut both left and right, as seniors demand both state payouts and a strong stock market to buoy their private retirement plans. More deeply, those who have been around longer find they have more to protect. And that can become a conservative impulse. Peter Kellner, president of YouGov, believes it is \"attitudes to risk and fears of uncertainty\" that change most: people become more cautious as they get older. That's one reason why reform of public services used heavily by the elderly becomes so politically radioactive. But it also sheds light on, for example, the striking age profile of Ukip, which skews towards the old. Plenty of Britons are unsettled by our changing society, whether by immigration or new technology, but, says Kellner, \"There's a fear of the modern world which is more intense among older people.\" That fear doesn't grip everyone with years on the clock. Those who have money and options, who feel life is still ahead of them and their race not yet run, can handle change; they can afford it. Those who are on a fixed income, watching their savings dwindle, for whom life has become no more than managing decline – who would blame them for becoming defensive, holding on to what they have and what they know? Viewed like this, it's wealth, not age, that's decisive. Either way, conservatism is not like grey hair – an inevitable part of the ageing process. It depends on when you came of age, how you saw the world and how life treated you. That's worth remembering. For it means the decisions we take now, shaping the young who witness them, will live on long into the future – long after we've gone.

It was inevitable, then, that the earthquake in Japan would trigger yet more debate over Germany's nuclear future. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Stuttgart this weekend to protest against Angela Merkel's plans to extend the life of 17 German nuclear plants for an average 12 extra years – an event given extra bite following the crisis in Fukushima. After the demonstration, the chancellor appeared on TV to reassure voters that Germany's power stations are safe. \"The events in Japan are a critical moment for the world,\" said Merkel on Saturday evening in Berlin. \"Germany can't just carry on as if nothing has happened,\" she conceded, ordering immediate safety checks in all nuclear power stations. Merkel has had a terrible year so far, having lost her most popular minister in a plagiarism scandal and seen support for her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party halve in the Hamburg regional elections last month. Increased public anxiety over nuclear power is bad news for the CDU, which is facing a rough ride in four further regional elections this month. The party is still forecast to win next Sunday in the former east German state of Saxony-Anhalt, but pollsters predict a swing to the left as nuclear-fearing voters switch to the Greens or the Social Democrats (SPD). In that pocket of Germany, the real fight is between the far left and right. To the horror of many observers, the radical rightwing NPD is likely to get enough votes to send representatives to the regional parliament for the first time, while the Left party, popular with sympathisers of the old GDR regime, is looking at increasing its share of the vote to 25%. The NPD is accused of leading an openly racist campaign, handing out scaremongering leaflets warning that the state is at risk of being \"flooded\" with Eastern European immigrants. Its latest advert features a teary wife waving goodbye to her husband as he is forced to seek work in the West, with the regional NPD leader Matthias Heyder promising to \"stop the invasion\" and give local jobs to local people. In the south of Germany, politicians from the CDU's sister party the CSU are also grappling with a question of whether to let a foreigner in – this time a Turkish-born Muslim who wants to join the Christian party. Mesut Karaüzüm, who is chairman of a mosque in Landshut, 47 miles (75km) north-east of Munich, has applied for CSU membership, despite the party's new defence minister recently declaring that Islam \"doesn't belong\" in Germany. The Turk says he shares the party's views on family, community spirit and tradition. The head of Landhut's CSU party told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Saturday that he was \"stunned\" to receive Karaüzüm's membership application. On April 2 the board will decide whether to admit him. While Bavaria grapples with religious cross-pollination, German commentators are trying to make sense of a BBC poll last week which voted Germany the world's most respected nation. The World Service asked almost 29,000 people worldwide to rate the positive and negative influence of 16 leading countries and Germany came out top, with 62% of respondents rating its influence as positive. \"It's an astonishing result that no one would have predicted, least of all Germans themselves\", wrote Henryk M Broder in Die Welt Am Sonntag. \"The news that they are liked is perplexing and hard to believe,\" he said. What happened to the old image of the \"nasty German familiar from books and films?\" he asked. Many people will miss being the baddies, suggests Broder. \"Was not it an adventure to go to Holland, where your tyres were slashed regularly? Wasn't it great fun to put towels on sunbeds at 6am?\" All this is in the past, he says. Today: \"We are the Pope. We have won people's hearts.

You and your subjective journal have no right to supply me the news any more than you have the right to tell me to skim or slow-think. The real point is desire for continued learning and freedom to learn, not flogging your rag. Thomas Wimber Rome, Italy • Concerning Rolf Dobelli's comments on ignoring all news media: in his defence I think it is appropriate to quote Ludwig Wittgenstein: \"Do not become dependent upon the external world because then you will have no fear of what happens to it.\" John G Woods Helsingborg, Sweden Focus on the science Carol Binnie's letter regarding GM crops (Reply, 26 April) exemplifies the attitude that had turned me off all the major green organisations (Greenpeace and the UK Green party, for example). There is a mixing of arguments – she asks where the scientific evidence is, and immediately deviates to matters of corporate monopoly. The argument for or against GM crops - or, indeed, nuclear power - should be about the science of their effectiveness, or lack thereof. Not the actions of multinational corporations and desperate government policy. The issues should be kept separate - I am pro-GM if it is properly regulated and not subject to an effective monopoly. I am anti-corporate bullying, regardless of what sector the company is in. The issues with Monsanto are important to address, but are a symptom of corporate greed, not genetically modified crops. How much better could plant technology be if the debate of the last 20 years had been about corporate responsibility as opposed to pro/anti-GM crops? How much further along the research path towards thorium as a (potentially much better) uranium replacement could we be if the nuclear debate was \"what's the best method?\" as opposed to pro/anti-all nuclear power? Please, can we separate the issues? There's enough problems to deal with, without alienating potential allies with woolly logic. Rohan Chadwick Bristol, UK • Carol Binnie is right that science has nothing to do with Mark Lynas's switch of allegiance over GM crops. His actions indicate to me that he is simply a brat kid screaming for attention. When he was no longer getting noticed for his protests he tried to regain the limelight by retracting. Sadly, by giving him such uncritical prominence, the Guardian fell for it hook, line and sinker. David Trubridge Havelock North, New Zealand Choice is not so simple I read Will Hutton's piece on the collapse of the European carbon trading scheme and, while I agree with the points he makes, the standard \"binary choice\" between free-market capitalism and \"environmental socialism\" that he mentions is an oversimplification that is made far too often (Burnt-out planet or financial doom? Painful choices, 26 April). The subject is multifaceted but, for the sake of simplicity, let's add just one extra path to the two cited by Hutton: let's call this path \"environmental capitalism\" or, maybe better, \"localised commerce\". This would be positioned between \"total freedom\" and \"strict control\", with the main emphasis being on taxing and regulating \"the source of the damage\" rather than regulating the whole economy. Prime examples of such a policy would be high taxes on fuel, on shop-size, on packaging, on exploitative imports and on agricultural chemicals; limits to advertising; and a compulsory return and re-use of jars and bottles (to mention just a few). Here, if we agree that emissions, overconsumption and waste are primary \"damaging factors\", these restrictions would disadvantage \"corporate capitalists\" but, if handled correctly, would favour local commerce, which is far less automated, less transport-intensive and more \"people-centred\". Indeed, my suspicion is that \"environmental socialism\" would simply try to give us the same \"consumerist comforts\" that we already have but strive to do it in a greener way. This is not the game-changer that the planet needs and a far better way would be to dramatically \"throttle back\" the damaging factors and let human ingenuity take up the challenge: for example, high fuel costs might price corporate trucking fleets off of the roads, but fuel costs only marginally affect a baker whose customers live around the corner and whose delivery boy uses a bicycle. Yes, local commerce and local enterprise, guided by an imposed \"prevention of damage\" policy (through taxation and regulation), could be the key to breaking the stupidly dogmatic and hopelessly entrenched debate between capitalism and socialism. Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany • Will Hutton writes as persuasively as ever in his article on climate change and the economy. He is less persuasive, however, when he claims that \"Galileo had to take on the Catholic Church to prove the world was round\". I am no apologist for their treatment of Galileo, but I am pretty sure the Catholic hierarchy knew perfectly well that the Earth was round. What they disputed was that the Earth went round the Sun. Rory Allen London Memory and the internet Henry Porter asks, \"memory is being partly outsourced to the internet – what's the problem with that?\" (We're smart enough to know we're stupid, 19 April). The answer is plenty. Ten-year-old children use their parents as memory banks but as they grow we expect them to remember important things for themselves. It's a crucial part of growing into adulthood. Increasingly, I have to tell my tertiary research students that there are many things they have at their fingertips. I don't have time, in the middle of a conversation, for them to search their memory bank for what a protein is made of or for them to go off and look up the answer and come back each time they run into similar roadblocks. They need to know these things so that we can have effective (and rapid!) discussions about the things that matter. In order for them to progress as scientists, they need to depend heavily on this now dying skill. That the increase in this problem is coincident with the rise of the internet is no coincidence.

That is the uncomfortable conclusion that many in the industry are reaching, as the consultation on a complete revamp of the UK's energy market closes on Thursday. The stakes are high: to cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to meet legal targets, the UK's energy industry needs to be virtually carbon-free by 2030. But almost all stakeholders are critical of the proposals in the consultation, except those who want to build nuclear power plants. The widespread perception is that the four measures put forward are knowingly intended to raise the price of electricity to a point where the government can get by without breaking both the commitment made by Chris Huhne, the energy and climate change secretary, to have no public subsidy of nuclear power – and European rules on state aid. The details of the measures are complicated. But the effort of examining them is well worthwhile, as most will raise the price of electricity substantially, all have significant downsides, none seem likely to achieve their goal of delivering low carbon investment other than nuclear – and all have cheaper, less complex alternatives. The four measures, which I'll explain below, are a rising carbon floor price; a contract-for-difference feed-in-tariff (CfD-Fit); a capacity payment mechanism and an emission performance standard. The latter, which limits the carbon a power plant may emit, represents a belt-and-braces approach that ought not be necessary, but could be implemented to ensure no high-carbon electricity plants are built. The other three are all hotly disputed. The CfD-Fit will mean someone – almost certainly the government, perhaps outsourced to an agency – has to commit to pay a premium for low-carbon electricity, whether it be generated by a nuclear power plant, a demonstration coal plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) or renewable energy. energy consumers will end up shouldering the cost via their utility bills. It should be noted that this move will seriously damage if not destroy, the market. It effectively rolls back the years to a level of state involvement not seen since before privatisation in 1990. Even if this is acceptable, a key issue is how to set the price to be paid for the low-carbon electricity. For renewable energy, it should be relatively straightforward to hit the right strike price: there is a real market in renewable energy with a diversity of technologies and companies involved around the world. And because it comes in small units – turbines or solar panels, for example – even if the strike price is wrong the first year, it can at least be reduced rapidly or even cancelled, thereby removing unnecessary cost from the consumer. However, it is a very different situation with nuclear power: there is almost no transparency of nuclear costs. The government can only negotiate with a couple of nuclear operators – since no others exist – so the information gap will be huge. The CfD-Fit starts paying out with generation, meaning the construction risk is with the generator. Given that the other two nuclear power plants being built in Europe are seriously over budget and late in construction, there must be serious concerns that the nuclear generators will lobby for a higher strike price to make up for that construction risk and pass it on to consumers. The monolithic nature of a nuclear power plant – half a plant is no use – means tying British consumers in to that price for 30-40 years. If costs rise, it gives them limited opportunity to refuse extra payments without leaving a large gap in supply. Support for CCS by CfD-Fits creates the same risks, but with even less experience to fall back on than nuclear power. The third measure – a capacity mechanism – is there to compensate the owners of coal and gas power plants for providing the back-up supply that ensures the lights stay on. Currently about 20% of the electricity supply comes from low carbon sources, but as that increases, so fossil-based generation is pushed to lower load factors and generators' return on investment becomes too low or risky to build new plants. The government's preferred option is a targeted mechanism to encourage generation to be available at the peaks, or high points of demand. The fossil generators say that this isn't enough, while others argue that CM is not needed at all in the short term. The final mechanism is the carbon price support (CPS), commonly known as the carbon price floor, which will increase to £70 a tonne of carbon in 2030, as an incentive to generate low-carbon power. If the carbon price via the existing European Union Emission Trading Scheme is lower than the CPS, companies must pay the difference to the government. All agree that reforming the EU-ETS itself, to create a stable European carbon price to drive investment, is the best way to go. Unfortunately, few would bet on the success of achieving that. However, the UK going it alone in Europe to support the price of carbon must encourage 'leakage', meaning that companies will do all they can to avoid paying the UK carbon price by investing in generation in Europe or buying electricity from there, unless a border tax is put in place. Thus UK customers could be paying heavily for a mechanism which is likely to not even achieve its stated goal of encouraging investment in the UK. The consultation is also lacking something. If it were really about reform, then reducing energy demand would be at its centre, yet it is all but missing. The opportunity should exist for companies not to generate low-carbon electricity but instead to reduce the demand for energy through efficiency measures, so-called negawatts. In electricity markets in the US, for example, 10% total demand is routinely removed at lower costs than supply. Moreover, the institutional framework for how the complex interaction of all the mechanisms will work is also missing. Lastly, there is also the question of whether the proposed long-term generation contracts are sailing against the wind of the EU's forthcoming single electricity market directive rules, which emphasise short-term power exchanges to maximise flexible and variable generation. The European juggernaut is almost entirely ignored but must surely raise questions about how long the proposed reforms can last, injecting a wholly unhelpful degree of political risk. To me, the government's objective seems clear: to underpin investment in nuclear power. There are much simpler ways of doing that, removing the need for the expensive assembly of CPS, CM and CfD-Fit. One would be a direct power purchase agreement, but that would fall foul of European rules on state aid. Another option would be to tender for two nuclear power station's worth of electricity, 2000 MW, via an agency, to see whether a nuclear bid would be cheaper than an alternative combination, including renewables and demand-side measures. But nuclear power would be unlikely to win that. The government wants nuclear power but cannot be seen to subsidise it, so it has had to set up this set of convoluted measures. Why the government wants nuclear power so badly, given all these unwanted outcomes and given nuclear can, at best, only provide a small proportion of the low-carbon energy needed is a mystery. That enigma will hurt those who have to pay a higher price for electricity.

Though tremors were felt across the Gulf region, Pakistan and well into north-west India after the quake happened at 3.14pm (11.44am UK time), local authorities said there were only limited casualties. However, it was the biggest earthquake in Iran for 40 years and there were fears of massive casualties yet to be reported. A Pakistani military official said his initial information was that 34 people had been killed and 80 injured in the country, saying all of the dead and injured so far were in the town of Mashkal. The US Geological Survey said it had measured the earthquake at magnitude 7.8 and gave its location at 50 miles east-south-east of the town of Khash, in Iran. Though the area is largely desert and mountains, there are several major cities, including Zahedan, 125 miles away, which has more than half a million inhabitants. One Iranian told the Guardian that the small town of Hiduj, which had a population of around 1,000 according to a 2006 census, had been badly damaged. The Iranian semi-official news agency Fars quoted Tehran University's geophysics centre as saying the quake had hit the south-eastern city of Saravan in Sistan and Baluchistan province at 3.14pm and initially reported that it had killed at least 40 people. However, TV stations later downgraded their estimate to \"several feared dead\". Speaking to the Iranian Students News Agency (Isna), Hatam Naroee, the governor of Sistan and Baluchistan province, reported no fatalities. \"Except for a limited number of villages, telecommunication services and electricity wires and water pipelines of other villages close to the epicentre are safe,\" he said, explaining that the region was sparsely populated. An official from Iran's Red Crescent Society told Isna that 22 search and rescue teams, including 17 rescue dogs, had been dispatched to the region. On the Pakistan side, the situation also seemed confused. \"We have reports of three deaths near the Pakistan-Iran border in Mash Khel area of Panjgore district,\" said a local government official, requesting anonymity. The official said about 40 people had been injured when wooden roofs and mud walls collapsed. The thinly populated district is one of Pakistan's most underdeveloped, with minimal telecommunication and infrastructure. Close to magnitude 8 means a powerful quake on a level with the one that killed an estimated 68,000 people in Sichuan province, China, in 2008. Experts said the depth of the earthquake may have saved many lives. \"The earthquake in Iran was strong but fortunately its source was quite deep, about 80km [50 miles] ... the intensity of the shaking was less than it would have been for a shallower earthquake of the same magnitude,\" said Dr David Rothery, chair of the Open University's volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis course. Saleh Mangi, from the NGO Plan International, said he was in a meeting with staff in an office in Thatta, around 65 miles from the Pakistani port city of Karachi, when the ground shook. \"People are afraid to go back to their homes and the government is telling fishing communities not to go into the sea as that would be very dangerous,\" he said. There was concern that facilities associated with Iran's nuclear programme might have been affected. But the Bushehr nuclear power plant was not damaged, said an official at Atomstroyexport, the Russian firm that built the plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/nov/01/lib-dems-tories-trade-blows-windfarms","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-01T18:47:19Z","webTitle":"Lib Dems and Tories trade blows over windfarms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/01/lib-dems-tories-trade-blows-windfarms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/nov/01/lib-dems-tories-trade-blows-windfarms","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dems and Tories trade blows over windfarms","bodyText":"The government's perma-shambles continues. Almost everything goes wrong. A new chief whip was greeted on Wednesday night with a crushing defeat after 53 Tories voted with Labour over Europe, ignoring their prime minister. And the minister for energy, a Conservative, is now completely at odds with the energy secretary, who is a Liberal Democrat. Clearly the secretary of state, Ed Davey, should be in charge. He told us that he was in charge. The minister of state, John Hayes, nominally his understrapper, had said there would be no more windfarms blighting our landscape. \"Enough is enough,\" was how he put it. Mr Davey believes there can never be enough windfarms. Only when, say, the entire Lake District is covered with the things, generating at peak periods enough electricity to power several toasters in the Penrith area, will he and the other Lib Dems be satisfied. I exaggerate, but not a great deal. For someone who had allegedly been given a bollocking by the boss, Mr Hayes looked remarkably pleased with himself. He resembled the schoolboy who, having been summoned to the headmaster for a caning, has remembered to wear his cast-iron Y-fronts. He had an air of casual insouciance, or as he put it \"What a pleasure it is to answer energy questions for the first time, and to do so with the wind in my sails.\" One of his joys is making life difficult for the Tories' coalition partners. Simon Hughes said the coalition agreement meant there could be no public subsidy for nuclear power. Mr Hayes was far too happy about the offer from Hitachi to provide us with nuclear power to let that one go. \"Let me be crystal clear,\" he said, using the politicians' term for \"let me obfuscate\". There would be no subsidy, \"unless similar support is provided more widely for other forms of generation\". In other words, the Tories were perfectly prepared to rip up the agreement. As they always are, when they can get away with it. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, complained. Mr Hayes said he would not be influenced by \"the preoccupations of bourgeois-left academics\". Who, presumably, are the only people concerned with the fate of the planet, in their horrible Marxist, middle-class, tree-hugging, beard-growing, Monbiot-reading way. Later, Mr Davey said he would be quite happy to listen to the views of bourgeois-left academics. Another coalition split! Mr Hayes was, by now, out of control. He praised himself for his clarity. He slapped himself on the back for the speed with which he acts. Mr Davey had the air of a man who couldn't take much more of this. Labour's Caroline Flint wanted to know if he and Mr Hayes were working together. Apparently they are. \"We may occasionally disagree on matters of substance … but I have to say that I really admire his style.\" And so does Mr Hayes.

The sooner the UK makes large investments in low-carbon generation – including offshore and onshore wind, nuclear power and energy from waste – the cheaper it will be, according to David Kennedy, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the statutory body that advises ministers on meeting emissions targets. The conclusions are likely to be controversial, as many MPs on the right of the Tory party have been clamouring for an end to onshore windfarms and reductions in renewable subsidies. They would prefer to see a new \"dash for gas\" that would require the UK to massively expand shale gas drilling and import tens of billions of pounds worth of fuel each year as North Sea reserves run down. They point to lower gas prices in the US that have resulted from the aggressive pursuit of shale resources. The CCC's analysis found that investing in renewable energy made sense even if the price of gas was relatively low. Previous analysis by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) relied on scenarios of large increases in the gas price to make renewables and other forms of low-carbon power, such as nuclear, more economic. Kennedy told the Guardian: \"Not investing in renewables only makes sense if you don't want to meet our emissions targets – if you tear up the Climate Change Act.\" That is precisely what some on the rightwing of the Tory party would like to do, although the act passed in 2008 with just a handful of no votes. The opponents included Peter Lilley, recently appointed as a senior adviser to David Cameron, although No 10 said his focus would be on foreign policy and not on energy. A DECC spokeswoman said: \"We agree with the CCC on both the need to invest in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies, and the need to reduce our dependence on imported gas which is the main factor driving up household energy bills. \"We recently trebled support for low-carbon technologies to £7.6bn to 2020, and have introduced landmark legislation through the energy bill to incentivise £110bn of investment in clean energy infrastructure, which has the potential to support 250,000 jobs in the energy sector.\" Kennedy said targets on emissions from the electricity sector to 2030 were likely to be needed, in order to spur low-carbon investment by giving companies the clarity and certainty they needed to put money into UK projects. The government has rejected a target of decarbonising electricity generation by 2030, as had been proposed for the energy bill now on its passage through parliament. Tim Yeo, the Tory former minister, is leading a rebellion on the target, which he wants reinstated, and has gathered at least 45 supporters including the prominent Tories Zac Goldsmith and Sir Peter Bottomley. Green campaigners welcomed the CCC report. Leila Deen, energy campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \"Every MP in British politics should take heed of this report, because in two weeks' time they'll be making the biggest changes to the UK's energy system in a generation when they vote on the energy bill. \"The CCC's advice is clear: a clean energy system is better for business and better for consumers. George Osborne has ripped a 2030 decarbonisation target from the bill, but with hundreds of businesses and investors crying foul, it's up to coalition MPs to vote it back in.\" The passage of the energy bill promises to be tempestuous because of the deep divisions within the Tory party on energy and climate change. Yeo said: \"This report raises serious concerns about the mixed messages the government has been sending on energy and climate change policy. The energy bill is supposed to deliver billions of pounds of investment in clean energy infrastructure by providing long-term certainty and reducing capital costs, but the Treasury has undermined investor confidence by stripping the legislation of a clear carbon reduction target.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jul/18/fracking-tax-breaks-peter-lilley","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-18T19:08:31Z","webTitle":"Fracking companies should not get tax breaks, says No 10 adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/18/fracking-tax-breaks-peter-lilley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jul/18/fracking-tax-breaks-peter-lilley","fields":{"headline":"Fracking companies should not get tax breaks, says No 10 adviser","bodyText":"Shale gas fracking companies should not be granted tax breaks, a leading Downing Street adviser has said, because their operations are likely to be profitable without such incentives – even as the government prepared to offer developers a new \"pad allowance\" for the wells they drill, to encourage more of the controversial exploration. Peter Lilley, the climate sceptic Tory MP who is an adviser on foreign policy in No 10, said in a debate on shale gas in Westminster Hall on Thursday afternoon: \"I think tax breaks are unnecessary for fracking, based on my knowledge of the oil and gas industry.\" Lilley has been an energy industry analyst for more than 20 years, and has a financial interest in central Asian oil and gas. The debate, called by the UK's only Green MP, Caroline Lucas, was frequently fractious – with the Tory minister Michael Fallon accused by Lucas of showing an attitude towards women that she \"absolutely deplored\". There were accusations that male MPs and the minister had been \"chuntering\" while women spoke, and had patronised some of the female speakers. At one point, Fallon asked Lucas to \"contain herself\". Lilley's intervention came as ministers were still finalising potential tax breaks and other incentives to shale developers, as well as setting out a consultation on the sort of incentives that should be offered to local communities to encourage them to accept shale gas drilling in their area. Fallon, the Conservative energy minister, said the tax breaks would be set out in detail soon, and would take the form of a \"pad allowance\" that would apply to each well. He said the government expected between 20 and 40 new exploration wells to be drilled in the next two years, and local people should also \"get their fair share\" from the exploration. Ministers are determined to offer local incentives, possibly similar to those unveiled on Wednesday for the sites of new nuclear power stations. \"The pad allowance [for fracking developers] will unlock investment and provide support during the critical exploration phase,\" Fallon told MPs. \"There will be a new round of onshore licensing next year, which we expect to attract a lot of interest.\" He promised planning guidance on the circumstances in which fracking wells should be allowed would be published \"very soon\". But Lucas slammed the coalition for failing to put out the planning guidelines on Thursday as expected, and said it was \"appalling\" that the guidelines would come into force without public consultation, which she said would deny affected communities the chance to have their say. She said: \"It's clear that ministers and fracking firms – increasingly indistinguishable – are keen to press on rapidly.\" She added: \"The direct carbon content of shale gas means widespread use [of it] is incompatible with the climate change targets of the UK. Shale gas is a high-carbon fuel.\" Lucas also cited 55 recent incidents of pollution from North Sea oil and gas operations as evidence that the UK's regulatory regime is flawed. \"The idea that our regulations when it comes to drilling are so much better than elsewhere is questionable.\" The debate also showed how polarised the debate on the controversial fuel has become, with MPs from all parties and sometimes from neighbouring constituencies disagreeing violently over whether widespread drilling should go ahead and what safeguards there should be. The split was not purely on party lines, as members of the coalition and opposition spoke up in favour of shale, while others from all parties voiced their concerns over the environmental impacts. Many MPs were concerned about the potential impact on local water supplies, the possibility of pollution, of methane leaks, and the question of whether burning large quantities of shale gas would be compatible with meeting the UK's climate change targets. Fracking requires the pumping of water, sand and chemicals at very high pressure into dense shale rocks thousands of feet underground, releasing tiny bubbles of methane that can be captured at the surface. Shale drilling in Lancashire caused two small earthquakes two years ago, and the casing of the well was damaged, though there was no leak of fluid or gas. Ministers were not informed by the drilling company, Cuadrilla, until months after the event, Guardian research revealed. But other MPs said environmental concerns were exaggerated, strong regulation would be in place to prevent leaks and other accidents, and there was unlikely to be an adverse impact on house prices in fracking areas. They argued that shale gas could provide a cheap indigenous source of fuel and help with the \"reindustrialisation\" of the economy, providing jobs and an economic boost. In the US, widespread fracking has produced a glut of gas, pushing down energy prices. Fallon said the government had established \"the right framework\" for shale development to go ahead safely, and the coalition's plans for \"accelerated shale\" would not mean overriding local concerns. Recent estimates by the British Geological Survey have suggested the UK could have 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the major shale areas in the north of the UK, enough to last for decades if it can be extracted at a profitable rate. Fallon said further estimates of the amount of shale gas in the Weald basin in the south of England would be published next March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/may/19/narendra-modi-india-election-victory-america-china-pakistan-world","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-19T18:55:41Z","webTitle":"Narendra Modi: what does his victory mean for America, China and Pakistan?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/19/narendra-modi-india-election-victory-america-china-pakistan-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/may/19/narendra-modi-india-election-victory-america-china-pakistan-world","fields":{"headline":"Narendra Modi: what does his victory mean for America, China and Pakistan?","bodyText":"When Narendra Modi, 63, formally assumes the highest executive office in this simultaneously troubled, joyous, chaotic democracy of 1.25bn people, he will have to reconcile the ideological and the pragmatic.

There were a series of statements by local BJP officials that appeared deliberately aimed at exploiting tensions between specific communities. There were also more assertive statements directed at neighbours Pakistan – with which India has fought four wars – and China – with which India has had one conflict – and a promise that Modi in power would create an India that no one could talk down to on the international stage. There was even an apparent threat to revise India's \"no first strike\" nuclear weapons policy . All came together in the slogan \"India First\", which apparently resonated with 180 million people tired of an uninspiring and apparently uncertain Congress party-led coalition government and its dynastic leaders. It got Modi to power, with the first majority seen in the Indian parliament for 30 years. But no one is quite sure what it means in terms of this huge and often fabulously insular country's relations with the region, and the rest of the world. Modi is a polarising figure. He has emerged from, and is supported by, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the hardline Hindu nationalist organisation. The BJP is intimately linked to the RSS, which has been banned three times by Indian authorities. The RSS is deeply distrusting (and worse) of other religious minorities in India, suspicious of former colonial powers and the US, and committed to economic self-sufficiency for India. And while his supporters see a man with an established record of honest, efficient and effective government, critics accuse Modi of harbouring deep sectarian prejudices and of allowing, or even encouraging, violence in which 1,000 people, largely Muslims, died while he was in power in Gujarat state in 2002. Though a supreme court investigation has found insufficient evidence to support the charges – which Modi has always denied – concerns remain. His foreign affairs in-tray is overflowing. There are major multilateral issues such as climate change to get to grips with. An election is underway in Afghanistan, with 2014 a critical year for Indian interests there. To the east, political strife in Bangladesh is subsiding but few believe any calm will last long. India has proved unable to protect its businesses even in the tiny Maldives and in Burma. Further afield, the whole aftermath of the Arab Spring presents huge difficulties. India needs lots of fossil fuels, and huge quantities of imported oil. Iran is a long-term ally but demanding. The history of the Gujarat riots and the RSS connection is not going to simplify diplomacy anywhere in the Islamic world. The relationship with Europeans is underperforming, with negotiations on a trade agreement taking so long they have become a stock joke of ambassador's receptions in Delhi. British ministers keep turning up, keen to stress how much they admire all things Indian, especially large contracts. With all his interactions internationally, there is one obvious questions: which will triumph? The job-creating, wealth-building pragmatist or the ideologue? The three big tests, experts agree, will be relations with Pakistan, the US and China. Sitting in the back room of the BJP headquarters as the scale of Modi's win became clear, is Ravi Shankar Prasad, an ebullient lawyer turned politician whose vociferous style of argument is well-suited to the noisy shouting matches that pass as debates on Indian television. Prasad, deputy leader of the BJP in India's upper house and a key campaign strategist, is in a very good mood. India will be an \"assertive power\", he says, but one \"with dignity, with responsibility and constitutional integrity\". However, Prasad explains, though India wants to dismantle the \"wall of terrorism\" that has separated Pakistan and India since partition, \"the Pakistanis\" need to be aware that \"terrorism promoted from their soil\" would no longer be tolerated. The outgoing Congress government has struggled with the question of Pakistan. Manmohan Singh, the technocrat prime minister, was born in the neighbouring country before partition. But the attacks on Mumbai in 2008, when militants from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group killed 166 people in India's commercial capital, sent a relationship that was already cool into deep freeze. Some now say Modi, who has no need to prove his conservative credentials, could bring about a breakthrough. Pakistan, also a nuclear power, is currently run by a conservative, pro-business government under veteran politician and industrialist Nawaz Sharif. His brother, Shahbaz, in a recent interview with the Guardian, blamed his nation's powerful military for the failure to generate greater commerce between the two nations. Modi's commitment to economic development could see him push hard to broaden these commercial links – or even attempt a more radical gesture. \"It could be that Modi is Nixon in China for India and Pakistan,\" says Professor Ashutosh Varshney, of Brown University in the US. \"Hindu nationalist visionaries have typically been better in dealing with Pakistan.\" Varshney's hopes are echoed by some Pakistani diplomats too. The precedent is the previous BJP administration of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who travelled to Pakistan in 1999 to sign a peace deal, a year after ordering nuclear tests that brought about international sanctions. The other sticking point for Pakistan is the disputed territory of Kashmir, where a low-level separatist insurgency continues. The BJP is committed to withdrawing the special constitutional provisions that guarantee Kashmir a degree of autonomy within India. Concessions on this would be tough for Modi to envisage, let alone enact, experts say. On top of that, the region is evolving rapidly as the US and other remaining international combat troops are withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of this year. Indian security officials fear this could result in a small army of unemployed militants who will head, or be directed, towards Kashmir or India itself, with the support of some elements of Pakistan's security establishment. Even optimists such as Varshney admit that a major terrorist incident traced back to, or blamed on, Pakistan, could derail even the most committed effort to make peace. \"Another Mumbai [attack] – which is unlikely but not impossible – would create serious pressure,\" he says. Rivalling the relationship with Pakistan for complexity and potential for misunderstanding is that with the US. As protocol demands, Barack Obama called the Indian prime minister elect over the weekend to express his hope that his win would help \"fulfil the extraordinary promise of the US-India strategic partnership\". Crucially, and here no one would have missed the significance, \"the president invited Narendra Modi to visit Washington at a mutually agreeable time to further strengthen our bilateral relationship,\" said a government spokesperson. This could occur as soon as the UN General Assembly in New York in September, when Modi could also visit Washington. The visit is likely to be an extraordinary event with Modi – a teetotal, celibate, ascetic outsider who has shunned the sophisticated salons of India's power elite – suddenly pushed on to the world stage, and into a gruelling round of diplomatic engagements. The public boilerplate, as it so often does, hides a difficult and often acrimonious relationship. If he has been happy to welcome US investors to Gujarat over the 13 years he has governed the state, there has been little love lost between Modi and Washington. The administration of President George W Bush denied Modi a visa in 2005 under a 1998 US law barring entry to foreigners who have committed \"particularly severe violations of religious freedom\". A boycott by senior US officials was only lifted earlier this year, when the US ambassador to India finally travelled to Gandhinagar, the state capital of Gujarat, to meet its chief minister. This, witnesses say, was a frosty occasion. \"I spoke to [Modi] a few years back about the boycott and whether he wanted me to push for it to be lifted,\" said one Modi aide, with international connections, last week. \"He said: 'No, let them come to me. They will,' and he was right. They did.\" Though Rajnath Singh, the powerful BJP president who is also close to the RSS, told the Guardian as the campaign opened, of the party's wish for better relations with the US, there is much repair work to be done. Trade is still significant. Last month, Nisha Biswal, the top US diplomat for South Asia, said that the US wants bilateral trade of $500bn a year, up from about $100bn currently. But, after an improvement a decade ago, and a controversial nuclear deal, relations between Delhi and Washington hit a new low five months ago when Devyani Khobragade, the Indian deputy consul general was arrested for visa fraud in New York, strip-searched and held in police custody. She was eventually released and flew back to India but the affair prompted a vitriolic reaction to what Indians saw as disrespectful bullying by the \"Ugly American\". This in turn prompted US commentators to accuse India of oversensitivity and behaviour unbecoming of an aspirant future power. Still, some experts are optimistic. Michael Kugelman, at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre in Washington says Modi may get a warmer welcome than some predict. He points out that the only US government agency to be critical of Modi for some time is the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, which warned of the impact a Modi-led government might have on minorities in India. \"Washington doesn't know him very well and I think that's the major concern. There was never any real hostility,\" Kugelman says. Indeed, Modi's backstory, the former tea seller who \"pulled himself up by his bootstraps and then embraced capitalism and the free market and became seen as a decisive and confident leader\", has much appeal in the US. \"There are a lot of tensions in the relationship but they tend to revolve around economics and I could see him as a pro-investor and pro-trade leader saying: 'Let's try and make some progress',\" Kugelman adds. Perhaps the biggest challenge for Modi on the world stage will be China. Few in India, where annual economic growth has dropped to less than 5% in recent years, now talk of catching up their neighbour. Indeed, for Modi, China may appear to be less a rival than an opportunity. He has been there four times on official visits – more than any other country – and, aides say, admires what has been achieved in the country. On his last five-day tour, Modi carried red business cards printed in Chinese. Modi is also said to feel more at home among the technocrats of Beijing than in the west. Critics frequently accuse him of authoritarian instincts in his career so far, of muzzling the press, of creating a \"climate of fear\" and of sidelining those who disagree with him. If Washington sees a Horatio Alger, Beijing may see a figure who represents less an American dream and more an East Asian one. But Modi will still come up against the fundamental tension between his nationalism and his desire to accelerate economic development. He may want to see Chinese investment in India's insufficient infrastructure – in trains, roads, power stations – but China has already proclaimed its ownership of the 21st century and Modi's victory speech pronouncement that the coming decades would constitute \"India's century\" is unlikely to have been well received in Beijing. Nor his attack, while on the campaign trail, on the Chinese \"expansionist mindset\". The two countries frequently dispute their Himalayan border. \"There is a [border] transgression every two days and some [such incidents] are critical,\" says Professor Srikanth Kondapalli, a China expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. \"A BJP prime minister will have a hard job to explain to the people why border transgressions are happening and he cannot do anything about it. As a nationalist leader, this sovereignty dispute will really test Indo-Chinese relations.\" Kondapalli's prediction is that, for at least the first years of his term in power, Modi will put development before ideology but warns, as others warn of Pakistan, that the big test will come when India is seen to be provoked. This week, Modi will form his government and pick his foreign ministers. His choice will be a key early indication of which way the man, who until two years ago was boycotted by the US and most of Europe, is leaning. Will it be ideology or pragmatism? Nationalist pride and sovereignty first, or jobs and growth? Or perhaps a clever blending of both, like his campaign rhetoric? Varshney believes Modi's landslide win will give him both a \"long honeymoon\" with voters and the legitimacy to hold the hardline nationalists at bay. He says: \"So long as it is Modi's ambition to rise – not only on an Indian stage, but on a world stage – that drives him, he will discipline and restrain the extreme wing of the party. And as long as his driving force is the desire to reshape India and be remembered as the greatest prime minister since [independence leader] Jawaharlal Nehru, you will see a more pragmatic Modi.\" But no one can be sure: either of Modi, or of his environment. In an unstable region, and in a vast country that is undergoing rapid social, political and cultural change, there are too many possibilities for anyone to be overly optimistic. The consensus among analysts is that it is not Modi's policy-making that could give cause for concern, but his potential response to a crisis – particularly if that crisis prompted a wave of nationalist indignation or anger. After all, there are many in India who see Modi's victory as a sign of greater changes to come. One is Anuraj Dikshit, 40, a marketing executive who splits his time between Mumbai and Gurgaon. He talks of not of India but Bharat, a Sanskrit-origin word describing a Hindu civilisation. \"This is not about warmongering but about this country's culture,\" he says. \"India has been there since 1947. Bharat has been there since time immemorial. Now Bharat has come back, validated and endorsed by the voters of this country.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/20/green-light","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-20T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Green news round-up: Red tape, nuclear power and Deepwater Horizon anniversary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/20/green-light","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/20/green-light","fields":{"headline":"Green news round-up: Red tape, nuclear power and Deepwater Horizon anniversary","bodyText":"Climate change and energy Environmental campaigners angry as green laws labelled as red tape Radioactive spills and breakdown revealed at British nuclear plants BP faces storms of protest at annual meeting Solar companies take legal action over UK feed-in tariff cuts Deepwater Horizon one-year anniversary: the key questions answered Conservation and wildlife Wildlife paradise or lorry park?

The responsibility falls on Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury. He took over the task after Nick Harvey, the armed forces minister, was sacked last September. Plans to spend billions of pounds on a like-for-like replacement of Britain's Trident nuclear submarine fleet are based on \"outdated and ludicrous\" ideas about deterrence, Harvey told a UN conference earlier this month. \"In the decade or so from 2017-18, the current plan is to spend between £25bn and £30bn building four vast new submarines whose sole purpose will be to patrol the high seas 24/7 waggling our nuclear bomb at – er – no one in particular. For another 30 years we'll spend £3bn a year in today's money operating them, and one day it will cost several billion more to decommission our nukes\", he wrote in the Guardian. Meanwhile, David Cameron and Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, continue to insist that maintaining a Trident fleet with a submarine equipped with ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads \"continuously at sea\" is the only effective deterrent. It is hard to imagine a British government agreeing to make significant cuts in its nuclear arsenal — even harder, perhaps, now that the French (socialist) government in its defence white paper published on Tuesday emphatically committed itself to maintain its own arsenal of sea and air-launched nuclear weapons. The French nuclear arsenal is \"completely ring-fenced\", French officials emphasised on Tuesday. Yet both the British and French economies are suffering and how money is spent on their armed forces should be subjected to the most careful scrutiny. Though the French defence budget is not being cut as much as the British (which is facing cuts of more than 8%), the cost of equipment will mean they are shedding manpower, just as the British armed forces, the army in particular, is doing. And while Britain is building two large aircraft carriers, which the Commons public accounts committee has warned could cost as much as £12bn, France has abandoned its plan to build a second carrier. Britain and France showed in Libya and Mali they are still incapable of operating in even limited conflicts without US help - for intelligence-gathering and refuelling aircraft, communications, drones, and bombs. \"While the United States would like to be able to rely more on its European allies, many experts doubt that even the strongest among them, Britain and France, could carry out their part of another Libya operation now, and certainly not in a few years\", the New York Times observed earlier this month. It added: \"The situation in Britain is so bad that American officials are quietly urging it to drop its expensive nuclear deterrent\". It quoted a senior American official as saying: \"They can't afford Trident and they need to confront the choice: either they can be a nuclear power and nothing else or a real military partner\". That is a hugely significant comment, from Britain's closest ally. The US now accounts for nearly three-quarters of Nato's expenditure. The once trumpeted French-German brigade, remains unused. When the French wanted to deploy it in Mali, the Germans objected. General Vincent Desportes, former head of France's School of War, warned that France's decision to \"sanctify\" its nuclear deterrent to the detriment of conventional forces meant \"we will end up with a model that doesn't work, namely the nuclear bomb plus gendarmes.\" Britain is in danger of going down that path."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/mar/07/ukip-policies-manifesto-commitments","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-07T22:00:07Z","webTitle":"What would a Ukip Britain look like?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/07/ukip-policies-manifesto-commitments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/mar/07/ukip-policies-manifesto-commitments","fields":{"headline":"What would a Ukip Britain look like?","bodyText":"Lord Ashcroft, the former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, once said that for Ukip voters \"policies are secondary.

Phil Bentley is expected to step down as managing director of British Gas over the next few months and an announcement could come as soon as Centrica's preliminary results at the end of February. At the same time the energy group will also announce the outcome of a three-yearly strategic review, encompassing its three main divisions of British Gas, an oil and gas production business that includes a significant North Sea presence and a US operation. Bentley, 53, joined Centrica as finance director in 2000 and was handed his British Gas role in 2007. Centrica declined to comment on Bentley's imminent departure but he is believed to harbour ambitions to become a company chief executive in his own right. British Gas is a lightning rod for criticism over rising household bills as the provider of energy to 15.8 million customers. In November it implemented a 6% increase in household bills, a rise that it blamed on the cost of upgrading the UK's gas and electricity grids, rising wholesale gas costs and levies imposed on energy companies to pay for low-carbon alternatives. Nonetheless Centrica is expected to announce after-tax profits of £1.4bn in next month, with British Gas forecast to produce a profit of £575m. Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, also faces questions over the group's involvement in the new nuclear power station planned for Hinkley Point in Somerset. It is a junior partner in the project with France's EDF and a decision on whether to proceed with the £14bn project has already missed its year-end deadline. The decision is heavily dependent on how much financial support the government provides, through underwriting a minimum price for nuclear-powered energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/12/north-korea-nuclear-test","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-12T18:00:04Z","webTitle":"Q&A: North Korea nuclear test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/12/north-korea-nuclear-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/12/north-korea-nuclear-test","fields":{"headline":"Q&A: North Korea nuclear test","bodyText":"What has North Korea got? Tuesday morning's nuclear test by North Korea has been measured as larger than the two previous tests in 2006 and 2009. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said it was twice the size of the 2009 explosion, registering 4.9 on the Richter scale, but they further tests were needed to verify it was definitely a nuclear explosion. The state news agency, KCNA, announced Pyongyang had succeeded in miniaturising a powerful nuclear device to put on a rocket, something it had not been able to do before. If this is true then they have taken a giant leap towards becoming a nuclear power. What is the technology for? Pyongyang said the tests were a response to the \"outrageous\" US hostility that undermines North Korea's right to peacefully launch satellites. They maintain these launches are aimed purely at putting satellites in space. However, the regime seems keen to stress that the device was more powerful than the two previous tests yet smaller in size, pointing to weapon capability. Washington believes North Korea is aiming to design an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that could hit the US. What does the international community fear? There are fears this device may have been constructed using highly enriched uranium (HEU). The regime said it had begun to enrich uranium in 2009. It is much more complicated to minituarise an HEU device, so if this is what happened, then North Korea's technological capabilities are greater than expected. They could build a much greater arsenal without having to rely on their dwindling plutonium stocks. What can be done about it? North Korea is one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world and has an extremely small economy, so there is not much left for the UN security council to target. The regime consistently cites sanctions as the reason it defies international law with rocket and nuclear tests. Since Kim Jung-un took over from his father the economy has shrunk by 20% and a third of children are thought to be malnourished. Existing sanctions include a ban on the import of nuclear and missile technology and an arms embargo. The regime told a UN disarmament forum on Tuesday that the \"country will never bow to any resolutions\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/social-enterprise-india-slums","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-05T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Social enterprise in Indian slums","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/social-enterprise-india-slums","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/social-enterprise-india-slums","fields":{"headline":"Social enterprise in Indian slums","bodyText":"Slums in India have grabbed the attention of activists, journalists and humanitarians for decades. And as urbanisation in India surges, living conditions in these poor areas within megacities have become increasingly dire. New slums have emerged on the outer rings of older ones, resulting in situations like the one in Mumbai's Dharavi where its one million people now sit on what many Indian leaders regard as prime real estate. Having spent time in some of the slums of Mumbai and Delhi earlier this year, I found it was easy to focus on the jarring first impressions: the overcrowding, filth and poverty. But peel back the harsh veneer and one sees the budding social enterprises that thrive in Mumbai's M Ward and Delhi's Holumbi Khurd. New business models from large and small firms alike that foster jobs, conserve resources and inspire innovation thrive within these neighbourhoods. The scarcity of resources like water and energy force residents to become creative, thrifty and share with their neighbours. Clearly these districts have their problems: inadequate healthcare, lack of clean water, scant opportunities in education and government indifference all contribute to the taxing daily life of most of their inhabitants. But the lack of necessities inspires social innovation, allowing many residents of these areas to progress while finding employment and, in the long run, hope. While these neighbourhoods are not necessarily models for sustainable development, what has unfolded in many of India's cities offer lessons for other cities around the world as they struggle with the influx of new migrants. Energy, water and health are just a few sectors in which necessity and creativity converge to improve lives and create new jobs. Dharavi, for example, has long been a hub for recycling, which in turn provides economic opportunities to tens of thousands of residents. Most of the trash Mumbai's 21 million people discard ends up at dumps near Dharavi, where \"ragpickers\" sort through the garbage and salvage plastic from everything imaginable including electronics and broken toys. The work is tedious and even dangerous, but at a daily wage averaging $3 to $5, the pay is comparable to those who make a living making the country's much-coveted and intricate sari fabric, which often involves even longer days in cramped and stuffy rooms. Recycling, however, is old school compared to what is catching on in other areas. Many of India's slums have no access to the local energy grid, which have forced residents to rely on pricey, dirty and dangerous kerosene. One social enterprise in Bangalore shuns the debate over whether India should build more coal-fired or even nuclear power plants. Pollinate Energy has provided solar energy to millions of poor Indians at a time when the cost of energy from the sun has declined precipitously. The company provides training to locals, or \"micro-entrepreneurs,\" who buy locally-manufactured solar home lighting systems and then sell them to families who would otherwise depend on kerosene for light. Families in turn have access to microfinance programmes, eliminating any requirement to purchase the contraption up front. Safe drinking water is also a leading health challenge for many of India's urban poor, and now multinationals and small social enterprises alike respond to the problem. One local company, Sarvajal, has created the \"Water ATM\", a stand-alone water dispenser that uses off-grid solar energy to power a reverse osmosis system and provides treated water 24 hours a day at a low cost. Users simply swipe a pre-paid card at a price Sarvajal claims is cheaper than other alternatives. The company trains franchisees so they can own and operate these water ATMs, giving a sense of ownership within local communities instead of relying on local charities or governments to truck in water, the norm in most Indian slums. Sarvajal received a contract last year to run a pilot programme in Delhi. Meanwhile, Unilever is an example of how a multinational can expand access to safe water to the poor while creating jobs. The company's PureIt brand of water filter, priced at $24, is a cheaper alternative than boiling water on a kerosene stove. And for consumers too poor to pay for the system entirely upfront, Unilever's India division works with several NGOs on micro-finance schemes, including one with a Facebook page that allows anyone to make contributions from as little as 10p, so these filtration systems can reach homes where they are most needed. Technology companies can also deliver services providing critical healthcare and employment. In Bhiwandi, a poor neighbourhood east of Mumbai, Microsoft partners with the Indian firm BigTech and the charity Operation ASHA to deliver tuberculosis medicine to patients who either forget or are too weak to go to local clinics for their scheduled treatments. ASHAs, or accredited social health activists, are local women trained to participate in similar health programmes throughout India and serve as the first line of healthcare support to India's poorest citizens. Dimagi, a Massachusetts-based software firm, partners with charities in the state of Uttar Pradesh to work with ASHAs who use mobile telephones to diagnose medical conditions and offer health advice to pregnant women. Technology and social innovation will not solve India's poverty and health problems alone. A government more responsive to its citizens needs would certainly help solve the growing disparity between rich and poor, but for now social entrepreneurs fill a void where a dismissive government and overwhelmed charities fall short.

The arrival of Kerry, Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, and his French and German counterparts, Laurent Fabius and Guido Westerwelle, has further boosted anticipation that a deal is within reach. On Thursday, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, announced that drafting of a joint statement would start on Friday morning and could be completed by the end of the day. \"I have come personally to Geneva because these are negotiations that are difficult but important for the regional and international security,\" Fabius said on arrival in Switzerland. \"It is a question of reaching an agreement which represents a first solid step in addresses the international concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme. There has been a lot of progress but so far nothing has been finalised.\" Kerry flew to Geneva from Israel, where he discussed the outline of the deal with Binyamin Netanyahu at a meeting at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv. The Israeli prime minister is reported to have restated his opposition to any partial agreement that lifts any sanctions without a complete halt to Iranian uranium enrichment. According to the Haaretz website, he told Kerry Israel would not be bound by any agreement struck in Geneva. On Friday morning over breakfast, the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who is co-ordinating the Geneva talks, met senior diplomats from the six nations involved in the long-running negotiations with Iran – the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China – to discuss positions before beginning the work of drafting an agreement. The US state department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, issued a statement as Kerry took off from Israel saying: \"In an effort to help narrow the differences in negotiations, Secretary Kerry will travel to Geneva, Switzerland, today at the invitation of EU high representative Ashton to hold a trilateral meeting with high representative Ashton and foreign minister Zarif on the margins of the … negotiations.\" Speaking to the Guardian on Thursday, Zarif said the agreement could be finished by the end of Friday, but that much would rely on the contribution of western diplomats. \"Depending on what they put on paper with us, we can decide whether it's a major deal or a small step in the right direction. I hope it's more than a small step in the right direction, but I'll be happy if we move in the right direction,\" Zarif said in his only interview with a British newspaper. He said the process of drafting would begin at a meeting with Ashton, which Kerry is expected to join. \"I believe the ingredients are there. I believe there is a general understanding of everyone involved, but it is important at the same time to start doing things in black and white and try to move forward with the text,\" Zarif said. To coincide with the climactic point in the talks, Iran launched a sophisticated new website to put the case for its nuclear programme, rebutting allegations that it is a front for eventually making weapons and laying out the energy, environmental, health and agricultural reasons for its development. Western officials agreed that drafting work could begin on Friday, but cautioned that there were still many difficult issues to resolve. Any agreement would represent a historic breakthrough after a decade of diplomatic sparring marked by paralysis and distrust. Zarif said the six other nations represented in Geneva had agreed with an Iranian plan to move the negotiations forward – a statement of intent encompassing an initial confidence-building measure and an outline of the end goal of a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme and a normalisation of relations between Tehran and the west. The foreign minister said the negotiations had gone further in the first day than merely agreeing a framework. \"We have gone beyond that and we have agreed on the elements that have to be incorporated in each one of these [steps]. The manner in which we incorporate them and the balance we strike between these elements – that's the sort of questions we have to answer tomorrow,\" he had said. It is widely expected that both an interim deal and a longer-term settlement would involve western acceptance of Iran's enrichment programme in return for Iranian acceptance of limits on its scope, particularly a cap on the level to which it could enrich uranium of about 5%, sufficient for fuel for nuclear power stations. There would also have to be an agreement on how far Iran could go in developing a heavy-water reactor at Arak which would produce plutonium, as well as on Iranian acceptance of extensive and intrusive inspections by the international watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As the negotiations got under way in Geneva, Netanyahu had referred to the emerging deal as \"a mistake of historic proportions\". Asked about the Israeli prime minister's comments, Zarif said: \"I don't think he's an authority on mistakes because he's been making mistakes for his entire life. He's been calling the Iranian programme six months away from a nuclear weapon since 1991, so I don't consider him a credible authority.\" As to the reception a nuclear bargain is likely to receive back in Iran, the foreign minister said: \"It depends on the type of deal that we get.\" \"The Iranian public is very sceptical about the process and I believe rightly so because we haven't had a very positive experience in the past,\" Zarif said. \"What is important is to prepare a solid agreement that all sides can be happy with and all sides can sell to their populations. For Iran because it's our right. It's our programme, it is important that it is respectful and it is based on equal footing and I believe we can sell it to the public. If we can't I don't think we should agree to it.\" In Tehran, Ayatollah Movahedi Kermani used his address at Friday prayers to warn that any deal struck in Geneva between Iran and the west would be detrimental for the Islamic republic. \"It's harmful to underestimate the enemy because they do nothing other than playing tricks. Our enemy would not rest even for a moment. If we underestimate the enemy we will definitely get hurt,\" he told crowds in Tehran. \"The US secretary of state has pledged Netanyahu that he will not do a bad deal with Iran. It means that they will not agree to an agreement which is harmful for them which means they will not make a good deal with Iran.\" \"I don't think the talks will bear fruit. They are not going to stop their enmity with us,\" he said.- Zarif is not the only participant in the Geneva talks likely to face resistance back home. In Washington on Thursday, the US Senate said it would move ahead with a debate on tough new sanctions on Iran after the Geneva meeting was over. Some senators have said they would consider loosening the sanctions regime, but only in return for significant concessions from Tehran. In another sign of progress on Thursday, Zarif said the head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, would visit Tehran on Monday, raising expectations of a breakthrough in long-running talks between the Iranian government and the agency aimed at clearing up uncertainty over Iran's past development work on nuclear weapons. Zarif said: \"Mr Amano's visit is going to be an important indication that we are in process in moving forward.\" His optimistic remarks followed a full meeting of all the delegates and separate discussions between Iranian officials and diplomats from the US, Russia and China, and talks with the three European states represented – the UK, France and Germany. British and Iranian diplomats discussed the eventual appointment of non-resident charges d'affaires in each other's countries. Zarif had cancelled a trip to Rome so that he could hold a face-to-face meeting with Ashton as it became clear that substantial progress was being made."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/nov/09/us-media-iran-scare-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-09T15:36:32Z","webTitle":"Why do the US media believe the worst about Iran? | Brian Whitaker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/09/us-media-iran-scare-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/09/us-media-iran-scare-stories","fields":{"headline":"Why do the US media believe the worst about Iran?","bodyText":"\"One of the oldest tricks in the run-up to a war is to spread terrifying stories of things that the enemy may be about to do. Government officials plant these tales, journalists water them and the public, for the most part, swallow them.\" I wrote this paragraph in December 2002, some three months before the US launched its invasion of Iraq, but it seems just as applicable today in relation to Iran. The Iraq war of 2003 followed a long media build-up in which talk about Saddam Hussein's imaginary weapons of mass destruction, simply by virtue of its constant repetition, led many prominent journalists to abandon their critical faculties. The Washington Post, for instance, devoted an extraordinary 1,800 words to an extremely flimsy (but scary) story suggesting Iraq had supplied nerve gas to al-Qaida. The paper later conceded that its coverage of the Iraqi WMD issue had been seriously defective, but by then it was too late to undo the damage. At the New York Times, meanwhile, star reporter Judith Miller was churning out more alarmist stuff about Iraq. One story concerned US attempts to stop Iraq importing atropine, a drug used for treating heart patients which is also an effective antidote against pesticide poisoning ... and nerve gas. There were various possible interpretations, but the implication of this tale, as presented by Miller, with assistance from anonymous official sources, was that Iraq not only possessed nerve gas but intended to use it and wanted to protect its own troops from the harmful effects. Another of Miller's \"scoops\" was an unverified claim that a Russian scientist, who once had access to the Soviet Union's entire collection of 120 strains of smallpox, might have visited Iraq in 1990 and might have provided the Iraqis with a version of the virus that could be resistant to vaccines and could be more easily transmitted as a biological weapon. The story collapsed shortly afterwards when it emerged that the scientist had not, after all, visited Iraq in 1990. Just to be on the safe side, though, the Bush administration still pressed ahead with a smallpox vaccination programme – much to the delight of pharmaceutical companies. Fast-forward to 2011 and we're left wondering if these same newspapers have really taken on board the lessons of Iraq. Here, for example, is David Sanger, chief Washington correspondent of the New York Times, writing in its Sunday Review last weekend: At the White House and the CIA, officials say the recently disclosed Iranian plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States – by blowing up a tony Georgetown restaurant frequented by senators, lobbyists and journalists – was just the tip of the iceberg. Note how the allegation of an \"Iranian plot\" in the US – which was greeted with a good deal of scepticism when it first surfaced last month – now appears to have become an established fact (even though it has yet to be tested in court). Not only that. Sanger's anonymous officials are now asking us to believe it is part of a bigger and even more menacing Iranian plot which stretches across continents from the Yemen to Latin America. At the Washington Post, meanwhile, Joby Warrick has been briefed by David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector who now heads the Institute for Science and International Security. Citing Albright, Warrick describes Iranian work on a detonation device known as the R265 generator: \"According to the intelligence provided to the IAEA, key assistance in both areas [design and testing] was provided by Vyacheslav Danilenko, a former Soviet nuclear scientist who was contracted in the mid-1990s by Iran's Physics Research Center, a facility linked to the country's nuclear programme.\" The way this is presented in the Washington Post, it points very clearly to the idea that Iran was working on a trigger for a nuclear bomb. But look elsewhere and that interpretation becomes less certain: possibly it wasn't nuclear at all, but a project to manufacture nanodiamonds. Of course, these are extremely murky waters and I'm not at all sure who to believe. There is probably a lot of deception taking place on both sides. But what seems to me extraordinary is the reluctance of journalists – especially in the US mainstream – to acknowledge the uncertainties and their willingness to accept what, as far as Iran is concerned, are the most incriminating interpretations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2014/mar/11/gchq-national-security-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-11T16:35:21Z","webTitle":"If GCHQ wants to improve national security it must fix our technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/11/gchq-national-security-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/mar/11/gchq-national-security-technology","fields":{"headline":"If GCHQ wants to improve national security it must fix our technology","bodyText":"In a recent column, security expert Bruce Schneier proposed breaking up the NSA – handing its offensive capabilities work to US Cyber Command and its law enforcement work to the FBI, and terminating its programme of attacking internet security. In place of this, Schneier proposed that “instead of working to deliberately weaken security for everyone, the NSA should work to improve security for everyone.” This is a profoundly good idea for reasons that may not be obvious at first blush. People who worry about security and freedom on the internet have long struggled with the problem of communicating the urgent stakes to the wider public. We speak in jargon that’s a jumble of mixed metaphors – viruses, malware, trojans, zero days, exploits, vulnerabilities, RATs – that are the striated fossil remains of successive efforts to come to grips with the issue. When we do manage to make people alarmed about the stakes, we have very little comfort to offer them, because Internet security isn’t something individuals can solve. I remember well the day this all hit home for me. It was nearly exactly a year ago, and I was out on tour with my novel Homeland, which tells the story of a group of young people who come into possession of a large trove of government leaks that detail a series of illegal programmes through which supposedly democratic governments spy on people by compromising their computers. I kicked the tour off at the gorgeous, daring Seattle Public Library main branch, in a hi-tech auditorium to an audience of 21st-century dwellers in one of the technology revolution’s hotspots, home of Microsoft and Starbucks (an unsung technology story – the coffee chain is basically an IT shop that uses technology to manage and deploy coffee around the world). I explained the book’s premise, and then talked about how this stuff works in the real world. I laid out a parade of awfuls, including a demonstrated attack that hijacked implanted defibrillators from 10 metres’ distance and caused them to compromise other defibrillators that came into range, implanting an instruction to deliver lethal shocks at a certain time in the future. I talked about Cassidy Wolf, the reigning Miss Teen USA, whose computer had been taken over by a “sextortionist” who captured nude photos of her and then threatened to release them if she didn’t perform live sex shows for him. I talked about the future of self-driving cars, smart buildings, implanted hearing aids and robotic limbs, and explained that the world is made out of computers that we put our bodies into, and that we put inside our bodies. These computers are badly secured. What’s more, governments and their intelligence agencies are actively working to undermine the security of our computers and networks. This was before the Snowden revelations, but we already knew that governments were buying “zero-day vulnerabilities” from security researchers. These are critical bugs that can be leveraged to compromise entire systems. Until recently, the normal response to the discovery of one of these “vulns” was to report them to the vendor so they could be repaired. But spy-agencies and law-enforcement have created a bustling marketplace for “zero-days,” which are weaponised for the purpose of attacking the computers and networks of “bad guys”. The incentives have shifted, and now a newly discovered bug had a good chance of remaining unpatched and live in the field because governments wanted to be able to use it to hack their enemies. Scientists formulate theories that they attempt to prove through experiments that are reviewed by peers, who attempt to spot flaws in the reasoning and methodology. Scientific theories are in a state of continuous, tumultuous improvement as old ideas are overturned in part or whole, and replaced with new ones. Security is science on meth. There is a bedrock of security that is considered relatively stable – the mathematics of scrambling and descrambling messages – but everything above that bedrock has all the stability of a half-set custard. That is, the best way to use those stable, well-validated algorithms is mostly up for grabs, as the complex interplay of incompatible systems, human error, legacy systems, regulations, laziness, recklessness, naivete, adversarial cunning and perverse commercial incentives all jumble together in ways that open the American retailer Target to the loss of 100m credit card numbers, and the whole internet to GCHQ spying. As Schneier says: “Anyone can design a security system that works so well that he can’t figure out how to break it.” That is to say, your best effort at security is, by definition, only secure against people who are at least as dumb as you are. Unless you happen to be the smartest person in the world, you need to subject your security system to the kind of scrutiny that scientists use to validate their theories, and be prepared to incrementally patch and refactor things as new errors are discovered and reported. Hence: “Security is a process, not a product” – another useful Schneierism. This is a distinction that sets security engineering apart from other engineering disciplines. Other kinds of engineers exist in a changing world, but security’s change is of a different sort altogether. For example, structural engineering is a field under continuous improvement, and tomorrow’s structural engineers will be able to apply better techniques to their work, but no one worries that someone will invent a way of making skyscrapers collapse tomorrow through application of an easily automated, low-cost technique. The difference is that security engineering is an adversarial discipline. A structural engineer must contend with the forces of entropy and gravity, of harsh winds and rising seas. But a security engineer must contend with enemy security engineers who labour every hour of every day to find flaws in her work and use those flaws to covertly undermine it. I think there’s a good case security engineering not being “engineering” at all. Engineers try to erect and maintain infrastructure against threats that are indifferent to them. These threats may be powerful – floods in the Philippines, earthquakes in Haiti – but they aren’t deliberate. The world doesn’t have a will. It doesn’t care if the earth shakes or not. But security adversaries want to break security. They lack the relentless force of physics, but exert something totally nonphysical: cunning. Security as an exercise in public health If security isn’t engineering, what is it? I think there’s a good case to be made for security as an exercise in public health. It sounds weird at first, but the parallels are fascinating and deep and instructive. Last year, when I finished that talk in Seattle, a talk about all the ways that insecure computers put us all at risk, a woman in the audience put up her hand and said, “Well, you’ve scared the hell out of me. Now what do I do? How do I make my computers secure?” And I had to answer: “You can’t. No one of us can. I was a systems administrator 15 years ago. That means that I’m barely qualified to plug in a WiFi router today. I can’t make my devices secure and neither can you. Not when our governments are buying up information about flaws in our computers and weaponising them as part of their crime-fighting and anti-terrorism strategies. Not when it is illegal to tell people if there are flaws in their computers, where such a disclosure might compromise someone’s anti-copying strategy. But: If I had just stood here and spent an hour telling you about water-borne parasites; if I had told you about how inadequate water-treatment would put you and everyone you love at risk of horrifying illness and terrible, painful death; if I had explained that our very civilisation was at risk because the intelligence services were pursuing a strategy of keeping information about pathogens secret so they can weaponise them, knowing that no one is working on a cure; you would not ask me ‘How can I purify the water coming out of my tap?’” Because when it comes to public health, individual action only gets you so far. It doesn’t matter how good your water is, if your neighbour’s water gives him cholera, there’s a good chance you’ll get cholera, too. And even if you stay healthy, you’re not going to have a very good time of it when everyone else in your country is striken and has taken to their beds. If you discovered that your government was hoarding information about water-borne parasites instead of trying to eradicate them; if you discovered that they were more interested in weaponising typhus than they were in curing it, you would demand that your government treat your water-supply with the gravitas and seriousness that it is due. The public health analogy is suprisingly apt here. The public health threat-model is in a state of continuous flux, because our well-being is under continuous, deliberate attack from pathogens for whom we are, at best, host organisms, and at worst, dinner. Evolution drives these organisms to a continuously shifting array of tactics to slide past our defenses. Public health isn’t just about pathogens, either – its thorniest problems are about human behaviour and social policy. HIV is a blood-borne disease, but disrupting its spread requires changes to our attitudes about sex, pharmaceutical patents, drugs policy and harm minimisation. Almost everything interesting about HIV is too big to fit on a microscope slide. And so it is for security: crypto is awesome maths, but it’s just maths. Security requires good password choice, good password management, good laws about compelled crypto disclosure, transparency into corporate security practices, and, of course, an end to the governmental practice of spending $250M/year on anti-security sabotage through the NSA/GCHQ programmes Bullrun and Edgehill. Everything involves the internet But for me, the most important parallel between public health and internet security is their significance to our societal wellbeing. Everything we do today involves the internet. Everything we do tomorrow will require the internet. If you live near a nuclear power plant, fly in airplanes, ride in cars or trains, have an implanted pacemaker, keep money in the bank, or carry a phone, your safety and well-being depend on a robust, evolving, practice of network security. This is the most alarming part of the Snowden revelations: not just that spies are spying on all of us – that they are actively sabotaging all of our technical infrastructure to ensure that they can continue to spy on us. There is no way to weaken security in a way that makes it possible to spy on “bad guys” without making all of us vulnerable to bad guys, too. The goal of national security is totally incompatible with the tactic of weakening the nation’s information security. “Virus” has been a term of art in the security world for decades, and with good reason. It’s a term that resonates with people, even people with only a cursory grasp of technology. As we strive to make the public and our elected representatives understand what’s at stake, let’s expand that pathogen/epidemiology metaphor. We’d never allow MI5 to suppress information on curing typhus so they could attack terrorists by infecting them with it. We need to stop allowing the NSA and GCHQ to suppress information on fixing bugs in our computers, phones, cars, houses, planes, and bodies. If GCHQ wants to improve the national security of the United Kingdom – if the NSA want to impove the American national security – they should be fixing our technology, not breaking it. The technology of Britons and Americans is under continuous, deadly attack from criminals, from foreign spies, and from creeps. Our security is better served by armouring us against these threats than it is by undermining security so that cops and spies have an easier time attacking “bad guys.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/aug/04/dash-for-gas-false-start","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-03T23:01:04Z","webTitle":"Why the 'dash for gas' has got off to a false start","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/04/dash-for-gas-false-start","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/aug/04/dash-for-gas-false-start","fields":{"headline":"Why the 'dash for gas' has got off to a false start","bodyText":"For all the talk of a dash for gas, the government-backed race for a new generation of power stations has had few willing participants thus far. So the suggestion last week by the chief executive of Drax, the UK's biggest coal-fired power station, that she might invest in new gas plants was a surprise. Nonetheless, her words were hedged with a caution shared by the rest of the energy industry. \"We could start to look at it. But it would depend very much on the details of the government's energy market reforms,\" said Dorothy Thompson. But even with the caveats, this was the biggest expression of enthusiasm for new gas power that the UK has seen in some time. The government is desperate to bring new gas-fired energy generation on stream, as a way of avoiding shortfalls in electricity supply when ageing coal and nuclear power stations are taken out of service. But there is a marked absence of building projects and a distinct chill where new investment is concerned. At least 14GW of new gas-fired power stations have received planning consent, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. So in theory construction work on this new dawn of gas power could start immediately. But there is only one such station being built – the 800MW Carrington plant in Manchester, owned by Irish utility ESB – and none of the big companies have active plans to begin work on any others. Centrica, owner of British Gas, confirmed last week that its plans for a site in King's Lynn were still on hold. Scottish and Southern Energy made a pointed reference to the government's electricity market reform, which aims to ensure that there is enough investment in power generation to avoid blackouts, while meeting 2050 greenhouse-gas targets. On top of that, electricity supply must be cost effective, even though a key part of government energy policy is the so-called capacity mechanism, which will put gas-powered plants on standby to fill gaps in solar and wind-powered electricity supply. SSE said: \"Although projects such as Abernedd are close to being 'shovel-ready' and others such as Keadby 2 are at an advanced stage of development, unless there is a significant change in UK government policy around EMR [electricity market reform] and the timing and operation of a future capacity mechanism, and clear market signals suggesting the need for increased gas-fired generation capacity, SSE does not expect to take any final investment decisions to construct these projects until at least 2015. This will effectively mean no new capacity will come into operation until 2017/18 at the earliest, given the lead times for constructing new CCGT plant.\" RWE npower said it had applied for a permit at its Willington site, but that this was \"in the very very early stages\". The mismatch between the government's aspirations and the industry's actions is growing larger. Ministers need to show progress by the next general election if their energy strategy is to have any credibility. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, told the Guardian last year he wanted at least 20 new gas-powered plants, while some estimates predict a need for about 30 sites. Gas is viewed as a key back-up for renewable energy, as – unlike nuclear – it can be turned on relatively quickly if demand spikes and it is much greener than coal. The prospect of an indigenous gas source from shale has also been touted by ministers. Another key advantage, from the coalition's point of view, is that gas stations can be constructed relatively quickly, taking about two to three years and costing about £1bn each. With energy chiefs citing the danger of power shortages in years, gas could be used to plug the gap. So why aren't companies following the government's script? Part of the reticence is down to the government itself. Investors are waiting to see how the capacity market, or those power plants designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs in low-carbon generation, will work in practice. One energy executive said: \"We are like everyone else in this industry – waiting to see the details of what the government comes up with and whether it works.\" But, more worryingly for the government, the economics of gas are also unattractive. \"No one is making money on gas,\" said another industry insider. \"The margins are so thin. Coal is making piles of money.\" Peter Atherton, energy analyst at Liberum, said companies also faced the prospect of building plants that would be running at only a fraction of their capacity for most of their 25-year lives, in order to meet the government's carbon budgets in the 2020s and 2030s. Plants could end up operating at only 20% of capacity, or being kept on standby to be used only during the winter peak, he said. That, together with poor economics of gas at present, added up to \"far too much risk\" for investors, he said. \"The attractiveness of gas has gone from being a small positive to a massive negative.\" Energy UK, which represents the energy industry, said companies would need further reassurance from government and better market conditions. A spokeswoman said: \"People need to have confidence to build any form of major project and, when it comes to gas power stations, continued uncertainty weakens market signals and undermines confidence that new investments will make a profit. Gas is also more expensive than coal and carbon which are currently very cheap.\" The department of energy said that it was for private sector investors to make their own decisions on infrastructure investments. \"It is a commercial decision for the applicant to decide whether or not to proceed with the proposed project.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/oct/30/more-reasons-defend-indefensible","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-30T20:59:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: More reasons not to defend the indefensible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/more-reasons-defend-indefensible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/oct/30/more-reasons-defend-indefensible","fields":{"headline":"Trident: more reasons not to defend the indefensible","bodyText":"The Guardian is to be congratulated for its forensic critique of government policy on Trident (Editorial, 30 October). In pointing out the compelling strategic, economic and moral arguments against Britain maintaining (let alone replacing) a nuclear weapons system, the absurdity of committing £100bn to Trident replacement is laid bare. But there is one further argument which needs to be made here: scrapping Trident is a vote winner – and this is something Labour and the Lib Dems must understand. The case must be made in no uncertain terms: would the public rather have essential services or a redundant weapons system? Do the military want usable equipment or an outmoded totem? And does the world need another hypocritical nuclear-armed state paying lip service to disarmament while ploughing billions into its nuclear arsenal? Domestically and internationally, Britain should be bold in rejecting nuclear weapons. They're indefensible and worthless – and who would want to defend that? Kate Hudson General secretary, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament • Why do not opponents of Trident take the straightforward, compelling and unanswerable stance that it is not Britain's to use? Trident's guidance system is controlled by the US, and the notion that Washington is going to allow its erstwhile colonial rulers to choose a target for such a devastating WMD is outside the realms of reality. The origins of this ludicrous situation go back to Trident's predecessor, Polaris, on which Harold Macmillan and his close ally John F Kennedy made a deal at Nassau in 1962 for Britain to have a figleaf arrangement, masquerading as independent control, in order to assuage backbench Tory outrage over the US's unilateral abandonment of the Skybolt missile that was to be used in RAF bombers. Skybolt was flawed, but it would at least have been an independent system. Trident is the opposite. Your leader, Nick Clegg's criticisms, Polly Toynbee's Comment piece and Martin Rowson's typically brilliant cartoon all missed the chance to nail the pretence that Trident is independent. John Webster London • Trident is neither British nor independent, and it isn't much of a deterrent. And hardly a bargain. Evidence to the Commons defence select committee demonstrated that Trident depends crucially for launch and target acquisition data on US military GPS satnav. You can be sure that if we tried to do something the White House didn't approve, the satnav would be switched off. Peter Johnston Bolton, Lancashire • In 1986, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, said: \"The accident at Chernobyl showed again what an abyss will open if nuclear war befalls mankind.\" He later said it was that accident that triggered the end of the cold war. As long as there are nuclear power stations in the world the deterrent value of nuclear weapons is illusory. In a nuclear war the real damage will be caused by uncontrollable emissions of radioactive material from nuclear reactors and their associated storage zones. Britain has plenty of nuclear power stations. As the prevailing winds in Britain are southwesterly, the likely victims of any attack on us will be to our east: Russia and China, the presumed objects of Trident. They have nuclear power stations, too. If Trident were ever to be used, the entire northern hemisphere would become uninhabitable. Craig Sams Hastings, East Sussex • Philip Hammond's go-ahead for Trident replacement (Tories snub Lib Dems over Trident future, 29 October) is just a ploy to scupper Scottish independence. It has nothing to do with being the \"ultimate safeguard for Britain's security\". The US has 14 Trident submarines and none of that killing power prevented the attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Billions of pounds of public money are to be spent on a dangerous, destabilising weapon that will only increase the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons. Rae Street Littleborough, Lancashire • The government claims a replacement for Trident is necessary for the creation of high-quality jobs and vital skills. This is profoundly depressing. To believe we have to invest in weapons of destruction is to totally ignore more peaceful and constructive investments, such as securing our energy needs through renewable energy or providing zero-carbon housing, hospitals and schools. We can develop high-quality jobs through ensuring a living wage, decent working hours, protection against unfair dismissal and so many other initiatives that this government considers unnecessary. Jean Lambert MEP Green, London • Polly Toynbee and others should be urging Ed Miliband to make a referendum on the future of Trident a matter of Labour policy. This is an issue that concerns the kind of country (and world) we want our grandchildren to inherit; the spending priorities we want our politicians to attend to; and whether the kind of defence we want for our community needs to be quite so apocalyptic. The debate and discussion around such an issue would be a collective airing of both the rational and irrational, and could return democracy back to where it belongs – our peoples. It might also be a fitting tribute to the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis from which, thank God, we all came through. John Hills Canterbury, Kent • When is the Labour party going to stop being frightened of its own shadow on this issue? I fear that they, like the Tories, are seduced by big toys. We deserve better.

The Communication Workers Union is mounting an anti-privatisation campaign and is balloting postal workers asking them to vote for or against the privatisation plans. The results from the ballot are due on 19 June and could lead to industrial action. Staff: 150,000 Possible bidders: A stock market flotation in London, with staff granted shares equal to 10% of the company, is the preferred option. However, business minister Michael Fallon has said other options are still \"on the table\", including a sale to sovereign wealth funds or other foreign buyers. Student loan book/Student Loans Company Value: 1st tranche: £900m What stage in the process: Business secretary Vince Cable revealed in March plans to sell a book of mortgage-style student loans with a face value of £900m. The market value is likely to be lower however, as the loans in question were issued between 1990 and 1998 and are mostly in arrears or deferred. The government has stated the private sector may be able to improve the collection of repayments \"using their expertise\". There is a possibility the rest of the loan book, worth £45.9bn in March 2012, could follow. A BIS spokesman said the government \"continues to explore options for monetising student loans\". Staff: 2,260 Possible bidders: Banks, investment funds, financial institutions Urenco Value: UK stake: £3bn What stage in the process: The government put its one-third stake in the nuclear processor up for sale in April, after securing agreement from its Dutch and German partners. The Dutch government also owns a third, while Germancompanies RWE and E.On jointly own the rest. All parties are now thought to be willing to sell their stakes in the uranium enrichment company, paving the way for a potential £9bn auction. Urenco has the gas centrifugal capacity not only to fuel the 430 nuclear power plants worldwide but also to make a nuclear bomb. Staff: 1,600 worldwide Possible bidders: Financial buyers, most likely infrastructure investors and sovereign wealth funds. Trade buyers including France's Areva and Canada's Cameco are also likely to look at it, and a flotation has not been ruled out. Search and rescue Value: £1.6bn What stage in the process: The 10-year contract has been awarded by the Department for Transport to US-based Bristow, which will take over search and rescue helicopter duties from the RAF and Royal Navy on a phased basis from April 2015. Bristow will also take on civilian search and rescue bases run by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The current fleet of Sea King helicopters, as flown by Prince William, will be retired. Eleven Sikorsky S-92 and 11 AgustaWestland AW189 helicopters will be located at 10 bases across the UK. Staff: Bristow plans to employ 350 people to carry out the contract. Bidders: Won by Bristow Plasma Resources UK Value: £200m What stage in the process: Health minister Dan Poulter announced in January that the Department of Health is examining a sale of part of all of Plasma Resources UK to the private sector as \"the best way for it to achieve growth.\" Potential investors were asked to state what level of resources they would make available, how they planned to grow operations, and how products would be developed. Staff: 1,200 (200 in the UK, 1,000 in the US) Possible bidders: Bioscience and healthcare companies. Baxter, Grifols and Biotest are likely to consider, as well as private equity firms. Banks Value: Dependent on share prices What stage in the process: Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, bailed out in the wake of the financial crisis with £66bn of taxpayer funds, will be returned to the private sector at a point yet to be determined, but it is thought that George Osborne and David Cameron wants them fully returned to the private sector before the next election in 2015. The government could start selling off shares in the companies on a phased basis. RBS is 81% owned by the taxpayer, while Lloyds is 39% state owned. The parliamentary commission on banking standards may recommend that RBS be nationalised, then split into a good bank and a bad bank, but the government is unlikely to be supportive, partly because it could slow down the privatisation process. Shares could be sold or gifted to the public.

Apparently, the theme for the Olympic opening will be the British countryside complete with sheep (The real Britain, 13 June). Will they lead or follow the athletes or, as is their wont, simply wander about, chew grass and defecate. What period of our history will feature? If it is pre-industrial revolution, will we be enthralled by be-smocked, forelock-tugging yokels, shire horses and the squire and his lady, completed by a facsimile of a thatched hovel and appropriate agricultural odours and noises? Instead of this bucolic heaven, we could show the world how advanced we are by asking Monsanto to sponsor a display by a real crop sprayer, muck-spreader and giant tractor. The scene would be incomplete without cloned sheep, BSE-addled cows, a farrowing pen and some lame battery hens. No wildlife though. There isn't any. The organisers have done us proud. Paul Erlanger Redditch, Worcestershire • Now we know. The opening ceremony of the London 2012 Games will be a tawdry and risible pageant which will attempt to evoke Britain's \"green and pleasant\" land – minus its rubbish dumps, nuclear power stations and factory farms – in London's East End, at the trifling cost of £27m and the efforts of 10,000 volunteers. Surely only The Wurzels will do for the opening ceremony? Sasha Simic London • No mention of a wind farm. Michael Wharton Darsham, Suffolk • Danny Boyle's surreal vista is not destined to go down well with the many people battling to keep the East End green against the onslaught of London 2012 diggers. Areas including Hackney Marshes, Wanstead Flats and Leyton Marshes – \"London's countryside\" – are being destroyed. Leyton Marshes, dug up for a temporary basketball training facility which unearthed toxic bomb clearance waste, left in uncovered piles until local people campaigned to get it removed – is just one example of how our open spaces are being sacrificed for this bombast. Celia Coram London • It's no wonder the English are confused about their identity (Letters, 13 June). Boyle's Britain is England's \"green and pleasant land\" albeit with thistles and flax (Northern Ireland?). UK, Britain, England are used synonymously. Jim McLean London • The 2012 Olympic Games were awarded to London, not to Britain or the UK. In what way do sheep, chickens and Glastonbury Tor represent our great city? Paul Dennehy London • Who is going to tell Danny Boyle that Glastonbury Tor has a tower on the top, not a tree? Peter Domone London • It is extraordinary for the sports and Olympics minister, Hugh Robertson, to boast now that the Olympics will cost less than the budget when it has more than doubled from the previous budget (Report, 13 June).

Thanks for reading, and for the many, many comments. We’re back tomorrow from 7am UK time for full, live coverage until we finally know what’s happened. Tomorrow is a big day. If you’re in the UK and eligible to vote in the referendum, please do. It’s a decision which could affect the country for decades to come. And it’s close. Unlike a general election, where the fate of the nation hangs on a few marginal constituencies, here everyone has a chance to nudge things their way. So whatever you believe, do take part. Earlier my colleague Frances Perraudin was at a tribute to Jo Cox in her home town: While tributes were paid to Jo Cox in Westminster, around 2,000 people gathered in the market square in Batley to celebrate the life of their MP. Many, including the handful of police at the event, wore white roses – the symbol of Yorkshire – and brought bunches of flowers to contribute to the large pile outside the town hall. Watched by her parents Gordon and Jean, Jo Cox’s sister, Kim Leadbeater, thanked all those who had sent their love and sympathy to the family over the last few days. “Knowing that Jo touched the lives of so many people has genuinely made a huge difference to us,” she told the crowd, many of whom were in tears. “From Batley to Burma and the Spen Valley to Syria, Jo’s life was centred around helping people and standing up for the causes she felt so passionately about,” she said. “My sister would want her murder to mobilise people, to get on with things, to try to make a positive difference in whatever way we can, to come together and unite against hate and division and to fight instead for inclusion, love and unity. In Jo’s honour, and on behalf of her grieving family, I urge you to please do so.” Ebrahim Bulsari, 43, who came to pay tribute with his wife and two small children, said that Jo Cox had achieved a huge amount for the local community in the short time she was an MP. “I voted for her and she even took a picture with [my little girl],” he says. “It’s a sad loss. She did so much for people in the community regardless of colour or creed. She was there for everyone.” Martin Jones, 65, a retired special needs teacher and a member of Kirklees United Against Fascism group said that on one level he wasn’t surprised by Jo Cox’s murder because of what he called a “persistent and low-key” problem with fascism in the area. “It’s important that we all gather today because of what Jo Cox said: ‘We have more in common than that which divides us’. And fascism wants to divide and rule by scapegoating migrants and refugees and Jo Cox stood up for those people.” Sophie, 44, who didn’t want to give her last name, said she lived around the corner from Cox’s parents and that the murder hadn’t changed her view of the area. “It’s a nice place. There are good and bad people everywhere.” She is sure that the MP’s death will effect the way people in the constituency will vote in the EU referendum. “Everyone who was sitting on the fence will probably decide to vote to stay in,” she says. Here’s an extract from David Cameron’s speech earlier. My colleague Amber Jamieson was outside the UN building in New York to see yet another tribute event for Jo Cox. Around 200 people gathered at the United Nations in New York to hear top diplomats, politicians and colleagues pay tribute to Jo Cox. White roses were pinned to the lapels of those who spoke, with a large display of white hydrangeas and roses on the stage at the James P Grant Plaza, part of the UN complex in Manhattan. Many who gathered were friends and colleagues from Cox’s NGO and international humanitarian work. “I couldn’t help but think that one day she would have made a wonderful leader here at the United Nations,” said Matthew Rycroft, the British ambassador to the United Nations, who spoke of her humanitarian work in places such as Darfur and Syria and her ability to use charm and steely determination to get money and change for issues she believed in. Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the UN, read a statement from President Obama paying tribute to Cox’s life, noting that the young activist come over to the USA to volunteer on his 2008 campaign. “She gave a time and passion to a country that was not her own because she believed in an idea that transcends borders and culture: the power of people to bring about change from the grassroots up,” said Obama. Justin Forsyth, the deputy director of Unicef and a long-time friend and former colleague of Cox’s at Oxfam, led the proceedings. A performer from Broadway’s Les Miserables, Devin Iiaw, sang Empty Chairs, Empty Tables, apparently a favourite of Cox and her husband Brendan’s. Stephen O’Brien, former UK MP and the UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, choked up as he paid tribute to Cox, along with a variety of her former colleagues at Oxfam and friends who spoke. David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and former foreign secretary, spoke of how Cox’s death reminded him of Anna Lindh, the Swedish politician killed in 2005, and quoted words said by then EU Commissioner Chris Patten about Lindh’s death: “The most beautiful symphonies are sometimes those which are unfinished” And even in Manhattan, 3350 miles away from her hometown in Yorkshire, there was another young politically active woman from Batley and and Spen. Muna Abbas, a political advisor from the House of Lords, spoke about her mentor and inspiration. “She taught us that the world was our oyster but that Batley was always home,’ said Abbas, telling of how until last week the most famous resident of Batley was scientist Joseph Priestley, and that a statue of him mere metres from where Cox was killed has turned into a floral tribute for her. “It is is as if he has passed on the baton to her as the new hero of our hometown,” said Abbas. The UN choir finished the event with a performance of Amazing Grace. It has just been announced that Nigel Farage has pulled out of tonight’s debate on Channel 4, citing family reasons. Jeremy Paxman is to present the final live European Referendum debate, a 90 minute discussion including 150 handpicked guests, consisting of 50 remain, 50 leave and 50 undecided, starting at 9pm. Many of the guests are politicians, including Alan Johnson and Chuka Umunna, who will be joined by a wide-ranging panel including TV presenters Billie JD Porter and Ulrika Jonsson, and actor Leslie Ash. What are we to make of the final remain rally outside Birmingham university? A few elements stand out. The first is that while he was the star attraction, David Cameron was arguably the least interesting speaker. It was not because he was poor – he was passionate and engaged. But the message was very familiar, almost entirely about the perceived threats to the economy and to security of Brexit. These are the issues on which Cameron believes remain will win, if they do. Also on show was the breadth of the remain camp. Yes, leave have a few Labour MPs among their ranks. But this featured former or current leaders of four parties – the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and Greens – as well as trade unionists. It’s a broad church. And yet this weight of political opinion could still lose tomorrow. It also showed off Tim Farron to good effect. As leaders of a much-shrunk party he is a far less well-known figure than Nick Clegg. But he made a good case. The standout turn was, however, Gordon Brown, prowling the stage in righteous fury, turning to face each side of the crowd in turn. It’s probably too late to sway many voters, but it was a passionate, engaged, positive case for stating in. Here’s they key passage, when he referred to the slightly tawdry debate so far: This is not the Britain I know. This is not the Britain I love. The Britain I know is better than the Britain of these debates, of insults, of posters. The Britain I know is better as it deals with some of the great challenges of our time. The Britain I know is better than the exaggerations and overexaggerations that we have seen. The Britain I know is the Britain of Jo Cox. The Britain where people are tolerant, and not prejudiced, and where people hate hate. Here’s a video of Brendan Cox making his emotional address at his late wife’s memorial service. My colleague Jessica Elgot was at the Trafalgar Square memorial of Jo Cox. She sends this: Jo Cox’s murder has inspired far more love than the hatred that killed, her husband has said in an deeply emotional tribute at a celebration of the murdered MPs life on what would have been her 42nd birthday. It included tributes from Malala, Bono, Bill Nighy and Lily Allen, as well as Syria’s humanitarian rescuers, the white helmets. In Trafalgar Square, more than 10,000 people gathered in the humidity, played in by the couple’s favourite band, Diddley Dee, who played at their wedding and had become close friends of the pair. Each touch at the event, named More In Common after the words of Cox’s maiden speech, was intensely personal, a tribute song recorded by Bono who admired Cox’s work with Oxfam, a performance by Lily Allen of Keane’s Somewhere Only We Know, a song the family sang at the holiday cottage on the river Wye. Children from her five-year-old son’s school sang civil rights anthem If I Had A Hammer. Brendan Cox, his voice catching, called his wife’s death “an act of terror designed to advance hatred against others.” “What a beautiful irony it is that an act designed to advance hatred has instead generated such an outpouring of love,” he said. Among the crowd were the close knit community of Hermitage Moorings, where Cox lived on the family house boat. Wearing white roses, the goup carried a six-foot banner with a picture of their friend, designed in the style of trade union banners. Maria Carey, the couple’s next door neighbour, designed the banner in a race against time to get it ready for Wednesday, sketching the design and begging firms to print over the weekend. “She was the most wonderful person, always positive, it has been a privilege to know her personally and inspiring to see her professionally,” Carey said. Here’s a better extract from Gordon Brown’s passionate speech earlier. Cameron ends, his voice sounding hoarse: Let’s go out there and vote remain tomorrow, Thursday. Let’s go for it! And with that, the rally is finished. Cameron tells voters to ignore untruths from the leave side on Turkey joining the EU imminently, an EU army and the fabled sum of £350m a week going to the bloc. “Don’t go and vote on the basis of things which are not true,” he says. Cameron says the one word he would use to sum up his argument is, “together”. Cameron cites Churchill, saying he did not want to fight alone in Europe. Cameron is going hard on the economy. His final message to undecided voters is: “Put jobs first, put the economy first.” This is a greatest hits run through by Cameron. He makes a previously-heard analogy about not driving a car which a mechanic says is unsafe. He lists the need to cooperate over terrorism, climate change, Russia and Islamic State. “The idea that you take back control by leaving is an illusion,” Cameron warns. There’s lot of mentions of terrorism, crime and safety. Cameron is in his shirtsleeves, roaming the stage and waving his hands. “Wasn’t that a belter of a speech from Gordon Brown?” he asks, also praising Tim Farron. He goes straight onto the need for a strong economy, saying it “is everything”. He is again scathing about Michael Gove’s comparison of experts warning against Brexit to Nazis. “That is the extent to which they have lost it,” Cameron says. We’ve not heard from him yet, but David Cameron is here. He’s now being introduced. Next we have the current Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron. This is a very big, very cross-party event. He says he will not have the definition of patriotism defined by “little Englanders”. This is another passionate speech. “I will vote remain tomorrow because I am a patriot,” he says. In the meantime, here’s a final average of polls for tomorrow’s vote – and it’s tied at 45% each, with the crucial 10% still undecided. It’s up to them now. Lucas introduces the former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown, who details what the EU does for security, based on his very wide foreign policy experience. As we await David Cameron, another detail from the Jo Cox memorial in London. According to people there, as it took place a small plane carrying a banner urging a leave vote flew over a few times, prompting some displeasure. The official Vote Leave campaign has denied it organised this. Now we have Caroline Lucas, the Green MP. David Cameron is, presumably, sitting on the bus looking forwards to next week, when he no longer has to share platforms with people from the Labour, Green and trade union worlds. If you missed Gordon Brown speaking live, here’s a video snippet. A better shot of Brown speaking. Brown is finished, and stalks straight off the stage like a slightly angry bear. “Gordon Brown,” says Tristram Hunt, in awe, as the small-ish crowd – all seemingly hand-picked, as tends to happen at such events – cheers wildly. Now speaking is Cathy Warwick, who heads the Royal College of Midwives, which is officially pro-remain. She’s followed by former TUC head Brendan Barber. Brown is striding about, turning to face all the people around him, speaking without notes and passionately. He’s also now covered the benefits of security, the environment and defence of staying within the EU. He talks about 1,000 years of European conflict ended by the EU, and of a new era of human rights. “Now there is no war, Europe is at peace,” he positively bellows. This is stirring stuff, the type of very positive pro-EU speech some have argued the campaign has lacked so far. Brown is seemingly not a fan of the campaign so far: This is not the Britain I know, the Britain I love. The Britain I know is better than these debates, these insults, these posters. He wants a more positive Britain, one exemplified by Jo Cox. Next we have Gordon Brown. He also pays tribute to Jo Cox, and then talks at length about the economic and trade case for remaining in the EU. “If you want jobs to remain, vote remain. If you want industries to remain, vote remain,” he says. Tristram Hunt, the Stoke-on-Trent Labour MP, has emerged from the bus to introduce the first of the speakers. First we have Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader. She begins by paying tribute to Jo Cox. Tomorrow, she tells the crowd, you will make “the biggest political decision of your life, one that is irrevocable”. A giant union flag bus has pulled up outside Birmingham university. If it’s not David Cameron inside then it’s a very big coincidence. We should have some words from the prime minister soon. As we still await David Cameron – the live video feed is currently showing footage of officials seemingly shrugging about what is going on – here’s something which might sway the odd person towards remain – a suggestion from the venerable Foreign Policy journal that Brexit could jeopardise the making of the Game of Thrones TV show in Northern Ireland. Ione Wells was also at the Trafalgar Square memorial and talked to people as to why they attended: Caesar and Antonio are visiting the UK from Spain on holiday. Caesar (left) said they were devastated to hear of this “great tragedy”. They are here to show their belief in “freedom and respect for everyone”. Peter Bruggen said he was feeling “a great deal of sadness at this assassination” and also because he wishes to express his views on unity and the referendum. “I was living in Strasbourg aged 15 to learn French - living with a family. They took me to the cinema, and I saw early screenings of Churchill in meetings about unions. I was also taken to the opera and there, by chance, I sat right next to Robert Schuman - the prime minister of France at the time. Now, I don’t believe in these things but it felt like a message. I felt a closeness, a union, and have never had a doubt since that union was the right thing.” We have a final pre-voting poll and... well, if anyone says they can predict tomorrow’s result with much confidence they’re lying. This is Peter Walker taking over for a final couple of hours of the pre-referendum day live blog. As you’ll see from the updated video feed above, we’re due any moment to see David Cameron making a final appeal for the remain campaign, outside Birmingham university. We’re also promised a mystery special guest. Frostrup ends the Trafalgar Square event by urging the audience not to let this be just one day. Let’s take the spirit of unity and roll it out, she says. Back in Trafalgar Square Frostrup says Jo loved musicals. She particularly loved Les Miserables, and some of the cast are on state singing her favourite song, Do you hear the people sing? About 100 people including the Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray gathered on Portobello beach, Edinburgh, with candles marking out “more in common” pressed into the sand. They heard Jo Cox’s friend, Oxfam colleague and former bandmate Kim Wallace say Jo and Brendan Cox loved climbing in Scotland: they had summited 98 of the country’s 282 Munros, hills over 3,000 feet (914m) high, and were planning their 100th this summer. “Jo was fearless,” Wallace said, choking back tears. “Jo was killed by hatred and if that happened to anyone else, Jo would not have been silent. She would’ve called it for what it was. I encourage you all to love the world like Jo did.” The speaker in Trafalgar Square asks everyone in the crowd to hold hands with the people beside them and pledge to ‘love like Jo’. It is very un-British, the speaker says, “but Jo would have loved it.” Some of Jo’s friends are now addressing the crowd in Trafalgar Square. Malala Yousafza, who was shot as a schoolgirl for defying a Taliban ban on girls attending school and who subsequently won the Nobel Peace Prize, is speaking now. She says she knows from her own life how powerful it is when a family is lifted up in prayer. She says the idea that we have more in common than what separates us was not just a line in a speech for Cox. It was a principle that she lived her life by. She says Cox will not be remembered for the way she died. She will be remembered for the way she lived. We will live like Jo because we will love like Jo, she says. A choir from the school attended by Jo’s son Cuillin is singing If I had a hammer. There is a tribute from the White Helmets, volunteer search and rescue workers in Syria. Bill Nighy reads an extract from a speech by Robert Kennedy. Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation. Thousands of Peace Corps volunteers are making a difference in isolated villages and city slums in dozens of countries. Thousands of unknown men and women in Europe resisted the occupation of the Nazis and many died, but all added to the ultimate strength and freedom of their countries. It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance. The actress Gillian Anderson is reading a poem, I will stand for love. A video tribute from Bono is now being played. Bono says Jo Cox had all the patience in the world for people who needed help. Jo’s sister Kim Leadbeater is speaking from Batley. Her speech is being broadcast at the event at Trafalgar Square. She says people asked if she was worried about speaking at such a big event. But there are much harder things in life than talking about someone you love, she says. She says the family has been truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support they have received. Knowing that she touched the lives of so many people has made a huge difference, she says. She says Jo devoted her life to helping others. She did not always know or understand the causes Jo worked on. But there was a pattern: principles of justice, equality, tolerance, acceptance, peace and understanding. These can be applied globally, nationally or locally, she says. She says she does not understand why Jo was killed. But she knows that Jo would have wanted people to unite against division. Brendan Cox, Jo’s husband, is speaking now. He says that he wishes he was not here, and that he could be with her. Today is her birthday. She should have been in her constituency today. She would have been campaigning for people to stay in the EU because she thought that was so important. He says she was worried about the forces the EU referendum would unleash. But he says he does not want to talk about that today. He wants to talk about Jo. There are things about her people will not know from reading about her. She was not 5ft. She was at least 5ft 1, or 5ft 2 on a good day. She was impractical, and once went on a cycling holiday but forgot her bike. Above all, she was a mum. She was the best mum any child could wish for. And they wish to have her back in their lives. He says he and his children have spoken every day about what they miss. They try to think, not what they are losing, but how lucky they were to have her in their lives. He says one reason there has been so much support following her death is that she is seen to symbolise something under threat: tolerance. He says her killing was political. It was designed to generate hatred. But what a beautiful irony it is that her death has instead prompted an outpouring of love. Jo lived for her beliefs, and died for them, and for the rest of our lives we will honour them, he says. Frostrup says music was important to Jo. One of her favourite songs was Somewhere Only We Know, which the family used to sing as they left their cottage in Wales. She says when Lily Allen heard about this, she offered to sing it today. She is singing now. Mariella Frostrup, the broadcaster who was a friend of Jo Cox’s and who campaigned with her on various issues, is hosting the event. She says she and Cox campaigned together for gender equality, the education of girls and the alleviation of poverty. She says today would have been Cox’s 42nd birthday. They are honouring her as an activist and a humanitarian. Jo believed that people achieved more together, Frostrup she says. Representatives from various faith groups, and from the Humanist Association, are laying 42 white roses to commemorate Cox. Frostrup says today is also the birthday of Bernard Carter-Kenny, the pensioner who was seriously injured trying to save Cox. Frostrup sends her best wishes for his recovery. Here is the scene from Batley, in Jo Cox’s constituency, where another More In Commons event is taking place. Here is the scene from the More In Common event in Trafalgar Square in memory of Jo Cox. The band playing is Diddley Dee, a band that Jo loved and that played at her wedding. Later there will be a film tribute to Jo, speeches from her husband Brendan, her sister Kim Leadbeater and Malala, the Pakistani activist and Nobel Peace Prize winners, as well as video messages and music. We will be covering the proceedings in detail. Many users of the Guardian’s mobile app get notifications, or “push alerts”, on breaking news stories.

Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, has launched a vicious attack on leading figures campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, claiming that they want to privatise the NHS, inflict taxes that will hurt the poor and weaken workers’ rights. The Labour politician has hit out at Conservative figures, including Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith, as well as Ukip’s Nigel Farage, warning that British politics will shift quickly to the right if they win the referendum. “Why should anyone believe them when they claim they want to put people in control? Their track record tells us that their mission is nothing less than Thatcherism on steroids,” he wrote in the Guardian, arguing that their track record in politics was not to help the poor. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commision, has told British voters there will be no re-opening of talks on Britain’s place in the EU, in the event of a vote to leave. Out means out. British policymakers and British voters have to know that there will be no kind of renegotiation. Juncker said there would be no re-opening of the British “special status” agreement negotiated with David Cameron in February. Under the deal, the prime minister got an exemption from the EU goal of “ever closer union”, the right to restrict welfare rights of EU workers in Britain and safeguards for countries outside the eurozone, vis-a-vis the larger single-currency bloc. We have concluded a deal with the prime minister. He got the maximum he could receive and we gave the maximum we could give. So there will be no renegotiation. If Britain votes to leave the EU on Thursday, the February deal will immediately become null and void, thanks to a self-destruct clause written into the text. The day before her murder, Jo Cox’s family had spent a happy day out on the river, her husband Brendan and their two small children flying the flag for ‘IN’ as they joined the remain flotilla to counter Nigel Farage’s Brexit boat on the Thames. The kids had enjoyed it so much, Brendan Cox tweeted that afternoon, they had asked to do it again the next day. On Cox’s 42nd birthday, less than a week since her killing outside her constituency surgery, her family and friends stepped aboard a barge moored by the family houseboat, to make their way up the river to Westminster again, to celebrate the life of the MP, human rights activist, wife and mother. Her neighbours at Hermitage Moorings had carpeted one community dinghy with 1,000 roses, a floating memorial named ‘Yorkshire Rose’ after the MP for Batley and Spen. At the gates of the East London moorings where the family houseboat docked, a table was filled with bouquets and potted roses left by mourners and on the riverside walkway facing the boats, there were drops of white candle wax and burnt-out memorial candles. From the Hermitage moorings with its views from Tower Bridge and City Hall, the barge with Brendan Cox and his two children, towing the floating memorial, set off up the river. Before disembarking at Westminister Pier just as Big Ben struck 3pm, the dinghy was tied to a mooring post outside the Palace of Westminster; where it will stay for a week. The main event will follow in Trafalgar Square, which coincides with dozens more around the world, named More In Common, after the MP’s maiden speech. The couple’s favourite band will play, with tributes from Malala, U2 and a guard of honour decked in suffragette colours of purple, green and white. Corbyn is repeating many of the points he raised in his EU speech yesterday. Corbyn is talking about the need for countries to work together to tackle problems with an international dimension, like pollution. “The sea is a common denominator for all of us,” he says. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He thanks Khan for winning the London mayor election against the most disgusting campaign he had ever seen in an election. Labour does not believe in the status quo, he says. It wants to reform Europe to make it work better for people. He says people should vote to remain in the EU for jobs, for rights at work and for the NHS. Sadiq Khan is speaking now. He says Labour faces the fight of its life between now and 10pm tomorrow. He says staying in the EU is the best way to be true to British values and Labour values. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, says the risks of leaving the EU outweigh any potential benefits. And these are risks we do not have to take, she says. She says you do not have to love Europe to vote for it. Tomorrow is not the day for a protest vote, she says. Jeremy Corbyn, Sadiq Khan, Carwyn Jones and Kezia Dugdale are all on the stage together. And Jones, the Welsh first minister, is speaking first. He says his job involves promoting employment. Employers want to come to Wales because it is in the single market, he says. He says he wants Britain to be a tolerant country. Alan Johnson, the chair of Labour In for Britain, is speaking at the Labour rally now. It is going to feature Jeremy Corbyn, the party leader, Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish leader, Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. Johnson says an Italian friend told him recently that for Britain to stand alone in 1940 when it was surrounded by enemies was heroic. But for it to stand alone now, when it is surrounded by friends, would be absurd. Sir John Major’s speech this morning, from the event with David Cameron, Harriet Harman and Marvin Rees, the Labour mayor of Bristol, was very good. I’ve already quoted one passage from it, but here is a summary of all the key points. Sir John Major accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of being “gravediggers of our prosperity”. And he said that if the UK left the EU, Britain would be “shrunk down to a little England.” Now, if our nation does vote to leave tomorrow, we must respect their decision. But if they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths and misunderstandings, then pretty soon the gravediggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer. They will have to account for what they have said and done. But that will be of no consolation. For we will be out, out for good, diminished as an influence upon the world, a truly Great Britain shrunk down to a little England, perhaps without Scotland, perhaps with a grumpy Wales, and certainly with a Northern Ireland divided from the south by the border controls that would then be the edge of the European Union. That is not how our island story should go. He praised David Cameron for the way he has conducted the campaign, and implied that some of Cameron’s Tory opponents had been too abusive towards him. I think the prime minister has fought an extremely brave campaign in very difficult circumstances. He’s put facts before our nation, he’s warned of the dangers, and that is his duty as prime minister. He cannot ignore the dangers that we face, and it is his responsibility to put those dangers before people. And in return for doing that he has faced a great deal of opposition and sometimes abuse from people who frankly we might have expected better from. And I think the way in which he has conducted himself in putting the country before self and the country before party is quite remarkable. And, David, I warmly congratulate you on what you have managed to achieve. He said that leaving the EU would not solve the immigration problem. High immigration was a short-term that would diminish as Europe recovered economically, he said. Let me say just a word about immigration. I come from Brixton, I was brought up in the 50s, I know a little about it from direct experience. And I have to tell you this. In a world that has changed, in a world that is on the move in almost every part of the world, leaving the European Union is no solution to the scale of migration around the world. it is a reaction to it, but it isn’t a solution to it. And to try and solve a short-term problem that will diminish as the European economy begins to grow again, and leave Europe and risk a far greater longterm impact to our prosperity in the world is quite disproportionate to the problem that we face. He said mocked Leave for raising fears about Turkey joining the EU. And I find it extraordinary that people should point to Turkey and suggest that 77m Turks are suddenly going to descend and take all our hospital places and all our school places and all our local authority dwellings. They have been negotiating for 30 years without getting in. They are not going to get in in my judgment for one decade, two decades, perhaps ever. Even if they do get in, we are not in the Schengen zone. And even if that happened in some far distant future, what absurdity it is to suggest all 77m Turks are suddenly going to say ‘Let’s go to the United Kingdom. The national living wage has risen by 50p. Let’s get there as quickly as we can.’ He said the EU would be weaker if the UK left, and that this would be bad for Britain. Let me turn the telescope of introspection around for a moment. Suppose tomorrow our nation decided to leave Europe. Not only would that be disastrous for us. But if we leave, what would that mean for Europe? What would Europe lose if they lost the British? Well, firstly they would lose the best performing economy in Europe, the economy that on the trends of recent years may very well in 15 years’ time be the biggest economy in Europe, bigger than Germany. They will lose one of only two nations that have a military capability of significance and a nuclear capacity. And they would lose the country with the longest, the widest and the deepest foreign policy reach of any European nation. Europe itself without Britain would shrink and would be diminished. In a world of three great economic powers, America, China, Europe, do we really wish our continent to sink to a lower level of significance than America and China. I don’t. I think the European voice is worth having and worth listening to and I don’t wish to see it washed away because the British moved away from Europe. He joked about his own reputation for being boring. The prime minister is quite young. Well, youngish. And I’m not, so perhaps I represent the grey vote. Some have said I always have done. Nine MPs are yet to declare which way they will vote in the EU referendum, with less than 24 hours until polls open - while nearly three-quarters are voting to remain, the Press Association reports. A survey of all 650 MPs carried out by the Press Association found 478 (73.5%) are voting Remain, while less than a quarter (159) are voting Leave. Some 1.4% have not yet declared. Four further MPs - Speaker John Bercow (Buckingham) and Deputy Speakers Lindsay Hoyle (Chorley), Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest) and Natascha Engel (North East Derbyshire) - will remain undeclared, having invoked their roles within the House of Commons as the reason. Of the nine MPs, seven will not be sharing how they will vote on Thursday, the Press Association understands. These include Ian Liddell-Grainger, MP for Bridgewater and West Somerset. The long-planned Hinkley Point nuclear power station is within Liddell-Grainger’s constituency and he said he did not want to jeopardise the project by declaring his vote in the referendum. Conservative Liddell-Grainger said: “I have actually made myself very clear about Europe in the past but we are so close after nine-and-a-half years of trying so I’m not prepared to say either way.” He added: “If it hadn’t been for Hinkley I would have declared but I am not going to say. It is right in the middle of my constituency.” Five other Tory MPs -Tracey Crouch (Chatham and Aylesford), Seema Kennedy (South Ribble), Jesse Norman (Hereford and South Herefordshire), Anne Milton (Guildford) and Caroline Nokes (Romsey and Southampton North) - also said they would not be declaring how they intended to vote. Warley’s John Spellar will not be declaring his voting intention, his office said. He remains the final Labour MP to reveal how he will be voting in Thursday’s referendum. Huw Merriman, Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle, said he would only announce which way he intended to vote on polling day after he had “finished a programme of discussions” with constituents. Tory MP Justin Tomlinson (North Swindon) declined to confirm which way he would be voting. Jeremy Corbyn turned down an invitation to appear with David Cameron and Tim Farron at a cross-party rally today, BuzzFeed reports. Corbyn has always said he would not share a platform with Cameron. Here is a Guardian picture gallery with some of the best pictures from the campaign. Q: You used to back Turkey joining the EU. [Martha Kearney plays a clip of Boris Johnson saying he favoured Turkey joining. It is from the TV documentary he made to promote his book about Rome, which also includes a pro-Turkey line.) Johnson says that when he made those comments the EU was a different kind of organisation. Boris Johnson is being interviewed on the World at One. Q: Sadiq Khan accused you last night of running Project Hate. Johnson says he does not accept that. He is running a positive campaign. Q: What about Michael Gove compared economists to Nazis. Johnson ignores the question, and says there are experts on both sides of this debate. Q: Are the IMF like Nazis? Johnson says Gove has run a fantastic campaign, and was right about this. He says the IMF did not foresee the 2008 crash and were wrong about the euro. Q: But that does not make them Nazis. Doesn’t this suggest you are running Project Hate. Johnson says he has run a very positive campaign. Johnson defends Gove’s decision to compare anti-Brexit economists to Nazi propagandists. He says immigration is good for the country. Q: So would you cut it to below 100,000. Johnson says that is a matter for the government. But he thinks the government should be in control. Q: What level do you think net migration should be? Johnson says the current level, 333,000, is too high. And he says 184,000 net, the figure for EU migration, is also too high. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, has accused David Cameron of “lying to the British people” over Turkey. Duncan Smith was responding to Newsnight’s interview last night with Ilnur Cevik, an adviser to the Turkish president, who said Cameron had supported Turkey joining the EU (see 7.27am), and to a line in Sir John Major’s speech this morning where he suggested Turkey could join the EU within a decade. Duncan Smith said: David Cameron has repeatedly claimed that Turkey is not going to join the EU despite it being Government policy. Now the Turkish government has confirmed that he is the ‘chief supporter’ of their bid to join the EU. Cameron also said that Turkey will not join until the year 3000 but Sir John Major has let the cat out of the bag - Turkey could be in the EU in ten years’ time. I’m afraid there is no conclusion you can draw from this, except that David Cameron is colluding with the EU and lying to the British people. Families are suffering the consequences of uncontrolled migration - a direct result of the EU’s obsession with freedom of movement. Duncan Smith has put quite an extreme interpretation on what Major said this morning. Major said he thought Turkey would not be joining the EU “in in my judgment for one decade, two decades, perhaps ever”. A man named Laurence Taylor who says he is “fed up with the rubbish being talked about immigration” has taken a full-page advert in the Metro to argue that it is a non-issued, the Political Scrapbook blog reports. Outside the Scottish parliament the folk music wing of the Remain movement have been out in action this morning, my colleague Severin Carrell reports. The EU referendum campaign has damaged the image of the Conservative party, according to an Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard. The proportion of voters who think the Conservatives have the best team of leaders has sunk from 43 to 36 per cent since January, found Ipsos MORI. And the proportion who think the Tories are the most “clear and united” about their policies has dropped from 33 to just 24 per cent ... However, the Conservatives are well ahead of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party on both measures. David Cameron criticised Michael Gove in an interview with LBC for comparing anti-Brexit economists to Nazi propagandists. (See 10.49am.) In a subsequent interview with Sky News, Cameron went further, saying Gove had “lost it”. He said: To hear the Leave campaign today sort of comparing independent experts and economists to Nazi sympathisers - I think they have rather lost it. These people are independent - economists who have won Nobel prizes, business leaders responsible for creating thousands of jobs, institutions that were set up after the war to try to provide independent advice. It is right to listen. Here are some more lines from the end of Nigel Farage’s press conference (which I missed because it was not covered on Sky News or BBC.) My colleague Michael Slezak has sent me more on the memorial event for Jo Cox in Sydney. (See 9.50am.) There were just over 20 people there. Organiser of the Sydney event, Neva Frecheville, said she felt the need to bring together people who knew Cox or who were moved by her, following her death. “When it happened it was just something that I feel like has the potential to make us all feel really isolated and full of despair and without hope. But actually there’s an opportunity for us to come together around everything that Jo stood for in her life, and the values that she lived her life by. I think it’s time for more of us to start living those as well,” she said. One of the people who attended the event was Nic Seton. He said he knew Cox from when he lived in a boat in East London in 2010, right next door to the boat Cox lived in. “We just by chance happened to pull up next door to their home – their boat,” he said. “We’d invite them over, and we went over to their place. We had a lot of barbecues and a really good time.” Like Frecheville, Seton wanted to see the good that could come out of what he said was a devastating tragedy. “I feel like the silver lining really is that people have recognised that the values that she had and are really seeking to fulfill it themselves,” he said. Jane McAdam, a law professor at the University of New South Wales, said she knew Cox’s husband, Brendan Cox, and attended partly because of that connection. “But I think more broadly it was what Jo devoted her life to in upholding the principles that she thought were so important in trying to create a society that was connected and not divided,” she said. Boris Johnson has been heckled in Ashby, the Press Association’s David Hughes reports. Q: In the event of Brexit, would you stay on as Ukip leader to ensure that Leave commit to cutting immigration? Farage says whatever happens tomorrow Ukip will have an important role to play. It is the biggest party in the European parliament, and, like the canary in the mineshaft, it will be able to say if reform is not happening. My colleague Marina Hyde points out (not for the first time) that Farage does not seem to fully understand the metaphor he is using. Farage says the establishment have done all they can to stack the odds in their favour, but that he still thinks Leave will win. Farage is now taking questions from the media. Q: Diane James said last night you had apologised for the “Breaking Point’ poster. Is that correct? Farage says he apologised for the timing of the poster, and for the fact it was abused. But he cannot apologise for the content, because it is true. He says Angela Merkel’s immigration policy had been disastrous. There has been one really offensive poster, he says. It was the Operation Black Vote one showing a Leave supporters as a skinhead. He says that was “offensive” and “abusive” and an “absolute disgrace”. He is referring to this image. Farage says that for the last time he will take out his passport to make the point that people do not have British passports anymore. He says Remain support is dominated by vested interests. He says Cameron has made another dishonest claim today. He says Cameron said if we voted to stay in the EU, we would be voting for more reform. (See 8.26am.) But that is not the case, he says. He says other prime ministers have tried to reform the EU. But the only reform the EU is interested in is more integration, he says. And he says one of the lasting images of the campaign for him was Bob Geldof shouting abuse at him on the Thames as he tried to give voice to the grievances of fishermen. Geldof is a millionaire rock star, he says. People like that do not care about ordinary people, he says. He says most of his supporters would “crawl over broken glass” to get to a polling station tomorrow. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, is speaking in London. He says that he thinks Ukip and its supporters have changed politics, not just in a way that will be reflected in the result tomorrow, but in a way that will affect the country more permanently. He says he is hearing politicians talk about things like an Australian-style points system - something Ukip has been calling for for ages. He says the term single market is misleading. We are part of a customs union, or more accurately a big business cartel, he says. Here is the key passage from Sir John Major’s speech in Bristol. He accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of being “gravediggers of prosperity”. Now, if our nation does vote to leave tomorrow, we must respect their decision. But if they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths and misunderstandings, then pretty soon the gravediggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer. They will have to account for what they have said and done. But that will be of no consolation. For we will be out, out for good, diminished as an influence upon the world, a truly Great Britain shrunk down to a little England, perhaps without Scotland, perhaps with a grumpy Wales, and certainly with a Northern Ireland divided from the south by the border controls that would then be the edge of the European Union. That is not how our island story should go. There is not a text of what Major said yet, because he was speaking off the cuff, but it was a substantial and effective speech. I will post a proper summary later. Yesterday Michael Gove, the leading Vote Leave campaigner, claimed that John Barnes, the former England footballer, was backing Brexit. Gove was wrong. Barnes is for Remain. And he has written a powerful article for the Guardian explaining why. For Barnes, immigration is the key factor. Leave is preying on people’s fears, telling the same story we’ve heard over the years about black people from Africa and the Caribbean coming to steal our jobs. Now we hear the same thing about Poles. If leave wanted to say that companies are paying migrants less than British workers, and so allowing them to take our jobs, then it should be looking at raising the minimum wage – not stopping migrants entering the country. The problem has nothing to do with the Polish workers – it is an issue about our labour laws. Yet leave maintains its focus on immigration ... Britain has always told the world that being British is about the humanity, compassion and moral fortitude that we have. All great things that we are supposed to have spread across the world. A leave vote now says that we don’t really care about anyone else, we don’t care what happens to the European Union. Why should the Germans be able to show more compassion than we do? ... And when politicians talk about welcoming different, more skilled immigrants – who are they talking about anyway? If there were thousands of blond-haired, blue-eyed Americans landing at Dover, seeking refuge, I think many of us would be straight down there to help. So many groups of people, whether they be from Africa or the Middle East, have been demonised and dehumanised because they don’t look like us. I’m not accusing anyone of being racist. I’m black, I was born in Jamaica, but this affects me too. I know I would feel more empathy with that boat of white American refugees than I do with the thousands fleeing Syria. It’s because of what we have all been told and the environment that we live in. I don’t look like a white American any more than I do a Syrian – but I was brought up in a society that has taught me to empathise more with them. And here is the full article. The media blitz continues. The PM has been on LBC, where he was quizzed about the Queen’s views on Brexit. Following a report that she challenged dinner guests for three reasons why the UK should stay in, David Cameron said: “The conversations we have are entirely private and will remain that way.” The PM also had some harsh words for Michael Gove, the justice secretary and his close political friend, who had compared experts warning against Brexit to experts who were n the pay of Nazis. Let me tell you what I think is the most extraordinary thing in the news today, and that is the Leave campaign, comparing these independent experts, businesses, economists, Nobel Prize winners to sort of Nazi propagandists. [See 8.43am.] I think is the most extraordinary thing when you know people who are … I think I’m afraid the Leave campaign here are making a massive mistake. If in our country, you know look at these people, some of them won Nobel Prizes, many of them are working for independent institutions we set up after the war. These businesses don’t normally come off the fence on an issue like this and speak so clearly. And I think when you’ve got that weight of opinion saying there’s a real risk to the British economy, to jobs, to families’ finances then it really is worth listening. And if we’re going to go to a world where we say, I’m not going to listen to experts, that’s an extraordinary thing to do. When asked if it wasn’t going to be very tough to work with Gove again after Friday, Cameron said: Well no, as I say I don’t think it will be because all Conservatives agree, it was right to have a referendum and it’s right to carry out the instructions of people. This is not about some sort of Tory psycho drama and who likes who and who and all the rest of it. This is about the future of our country. Here is John Harris’s latest Anywhere but Westminster video about the EU referendum campaign. Britain should stay in Europe for the sake of its countryside and natural world, according to a group of current and former ministers, MPs and representatives of conservation organisations. In a letter to The Independent, the 37 signatories write that: “It’s only with a strong voice in the EU that we can protect and enhance the environment, meaning that our precious wildlife and natural resources are preserved for generations to come.” The list of names is impressive. Liz Truss and Rory Stewart, the current environment secretary and environment minister, are on there, along with Stanley Johnson, a long-time environmentalist and former Tory MEP, and father of Brexiter-in-chief, Boris Johnson. Former heads of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Countryside Alliance, and the Environment Agency feature too. While climate change has had a fair airing in the TV debates and the campaign – repeatedly deployed by the remain camp as an example of a problem that can’t be solved without working in the EU – the natural world has hardly featured. Yet the UK used to be known as the “dirty man of Europe”, and almost all our protections for wildlife and nature come from the EU, from the birds and habitats directives to ones on river water quality and bathing water. “By working in partnership with other European countries we have ensured our rivers, streams and coastline are in the healthiest state for 25 years,” the letter writers say, adding that “EU action has also led to an increase in bird numbers.” Last night’s referendum debate broadcast from Wembley arena, which saw clashes between London mayor Sadiq Khan and his predecessor Boris Johnson, drew in 3.9m viewers. The two-hour show on BBC1 had an audience share of just over 19%, but suffered going up against Spain’s Euro 2016 clash with Croatia, which was watched by 4.6 million, accounting for 23.5% of all viewers. The number of people tuning in was up on the 3m who watched Johnson’s previous debate appearance on 10 June on ITV when he went up against SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Labour’s Angela Eagle, but down slightly on the 4 million who watched the debate Ukip leader Nigel Farage David Cameron two days earlier. The final debate will take place tonight on Channel 4, with a revolving panel chosen from an audience of high profile remain, leave and undecided representatives, including Yvette Cooper, Louise Mensch, Delia Smith and Ulrika Jonsson. Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, is speaking now at the event with David Cameron and Sir John Major. She is there with Marvin Rees, the new Labour mayor of Bristol. Major says if we vote to leave the “gravediggers of our prosperity” will have a great deal of explaining to do. Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, is speaking now at an event with David Cameron and Harriet Harman. My Guardian Australia colleague Michael Slezak has been at the Jo Cox memorial event in Sydney. He has posted these pictures on Twitter. It turns out that Operation Croissant has become Operation Postcard. This is an initiative staged by Parisiens who want to show Britons at King’s Cross station in London this morning how much the French want them to stay in the EU. The original plan was to hand out free croissants. But the organisers say they were advised by the police that this would be illegal (giving food or drink to people to influence their vote, or “treating” as it is known, used to be a standard election practice many years ago, but a law was passed to make it an offence) and so instead the organisers decided to hand out postcards. Here are some of them. The croissants are being donated to a shelter for the homeless instead. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Claire. The Press Association has more on Boris Johnson’s visit to Maldon. Johnson’s next campaign stop was in Maldon, Essex, where he joined Brexit-backing Cabinet minister John Whittingdale. After a walk through the town marked by the usual ritual of posing for selfies, signing autographs and acknowledging shouts of support from passing motorists, the former London mayor told activists: “I do think that we are on the verge, possibly, of an extraordinary event in the history of our country and indeed in the whole of Europe.” He added: “It’s all going to about getting our supporters out to vote and if we do it I really think tomorrow can be independence day.” But the rally was interrupted by former Tory supporter Nigel Brunt, who said: “Democracy will win tomorrow and it will be Remain.” Brunt, who was jeered by the Vote Leave activists, told local MP Whittingdale: “As an ex, now, Conservative supporter in this borough, I hope you resign after the vote.” Johnson stopped to buy copies of Brexit-backing newspapers The Sun and Daily Telegraph in Maldon. The Tory MP, a Telegraph columnist, flicked through the papers as he strolled around the town. Remainers might have Operation Croissant, but Boris Johnson has a wild salmon: Johnson had an early start at Billingsgate fish market, where he also revealed that he had once “kissed a crocodile in Australia”. Less surprisingly, he then told BBC Breakfast that he was pushing for an Australian-style points system for immigration, and “personally would advocate” a cut in the number of people coming to the UK. He then skipped on to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, where he said of the money sent by Britain to Europe: Some of it is spent in this country by Brussels bureaucrats, some of it comes back in the form of rebate but that is at the discretion of the EU, and half of it we never see again – it just vanishes. It is spent in a way that is extremely dodgy and in many ways, and very often as you know, it is the subject of corruption. Johnson is currently in Maldon, Essex, with John Whittingdale, the pro-Brexit culture secretary. And it’s still only 9am. It’s going to be a long last day of campaigning. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has written his please-don’t-go column for the Guardian this morning; in Warsaw, the palace of culture and science switched on the red, white and blue lights last night: At St Pancras station this morning, London commuters were met with Operation Croissant – Parisians wielding croissants and messages to voters to stay with the EU: Also in London, Tate Modern was lit up last night, too: It feels a little too early in today’s live blog for Godwin’s law, so apologies, but we have our first Nazi reference of the day. Via Press Association: Michael Gove has compared economic experts warning about the fall-out of Brexit to the Nazis who orchestrated a smear campaign against Albert Einstein in the 1930s. The justice secretary, who co-chairs the Vote Leave campaign, said experts cannot always be trusted, after being challenged over why he is not heeding the advice of many economists who have warned that Brexit could have dire consequences and tip the economy into recession. The International Monetary Fund, 10 Nobel-prize winning economists and the Bank of England have all warned that leaving the EU could damage the economy. Gove told LBC: I think the key thing here is to interrogate the assumptions that are made and to ask if these arguments are good. We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his theories were denounced, and one of the reasons of course he was denounced was because he was Jewish. They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said: ‘Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.’ The truth is that if you look at the quality of the analysis, if you look at the facts on the ground, you can come to an appropriate conclusion. And the appropriate conclusion, I think, all of us can come to is that with growth rates so low in Europe, with so many unemployed and with the nature of the single currency so damaging, freeing ourselves from that project can only strengthen our economy. Cameron reacts strongly to a suggestion that the UK risks tying itself to a dying institution: We are not shackled to a corpse, you can see the European economy is recovering … The vision of Britain in Europe is that we do have a special status, you have the best of both worlds … I am a deeply patriotic person … I don’t want to give that up to some sort of United Europe. We achieve more if we’re in these organisations fighting for British interests rather than standing outside, ear pressed to the glass. And will he still be prime minister on Friday, come what may? I will accept the instructions of the British people and get to work to deliver them. And he’s done. Cameron says we need to come up with “smart ways” of managing immigration, citing efforts to curb criminals from coming into Britain and cracking down on sham marriages. He says reform will continue “on Friday” if the UK stays inside the EU. There are people in our country who haven’t had as good chances as I’d like them to have … stating in the European Union is actually going to increase people’s life chances. Staying in the EU makes it easier, too, to tackle issues such as terrorism and climate change, Cameron says. Cameron says the claim by his former adviser Steve Hilton that he knew four years ago that it would be impossible to cut net migration to the tens of thousands is “simply not true”. He says that when Hilton left No 10 in 2012, net migration was falling “and the forecast was that we would be meeting the target we had”. (As Cameron told the Guardian on the same question: “The figures were 244,000 in 2010 and by the autumn of 2012 it was down to 154,000, so it was falling towards that ambition.”) Cameron: We don’t solve our immigration challenge by leaving the European Union but we do create a massive problem for our economy. In the debate last night, the leave campaign admitted it could take 10 years to negotiate a trade deal. Cameron insists that the safeguards against “ever closer union” are legally binding on the other 27 member states if the UK votes to remain. It’s undeniable that we have the best of both worlds. This [a vote to leave] is irreversible: you can’t jump out of the aeroplane then climb back in through the cockpit hatch. Cameron denies that the concessions he secured on EU migrants’ access to in-work benefits amount to very little. That will make a difference … It’s about a principle as well as the numbers: if you come and work here, you have to pay in for four years before you get anything out of the system. He argues that concessions he achieved add to the UK’s “special status” in the EU: We were at risk of getting drawn into bailouts of the euro … We did not have that guarantee and that is now guaranteed. David Cameron is speaking on Radio 4 now. He also gave an interview to the Guardian, which you can read here. On his decision to call the referendum and whether he was effectively bumped into it, he says: We haven’t had a say on this issue since the 1970s. Europe has changed … I would dispute that this has been done in a hurry. Scotland’s political leaders and its five surviving first ministers have released joint cross-party statements urging voters to back remain, as the campaigns began their final push before referendum day. The five first ministers, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP, Jack McConnell and Henry McLeish for Scottish Labour, with Jim Wallace, the Scottish Lib Dem twice acting first minister, said Scotland had to “maximise the remain vote” on Thursday: The stakes could hardly be higher. Staying in the European Union and its single market is vital for jobs and investment in Scotland, and also enshrines key protections for workers and consumers. In a splash story reminiscent of the controversial “vow” by UK party leaders on the eve of Scotland’s independence referendum in 2014, the Daily Record published what it said was an unprecedented joint statement by the leaders of Scotland’s five main parties. Sturgeon, along with Ruth Davidson for the Scottish Tories, Kezia Dugdale of Scottish Labour, Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, said they set aside their policy differences to agree on the need to stay in the EU: We disagree on much, but this issue transcends party politics – staying in Europe and its single market of over 500 million people is vital for jobs, investment and opportunities for the people of Scotland. Scotland has ancient trading and educational links with our European neighbours. In the aftermath of World War II, the EU was established as ‘Project Peace’, to turn swords into ploughshares. Peace on our continent is a precious legacy, and a powerful example to the rest of the world. We should not turn our backs on all that has been achieved … Common sense tells us that if Scotland is taken out of the world’s biggest free trade area, our economy will be damaged. It would be all pain for no gain. Most of the worldwide events in memory of Jo Cox – synchronised to take place today, on what would have been her 42nd birthday, under the banner #MoreInCommon – are happening later, around 4pm UK time. Some have already taken place, such as this tribute in Melbourne, at Oxfam Australia: Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd added his support: The Google UK homepage has added a note to mark the day and link to a fundraising page for three charities supported by Cox. The fund has now surpassed £1.2m. Whatever happens tomorrow, I think it’s fair to say that the Sun and David Cameron are never, ever getting back together: The rhetoric about Turkey in this campaign has not gone unnoticed in that country, an adviser to the Turkish president has said. Ilnur Cevik told BBC’s Newsnight on Wednesday that Turkish citizens would not “flood” to Britain if the country joined the EU, Press Association reports: Cevik, who is close to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, criticised both David Cameron for “taking us for a ride” by indicating he supported the country joining the EU, and the Leave campaign for using the prospect as “an alibi” for Brexit. He said Turkey is “deeply hurting” now that the prime minister has indicated he is unlikely to support its EU membership after Brexit campaigners used the potential accession to warn that it could open Britain’s borders to millions of Turks. But responding to the leave campaign’s claims that could mean more Turkish criminals in the UK, Cevik told Newsnight: Firstly, the crime rate is not high. Secondly, there’s no extraordinary situation in this country that we would export anything to Britain. But besides that, who’s going to come to Britain? Why should we be flooding Britain? There’s no reason. Whatever exists in Britain also exists in Turkey. We are not going to go over there just because you produce Cadbury chocolates and Maltesers, for God’s sake. They should not use us as an alibi, they should not use us as a pretext, they should really deal with the nitty-gritty of why they should be leaving. Tory MEP and prominent leave campaigner Daniel Hannan has been speaking on the Today programme, where he was asked about that £350m figure, curiously absent from the Brexit arguments in last night’s BBC debate. Hannan insisted the claim hadn’t been shelved: No, I’m very comfortable to defend that figure: it’s the difference between gross and net … It’s not one that I’ve plucked out of the air. It is true, he conceded: We don’t literally, in a digitised age, put gold in the back of a van and drive it across the Channel. But he argued that nobody would argue that the 20p income tax rate was actually zero because we get it all back in schools and roads and hospitals. Good morning and welcome back to the live blog for the final day of campaigning ahead of tomorrow’s referendum. I’ve rounded up the key moments of last night’s not-quite-final TV debate below, along with the rest of the news you need. Andrew Sparrow will be along later. Do come and chat in the comments below or find me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps. The big picture David Cameron, in an interview with the Guardian after his earlier appeal to older voters, says the leave campaign has “become very narrowly focused” on immigration, stoking “an issue that needs careful handling”. The UK is, he says, “arguably the most successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith, opportunity democracy anywhere on earth”, and a vote to remain would send “a very clear message that we’ve rejected this idea that Britain is narrow and insular and inward-looking”. Cameron gets a helping hand this morning from the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who has written – via the Guardian – to British voters asking them not to make “the wrong choice”: Seen from Italy, a vote to leave Europe would not be a disaster, a tragedy or the end of the world for you in the UK. It would be worse, because it would be the wrong choice. It would be a mistake for which you the voters primarily would pay the price. Because who really wants Britain to be small and isolated? If there’s one thing the British have never done when faced with a challenge that concerns their future, their very identity, it is to make the wrong choice. A Britain less great than it is would go against the very logic of those who want an exit. It would swap autonomy for solitude, pride for weakness, and identity for self-harm. Last night’s BBC Big Referendum Come Dancing Debate (I’d love to claim that, but it’s a John Crace copyright) pitted Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, London mayor Sadiq Khan and TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady for remain, against Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Andrea Leadsom and Labour MP Gisela Stuart for leave. A snap YouGov poll for the Times found 39% thought leave had won it, over 34% for remain (and a bumper 17% who didn’t know). The same group of those polled were, however, still just a smidgen more likely to vote for remain: 41% to 40%. What we learned I’m going to assume that regular readers and anyone who’s prised open an eyelid at any point during this referendum campaign can take a guess at the key points covered: The economy People would lose their jobs and business leaders think we should stay (remain); the EU wouldn’t dare impose tariffs and James Dyson thinks we’d be fine (leave). Workers’ rights The EU guarantees protections (remain); the UK could guarantee them itself (leave). Immigration No silver bullet (leave); take back control of borders (leave). As my colleague Andrew Sparrow neatly summed it up: “The exchanges bear so little relation to the questions that one wonders why [David] Dimbleby bothers to ask them.” Still, we did glean a few new things: Davidson is not afraid to take on her own party colleagues, tackling Johnson over his attitude to people losing their jobs, and accusing Leadsom of a “blatant untruth” on the proportion of laws made in Brussels. (On that last point, by the way, a BBC reality check concludes they were both wrong.) But the remain team avoided personal attacks on Johnson, after mixed reviews of that tactic in the ITV debate. Davidson once worked as a reporter in the Balkans and served in the Territorial army. In response to a claim by Johnson that Europe had failed to bring about peace in the Kosovan war until the US and Nato “asserted its primacy”, Davidson retorted: I think Boris maybe misjudged this panel by talking about the Balkans because what he probably doesn’t know is that I was sent to the Balkans at the end of the Kosovo war as a reporter and I have never been more proud of being British in my life than watching British troops with a union jack on their arms, believing in something, pulling their weight, and helping in the European Union. That’s what caused me to join up and serve. I think I am the only one on this panel that has ever worn the Queen’s uniform. Scotland can’t export haggis to the US, Johnson said, blaming EU rules (disappointing fact check: it’s actually a US Department of Agriculture regulation): Because the EU is in charge of our trade negotiations we cannot export haggis to America. Leadsom is a mother. Stuart is a mother and a grandmother. It was a fact repeated enough times that Davidson felt the need to add: I do just have to remind people that there are mums and dads and grans and grandads on this side as well. Khan broke his fast on stage during the debate, having eaten nothing for 19 hours to observe Ramadan. What we didn’t O’Grady wanted to know if Vote Leave would return a £600,000 donation from a former BNP member. Leadsom said the question was “unworthy of this debate”. Davidson lamented that “we are not having a grown-up argument” about immigration. Do we know what that might look like? Why none of the leave side mentioned that £350m figure. The key exchange Khan: Let’s deal with this big fat lie once and for all. Turkey isn’t about to join. And until three months ago, you knew that was the case, Boris Johnson … You are using the ruse of Turkey to scare people to vote to leave. Johnson: I’m a Turk! Zinger of the night Khan’s “Project Hate” accusation, levelled at Johnson, captured a lot of headlines: Your campaign hasn’t been project fear, it’s been project hate as far as immigration is concerned. But Johnson of course had a pre-prepared soundbite of his own: This Thursday can be our country’s independence day! The Remain campaign verdict The Leave campaign verdict You should also know Yvette Cooper has informed the police and Twitter after receiving a death threat online against her family. A record 46,499,537 people are eligible to vote tomorrow. 1,200 business leaders – including leaders of 50 of the FTSE 100 – back remain. Tate &amp; Lyle joins the campaign to leave the EU. Donald Trump campaign supports leave, citing America’s “own little Brexit”. Priti Patel will today warn that EU migration threatens UK class sizes. The Sun claims the Queen has been quizzing her “VIP guests” (does she have any other kind?), asking them: “Give me three good reasons why Britain should be part of Europe.” And – drumroll – the Daily Mail comes out for Brexit. Poll position So far this morning, there are no fresh forecasts, but expect numbers today from ComRes, Opinium and YouGov. There should also be a last-gasp Ipsos Mori poll on Thursday morning. Diary Nigel Farage makes his final speech of the campaign in London at 11am. Jeremy Corbyn is also in London at 2pm with mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale and Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones. Stronger In rallies in Birmingham at 5pm, with David Cameron centre-stage alongside Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, who visits Cambridge first. Vote Leave has Boris Johnson roaming the skies in a helicopter and Michael Gove touring the south coast. At 4pm (UK time), memorials are being held worldwide to remember Jo Cox on what would have been her 42nd birthday. A service will be held in her constituency of Batley and Spen, synchronised with events in Trafalgar Square in London, Nairobi, Brussels, Beirut, New York, Washington DC, Edinburgh and many other places. A boat from the mooring where Cox lived with her family will lead a floral tribute along the Thames to Westminster. There’s a full list of commemorations here. At 9pm, Channel 4 hosts the final, final TV debate, with Jeremy Paxman and a huge list of remainers and leavers including some usual suspects (Alan Johnson, Alex Salmond, Nigel Farage) and some … not (Rick Astley, Delia Smith, Ulrika Jonsson). Perhaps Paxman can finally get to the bottom of whether Astley really will never give you up, let you down, run around or desert you. Read these It’s been pinging around Facebook, but now this piece by Martin Fletcher, a former foreign editor for the Times, has made its way to the New York Times: For decades, British newspapers have offered their readers an endless stream of biased, misleading and downright fallacious stories about Brussels. And the journalist who helped set the tone – long before he became the mayor of London or the face of the pro-Brexit campaign – was Boris Johnson … He wrote about European Union plans to take over Europe, ban Britain’s favourite potato chips, standardise condom sizes and blow up its own asbestos-filled headquarters. These articles were undoubtedly colourful but they bore scant relation to the truth. Mr Johnson’s dispatches galvanised the rest of Britain’s highly competitive and partisan newspaper industry. They were far more fun than the usual dry, policy-driven Brussels fare. Editors at other newspapers, particularly but not exclusively the tabloids, started pressing their own correspondents to match Mr Johnson’s imaginative reports … The upshot is that Mr Johnson and his fellow Brexit proponents are now campaigning against the caricature of the European Union that he himself helped create. They are asking the British people to part with a monster about as real as the one in Loch Ness. Could Australia swing the EU vote, Julian Lorkin asks on the BBC website: With 1.2 million British nationals in Australia, and 250,000 in New Zealand, both the stay and leave camps are in full campaign mode half a world away from the UK. Southern hemisphere votes have the potential to swing the knife-edge referendum. Posters supporting both sides have sprouted in areas popular with UK residents. In some locations, such as Perth, up to 15% of the population was born in England … Far more British expats live Down Under than elsewhere in the world. Only Spain, with 760,000, and the United States at 600,000 come close. As such they will wield considerable influence over whether the UK stays in the EU. Cathy Newman in the Telegraph says Theresa May is the one to watch should Cameron take a tumble on Friday: May is truly the quiet woman of British politics. And I don’t mean that as an insult. There’s no shortage of loud-mouths soaking up the attention and hogging the airwaves during this rancorous EU referendum campaign. The home secretary, by contrast, has been reserved to the point of invisibility … Authority, though, is something May has in spades. The longest-serving home secretary for more than a century, she’s managed - in a department known for destroying reputations - to enhance hers. This is something of a miracle, particularly when you consider the government has failed to meet one of its central manifesto pledges on her watch: the promise to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands. Celebrity endorsement of the day Still undecided? Let a famous person persuade you. Actor Liam Neeson has said he’s for staying in: A UK exit would have the worst ramifications for the island of Ireland … It would be truly a shame to sacrifice all the progress that has been made by the peace process regarding border controls … There is strength in unity. A Brexit vote will make us weak. Or how about King of Darts Bobby George? He’s for remain too. And ex-footballer John Barnes came out fighting against claims by Michael Gove that he was a leaver – making what has been described by some as the most positive argument for immigration so far in this campaign: The Channel 4 debate also chucks in a few leave celebs, with Selina Scott, DJ Mike Read (of Ukip calypso fame) and Gillian McKeith arguing for out. The day in a tweet Perhaps we could put it to a referendum? If today were a film ... It would be Independence Day. Either (if you’re for Brexit) the box office-busting original or (if you’re for staying or perhaps just very, very tired) the newly released sequel described by Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw as “planet-smashingly boring … on its way to crush our minds”.

Thanks for reading throughout Tuesday. Thanks also to Bridie Jabour for the taxing dawn offensive and to the on road team of Lenore Taylor, Gabrielle Chan and Mike Bowers. Let’s assess the sum of our campaign parts to date. Malcolm Turnbull is bursting with energy, but the government is yet to launch one new policy, digging in behind its budget, either because that’s all there is, we have eight weeks selling a plan that was unveiled in the budget last week, or the stasis is useful while the leader and the campaign operation behind him finds its feet. As they say in the classics, only time will tell. On that score, there are some stirrings in the Liberal party base over the superannuation measures which will either settle or escalate, depending on how the campaign travels. In campaigns, success breeds success, and ill discipline breeds ill discipline. Labor has opened on education, and opened in the regions. Every campaign in recent memory Labor has been hopeful about its prospects in far north Queensland, and the efforts have come to naught. Perhaps this time is different, and courtesy of the long campaign Bill Shorten has time to put the plane on the ground and do some baby kissing and hand pumping. Again, as they say in the classics, only time will tell. I suspect things will be a bit terse behind the scenes in Labor’s campaign headquarters about the sum of the first two days. Shorten was late to position north on day one, so lost some early momentum to Turnbull, who was on the move from first light on the first day. Then the education message has been fighting for oxygen because the government really doesn’t want to talk about education (that’s a lose for the Coalition). It wants to talk about asylum boats, so it’s doing everything in its power to keep Labor in the boats frame. Why? Because the Coalition thinks it wins always on boats, hands down, and if you can push Labor into boats, you can set up the pincer movement. The Coalition can move in from the right and the Greens also crowd in from the left. Double plus good. Neat segue to the Greens. The Greens are playing for keeps this cycle. Raising the spectre of the minority parliament (which was the game plan today) elevates their stakes, they move themselves out of the wings, fighting for airtime, to centre stage. Everyone is suddenly in pursuit of the Greens. And they move there at Labor’s expense. Greens supporters like the idea of a hung parliament because in that matrix, the Greens have influence. Labor supporters hate the notion. It brings back the whole memory of the Rudd/Gillard period, which the party has worked assiduously over the past three years to consign to history. Any day Labor fights in a boats/minority government frame is a clear loss in terms of the national strategy. But we are only two days in. The campaign stretches out to the sky and then some. We can only wait and watch how the dynamics play out, in my case, minute by minute, all day. Have a lovely evening. Let’s do it all again in the morning. The treasurer Scott Morrison is campaigning today in Tasmania. The subject of superannuation comes up. Q: The Institute of Public Affairs is describing the retrospective elements of your superannuation changes as diabolical and causing an absolute fire storm amongst its members. Some backbenchers are concerned. Would you reconsider? Scott Morrison: There’s no retrospectivity in our plan. 97% of superannuants are completely unaffected by the changes we announced on Tuesday night. Our plan for superannuation is to target the most wealthy of our superannuants and ensure that they are paying tax on earnings for capital above $1.6m. You’ve got to be earning more than $250,000 to be impacted by the measures that we announced. This is just, frankly, a campaign being drummed up by the Labor party because they know that what we’ve put out there is a strong package ... (And the IPA, which is not exactly the Labor party .. but moving on .. ) Q: So you won’t consider any changes at all? Scott Morrison: Our plan is there, it’s clear and ensuring that people on lower incomes can have a more affordable contribution to their superannuation. (That’s not quite no, is it – our plan is there. The follow up question should have been is your plan there forever?) I did promise a post on the subject of gotcha and election campaigns, bouncing off this comment from Kelso Kel on my Facebook forum earlier today. Reading the interview transcript with Shorten and Cathy O’Toole, it makes me so angry and frustrated that she’s being badgered for a gotcha moment on refugee policy. It’s backing people into a corner like that which transforms a policy discussion into high-stakes take-no-prisoners extremism and which doesn’t serve anyone! I’m 100% anti the bipartisan position on asylum seekers but I don’t agree with the way (some) members of the media make a game of policy differences within parties. All that does is shut down debate, shuts down differences of opinion and it trains our electorate to focus on the gotcha instead of the issue. In case you are only now tuning in to the campaign, and you’ve missed the context for this remark, earlier today Bill Shorten and Labor’s candidate for the seat of Herbert Cathy O’Toole wanted to talk about schools funding, but found themselves peppered with questions about asylum seekers. The reason for this is O’Toole has previously publicly expressed support for a more humane policy when it comes to the treatment of boat arrivals. A picture of O’Toole (helpfully) surfaced today with the candidate holding a #LetThemStay sign. I stress I don’t know how the picture surfaced because I’m not currently travelling with Shorten, but having covered a lot of campaigns I can hazard a guess. In the respective campaign headquarters engage in a practice called opposition research – this means digging up dirt on your opponents. Both sides do it. Helpful information then tends to fall into the hands of the respective travelling press parties that can influence the questioning leaders face at their pit stops. As I said, I don’t know if that’s what happened in this instance, perhaps the picture emerged as a consequence of old fashioned journalistic leg work, but let’s say with perfect safety it’s been known to happen. Yesterday, Shorten faced questions about the party’s candidate in the seat of Melbourne departing from Labor’s offshore processing policy. That seeded the story as a national campaign issue. Today, it was O’Toole’s turn. Let’s look at some fundamentals here about gotcha cycles. As they say in politics, let’s go high level. It is perfectly legitimate that Shorten face questions about Labor’s stance on asylum seekers because the policy is contested internally. It’s also legitimate that Cathy O’Toole face questions about whether or not she agrees with her party’s policy, particularly if there is evidence she doesn’t agree with it. The whole process of covering election campaigns is about testing every proposition. That’s the job of working journalists to stress test all the public offerings. The alternative is just act as a propaganda machine for the major parties. It’s also the job of journalists to drive the news cycle forward. We are in the “new” business, and news often turns on conflict. So that’s why you see this relentless pushing forward during press conferences – people aim to emerge with a new thought, a new angle, a new contradiction or inconsistency. Once upon a time, press conferences weren’t broadcast live, all that sausage making was largely concealed from the public. Now people can watch the process around the clock if they so choose. To a certain degree journalists are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. If we nit pick, we are nit pickers. If we don’t nit pick, then people criticise us for not doing enough to test our political candidates during election cycles. So what’s the bottom line here? I suppose it’s one person’s “gotcha” is another person’s topline for a news story. But I completely understand the frustration that viewers face watching on at campaign press conferences. I absolutely do get it, particularly as now I don’t get out regularly myself, and I’m forced to rely on what comes back through those processes myself in order to maintain live coverage. You can, I know, look on with a certain amount of confusion, or disappointment, because inevitably there will be an issue that you want pursued that doesn’t get pursued. Completely get it. In the broader campaign dynamic, pursuing asylum seekers today was perfectly legitimate in all sorts of ways, but I get, particularly with an issue like schools funding, voters might want to hear a bit more about that – how much does my school get, is this policy well designed so the promises come to fruition, what are the merits of needs based funding for schools versus the alternative? It’s a highly imperfect business, journalism But I hope this explanation provides some insight into our competing imperatives. To stirrings elsewhere, the Institute of Public Affairs is preparing to run an aggressive public campaign against the Turnbull government’s superannuation changes. Central to the issue is whether capping lifetime contributions to super and limiting the amount of super balances which can earn tax-free income are retrospective changes. IPA executive director, John Roskam, told Guardian Australia the government’s proposed super changes had become an “absolute firestorm” among Coalition supporters and IPA members, and the government’s claim that the changes aren’t retrospective had made people “even more angry”. No Coalition MPs have come out against the superannuation changes (yet), although Senator Ian MacDonald has said he will raise the issue with the treasurer because he opposes retrospective legislation, but he hasn’t formed a view on whether the changes are retrospective. To our north, colleagues are on the move. Just because it ticks every box, I thought I’d share an excerpt of the conversation broadcaster Alan Jones had with the immigration minister Peter Dutton earlier today. We break in to the conversation just as Jones is bemoaning the lurch to the left, Peter. Peter Dutton: That’s exactly right Alan and we must defeat it. Alan Jones: Oh yeah you have done a brilliant job. Look the Labor candidate for Bass, I mean this is every state by the way, this is the point that’s its every state, the Labor candidate for Bass in Tasmania Ross Hart said in the past that he would vote against turn backs. The Labor candidate for Cowan in Melbourne Anne Aly said ‘I support Labor’s stance to move towards a more humane and humanitarian approach.’ The Labor candidate for Higgins in Melbourne Corey Rabaut tweeted that the ‘German Neo-Nazi Party had endorsed Australia’s current refugee policy.’ You have got the former speaker Anna Burke, you have got the Freemantle MP Melissa Parke. I mean they are everywhere! Peter Dutton: Well they number twelve now and there is no sense in Bill Shorten saying at his press conference again today that there is nothing to see here, everything is fine, Labor will just continue the policies of the Coalition government. He needs to come out and answer this. It’s now a leadership issue for Mr Shorten today. Alan Jones: Well yes it’s overtaken the campaign this. Peter Dutton: Well this is the issue and he needs to deal with Mr Albanese and discipline him. The interview last night on Lateline where Mr Albanese refused point blank to state that he supported the position of the Coalition in relation to turn backs where its safe to do so, in relation to Temporary Protection Visas and in relation to offshore processing. They are the three elements Alan that have given us success in stopping these boats and Anthony Albanese refused on several occasions last night to confirm that that was actually Labor’s potion and Mr Shorten needs to deal with this. This is his leadership opponent and he needs to deal with this split in the Labor party because it’s clear that if he can’t govern them in opposition then how on earth can he govern them if he was to win the election. Alan Jones: Yes it’s one thing to say we are in unity with the government on border protection when you have disunity within your party. Just coming to another point, but related to that. I noticed you said, just a quick one on this, there is a lot of intelligence coming out of different parts about people hoping that the election is the turning point for them and that there might be an opportunity for them after the election to restart their businesses, their people smuggling businesses. I don’t want men, and this is Peter Dutton, ‘men, women and children to go to the bottom of the ocean and I don’t want people to turn up unannounced to our country.’ So your intelligence tells you that they are on the alert and watching every move? Peter Dutton: Yes they are and this was reported on Channel 7 only a fortnight ago Alan. People smugglers are telling people in Indonesia that they are waiting for the outcome of the election and they think that it could be a turning point, a change of policy and that the people smugglers would be back in business. They watch every word that Shorten says, that Turnbull says, that Dutton says, that Marles’ says and if they can then they manipulate that into a message that the boats are able to restart that you will be settled in Australia. That is why we have a tough, strong and consistent line and that’s why they would be rubbing their hands together in Indonesia now at the words of Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese. That’s why this government will not blink and we will not be dictated to by people smugglers and we are not going to allow women and children to drown at sea. Alan Jones: Good on you. I just want to say this to you because politicians never get any credit. There are people listening to you all over Australia at the moment and they are just simply saying that they are very grateful that Peter Dutton is there representing their interests and they feel infinitely safer as a result of that so I thank you and congratulate you and wish you well. Peter Dutton: Thank you Alan and all the best to you too mate. A bit more on that WA polling that Calla Wahlquist referenced in our postcard from WA. The polling was revealed this morning by the political editor of the West Australian, Andrew Probyn. The polling found drug-related crime, ice and jobs to be dominant issues in the [Burt] electorate. The unpopularity of the Barnett government is also dragging down the coalition vote in WA, the polling found. The six-point swing away from the government in Burt, if reflected evenly across the State, would result in the Liberal Party losing Cowan (held by Luke Simpkins by 4.5 per cent) and possibly Hasluck (Ken Wyatt, 6 per cent). But Liberal insiders believe the advantage of incumbency and strong local campaigns will keep Mr Simpkins and Mr Wyatt above water. Both seats were analysed by Crosby Textor in February-March. (KM: My lovely colleague Calla Wahlquist sent me this dispatch from the hustings in Perth early this morning, and it’s only just boxed its way out of my inbox. We’ve moved on from 7am but it’s too delightful not to share.) Here’s Calla. Matt Keogh, Labor candidate for the newly created seat of Burt, has made an upsetting realisation. “The thing about the Canning by-election that is different to this campaign is it started cold and got warmer,” he said, as the crisp morning air at Gosnells train station turned his breath to fog. “This campaign started warm and will get colder.” It’s 7am and Keogh and a team of red-shirted volunteers are handing out flyers. Gosnells, 34km southeast of the Perth CBD, is just outside the old boundary of the Canning electorate, which Keogh unsuccessfully contested in the by-election in September. It’s now part of the new outer metropolitan electorate of Burt, formed out of the northern part of the Canning electorate, including part of Armadale and the suburbs of Forrestdale, Harrisdale, Piara Waters, and Kelmscott, and southern areas of Liberal-held Hasluck, like Gosnells and Thornlie. Keogh, who moved back to his home suburb of Kelmscott to contest the Canning byelection, has remained in place and swapped out the name Canning for Burt on his campaign materials while the electorate was re-drawn around him. “This is my hood,” says the bespeckled lawyer in a pea coat. Burt was considered to be notionally a Liberal seat, with a 6.1% margin for Liberal candidate Matt O’Sullivan, but according to The West Australian on Tuesday the Liberal Party’s own Crosby Textor polling has it on 50:50. O’Sullivan runs mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s GenerationOne Indigenous employment scheme and had Forrest’s enthusiastic support to enter politics. But despite that high-profile backer, Labor is quietly confident it can win. Keogh, who is expecting his first child in July with wife Annabel, has received some advice against that eventuality from his old opponent, Canning MP Andrew Hastie. “He did give me one piece of advice, which was if I am elected, Virgin is better for taking babies than Qantas,” Keogh said. He smiled broadly when asked how he’d balance the demands of a newborn baby if voters do send him to Canberra. “There’s never been a more exciting time to be a Keogh,” he said. While Bishop was talking, the Liberal party has issued a statement about the allocation of preferences in this campaign. This of course relates to speculation about the Liberal party preferencing Greens in Victoria. Former prime minister John Howard earlier this year publicly advised his colleagues not to go down that road. The statement from the party’s federal director says no deals, no comment. The foreign minister Julie Bishop is speaking to reporters in Adelaide. She’s asked whether she would support easing restrictions around nuclear power generation in Australia in the wake of a royal commission in SA on the subject. Bishop says sure, with several caveats. Julie Bishop: We would certainly want to see the business case for it. It would obviously have to be economically feasible and I believe that the Royal Commission has taken it a step further with this wide consultation and feedback and expert report. The state government is yet to say what it will do with it and of course the state government commissioned the royal commission report so we would be happy to work with the state government on a proposal that will provide economic growth and jobs in SA but it would need broad community consultation and broad community support. The last question is on the five cent piece, which is a minor obsession of news.com political editor Mal Farr, on the basis the five cent piece actually costs six cents to produce. Bowen says he has no plans to get rid of it but if Labor wins on July 2 he’ll ask the Mint for advice. And that’s a wrap at the NPC. Bowen is asked will he take the money back from the Reserve Bank that the Coalition gave the Reserve Bank shortly after the 2013 election – money which significantly inflated the deficit. Bowen quips that Tony Burke’s (the shadow finance minister) eyes just lit up but no, the RBA can keep the money. Bowen also gives a broad hint that Labor will have something to say about increasing the superannuation guarantee later in the campaign. Q: When will you tell us? Chris Bowen: There’s a two month election campaign coming, just bear with us. He’s asked about Labor’s asylum policy. Bowen, a former immigration minister, says Labor had a brawl over this at the national conference, the party has set the course, and will keep the course. He says the shadow cabinet stands behind the leader. Chris Bowen: My moral compass, our moral compass points us very clearly to lifting the refugee intake, inviting more refugees into Australia, in a safe and orderly process. So that we never have to go back to the situation where an immigration minister is taking the call at 2 o’clock in the morning, another boat is sinking. We cannot countenance that. Yes the Labor party is a church full of people who are wanting to do the right thing by their fellow human beings. You’ll have people who sometimes have a different way of doing it but the shadow cabinet, the incoming cabinet, is unanimously behind Richard Marles and his determination, and Bill Shorten’s determination to ensure that the people smugglers trade does not recommence. We went through an emotional debate at the national conference. Tony Burke gave a very fine speech at the national conference in support of what is a policy many people will regard as tough but one which is necessary to save lives. And having been through that debate at national conference, having made that decision, we stand by it. Bowen is asked whether he’ll submit Labor’s costing to treasury. He signals he’ll send them to the Parliamentary Budget Office. He also signals Labor would also keep the current head of the treasury, John Fraser, not sack him as the government sacked Martin Parkinson (who Malcolm Turnbull subsequently brought back as the head of his department when he took the Liberal leadership.) Bowen is asked about keeping the deficit levy. He says Labor will keep it permanently. Chris Bowen: This has been the tax rate now for two years. The world hasn’t ended. Of course when fiscal circumstances allow, again, we’d review all our tax rates with a view to providing relief where we could when fiscal circumstances allow – but I’m not going to make outlandish promises about that because the budget can’t afford it, and the tax system is rightly progressive and important part of that is the top marginal tax rate. Bowen is asked about Labor’s position opposing elements of the budget superannuation measures on the basis they are retrospective. Bernard Keane from Crikey notes these are wealthy people exploiting our retirement incomes system to avoid paying the tax that they should be paying. There’s nothing noble about what they’re doing. Why if you’re focused on fairness and fiscal discipline don’t you support these changes given the nature of what’s been going on in unsustainable retirement incomes system now for many years? Bowen repeats what he said in the speech. As I said, we accept that these are people of means and by and large Liberal voters but there’s an important principle here – the principle also goes to undermining confidence in superannuation for everybody. Bowen is asked about when Labor will return to surplus. The shadow treasurer says Labor will have more to say about this later in the campaign. He’s asked whether he’s confident that Labor can oppose many of the government’s expenditure measures, fund its own priorities, and protect Australia’s AAA credit rating. He’s asked specifically can that work over the forward estimates of the current budget. Bowen says the return to surplus needs to happen over a longer timeframe. Chris Bowen: The last thing the real economy needs at the moment is a massive withdrawal of fiscal activity in some rush to surplus over the next four years. Q: I have a question about a Labor policy I found from 2010. This was where Labor went to the people at the election with a plan to reduce the company tax rate by 2% and did it with economic modelling that showed that this plan would not only increase growth but would also increase wages. Why is it that a plan that was right for then at a time of deficits and slow growth, but is not a good plan now when we have exactly the same problem? Are you being a populist by telling people what you think they want to hear rather than telling them what the economy needs – and do you acknowledge that a company tax cut can lift growth? Chris Bowen: That would be the company tax cut the Liberals and Nationals voted against with the Greens and blocked in the Senate. That would be the company tax cut that your referring to. These are matters of priorities. I’ve laid out pretty clearly today our policy of ... investing in schools and hospitals. These things mean that we do have to make decisions and this tax cuts simply cannot be afforded at this time. They are into questions now. Peter Martin from Fairfax asks whether Labor would use its mini budget to justify breaking election promises. He correctly notes we’ve seen this trajectory before. Chris Bowen says he won’t. The next question is whether Labor has any plans to reinstate the debt ceiling. Bowen says no, he doesn’t. Bowen is very much the architect of Labor’s big target strategy on policy. He says if Labor is going to return to government, it needs a mandate. Chris Bowen: Bill Shorten and I are as one in wanting to seek a mandate for our economic plan. Our budget repair plan, our plan for growth, and opportunity, we want the moral authority of a mandate. It goes against the conventional wisdom to be honest about controversial plans before an election but it comes down to trust. Malcolm Turnbull talks about thrust but the fact is Labor trusts the Australian people by being upfront and honest about our plans. Malcolm Turnbull on the other hand didn’t even trust the Australian people enough to tell them the cost of the centre piece of his election budget. Now we are on to retrospectivity in the government’s super changes. Chris Bowen says Labor opposes retrospectivity on principle: people invested in good faith and complied with the law, secondly, retrospective changes undermine confidence in superannuation and scare people away from investing in superannuation in the future. Bowen says we will hear plenty about Labor’s first class NBN plans during this election – which is good, given all we’ve heard thus far is Bill Shorten saying Labor would build on the government’s roll-out and then subsequently suggesting Labor would do something else. I suspect the voters would like to know which version it is. Chris Bowen: Australia does really need, dare I say it, a plan for jobs and growth. The government says that their plan will be delivered by making cuts to families in the middle and directing a series of tax cuts for those at the top. Remember, that many of the cuts in the discredited 2014 budget remain in this one, unloved, but alive. The growth model here is the plainest example of trickle down economics we’ve seen in a very long time. In contrast, Labor recognises that economic growth is hindered when there’s a hit to demand and when vital economic and social investments aren’t made. This was the big story of Australia getting through the global financial crisis and ... the 2014 Budget. When you attack demand you hit confidence and you reduce growth. Labor believes in inclusive growth, the Liberal model is a pretty exclusive one. After a section on the perils of losing Australia’s AAA credit rating, Bowen has reached the mini budget commitment now – he says he will bring forward the mid year economic forecasts to within three months of a new Labor government being sworn in. Chris Bowen: The impact of the prime minister’s decision to hold an election in July is that in the normal course of events, a budget in May 2017, a full ten months after the election, would be the first opportunity to have our policies impact on the fiscal and economic trajectory of the nation. That is too long. We flagged this morning that Bowen would work up in this speech to a commitment to a mini budget, given he’s unhappy with the forecasts in last week’s budget. Chris Bowen: The return to surplus under the government’s plan is built on extremely shaky foundations. In fact, I’m prepared to say none of it can be relied upon. The forecast for nominal growth is rosy at best. The budget assumes nominal GDP growth will leap from 2.5% this year to 4. 25% next year. That’s the same leap of 1. 7% they presumed last year. It’s at odds with the ratings agency Moody’s which predicts amore modest level. Real GDP is also assumed to just back to 3% even though the Treasury said last November that Australia’s long-term growth rate was being revised down. The government seems to think that talking about jobs and growth delivers jobs and growth. They seem to think that the way to produce a budget surplus is to assume one. That’s their version of the Abbott-hockey mantra. Things are better just because we’re here. Well, I can’t rely on such presumptions for the important task of return to budget balance. Kind of amazing really that this is a budget in reply speech when we are in an election campaign. But here we are. The shadow treasurer is on his feet. Chris Bowen: The mantra of jobs and growth is a slogan that could be applied to any budget, it’s so vague as to be meaningless. (Probably best to be careful here, given jobs and growth was actually Wayne Swan’s slogan for a very long time.) Bowen, continuing. In fact this budget distinguishes itself by a lack of a clear objective no clear plan to get back to surplus, no clear vision for a future economy. Just quickly – here’s a table showing the needs based school funding by electorate, courtesy of clever people in our Sydney office. We are pushing now into Chris Bowen at the National Press Club so I’m going to reserve doing some analysis of the various events until we are on the other side of that event. But it’s safe to note that the Labor backroom will be grinding their teeth about the trajectory of today. Today was supposed to be about electorate-by-electorate schools funding, but the campaign has been caught in a pincer movement between Greens brinkmanship, and some deft rapid response from the Coalition. Rapid response, exhibit A. More on that, and more besides, over the course of the afternoon. And I’ll get to gotcha. Promise. Chris Bowen, up in fifteen minutes. So much excitements. Another reporter follows Lenore’s question. What’s the direct benefit to the economy? What’s that that figure? Are you going to release the figure? Malcolm Turnbull: The figures in terms of the response to the economy has been identified by the treasury as being a growth in GDP by 1% overall so that is over the long-term but you see you get the growth, the response begins and it builds up. One of the reasons we have calibrated the tax cut to business in the way we have so it starts with smaller firms like the businesses we are talking to this morning, and then bills up until finally, after a decade, every company, including the largest, is paying 25% tax is that you will get an investment reaction in advance of the tax cut because firms will see that there is a tax cut coming down the track and they will say: “We can invest now and then when we make the profit we anticipate on that investment we’ll be paying tax at a lower rate.” So we have very carefully designed this company tax cut, this enterprise tax plan so, that we get the maximum outcome in terms of investment and in employment and that is what will drive it. My colleague Lenore Taylor asks Turnbull to be clear – he’s not ruling out a preference deal with the Greens – (he isn’t), and she wants to bring him back to the Mitre 10 franchise. The owner of the business told Lenore this morning he would use the coming tax cut to either employ more people or make more profits. How does making more profits assist jobs and growth, she wants to know? Malcolm Turnbull: Lenore, in terms of cutting company tax, it is well understood and well accepted that if you reduce the level of business taxes, company taxes, then you will get a better return on investment, you will see more investment and you will see more employment and that is the inevitable consequence of it. Obviously different firms will react in different ways but that is why of course Mr Bowen has previously advocated cutting company taxes ... We’ve got to compete (with comparable tax rates overseas). We back business and they will then invest and employ and that is the consequence of what they’ll do. Turnbull is asked about the RBA note about negative gearing. He says the note is old, and Labor doesn’t have a housing affordability policy. Malcolm Turnbull: It is purely and simply a tax grab, another Labor tax grab. Q: Prime minister, Labor has launched an attack on the government’s tax cuts for higher income earners. What do you make of those advertisements and are they fair given they don’t take into consideration the changes to superannuation? Malcolm Turnbull: Let’s be quite clear - the only cuts to personal income tax in our Budget is the increase of the $80,000 threshold to $87,000 to ensure that Australians in the middle income bracket are not going to move into the second-top tax bracket. What Bill Shorten is proposing is to increase personal income tax. He is proposing to add another 2% after the deficit levy expires, he’s proposing to add another 2% to the top marginal rate. He’s got a commitment to higher personal income tax whereas we are reducing by that threshold change and of course you’re right, in terms of the changes to superannuation, they – 96% of people in super and Australians who are contributing to super, 96% will either be better off, particularly older Australians and women and people on low incomes, they’ll be better off and only 4% will be affected by the changes in any way that they would find adverse. In terms of the change to the retirement phase, of course it affects around 1%, that is people with a superannuation account in retirement of over $1.6million – which is about 1%. First question is the prospect of a hung parliament. Will you preference the Greens Turnbull takes the opportunity to recount the events of the morning. Malcolm Turnbull: If you doubt Bill Shorten’s ability to keep our borders secure given the dissension in his back bench and in his own party, consider what it would be like if we have the same old Labor with the same old deal with the Greens. Remember, nobody in the Labor party did more to create the Julia Gillard prime ministership than Bill Shorten. Right now he looks as though he wants to re-enact it. Q: Do you rule out any informal arrangements in Victoria or elsewhere with the Greens? Malcolm Turnbull: If you’re asking about preferences, the federal director will decide how preferences are allocated. Obviously when we know who’s nominated. That will be done in the usual way, in consultation with the organisation. Q: There was a hung parliament. Would you rule outdoing a deal with the Greens to form government? Malcolm Turnbull: There is absolutely no chance – yes we can rule out any collaboration withthe Greens to form a government butI can tell you Labor won’t and Labor can’t and if they did no-one would believe them. Malcolm Turnbull: It’s wonderful to be here. Our national economic plan is driving jobs and growth and you can see the spirit of it here in Queensland, the confidence, the optimism, the determination to get ahead. That’s what we’re backing. We’re backing Australia. We’re backing the imaginative, the innovative, the enterprising Australians we’ve been with today because we know as we support them their businesses will grow, their enterprises will grow and they will provide more and better jobs to young Australians, Australians of all ages right across the board. Jobs and growth, our national economic plan, Australia’s future. That’s what the choice in this election is all about. The prime minister is excited. Yes he is. Malcolm Turnbull looks pumped full of glucose jelly beans as he speaks about robots at this media conference. There has never been a more exciting time to be enthusing over robots in hospitals. Some quick reader feedback on my Facebook forum about the Shorten media event from Kelso Kel. Reading the interview transcript with Shorten and Cathy O’Toole, it makes me so angry and frustrated that she’s being badgered for a gotcha moment on refugee policy. It’s backing people into a corner like that which transforms a policy discussion into high-stakes take-no-prisoners extremism and which doesn’t serve anyone! I’m 100% anti the bipartisan position on asylum seekers but I don’t agree with the way (some) members of the media make a game of policy differences within parties. All that does is shut down debate, shuts down differences of opinion and it trains our electorate to focus on the gotcha instead of the issue. This is a big subject – gotcha versus substantive discussion in election seasons. I can’t post about it now but I will return to this later, afternoon willing. It’s a topic worth walking through. I’m pop down to the thread when I get a chance. Haven’t had an opportunity yet. Banners in position. Check. Arrival of the prime minister. Pending. A short dispatch from me on the ground in FNQ. Bill Shorten arrived at Heatley Public School in Townsville this morning with his candidate Cathy O’Toole to meet the kids and highlight Labor’s Gonski funding package. He was keen to do three things: tell the Greens to bugger off, not let in a crack of light on asylum seeker policy and talk about the importance of the regions. The problem was a photo surfaced of O’Toole protesting outside the offices of LNP MP for Herbert, Ewen Jones, holding a sign saying “let them stay”. It was posted on Facebook and shared around by the Coalition. O’Toole’s stance would be at odds with Labor’s policy, which Shorten was keen to again enunciate this morning. “We will be compassionate in the way we treat refugees in this country but what we will never do is re allow the opening of the dangerous seaways between Java and Christmas Island.” O’Toole was asked about her views. After some campaign counselling, she said she wanted to be very clear. “I want to be very clear, I support the Labor policy.” Shorten moved on to the Greens and their suggestion that the party was open to another deal with Labor in the event of a hung parliament. “Tell him he’s dreaming,” said Shorten. Labor is being very emphatic about not doing a deal, after the last deal in the 43rd parliament under Julia Gillard. Shorten also managed to label the Greens “far left” in the doorstop, trying to widen the gap between the Greens and Labor. It was a point he also made on ABC Townsville this morning - that is, do not think a vote for the Greens is same as a vote for Labor. This afternoon, there a few more stops on the Shorten express, though we are not entirely sure what they are. There are rumours of a stadium. And perhaps water. Though not boats. Just quickly on Gonski, I’m exploring whether or not I can link you to the electorate level funding in embeddable form (here’s looking at you Nick Evershed), but for now, here are the state breakdowns Labor is promising today for needs based schools funding. This is according to the campaign materials Labor is circulating. State Additional investment: SA $355 million VIC $815 million NSW $1.4 billion TAS $60 million QLD $725 million WA $330 million ACT $25 million NT $100 million TOTAL $3.8 billion Shorten was asked at the press conference about the risk of state governments withdrawing funding after the Commonwealth kicks in. The example of Queensland was cited. Shorten said everything’s different now in Queensland because there’s now a Labor government at the state level. That answer isn’t entirely satisfactory, is it? I will pick this all apart once we are through the rush of set piece events, and also give you some detail on the Gonski announcement for today. The prime minister is coming up shortly with a media conference in Brisbane. Stay tuned. Down in Melbourne, the Greens MP Adam Bandt is shovelling coal into the minority government fire. Q: What did you think of Bill Shorten ruling out a Coalition with the Greens? Adam Bandt: I think if we end up in a parliament like we did after 2010 where no party wins then I think the Australian people would expect people in parliament to work together and to work together cooperatively and that means no-one is able to take their bat and ball and go home. It means having sensible and reasonable discussions about what - about how to deal with the fact that the Australian people have returned this particular parliament. Bill Shorten can say that we’re dreaming, sometimes dreams come true. And if the Australian people decide that they want a parliament where there are more than two voices who largely say the same thing then the obligation is on all of us to work together and Richard Di Natale will be speaking more about this later on today. A few questions to round out on. Was Shorten unhappy the first debate of the campaign is in Sydney? Bill Shorten: I really regret that Mr Turnbull would rather stay in Sydney and debate me than come to Townsville where a lot of people legitimately have an expectation of hearing both of us. Q: Scott Morrison has said that the RBA’s notes were prepared in 2014 regarding negative gearing. What’s your response to that? Bill Shorten: I think poor old Scott Morrison has blundered from one mistake to the next. Q: Your superannuation policy is retrospective too? Bill Shorten: No, I think as people have examined the fine print of this budget, you know, they are quite shocked by what Mr Morrison and Mr Turnbull have proposed. Then a full toss on Eric Abetz. Q: On Eric Abetz, would you support, some of his Tasmanian colleagues say he should be back in Cabinet. That a good idea? Bill Shorten: There they are again. There’s the Liberal party arguing about the spoils of victory that they haven’t won. On the last question in that post, about the Greens and minority parliaments – Shorten’s final locution is a bit hedged. Bill Shorten: Can I put it another way to Mr Bandt and the Greens – tell ‘em they’re dreaming. No deals with Labor about forming a Coalition. No deals. (I don’t think the questions was about coalitions – I think it was about deals to form a minority government.) Q: On the Greens, would you be prepared to form a partnership with the Greens to form minority government? Bill Shorten: No, I wouldn’t. Q: School results haven’t improved with the money allocated so why is more money the answer? Bill Shorten: The only people who say more money isn’t the answer are generally people who already have a lot of money. Q: You’re proposing extra federal funding for schools but how will you ensure states like Queensland which never signed up to the last Gonski deals won’t cut their education budgets or keep it flat lining? Bill Shorten: There’s been a change in the government of Queensland. Campbell Newman, who was remarkably belligerent in his negotiations with us - I think that was his modus operandi – the government’s changed. Q: What would you do if there’s a hung parliament? Bill Shorten: The question was what would we do in the event of a draw. Let me make it very clear. Whilst Labor is the underdog, whilst we’ve got a steep climb to win twenty seats, we’re in it to win it. Q: The Liberals are poised to do a deal with the Greens. What do you think about that? Bill Shorten: There you go, the Liberal party. They say that only the Liberals can be trusted and they don’t like any of the centre parties, the centre left parties like us or extreme left-wing parties like the Greens, yet what they would do is they would do a dirty deal with the people they say are furthest from their views just to gain power. The Liberals are only backing the Greens because it’s in the Liberal party’s interest. Shorten then shuts down further questions on this subject to the candidate. He says he was happy to have five questions, but now things need to move on. The first question is about turnbacks. Can Shorten articulate Labor’s policy? Bill Shorten: We will support boat turnbacks where the border forces deem it appropriate. It is part of our general plan. We will, after July 2, if elected, keep the people smugglers out of business. We will be compassionate in the way we treat refugees in this country but what we will never do is re allow the opening of the dangerous seaways between Java and Christmas Island. Then the questions go to the candidate, Cathy O’Toole. Q: Cathy O’Toole, can I ask if you support that? What’s your response to what should happen, should we have boat turnbacks? Cathy O’Toole: I want to be really clear. I 100% support theLabor policy. Q: Can you articulate what that is? Cathy O’Toole: I can say to you that Labor will put money into the UNHCR to ensure that we are supporting people and not being left in camps for decades. Q: But you don’t support boat turnbacks? Cathy O’Toole: I support the Labor policy which says we will not be allowing people to put their lives at risk, to be exploited and to come to this country when we can make an alternative arrangement for them. Q: How do you reconcile that with a photo on your Facebook page campaigning outside Ewen Jones’s electorate office holding up a sign saying, “Let them stay.”? Cathy O’Toole: I have been a member of Amnesty International for many years. What I was saying at that point in time is very clear - I support the humane treatment of people regardless of whether they’re efugees or not. We treat people humanely. I do not support people making extreme amounts of money by extortionate measures and risking people’s lives. Q: Is offshore processing a humane treatment? Cathy O’Toole: Labor’s policy is looking to put the money into the UNHCR to go back to the source, to say how do we support people to get them out of these lengthy detention camps where they are sitting for decades. I’ve met many of these people here in Townsville. Q: Do you still want those people to come to Australia though? Cathy O’Toole: I think we need to - our policy is really clear, support people in a humane way, let us ensure that people are not being drowned at sea. Let us ensure that people are not being exploited and paying extortionate amounts of money that put themselves and their families at risk. Shadow education minister Kate Ellis. Malcolm Turnbull may want to talk about youth and jobs but let’s be very, very clear, you don’t care about youth and jobs if you don’t care about an adequately supported, quality education system. The OECD themselves have pointed out that one thing that Australia could do to boost our future economy is boost our education system and make sure that we have more graduates with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. This is about students, this is about principals and parents but this is also about Australia’s economic growth and you do not grow the economy unless you support our education system. The Labor leader has opened the batting on schools funding today. Bill Shorten tells reporters that he will be campaigning in north Queensland for several days. Bill Shorten: I’m spending a fair bit of my time in North Queensland to start off with because I will be a prime minister, if elected, who governs for all Australia not just the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. The best way you demonstrate you’re bona fides is by putting education, first, prioritising the proper funding of schools. Is this a paint pot I see before me? Thanks to the ABC’s live election blog for this excerpt from Julie Bishop on Adelaide radio about superannuation. Julie Bishop: We’ll have a consultation period, we’ll discuss it with the public, we’ll have draft legislation, and we’ll get feedback on any unintended consequences, as one would expect. Q: Unintended consequences and feedback is code for backpedalling? Julie Bishop: No it’s not. Q: You’re now facing a backlash are you not, particularly from Liberal heartland over the retrospective nature of some of the taxes that you’ve imposed? Julie Bishop: It is not retrospective, it is absolutely not retrospective, it’s about the tax rate on future earnings. ABC political reporter Naomi Woodley, who has listened to the Bishop interview, says the foreign minister also held the line on retrospectivity, which begs the question, what would the government be consulting about? Meanwhile, to our north. The other story bubbling around this morning is the superannuation measures the government outlined in the recent budget. The hot political issue is retrospectivity – whether or not the government is imposing a new tax on existing super savings. The government has been insisting that’s not the case. This morning, on ABC News Radio, the trade minister Steve Ciobo said there was nothing retrospective about increasing a tax from zero to 15%. If that’s considered retrospective then the government could never increase any taxes because that would be retrospective. But meanwhile, in Adelaide, an apparent departure from the holding line – which has been nothing to see here. While we are waiting for the campaign dam to break, I can point you in the direction of the latest in our series of campaign essays. Today’s contribution is from David Marr. I think it’s fair to say David is underwhelmed by the spectacle. “In 2016 the government and opposition will bicker over the revenue, as they always do in election campaigns. But neither side of politics will approach the underlying problem here. Preserving Australia as a paradise for the prosperous is their joint enterprise.” I can also remind you to sign up for Campaign Catch-Up, a summary of the day on the hustings delivered direct to your inbox. A most marvellous innovation. Get amongst it. We are in a slight pause at the present time as the two leaders position. I think Bridie Jabour mentioned this first up but in the event you are just tuning in, the other major set piece of the day is a speech the shadow treasurer Chris Bowen will make to the National Press Club. Bowen will promise to produce a mini-budget within three months of being sworn in, telling the club the government’s budget forecasts are so unrealistic they will need updating to avoid a AAA credit downgrade. Smile, as if this is the most natural thing in the world. Or perhaps that was the other way round. When the national media shows up, so do the candidates, little moths to flames. Meanwhile in Townsville, the Shorten travelling party has happened upon the local Coalition member, Ewen Jones. I see the media contingent following Malcolm Turnbull has adopted a pig that will deliver the squeak of truth whenever porkies are told. I wonder who is in charge of depressing the belly of the pig? My colleague Lenore Taylor is vox popping the owner of Mitre 10, who in a shock development, wouldn’t mind a tax cut, either to employ another person, or “make more money.” I’d say run Forrest, run (away from the Greens) but that would be wrong at a number of levels. Back to Townsville, Shorten is asked whether he’d be prepared to form a partnership with the Greens to form government. Bill Shorten: [Adam Bandt is] dreaming. Labor will fight this election to form its own government and to form a government in our own right. Meanwhile, in BrisVegas. I hope Lenore will bring me back a fire pit. I really want a fire pit. Looking up north, Bill Shorten has been on the ABC in Townsville. My colleague Gabrielle Chan is hot on his tail. I suspect she’ll send me a short dispatch so I’ll just deal with what we need to in order to bounce off the last post on boats. Shorten is asked about Labor’s position on border protection given the leadership says one thing and candidates another thing. Bill Shorten: Labor and Liberal, regardless of who wins after July 2, will not reintroduce onshore processing for people who come by boat from Indonesia. The people smugglers will stay out of business. Q: If that is the case, what’s the solution then? More money for Nauru, for facility there is? Bill Shorten: I think the solution ultimately is to get these people in those places resettled in third-party nations. Other places. And this government has been very slack at doing that. We’ve also said that we’ll take more refugees overall but we’re not going to have them come here in an unsafe means, ferried by criminals. Q: Are you having those discussions already with other nations that could be those third-party places in place of Manus Island? Bill Shorten: Other nations will deal with the elected government of the day. It’s very hard for them to deal with an opposition. But what I do know is that we’ve spoken to experts around the world, about the best way to deal with this situation ... A Labor government will be tough on people smugglers but humane in the treatment of any person who comes within the care of the Australian government directly or indirectly. Q: Aren’t voters right to be a little bit cynical about a party, if candidates are saying one thing and the leadership is saying something else on a matter like this? Bill Shorten: No, I think you will find that the general sentiment when you strip away from the gotcha moments of the media, is people want to see humane treatment. But we know in Labor and we debated our issues publicly at our national conference, so it was there for all to see. We know that the people smugglers cannot be allowed to comeback into business with their deadly and fatal consequences and what I can assure Australians that on this occasion even more importantly the criminal gangs in Indonesia, but if Liberal Labor are elected are a July 2, you’re not back in business, full stop. We are not going to let you risk and drown people at sea so you can make an evil dollar. On Sky News, the immigration minister Peter Dutton is doing his darndest to fan yesterday’s asylum story. Readers with me yesterday know that Labor’s candidate in the seat of Melbourne departed from the Shorten script on border protection, arguing for a more humane stance. SPLITTER shouted the campaign news cycle. This is how elections work. The news cycle rolls greedily between small g gaffes and capital G Gaffes to help break up the policy announcements and the campaign events. Yesterday was *Shorten stunned by asylum gaffe*, at least according to the Daily Telegraph, which is also doing its best to bang the drum on the scary asylum seeker invasion issue. Labor’s campaign spokeswoman Penny Wong follows Dutton in the Sky studios. Our policy is set, Wong says. Candidates have views but our policy is set. Thanks to Bridie for battling the sparrows wind wall of sound – and welcome good people of Politics Live to our live coverage of the 2016 election campaign, day two. It’s delightful to be with you. As Bridie’s early reporting suggests, the early morning news cycle is, predominantly, negative gearing and that inconvenient Reserve Bank note, and the prospect of another hung parliament and a Labor-Greens government. Let’s recap negative gearing first. A few months back, the treasurer Scott Morrison brandished some work from BIS Shrapnel which he presented as a comprehensive demolition of Labor’s negative gearing policy. Of course it was no such thing. Now, he’s the one battling an inconvenient note from the RBA which reads like an endorsement of Labor’s policy direction on negative gearing, except of course it isn’t: it’s a briefing note reflecting the bank’s long established thinking on the merits of winding back negative gearing, and the note predates Labor unveiling its policy. In politics, one thing is a constant: what goes around comes around. Now to hung parliaments. The polls, at least the early ones, suggest the major party contest is tight. You’d also think the current batch of House cross benchers have strong prospects of re-election. The tightness of the contest has led to analysis about whether the country could be heading into another minority parliament. The Greens seem happy to fan that analysis, positioning as the dancing partner of Labor in the event the voters push the Coalition backwards at the coming poll. The government is also happy with it: it puts flesh on the bones of that Labor/Greens alliance bogey man that lurks behind every shrub on every campaign stop. Labor, which has engaged in three years of deep tissue massage to try and remove the stress of the 43rd parliament, is less keen to fan that analysis. As Labor’s deputy leader Tanya Plibersek just told Radio National: “We are playing to win. Every seat we lose to the Greens makes it more likely we’ll have Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister.” These two issues are the drumbeat to open today. Malcolm Turnbull remains in Brisbane and will campaign there. Overnight the Labor campaign has repositioned in Townsville. Bill Shorten will campaign again on schools funding, releasing a seat-by-seat breakdown of the Gonski money. So let’s power on. A reminder that today’s comments thread is open for your election day business. Visual maestro Magic Mike is up and about on the twits – he’s @mpbowers and I’m @murpharoo. If you speak Facebook you can join my daily forum here. And if you want a behind-the-scenes look at the day and the looming campaign, give Mike a follow on Instagram. You can find him here. Onwards into Tuesday. Well blogans and bloganistas, our time together this morning has drawn to a close and your rightful blog driver Katharine Murphy is here to take you through the rest of the day. Thanks for reading and see you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed tomorrow morning. Malcolm Turnbull is wheels up to the northern Gold Coast seat of Forde and the northern Brisbane seat of Lilley – where Wayne Swan is the sitting member. Interesting tidbit about Forde – it’s the seat former Queensland premier Peter Beattie ran in 2013. At the time it was seen as a bit of a masterstroke, but then he lost. Straight after Adam Bandt we have Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek talking on pretty much the same themes – potential alliances and preference deals. We are playing to win, not playing to be part of a coalition government. Plibersek says her seat of Sydney is “absolutely” at risk of a Liberals-Greens preference deal and the Greens have been campaigning doggedly in her seat and Anthony Albanese’s seat of Grayndler. It makes another Liberal government more likely and I think frankly Greens voters would be disappointed. But why shouldn’t Greens do preference deals? Fine, they can do that, but then they can’t pretend they are not a political party like others, they want purity but of course they put their interests first going after seats like Sydney and Grayndler. It is absolutely cynical, it is absolutely political. They can’t pretend they are not making pragmatic deals that hurt people. The Daily Telegraph’s front page says the Labor party is in revolt over asylum seeker policy with candidates and MPs speaking out over turnbacks. Does that type of front page hurt Labor? I think the Daily Telegraph will be campaigning very hard for their chosen government and I’m sure there’ll be another front page tomorrow. Plibersek says it is difficult for Labor to explain a complex policy. She says they want to bring more asylum seekers to Australia but “we don’t want them drowning at sea”. Does she support turnbacks? It’s something we hope we never have to do but we have to have in our policy in case it’s necessary. Greens MP for Melbourne Adam Bandt is on Radio National talking about the “stable progressive government” the Greens would be open to forming with Labor in event of a hung parliament. [We would want to form a government] taking action on climate action, closing the gap between the rich and everyone else, we would be bringing an open mind to those discussions and trying to come up with a stable agreement. Most of the things Greens are taking to the election, including putting decency back into treatment of people coming here seeking our help, would be on the table...we wouldn’t be going in with [demands]. I hear Labor saying ‘we either govern alone or not at all’, and I think that would be a pig headed approach. When asked if the Greens are overstating their influence talking about potential coalitions in a hung parliament, considering they only have one seat in the lower house Bandt says the voters expect them to be upfront and explain their position. Of course, these statements open Labor up to a scare campaign allowing the government to talk about Gillard-era Labor-Greens government. The period of 2010 parliament was one of the most productive times ever, Tony Abbott said it was the worst thing ever and then we got Tony Abbott so I think people can make their own judgement. Bandt says there is a view in Labor that an alliance with the Greens is “electoral poison” but the poison was Labor tearing themselves apart in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. If they want to run that scare campaign they can do it but after Tony Abbott people will think twice. People want action on climate change, people want action on refugees, people want the gap between the rich and the poor closed. Bandt dances around questions about the supposed Greens-Liberal preference deals in some vulnerable Labor seats. He says there is no deal but does not deny negotiations. There’s only one party preferencing Liberals in Victoria and that’s Labor. I’m not involved in any discussion, if there are discussions it’s something the party is involved in. Well if you have to wake up at ridiculous o’clock, for a gruelling day on the campaign, at least the view is gorgeous Scott Morrison was asked on Radio National about potential threats to Australia’s AAA rating, which has prompted Labor to promise a mini-budget. This is a very sensitive environment and this is why it’s important to have a national economic plan. Multiple polls have voters feeling worse off under the government’s budget, but Morrison resorts to “national economic plan” when asked if the government needs to do more to sell it. This is just not a budget, this is a national economic plan for jobs and growth, it is not designed before an election to throw sweetners around because this is not a time to throw sweetners around. We are showing sober economic management that is necessary to get the economy through the transition. The treasurer is now on Radio National’s AM. When asked if he was concerned about a Reserve Bank document which showed it believed any policy that discourages negative gearing may be good for Australia’s financial stability. Of course not, this is a note, not an official RBA advice that was prepared in 2014, not commentary on Labor party policy. Morrison said measures introduced by the prudential regulator rendered the 2014 recommendation irrelevant as the matters had been dealt with. He said the RBA interest rate cut was a signal of that, as Glenn Stevens was able to announce the cut without being too concerned about the housing market. Something that would threaten our economy is a negative shock to the housing market. What the RBA said in 2014 was addressed by Apra and it worked. Asked about Sydney house prices rising by 11% in past year Morrison said policy could not just be created for the city. The experience is not the same across the country, I’m in Adelaide this morning and in places like Perth the experience is not the same, the sort of policies Labor is putting forward with the housing tax will slam markets across the country. When it was pointed out the RBA document said housing prices would only be affected if winding back negative gearing was not grandfathered, which is Labor policy, Morrison said it was not a commentary on Labor policy, and then started to commentate on Labor’s policy. [Labor’s policy] would put rents up too, where do people think the investors who own these properties will make up the losses? They will make up the losses by putting up rents. If you want to deal with housing affordability issues you have to deal with issues where housing supply is constrained. In Sydney and Melbourne where things are stronger you can deal with supply issues and not have negative impacts on places like Adelaide and Perth. We have the skinny on the first leaders’ debate: it will happen this Friday in the western Sydney suburb of Windsor. Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten’s debate is a joint venture between Sky News and News Corp Australia. Treasurer Scott Morrison is coming up on Radio National, in the meantime here are the Fairfax front pages today: Gabrielle Chan has set off for a jog with Bill Shorten – looks like she may be one of few women who have. The Australian has a piece today saying Shorten has shed a “heroic” amount of weight. The report also details the fitness and eating habits of the “other high-profile fat-shredder, Malcolm Turnbull”. Mr Shorten’s metamorphosis has put him in that weird zone that most late-40s men can relate to: lose any more weight and Shorten, 49 this week, will look gaunt. Gain any more and Peak Bill will be in danger of lurching back into the territory of Pie Shop Bill. While Shorten is running, the Aus says Turnbull was on his rowing machine at 4.45am in Brisbane. It may seem trivial stuff, but optics matter, and possibly even more importantly, stamina is required for this (feels like) 147 week campaign. Progressive campaigning group GetUp have mapped what Coalition cuts to hospitals will look like over the next 10 years. According to the group the policies amount to a $57bn cut over 10 years, equivalent to 37,000 hospital beds that can’t be funded, or 68,000 nurses or 33,000 doctors that can’t be paid, my colleague Paul Karp reports. The map is based on work by GetUp and unions using parliamentary budget office figures to estimate each state’s share of cuts based on their health funding and activity, then estimating each hospital’s share of the cuts by the number of their beds. The view from the Turnbull camp (with some added Snapchat pizzazz) Labor MP Terri Butler says sitting MPs in Queensland are being told to run their own campaigns and not expect a visit from the leader, according to the Courier-Mail. Instead Bill Shorten will be focusing on winnable Coalition seats in the sunshine state. They are focusing on the non-helds...We think there is a real opportunity to pick up a lot of seats in Queensland so those of us in held seats are sort of expected, quite rightly, to make sure that we are doing everything we can to retain it.” Butler holds the seat of Griffith in Brisbane’s inner south with a 3% margin. Labor needs 20 seats to win government in July and pollsters reckon there are about 10 winnable seats in Queensland, so it will be crucial to a victory for either party. Richard Di Natale has denied the report in the Herald-Sun that the Greens have done a deal with Liberals to get preferences in key vulnerable Labor seats. He says there is still the prospect of open tickets and the Greens will not favour Liberals. Our branches have already said they won’t be preferencing Liberals in any seats, ultimately will make decision about whether they will preference at all Turnbull’s secret weapon in the regions... There is a soft spot in my heart for Queensland, this is what the travelling pack with Shorten are waking up to in Townsville: Greens may dismiss forming government with the Liberals, but when it suits them they do not mind teaming up. The Herald-Sun is reporting the two parties are negotiating a deal where the Liberals would preference them in the Labor seats of Batman and Wills, and the Greens’ seat of Melbourne. In return, the Greens would issue open tickets — not preferencing Labor ahead of the Liberals — in outer-suburban seats. Good morning, another day dawns on the election trail with leaders (and readers) waiting with bated breath for ... well, for a stuff-up, for a policy announcement that turns everything on its head, for the killer line that sinks the other’s campaign. We’re only on day two, so feel free to breathe a bit. I’ll be guiding you through the early hours of the morning until Katharine Murphy’s steady hand on the tiller takes charge at 8.30am. The big picture: This morning is all about the economy, economy, economy. As well as the hypothetical of what would happen not just if either party won the election, but if there was a hung parliament – hey, it was only a few short six years ago that it happened. Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen is giving a speech to the National Press Club today and in it he will say Labor will deliver a mini-budget within three months of being elected because the numbers the government is using are too malleable. He even says Australia could be at risk of losing its AAA credit rating. In an economy where confidence is low and the Reserve Bank has repeatedly expressed concerns about the lack of investment, losing one or all the AAA ratings would be a real body blow to confidence. Bowen will also announce that a Labor government would have the Parliamentary Budget Office take control of economic forecasts in budgets so it is an “arm’s length process”. Greens leader Richard Di Natale has been talking about the possibility of a hung parliament. He says it is “inconceivable” the Greens would negotiate with the Coalition to form government but the door would be open to Bill Shorten. The Australian is running the story as a potential return to the “Gillard-era”. My own view is, given this government’s record on things like global warming, on their cruel treatment of refugees, on making inequality worse rather than better, that it is inconceivable we could enter into an agreement with the Coalition. If the Labor party is interested in taking this country into a more progressive, more sustainable direction, then obviously we would be happy to have those negotiations closer to the time. The possibility of a hung parliament loomed large on Q&amp;A last night, where Melbourne MP Adam Bandt backed his leader and said the Greens would be open to forming a coalition government with Labor. Labor shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh, who was also on the panel, immediately tried to distance himself from that, saying he was “not inclined” to believe it was a good path to go on – of course each major party would ideally want to win in its own right. Although, a hung parliament is no pie in the sky stuff, yesterday’s polls had the Coalition and Labor neck and neck and today’s Guardian Lonergan poll has the two major parties at 50%-50% on the two party preferred vote. Among younger voters the reaction to the budget was quite harsh, with 61% of 18- to 24-year-olds saying it made them less likely to vote Liberal, while 30% said they were more likely to support Turnbull and 9% were unsure. Over at the Daily Telegraph Labor members and candidates are apparently “in revolt” over asylum seeker policy and Bill Shorten’s campaign is off to a “nightmare start”. A key one? The Labor candidate in the Greens-held seat of Melbourne has “concerns about turnbacks. I don’t think they should be on the table.” In too-weird-to-make-a-joke-about news, there may be a bust of Phillip Ruddock installed among the water fountains in a western Sydney playground, which is already named after him. On the candidate front, dumped Liberal MP Dennis Jensen has announced that he will run as an independent and that “branch stackers should be jailed”. To keep in the loop in the afternoon sign up here for our special election 2016 email, the Campaign catchup, a quick read on the campaign news of the day, delivered every afternoon. On the campaign trail: After spending yesterday blitzing marginal seats in Brisbane, Malcolm Turnbull will be on the move this morning, possibly going south. Shorten is expected to camp out in north Queensland for the next few days, he arrived in Cairns yesterday and spent the night in Townsville. He is expected to visit at least one school this morning. The race you should be paying attention to right now: Nick Xenophon is making both parties very nervous in South Australia, including Liberal Jamie Briggs – who you may remember resigned last year after improper conduct in a Hong Kong bar. He holds the seat of Mayo with what would usually be a very comfortable 12.5% margin. However, the Nick Xenophon Team has identified Mayo as a key target. Xenophon polled 28.3% of the Senate vote in Mayo at the 2013 election. Briggs could be in trouble if the NXT candidate can overtake Labor and benefit from Labor and Greens preferences. And another thing(s): Katharine Murphy has spent countless hours and weeks (no, really, they are countless) on this stunning piece about Bill Shorten and the nature of leadership. She says it is an essay three years in the making and is the sum of her observations and meditations since Shorten became leader. There are truly too many great quotes to pull out from it but this was one of my favourites: Shorten claims to lead institutionally but not factionally, which in the ALP is a bit like saying you tried marijuana in your youth but didn’t inhale: preposterous, in other words. This piece from Buzzfeed should come with a vulgar content warning, but it has been shared by so many staffers from both sides of politics in my social media feeds with the message “advancing has become a nightmare” (advancing is when staffers go to a spot where a leader will be photographed and make sure there are no signs that say “reject” or “last exit” if the leadership is being threatened. They basically look out for bad photo opportunities). An example of the extra layer of unpredictability social media and smartphones have added to the campaign. I recorded a podcast with Kristina Keneally and my colleague Gabrielle Jackson about how to survive an eight-week election campaign. There are lots of interesting insights from Keneally about what it is like for the leader, emotionally and physically, on the trail.

A sophisticated hacking group, whose members moved its servers from the Iranian capital Tehran to Canada in January 2012, stole hundreds of sensitive documents from the officials and businesspeople in an eight-month spying campaign. That began in December 2011, researchers from the security firms Kaspersky Labs and Seculert have told the Guardian. Email and Facebook accounts belonging to the victims were also spied on during the attack, which follows a string of attempts to snoop on top-secret projects in the Middle East. Researchers believe the attack, revealed for the first time on Tuesday, was coordinated from four bases in Canada by a group of Farsi-speaking hackers. It is not known whether the cyber espionage was state-sponsored. Aviv Raff, chief technology officer of Seculert, told the Guardian: \"Most of these 800 victims are from Middle Eastern countries, starting with Iran, then Israel, then Afghanistan, and are all from critical infrastructure companies, financial services and even government officials.\" The attack secretly downloaded the Madi spying software on to a victim's computer when they downloaded an email attachment, usually in the form of an innocent-looking Microsoft PowerPoint file. Once downloaded, the software installed a keylogger able to record every keystroke on the target's computer, to track login details for sensitive websites. The Madi malware could also take screenshots of a victim's computer activity – most commonly their email exchanges and social networking habits – and record audio. Gigabytes of data has been stolen from victims' computers over the eight-month period, the researchers said. \"While the malware and infrastructure is very basic compared to other similar projects, the Madi attackers have been able to conduct a sustained surveillance operation against high-profile victims,\" said Nicolas Brulez, a senior malware researcher at Kaspersky Lab. Unlike more commonly known spam emails, researchers said these messages were designed deliberately for their targets and not sent to tens of thousands of people across the world. Some of the emails attached a PowerPoint presentation or a Word document, and others had a video of a missile test, pictures of a nuclear explosion and an image of Jesus. Another email contained a copy of a Daily Beast article discussing Israel and Iran. Raff, from Seculert, said: \"There's definitely a religious thing. They are trying to lure people to open these emails.\" News of the latest cyber surveillance plot follows a string of other data snooping attempts discovered in the past 12 months. Two of the most complex online attacks ever discovered – Stuxnet and Flame – were revealed to have covertly targeted Tehran, in an attempt to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. • This article was amended on 18 July to reflect the fact that it was the hacking group's servers that were located in Canada, not the members of the group themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/05/returning-rare-bumblebee-britain-complex-task","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-05T12:55:00Z","webTitle":"Returning rare bumblebee to Britain is a dauntingly complex mission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/05/returning-rare-bumblebee-britain-complex-task","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/05/returning-rare-bumblebee-britain-complex-task","fields":{"headline":"Returning rare bumblebee to Britain is a dauntingly complex mission","bodyText":"The technology – a Fiat Ducato camper van with a reliable fridge – is the easy bit. But the heroic mission to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee (Bombus subterraneus) to Britain is dauntingly complex. This week Nikki Gammans, a biologist and the driving force behind the bid to return this rare bee to Britain, led the release of 49 queens on the RSPB's reserve by the brooding Dungeness nuclear power station. It follows the release of 51 bees last summer and the statistics demonstrate just how challenging re-establishing a lost insect species can be. The headline figure – not one of those 51 short-haired bumblebees has been seen again in the wild since their release – is discouraging. But if anyone can succeed it is Gammans, supported by a coalition of supporters including local farmers, government agency Natural England, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust and Hymettus. Gammans studied under Prof Jeremy Thomas, architect of the most successful insect reintroduction project in the world – returning the extinct large blue butterfly (again using stock from Sweden) to the West Country. That mission took Thomas more than a decade – and the short-haired bumblebee project may need as much patience. It was 2009 when Gammans began working on the first ever programme to reintroduce a native bumblebee. For the third year running this spring she drove her van (purchased not with lavish conservation funding – that doesn't exist – but with a modest family inheritance) to southern Sweden. There, with the blessing of the Swedish authorities, she and her small team of volunteers caught 100 queen bees. Gammans and half-a-dozen volunteers had a tiny window in which to catch the queens before they began nesting, and had to release any bees carrying pollen – a sign they had already established nests. The bees were then placed in the Fiat's fridge to send them into a relaxed torpor on the long drive home. Once in Britain, they were placed in quarantine for two weeks. The previous summer, the bees were fed thanks to volunteers who collected pollen from other wild bees by catching them and gently brushing it off their bodies. To gather just 10g, volunteer Alan Kenworthy went out three times a week last summer and harvested pollen from more than 300 wild bees. (Bees are rather more efficient pollen collectors than man.) Last year, the Swedish queens began laying eggs in quarantine, perhaps because they were fed too well. So this year, Gammans fed them nectar and just one grain of pollen each day, before rapidly increasing their ration in the days before release so they would have the requisite energy for their release into the countryside. Despite more than half succumbing to parasites and other diseases (as they would in the wild) while quarantined, Gammans and her team reckoned that the 49 survivors looked much livelier than last year's. The bee I carefully released from its individual container onto yellow flag iris was certainly in fine fettle as it busily drank nectar and then cruised off, with that casual, heavy-looking flight of one of Britain's best loved insects. Some people may wonder what is the point of spending so much energy on reintroducing one rare species of bumblebee, that was last seen in Dungeness – an improbable bumblebee hotspot – in 1988. But, as Dave Goulson argues in his excellent new book, A Sting in the Tale, the project is already a massive success. Thanks to Gammans' work with local landowners, more than 850 hectares of Romney Marsh around Dungeness is now farmed sensitively, allowing for wild flower strips and traditional meadows, which will help the short-haired bumblebee re-establish itself. More importantly, this management benefits thousands of rare species – birds of prey, songbirds, rodents and butterflies. Some of the rarest of Britain's 25 bumblebee species are already thriving: the shrill carder and the ruderal bumblebee have returned to Dungeness after an absence of more than two decades. Gammans is \"not too worried\" about the lack of positive sighting of last year's queens – it's so difficult to monitor something as small and mobile as a bumblebee that she is convinced there will be survivors somewhere. \"Obviously last year wasn't the best year for the bees, it was cold and wet, but the queens that survived are going to be pretty tough and pretty feisty,\" she said. \"They are going to be able to cope with anything in the future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/nov/04/bilateral-investment-treaties","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-04T18:23:45Z","webTitle":"The legal monster that lets companies sue countries | Mahnaz Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/04/bilateral-investment-treaties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/04/bilateral-investment-treaties","fields":{"headline":"The legal monster that lets companies sue countries","bodyText":"The news that Germany's nuclear phase-out is being challenged by a Swedish company is not without irony. In doing so, the Swedish energy company Vattenfall is using the very mechanism designed by the German government to protect German investors from the actions of developing countries' governments. Germany and Pakistan concluded the world's first ever investment treaty in 1959 and renewed their vows on its 50th anniversary in 2009. The blueprint of the German bilateral investment treaty (BIT), which set the template for most European BITs, was cast by the notorious Hermann Abs, chairman of Deutsche Bank in Germany, and Lord Shawcross QC, attorney-general in the UK. This was in 1957, when the Society to Advance the Protection of Foreign Investments, an organisation of German business people, published a draft instrument entitled International Convention for the Mutual Protection of Private Property Rights in Foreign Countries. The goal of this initiative was to protect European investments abroad against interference by communist and nationalistic governments. Today the German investment treaty empire, consisting of over 135 countries, is the largest in the world. In addition to having BITs with countries such as Somalia, Papua New Guinea and Venezuela, Germany also has some 13 BITs with its poorer cousins in the EU, including Greece (signed in 1961, in force since 1963). BITs are typically concluded between a developed and a developing country with the intention that investments from the former will be protected by guarantees of protection and non-discrimination in the latter. BITs are an anomaly in public international law because they grant private investors the right to bring claims before an international arbitration tribunal. Thus, investors can rely on broad guarantees, such as full protection and security, and fair and equitable treatment before privately hired arbitral tribunals, rather than government appointed judges. These treaty rights are often more favourable to investors than those found in national law. The concern that foreign investors under UK's BITs may be entitled to higher compensation rights than those available to British shareholders of Northern Rock was put to Lord Davies, the then government deputy chief whip, at the time of the bank's collapse in 2008. Davies denied that such treaties applied to Britain, while also criticising the fairness of such arrangements in general. He appeared unpleasantly surprised that treaties created reciprocal rights which foreign investors from the less developed treaty partner could use against European governments. Davies also found it unbelievable that European standards of governance were somehow wanting under treaties meant to discipline developing country governments. For years, European and north American governments saw no need for treaties to protect investment flows between developed nations. Thus, the largest flows of foreign investment were unprotected by investment treaties, owing to the mutual confidence developed countries enjoyed in each others' systems of governance and courts. This dynamic was perhaps accidentally disturbed by the conclusion of chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which saw the creation of a tripartite investment treaty between Canada, Mexico and the US in 1994. The idea was to provide north American businesses with the investor-state arbitration mechanism to challenge Mexico, the developing country in the party. Although north American investors did sue Mexico under Nafta Chapter 11, the vast majority of Nafta claims involve US investors suing the Canadian government and vice versa. Having tasted blood, Canadian investors are likely to demand an investor-state mechanism in the EU-Canada negotiations. Although at least 81 governments have faced investment treaty arbitration in over 400 claims, western European countries have so far avoided such actions – as there are few investors from the developing world that have the means or occasion to challenge government measures in private arbitration proceedings. European BITs are almost always concluded with lesser developed countries. The conclusion of the energy charter treaty to promote and protect investments in the new democracies of eastern Europe and central Asia, like Nafta, also permits, perhaps inadvertently, western European investors such as the Swedes to bring claims against other European governments such as the German, French and British. The recent claim by Vattenfall warns of another crack in European cohesion as European investors start using investor-state arbitration in treaties governed by public international law, which will prevail over national and European Union law. Further, the rise of investments from \"developing countries\" such as China and India into Europe will provide the occasion to use the investor-state mechanism against the UK and Germany. European countries may find themselves paying out several million dollars per claim to feed the monster let loose by the late Abs Hermann and Lord Shawcross."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/02/us-can-talk-iran-joe-biden","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-02T13:17:53Z","webTitle":"US can talk to Iran, says Joe Biden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/02/us-can-talk-iran-joe-biden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/02/us-can-talk-iran-joe-biden","fields":{"headline":"US can talk to Iran, says Joe Biden","bodyText":"The United States is prepared to hold direct talks with Iran amid the standoff over its nuclear ambitions, the US vice-president, Joe Biden, has said. Speaking at the Munich security conference on Saturday, Biden said: \"There is still time, there is still space for diplomacy backed by pressure to succeed.\" He insisted that \"the ball is in the government of Iran's court\" to show that it is negotiating in good faith. Asked when Washington would hold direct talks with Tehran, Biden replied: \"When the Iranian leadership, the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei], is serious.\" Last month, Iran announced plans to dramatically increase its pace of uranium enrichment, which can be used to make both reactor fuel and the fissile core of warheads. Iran insists it does not want nuclear arms and argues it has a right to enrich uranium for a civilian nuclear power programme, but suspicions persist that the real aim is to develop nuclear weapons. The country's nuclear programme remained secret until it was exposed more than a decade ago. Iran also unveiled its latest combat jet on Saturday, a domestically manufactured fighter-bomber that military officials claim can evade radar. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a ceremony broadcast on state TV that building the Qaher-313, or Dominant-313, highlights Iran's will to \"conquer scientific peaks\". The Qaher is one of several aircraft designs produced by the Iranian military since 2007. The Islamic republic launched a self-sufficiency military programme in the 1980s to compensate for a western weapons embargo that banned the export of military technology and equipment to Iran. Since 1992, Iran has produced its own tanks, armoured personnel carriers, missiles, torpedoes, drones and fighter planes. Russia and the US have moved closer to agreeing a strategy over Iran's nuclear programme, butthe two countries remain dividied as to how to tackle the crisis in Syria. Biden told the conference: \"President Assad, a tyrant hellbent on clinging to power, is no longer fit to lead the Syrian people and he must go.\" The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, branded Biden's statement as counterproductive. \"The persistence of those who say that priority number one is the removal of President Assad, I think it's the single biggest reason for the continued tragedy in Syria.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/08/israel-call-tougher-sanctions-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-08T12:55:02Z","webTitle":"Israel poised to call for tougher sanctions against Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/08/israel-call-tougher-sanctions-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/08/israel-call-tougher-sanctions-iran","fields":{"headline":"Israel poised to call for tougher sanctions against Iran","bodyText":"Israel is expected to call for increased sanctions against Tehran in response to an imminent report by the UN's nuclear watchdog amid growing fears it could be preparing to attack Iran's nuclear installations. A statement demanding stiffer sanctions will be issued by the office of the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) publishes the report, Israel Radio reported. An Israeli government official confirmed that a statement would be made but declined to be drawn on details until \"we've had a chance to look at the report\". But, he added, the Israeli government \"hopes the report serves to galvanise international support for beefing up action\" against Iran. The IAEA is expected on Wednesday to publish new details of evidence of Iran's development of a nuclear military capability, and will identify a site where warhead components are suspected to have been tested. Israel has long pressed for a regime of stringent economic and diplomatic sanctions coupled with the threat of military action aimed at deterring Iran's nuclear ambitions. Its hardline foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, is reportedly a recent convert to the merits of a military attack. He called for \"crippling sanctions\" to follow the report. If the US failed to deliver, he was quoted as saying, \"this will mean that the US and the west have accepted a nuclear Iran\". Iran's central bank and its oil, fuel and gas industries should be targeted, he said. The defence minister, Ehud Barak, told Israel Radio: \"We are probably at the last opportunity for co-ordinated, international, lethal sanctions that will force Iran to stop.\" However, the Israeli government \"had not yet decided to embark on any operation\", he said, adding: \"We don't want a war.\" There has been intense speculation in Israel over the past week that it may be preparing for a military strike after reports that Netanyahu and Barak were working to secure a majority within the inner cabinet for action. The speculation was fuelled by the test-firing of a long-range ballistic missile, and by Israeli air force exercises at a Nato base in Sardinia. The former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said this week that she expected Israel to take military action in the event of Iran reaching nuclear capability. \"I don't have any doubt that the Israelis will defend themselves if the Iranians look as if they really are about to cross that nuclear threshold,\" she said in a television interview. However, Russia and France have both cautioned against military action. The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, said Israel was using \"dangerous rhetoric\" that could lead to \"a major war\". Alain Juppé, the French foreign minister, said his government opposed military action because \"it would seriously destabilise the region\". Israeli figures urging caution include Meir Dagan, who recently retired as head of the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. He warned earlier this year that military action against Iran was \"the stupidest idea I ever heard\". The open nature of the discourse about a sensitive security issues within the Israeli establishment has infuriated some politicians, with the deputy prime minister, Dan Meridor, describing it as \"insane\". \"A public debate about this is nothing less than a scandal,\" he said. Previous air strikes against nuclear facilities in Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007 were conducted without warning. Some analysts suggested that the speculation is part of a deliberate ratcheting up of pressure to encourage stiffer sanctions by the international community. Trita Parsi, the author of Treacherous Alliance – the Secret Dealings of Iran, Israel and the United States, wrote on CNN's website last week: \"These intense periods of Israeli warnings about its imminent intent to bomb Iran have indeed tended to coincide with times when the international community has been debating additional sanctions on Tehran. This latest call for war is no different.\" However, he warned: \"How much longer can this game of brinkmanship and sabre-rattling be pursued before it turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy?\" Emily Landau, an Iran expert at Israel's Institute of National Security Studies, said there was a difference between preparing for military action and actually taking military action, but it was \"a very fine line\". Israel was giving \"a clear deterrent message to Iran that there will be consequences for Iran's cheating, lying, deception and unacceptable behaviour,\" she said. The options were economic and diplomatic sanctions and military force: \"both these levers of pressure need to be used\" to create conditions for meaningful negotiations with Iran. The Guardian's disclosure last week that British armed forces were stepping up contingency planning for potential military action against Iran in the belief that the US may accelerate plans for strikes indicated that \"we might be in the midst of a co-ordinated move\", Landau said. Other analysts have pointed to regional instability as a reason for Israel to seek to reassert its military dominance and its need to place the issue of Iran's potential nuclear capability at the top of the international agenda. A public opinion poll published in Haaretz last week found Israelis split on support for a military strike against Iran. However, more than 80% feared such military action would increase the chances of war with Hamas in Gaza and with Hezbollah in Lebanon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/feb/13/floods-vital-role-state-lives-conservatives","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-13T20:59:00Z","webTitle":"Floods show vital role state has in all our lives | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/13/floods-vital-role-state-lives-conservatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/feb/13/floods-vital-role-state-lives-conservatives","fields":{"headline":"Floods show vital role state has in all our lives","bodyText":"The present flooding has sunk one of the major ideological concepts of the Conservatives (Report, 13 February): that the state is unnecessary and costs too much. Better to roll back \"the red tide of socialism\" as Thatcher proclaimed and allow private enterprise to take control (and the profits). Now people are up to their waists in floodwater as a result of cuts in environmental resources, firefighters, police, the army etc. Even the Tory mantra of \"leave it to the voluntary sector\" has collapsed. Exhausted by the storms, ordinary people have been crying out for help. Time to sweep away the dead dogma of Tory/Lib Dem politics and bring the basic necessities of life under state control. Peter Woodcock London • Well knock me down with a feather! The credit card is not maxed out after all (PM's high-stakes flood pledge, 12 February). After cruelly removing benefits from the poor, the sick and the disabled and destroying essential local services by starving them of resources, David Cameron has the gall to state that \"money is no object\" and that \"we are a wealthy country\". However, ministers are already rowing back and the probability is that \"unlimited funds for flood relief\" is another of Dave's smooth headline-grabbing fibs to dupe the electorate. Dr Robin Richmond Bromyard, Herefordshire • So, David Cameron has said \"money is no object in this relief effort\". Good, but I couldn't help noticing that this followed the flooding in the predominantly Tory-voting home counties. I wonder what the response would have been if all those in flooded areas were benefit claimants? No doubt we'd be told that the best way of helping them was to reduce the support available, thus encouraging them to help themselves. Alan Healey Milson, Shropshire • Tony Jones (Letters, 11 February) writes that the areas affected by recent flooding voted Tory or Lib Dem at the last election, and so \"actively voted for cuts in public spending\". No they didn't. What Nick Clegg would dearly like people to forget is that the Lib Dems fought the 2010 election on a position of opposing austerity and reckless spending cuts. Those of us who voted for them haven't forgotten, and that's why his party is 10% in the latest ICM poll and has lost more than half its support since the last election. Alasdair Murray Richmond Upon Thames, Surrey • Here in Staines we had the requisite visit from the PM, but we have yet to receive any help – not even a single sandbag from the council. I guess Staines isn't as important as Windsor and Datchet – can't think why. It is ironic that Cameron talks about money being no object in helping us, when only this month the Tories in Surrey county council voted to halve our fire and rescue services here in the borough of Spelthorne. So we have a situation where existing services are stretched beyond coping point, knowing that once the cuts have gone through, our safety can't possibly be guaranteed. Where does that fit with Cameron's pledge? Sian Manaz Staines, Middlesex • The current disastrous flooding in the south is the result of centuries of complacency and neglect. I grew up in the Netherlands, in a polder (area with managed water levels) now two metres below sea level, which dates from about 1440. Formal organisation of regional water management boards started around 1200. These levy their own tax, which means that funding for water defences never has to compete with other urgent items in the local budget. The cost of the cleanup after this latest bout of flooding will almost certainly be far more than the expense of well-planned defences would have been in the first place. Anna Alberda Ellis Huddersfield • At last, Lord Stern's prophetic predictions (Letters, 11 February) are being addressed. We need a prime minister who is prepared to fight on both a national and international level to cut our carbon emissions which are warming the oceans. My reaction is to redouble my efforts to cut my own emissions by doubling insulation, getting on my bike more and continuing my no-flying pledge that I started seven years ago when I first learned of the predicted human misery as a result of catastrophic flooding. Elaine Steane LCON (Low Carbon Oxford North Group) • Damian Carrington correctly identifies Owen Paterson's scepticism on climate change as part of the problem (Comment, 10 February). However, it is merely the tip of the particular iceberg of scientific illiteracy, which is widespread in society, but endemic in the government. By knowing little or nothing about basic physics, chemistry or biology, ministers are wide open to lobbying by big oil/pharma/energy/tobacco/food etc. Thus nuclear power, fracking and, most damaging of all, climate change denial, go virtually unchallenged. This leads to the dismal and panicked Elastoplast-style emergency responses we have seen over the past weeks, but no sign of a long-term, informed and understood strategic plan that has the reality of climate change embedded at its core. This is why Labour needs to build in what might be termed \"renewable thinking\" into all its policies. Cameron's \"green crap\" mindset will guarantee a degraded, depleted and devastated environment which our children will not thank us for. Max Fishel London • Cameron is just trying to appeal to the floating voter. Andrew Turton London • Further to your article \"Not saving but drowning\", we are farmers near Milton Keynes. All farmers pay \"drainage rates\" allowing the rain to run off from the fields into the drainage system, hence into the main waterways. In our area there are two drainage boards, the river Ousel and the river Ivel boards, one covering part of Buckinghamshire, the other part of Bedfordshire. The purpose of these boards, was to keep the smaller ditches and the larger main drainage and rivers dredged, on average every 15 to 25 years according to the level of silt or debris. They still collect the rates and are now awash with unspent money. Each board had four dredging machines and hedge-cutting equipment, together with the necessary manpower. Unfortunately, eight years ago it was decided to scrap six dredgers and hedge cutting equipment, only cleaning out very few waterways. Therefore, very limited work is now carried out, as Milton Keynes is still growing, so the amount of rainwater running into the waterways has increased considerably. Fortunately, we do not flood, but downstream from Newport Pagnell to Bedford it can and does. The decision to forgo 80% of the clearing of waterways has been going on throughout the UK. The Environment Agency's more recent decision to stop most main drainage has meant all water courses, from small ditches to large rivers have been silting up. This has not helped in the inevitable flooding, caused by the very heavy rain, but exasperated by the silting up of waterways. Paul and Mary Colburn Hulcote, Bedfordshire • Helen Keating (Letters, 13 February) may be amazed that nobody has imported the Venetian door barrier to Britain to prevent homes being flooded but she is wrong to assume that people have been complacent. There are countless devices available in the UK and thousands have been fitted. The reason that so many people are using sandbags is that they never dreamed they were in danger. No doubt they will be sold such devices in the future by an army of salesmen taking advantage of government grants, but beware of the quick fix. It takes a lot more than a door barrier to stop water seeping through masonry and coming up through the floor and the loo and unfortunately it takes a flood to search out the weak points. The Venetians have had centuries to fine tune their systems. Roger Bisby Reigate, Surrey • With all the flooding, I inquire as to where all those new homes that Labour claims it will build, if elected, are going to be placed? Many developers will not touch any land that is likely to flood knowing full well that the re-sales will prove difficult. Lenders are now much more cautious. Insurance will be harder to find. I predict a massive slowing down in the property market again and prices will drop – apart from existing homes on high ground well away from rivers and cliff tops. In the meantime, I can see more estate agencies closing down, as the property market will be badly hit where they have offices in areas near to, or including flooded areas. I also wonder how many Conservative-led government loan guarantee mortgages up to £600,000 were granted on properties now flooded. Richard Grant Retired estate agent, Burley, Hampshire • In response to a growing campaign started by the Daily Mail to slash aid to poorer countries to pay for flood damage in the UK (Daily Mail and Ukip lambasted for 'disgraceful' attack on overseas aid, 14 February), it is time to call on the UK and other governments to redirect the massive amount of money they spend on fossil fuel subsidies towards climate adaptation in the UK and elsewhere, including better flood defences and emergency relief measures. The bill for international aid will only increase as richer countries have to support the victims of climate change in poorer countries, so we need to address the causes of the problem rather than further punish those that have contributed to it least, but are suffering its worst effects. If you agree please sign the 38degrees.org.uk petition on this. Professor Peter Newell Sussex University • Due to the serious flooding and repeated storms in the UK, is it not time to consider re-establishing a civil defence network, to help during these natural disasters? Trained volunteers, properly equipped, could provide much-needed support to the professional firefighters, police and ambulance crews during emergencies. Gerard Hanney-Labastille Luxembourg • In light of the serious flooding now affecting the lower Thames area in the vicinity of Heathrow, there can surely now be no question of proceeding with runway expansion there. In truth it should never really have been considered. It has been well established – at least since the floods of 2003 – that the \"concretisation\" of large parts of west London, and indeed the suburbs, has contributed greatly to what was already a chronic flood risk. We now have proof positive of just how bad the situation is. Construction work at the airport would merely exacerbate the flooding problem. While there may indeed by an argument for increasing airport capacity in the south of England surely it cannot be here. Andrew McLuskey Staines upon Thames • The Met chief scientist says climate change almost certainly lies behind this winter's torrential rains and violent storms\" and your editorial (10 February) notes that \"more investment in fossil fuel energy seems to promise ever-greater problems\". So, leave the carbon underground, seal off the oil and gas wells, stop fracking. Invest in renewable technologies, more wind power, more solar panels on roofs, develop self-support communities and explain – explain to all – how vital action today is. And wear warmer clothes in winter! Britain led the industrial revolution, now we should lead Europe and then the rest of the world in the ecological revolution of survival for a sustainable life. Yes, it will be hard. But a government that believes that fossil fuel-propelled growth is the answer to present economic problems, that ignores the scientific evidence for manmade global warming (with some ministers even daft enough to deny it), that fails to invest enough in our future, is in gross dereliction of its people and increasingly so to the next generation? Time to dismiss them.

They will do so under the auspices of the UN framework convention on climate change. This is an international treaty negotiated at the Earth summit in Rio in 1992 with the objective to “stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system”. The discussions in Paris in 2015 will be informed by the latest climate science. In our play 2071, which recently completed its inaugural run at the Royal Court theatre in London, directed by Katie Mitchell, we explore the science, its implications and the options before us. A key aim is to leave the audience better placed to participate in the public discourse, in which we all need to play a part. Climate change is a controversial subject that can raise strong emotions. We are all susceptible to being less open-minded and rational about it than we may appreciate. The climate system is very complex, yet its discussion is often oversimplified. There are gaps in our knowledge, and many scientific uncertainties, some of which are fundamentally unknowable. This makes it extremely difficult to predict precisely what the future holds and to determine exactly what actions, if any, to take. In addition there are economic considerations, political implications and ethical questions that further complicate the way forward. In 2071 we describe how satellites allow us to probe and map our planet’s key components – atmosphere, oceans, ice, and land – in unprecedented ways. By using computer models to bring together the space data with a myriad measurements made in situ, and by combining these with our understanding of underlying physical laws, it is possible to begin to make sense of what is observed. This provides a grand perspective of the Earth’s system as a whole, of its component parts and the interconnections between them. The system behaves in complex and often counterintuitive ways. But the fundamental principles of it are quite simple: its component parts interact with each other such that, over time, the amount of energy leaving the planet is equal to the amount entering it from the Sun. The interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, and the ice on land and sea drive the natural variability of the climate. The system is very responsive. Even a small change in one component can trigger a chain of consequences in the other parts. When such changes alter the energy balance, the effects are felt throughout the entire system, while it adjusts to reach a new balance. Changing oceans Since the majority of inbound solar energy is absorbed by the oceans, which cover 70% of the planet’s surface and are dark, any imbalance should be most readily observable there. Sea levels rise as water temperature increases, acting as a global thermometer. By combining data gleaned from beach structures and archaeological data, we know that during the latter part of the Holocene, the unusually stable climatic period the planet has undergone since the end of the last Ice Age, sea-level changes did not exceed 0.2mm per year. Information from tide gauges, and more recently, satellite radars, show that in the late 19th century, sea levels began to rise. Over the 20th century the rate of rise averaged 1.8mm per year. Over the last two decades, the rate has further increased to 3.3mm per year. This may not seem much, but it is geologically significant. The current rate is approaching the 10mm per year which occurred during the transition from the last Ice Age to the current warm interglacial, a major climatic shift. And it is occurring during the warm interglacial, at a time unrelated to the natural ice age cycle. In 1978 John Mercer, a US glaciologist, described how, in a warming world, a successive collapse of ice shelves extending down the Antarctic Peninsula might occur. He suggested that this would be a warning sign of a more significant sequence of events to come. The Antarctic Peninsula connects to an area of the Antarctic called West Antarctica, where the massive ice sheet sits on bedrock that is up to 2km below sea level. Mercer’s concern was that if the successive collapse reached this far, the pressure of the warmer water at depth would lift the ice sheet, causing water to penetrate deeper and deeper below the ice, reducing friction between the ice and rock, leading to an unstoppable collapse. This would result in a rise in sea levels over time of many metres, as the total volume of ice in West Antarctica is equivalent to a six-metre rise. Since the 1990s, a successive series of ice shelf collapses has occurred along the peninsula, and parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet are now accelerating into the ocean. And in the northern hemisphere, the satellite and surface data show that the loss of ice from the Greenland ice sheet increased by 600% over a decade following the 1990s. It is estimated that, at present, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers contributes to about half of the observed sea level rise. Apart from a small contribution from human use of aquifers, the rest of the sea level rise is due to thermal expansion – the oceans are warming. The greenhouse effect The atmospheric trace gases – water vapour, methane and carbon dioxide – provide an explanation of the planetary energy imbalance. These gases are present in relatively small quantities in our atmosphere, but they have a significant impact on the temperature of the planet since they obstruct the loss of heat from the surface as it passes upwards. This effect, known as the greenhouse effect, causes the Earth’s surface to have an average temperature of 15C. Without it, the surface would be 15C below freezing. Ice cores drilled from ice sheets and glaciers in the Antarctic and Greenland provide a means of measuring past changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Each year the snowfall creates a layer that compacts to ice and traps bubbles of the contemporary air. The deepest ice cores extracted from the Antarctic are more than 3km long and contain a record stretching back 800,000 years. By melting the ice and measuring the ratios of different atomic isotopes in the water, a history of global temperature can be derived. The relationship between the trace gases and temperature can then be studied. During each recent cold phase, when on average global temperatures have decreased by 5C, and vast ice sheets have built up over northern high latitudes, the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere dipped to about 180 parts per million. In the warm phases it peaked at around 300 ppm. This year, the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere passed 400 ppm. The rise over the last century is already 100 ppm – the same as the natural change between an ice age and an interglacial warm period, but at a rate more than 100 times faster. And it is in the “warm” direction of increased concentration not experienced by the planet at any point over the last 800,000 years based on the ice core data, and probably not over the two million years judging by the geological record. This has occurred because the global carbon cycle has been disrupted. The cycle consists of large annual exchanges between the carbon reservoirs of the atmosphere, the land biosphere, the lithosphere (the rocky surface layer of the planet) and the ocean. The exchanges are much greater in magnitude than our own carbon emissions – but, prior to industrialisation, they were in balance. However, in 1712, the invention of the Newcomen steam engine started a chain reaction of innovation, technology and science that spread across the globe. This revolution built the modern world. It was fuelled using cheap, accessible and convenient fossil energy. This has led us to the point where we are currently burning 10,000 million tonnes of carbon per year – a figure that is increasing at a rate of 2% per year. To date, we have burned an estimated 530,000 million tonnes of carbon. A quarter of the resulting CO2 has been absorbed by vegetation on land, which has bloomed as a result, and just over a quarter by the ocean, which has become more acidic. The remainder will stay in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years because it takes that long for natural processes – mainly rock weathering – to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Consequently, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen by 40%. The energy imbalance revealed by the ocean, confirmed by rising temperatures and loss of ice, and explained by the disrupted carbon cycle, is evidently being driven by us. It is the unwitting result of our use of fossil fuels. The evidence seems compelling. But since the implications are sufficiently profound, a deeper evaluation is merited. This is the task given to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It was set up in 1988 by the UN environment programme and the World Meteorological Organisation. Its job is to provide a comprehensive summary of the scientific data to inform the policy decisions of the UN framework convention on climate change. IPCC working group I reviews and assesses the physical science information relevant to human-induced climate change. Its most recent report – the fifth – was released in September 2013. It is arguably the most audited scientific document in history. The work was led by 209 scientists, who are regarded as the world experts in their fields. They were supported by more than 600 contributing authors from 32 countries and 50 review editors from 39 countries. Of the tens of thousands of publications sifted more than 9,200 were cited. The authors responded to 54,677 comments from 1,089 reviewers worldwide. So what do they conclude? The conclusions of the IPCC Concerning the atmosphere, each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. In the northern hemisphere the 30 years from 1983 to 2012 were likely to have been the warmest in the last 1,400 years. The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature measurements show a warming of 0.8C from 1850 to 2012. They note that despite the warming at and near the surface, the upper atmosphere has cooled, ruling out the Sun as the cause. They report that the rates of loss of ice from the world’s glaciers and from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have all increased dramatically. While glacier losses have increased globally by about 20%, the ice sheet losses increased by as much as 600% between the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. Summer minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic decreased over the last 30 years between 9% and 14% per decade. There is evidence that this level of ice retreat is unprecedented in the last 1,450 years. By contrast, winter sea ice extent in the Antarctic has increased slightly, at a rate of about 1.5% per decade. This appears to be driven by changes in the Southern Ocean winds, which have intensified in response to the planetary energy imbalance. They report that ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010. They confirm that the ocean has absorbed about 30% of the cumulative anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, causing it to become progressively more acidic. More recently, the IPCC released its overall synthesis report. This states: “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, [and] sea level has risen.” It observes that: “In recent decades, changes in the climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to the changing climate.” On the causes of climate change, the IPCC says: “It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 [to] 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.” It continues: “The best estimate of human-induced contributions to warming is similar to the actual warming observed.” In other words, there is evidence that all the warming that has occurred since 1950 is due to human actions. It concludes: “Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, which together with adaptation can limit climate change risks.” John Kerry, the US secretary of state, summarised the working group I findings as follows: “Boil down the IPCC report and here’s what you find: climate change is real, it’s happening now, human beings are the cause of the transformation, and only action by human beings can save the world from its worst impacts.” The cut-off date for published material considered by IPCC working group I was July 2013. But there have been some important results since. Evidence from the Argo floats, a system of 3,500 buoys deployed throughout the world’s oceans, shows that despite an 18-year pause in the rate of surface and atmospheric temperature rise, energy has continued to accumulate in the oceans unabated, with the prospect that some of it will be released to the atmosphere in the future. New data from the CryoSat satellite show the recent rate of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has doubled in three years. Some experts have concluded that the loss of ice from the West Antarctic ice sheet is now irreversible and that this will raise sea level by 1 to 2 metres in as little as a few hundred years. Based on a combination of scientific analysis, assessments of the impacts and related value judgments, the nations negotiating under the terms of the UN framework convention have set a limit beyond which climate change will be “dangerous”. That limit is 2C above the pre-industrial average. We are currently at 0.8C. Two-thirds of that increase has occurred since 1980. In order to stay below the 2C “guardrail”, human carbon emissions have to drop to 50% of the present level by 2050 and thereafter drop to zero. This would mean leaving 75% of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. They would become economically worthless. The temperature at which the system will stabilise is determined by the total quantity of carbon we emit to the atmosphere, not the rate at which it’s emitted. So reducing carbon emissions to zero will not lower temperature; it will just prevent the temperature rising beyond the 2C level. Temperature will then remain at that level for a very long time because CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. This sets a limit on the total carbon that we can burn. The IPCC calculates this to be about 800 gigatons of carbon. They estimate that we have already burned 530 gigatons. This leaves 270 gigatons for us to use. At our current rate, which is 10 gigatons of carbon a year, we have 27 years left, after which time carbon emissions would need to cease. Suppose we begin reducing our emissions next year and don’t exceed the overall 800 gigaton limit; then CO2 concentration will stabilise at 450 parts per million. Temperature will take longer to stabilise because it responds to CO2 concentration – but it will eventually stabilise at 2C. The oceans will continue to warm and the ice will continue to melt – so the sea level will continue to rise. It will take hundreds of years but will eventually stabilise at a level, based on evidence from past warmings, about 2 to 3 metres higher than today. If we leave it longer to start reducing emissions, we will have to reduce them more rapidly to avoid exceeding the overall 800 gigaton limit. Calculations show that if we leave it until 2020 – only five years away – the subsequent reductions would be of the order of 6% per year to stay within the 2C limit. 6% may not sound much, but annual reductions of carbon emissions greater than 1% have happened only during economic recession or upheaval. The UK conversion from coal to gas and the French conversion to nuclear in the 1970s and 80s achieved reductions of 1% per year. A temporary 5% reduction was achieved in the Soviet Union when it collapsed. Japan recently achieved a 15% reduction when its nuclear power stations were shut down, and demand fell as a result of a national appeal, after the Fukushima disaster. The 6% annual rate of reduction required is global. We in the developed world have to reduce emissions even more rapidly to accommodate growth in the developing world. To achieve the necessary reduction will require a collaborative effort on a global scale. Time is running out The aim of next December’s meeting in Paris is to forge a deal to put the world onto a path to a 2C maximum rise. The new agreement aims to obtain credible and fair emission reductions and legally binding commitments from all countries – with the most advanced economies making the most ambitious commitments. In the lead-up to Paris 2015, Barack Obama and Chinese president Xi Jinping have announced joint measures to fight climate change. The US aims to reduce its carbon emissions to 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 – nearly doubling its previous commitments. Despite not having signed up to Kyoto or Copenhagen, the US is already on track to cut its emissions by 17% between 2005 and 2020. China, partly driven by serious air pollution problems, has committed to cutting the proportion of energy it generates from coal and has set up pilot carbon markets and low carbon zones. It has set a date of 2030 for “peak” emissions and has pledged to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to around 20% by 2030, from less than 10% today. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has committed to expand solar energy to provide electricity to 300 million people who have no access to power at present. The EU has agreed a package to achieve a 40% reduction in domestic emissions. It aims to boost the use of renewable energy to 27% and to increase energy efficiency by at least 27%. The UK Climate Change Act, passed in 2008 with cross-party support, is the world’s first long-term, legally binding, national framework for reducing emissions – setting five-year carbon budgets to cut UK emissions by 80% by 2050. Around the world, in recent years, almost 500 climate-related laws have been passed in 66 of the world’s largest emitting countries. In 2005 the mayors of the worlds 40 largest “megacities” – including London – met and formed the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. They have taken 4,734 actions to tackle climate change, over three-quarters of which have been implemented. Many individuals have taken measures to reduce their own climate-related impacts by making changes in their personal, professional and public lives – installing solar panels, increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, vehicles and appliances, using public transport and avoiding unnecessary travel, changing diet and by choosing to forgo activities that generate emissions. They have encouraged changes to be made in their workplaces and written to their MPs. They have sought to educate themselves about the issue and to talk about it to their friends, families and communities. Around the world, renewable power capacity grew at its strongest ever pace in 2013 and now produces 22% of world energy. More than $250bn was invested in “green” generating systems in 2013, although the growth is expected to slacken, partly because western politicians are seeking to reduce financial incentives. The growth rate of windfarms and solar plants in China, India and an array of smaller developing nations is starting to outpace that in the richest ones. This explains why investors are increasingly confident and keen to put their money on alternative energy. But despite all these measures, global carbon emissions continue to rise. To achieve the necessary reduction in carbon emissions will require the invention and mass roll-out of new technologies that do not exist yet. However, my experiences as director of the Science Museum from 2007-10, exploring the legacy of technical innovation on public display and held in its reserve collection, and of working with engineers on space projects during the exhilarating era of the 70s and 80s, convinces me that human ingenuity is unbounded and that technological advances can be very rapid. My hope lies with the engineers. But the right conditions need to be in place for innovation to occur. Progress is hard when other economic drivers inhibit the transformation. Fossil fuels are estimated by the International Energy Agency to receive subsidies of $500bn per year, six times the incentives to develop renewables. Suppose we fail to take the action needed to stay below the 2C guardrail. The IPCC working group I predicts that by the end of the century, if measures to mitigate emissions are weak, we could have committed to more than a 4C rise. No nation would be immune to the impacts of that level of climate change. Our infrastructure was built for the climate system we inherited and is not designed to cope with the climate system we are provoking. Our food and water supplies, housing, industry – our entire wellbeing and prosperity – depend on access to energy. And our primary source, at present, is fossil fuel. So we are confronted with a need to totally transform the world’s energy system. At the same time we need to ensure energy security, equity, sustainability and growth. So what does the future hold? I look at my eldest grandchild who will reach the age I am now in 2071. I encourage her to be an engineer. We are all dependent on energy. Almost everything we do depends on it. There will be carbon atoms that we each generate today that will still be in the air in 2071, in the air that my granddaughter will breathe. Science can inform, but it cannot arbitrate, it cannot decide. Science can say that if we burn another half-trillion tons of carbon the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide will go up by another 100 ppm and that will almost certainly lead to a warming of the planet greater than 2C, with major disruption of the climate system and huge risks for the natural world and human wellbeing. But it can’t answer moral questions. Do we care about the poor? Do we care about future generations? Do we see the environment as part of the economy, or the economy as part of the environment? The whole point about climate change is that, despite having been revealed by science, it is not really about science. It is about what sort of world we want to live in and what kind of future we want to create.

For instance, almost every drug that has had to be withdrawn because of serious side-effects had mountains of scientific evidence supporting its use before doctors were allowed to prescribe it. Tiles fall off spacecraft, aircraft batteries overheat and burst into flames, pesticides affect the eggs of seabirds, nuclear power stations explode for one reason or another and tyres burst on racing cars, none of which would have happened if there had been good evidence of such dangers at the time decisions were made to introduce them. What we really need is proper pilot projects before any technology is introduced widely and careful monitoring afterwards to pick up any unintended consequences. This would require a revolution in public policy because both of them are deeply unpopular with politicians.

Our forebears, on the whole, didn't live long enough to test marriage to destruction after the kids were raised. Life is different as we live longer and reaching out to others is a necessary adjustment. Having spent my weekend working with two would-be co-housing groups in London for people who are over 50, single, divorced and widowed, and who are working hard to form new collaborative relationships, I wonder why alternatives are not more widely recognised.

The Society Network Foundation was one of a number of organisations that approached the fund after a call for ideas was made in September 2012 to support the legacy of the Olympics. Four organisations with developed ideas were invited to submit applications, which were fully, independently and rigorously assessed. All four have now been funded subject to stringent conditions and monitoring. The Big Lottery Fund has since made a further £8m available for organisations to apply for to help keep the spirit of 2012 alive for communities across the UK.

How absurd Jeremy Hunt has decided to go after \"health tourists\" to save £33m of taxpayers' money (\"Hunt tells GPs to crack down on the use of NHS by 'health tourists'\", News). I have been in medicine for more than 40 years, both in hospitals and as a GP. I have seen many rare and exotic diseases, but I have never seen a \"health tourist\". Neither my former practice nor, as far as I know, any of the adjoining practices ever encountered a member of this exotic species. To be fair to Mr Hunt, the previous government also banged on about \"health tourists\" stealing our money. However, the actions now being proposed have been in place for at least 10 years. Already, all GP practices have to ensure that anyone seeking to register for permanent or temporary care provides documentary evidence of their eligibility. It does seem rather daft that a government that has spent more than £2bn rendering the NHS less efficient, more bureaucratic and less fair is making such a fuss about a species that may not exist, and even if it does, costs only £30m.

Four days after Ed Miliband launched his bold new energy policy, it remains hard to say that Labour has a fully formed plan. The leader of the opposition deserves applause for igniting a debate. The proposal to freeze prices for 20 months has pushed energy to the top of the political agenda, exactly where it should be, and sown confusion in government ranks. Bullseye. But the other challenge was to explain how the lights will stay on, how investment in low-carbon infrastructure will be financed and how bills can be made permanently affordable. On that score, Miliband's vision was just a sketch. Labour's hope is that the big six companies, given a jolt and a fiercer regulator, can be made to fight like ferrets. There probably are gains to be made this way. Obfuscation has been the big six's best friend. Their price tariffs make the head spin and their allocation of overheads between their supply and generation arms invites suspicion. But let's not pretend that a blast of stiffer competition, and the introduction of a transparent price pool, is a cure-all. The queue of new entrants wishing to risk their reputations and capital in the energy supply market may turn out to be short. Supermarkets, touted as a truer consumer champions, may have enough on their plates dealing with the online revolution in their backyard. Greater competition may force prices downwards only marginally. In the meantime, the bill for greener power generation and transmission will continue to push in the opposite direction. The firm rule under successive governments has been that the customer must pay to meet EU targets on greenhouse gases. Labour is not challenging that orthodoxy. So, once the price freeze ends in 2017, how will bills be kept permanently lower if wholesale prices do not fall? Labour's answer is that it will \"reset\" the market and provide \"policy certainty\" that will encourage £110bn of investment. But its mechanism is the same as the current set-up – an array of subsidies and contracts for difference enshrined in the energy bill to encourage the building of offshore windfarms and new nuclear power stations. These subsidies cost money, and the bill ultimately lands on consumers. It is simply unrealistic to hope that private companies can be cajoled into making investments where they cannot see a profit. Yes, the directors of Centrica et al should be given a prod. They could compete harder, cut costs, and even pay themselves less. But in the end, a government wishing to address energy bills has a limited number of big options. It can delay the decarbonisation targets (tricky given the assessment on climate change from the United Nations). It can persuade the voters the bill is worth paying. Or it can shift the burden towards general taxation, thereby obliging the better-off to pay. What has Labour chosen? It's impossible to tell. Nothing to do with me guvnor Dear Mr Carney, it's now your fault if the UK suffers a damaging house price bubble. George Osborne, one assumes, didn't put it like that as he handed the Bank of England powers to curb the efficacy of his flagship Help to Buy scheme. But the whiff of panic in the Treasury is unmistakable. The realisation has dawned that stoking up house price inflation is playing with fire. Indeed. It is obvious to anybody in London and the south east that house prices do not need tickling up to encourage builders to build. Prices in the capital are rising 10% annually, and the pace is accelerating, according to the Nationwide. Dishing out state-subsidised mortgages on houses worth up to £600,000 in these circumstances is plainly dangerous. But the chancellor's supposed new safeguard – monitoring by the Bank's financial policy committee (FPC) – is nothing of the sort. The FPC will not be allowed to review Help to Buy until next September, which might be too late. In theory, of course, the FPC can intervene in the housing market whenever it wishes. It can increase lenders' capital requirements against high loan-to-value mortgages, for example. In reality, though, any interference would be difficult – the Bank would be seen to be trying to cool high-risk mortgage lending just as the Treasury is piling in with guarantees to lenders. The best way to avoid that mess was surely to give the FPC the power to cancel the second stage of Help to Buy at any time. Embarrassing, but the right thing to do. Quantitative easing and interest rates are reviewed every month. What's the difference? Race to the post Get your skates on if you want to buy some Royal Mail shares – the government, anxious to get in ahead of likely strike action, is privatising at speed. A fortnight today the deed will be done. To emphasise the fact to Royal Mail workers, who will be given 10% of the shares, the prospectus says management does not \"currently\" expect a strike to affect the dividend policy. The not-so-subtle implication: push this too far and your £2,000-worth of freebie shares will fall in value. That's the new world at the Royal Mail. Will the free shares for staff improve industrial relations over time? It's anybody's guess. The same might be said about whether the shares are a buy. There's an eye-catching dividend yield (if those \"current\" intentions are honoured) even at the top of the price range of 260p-330p. It works out at a utility-like 6.1%. At the bottom end, the yield is 7.7%, which definitely looks attractive. Unfortunately for Joe Public there is no way to express a wish to buy, say, up to 290p but not above. Retail investors get the price established by orders from City investors, who enjoy the privilege of setting limits on what they are willing to pay via a \"book-build\" process. This is clearly necessary to protect the public purse. But it's tough on retail punters who can't know in advance the price they'll be expected to pay. It can't be that hard to build a program that allows retail investors to participate in a book-build. Goldman Sachs and UBS are joint global co-ordinator and joint bookrunners; eBay would have been a better pick. Probably cheaper too. Nokia chief Mircosoft exit Is it Stephen Elop, outgoing chief of Nokia, getting a payoff from the Finnish firm or a golden hello from his next employer, Microsoft, which also happens to be a former employer? Either way, the upshot of this tangled tale is that Elop gets €18.8m (£16m), which is a hell of a sum given the collapse in Nokia's share price on his watch. \"Quite outrageous,\" says the Finland's premier. You bet. Elop is departing with Nokia's mobile phone business and won't miss a beat as he takes up a senior post at Microsoft. The curious sub-plot here is that Elop, it is reported in Finland, was asked to return some of the money but replied that he couldn't because he was divorcing his wife. Surely there was a simple solution: give Mrs Elop her share of the winnings and invite Mr Elop to forego the rest.

In an interview with the Observer, Huhne insisted that he would not \"rush to judgment\" until the implications of the disaster were known and a report into the safety of UK nuclear plants by the chief nuclear officer, Dr Mike Weightman, was complete. The interim findings are due in May. \"I am not ruling out nuclear now,\" said Huhne. But he said events in Japan could have profound long-term implications for UK policy, which is based on a three-pronged \"portfolio\" approach: a commitment to nuclear energy; the development of more renewable energy, such as wind and sea power; and new carbon-capture technology to mitigate the damaging environmental effects of fossil fuel-fired power plants and industrial facilities. Huhne, a Liberal Democrat, said that Britain was in a very different position from Japan, which was vulnerable to strong earthquakes and tsunamis. The UK also used different types of reactors. But he conceded that the Japanese disaster was likely to make it more difficult for private investors to raise capital to build the eight new reactors planned by the government. \"There are a lot of issues outside of the realm of nuclear safety, which we will have to assess. One is what the economics of nuclear power post-Fukushima will be, if there is an increase in the cost in capital to nuclear operators.\" He said that after the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster in the US 32 years ago, it became more difficult to raise money for nuclear investment. \"After Three Mile Island in 1979, nuclear operators found it very hard to finance new projects. Huhne said he remained wedded to the \"portfolio\" approach, but added that nuclear energy's future, as part of the mix, had become more uncertain as leaders of other nations, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, openly questioned its future. \"Globally, this undoubtedly casts a shadow over the renaissance of the nuclear industry. That is blindingly obvious,\" he said. Any move away from nuclear – while certain to be welcomed by many Lib Dems – would alarm many in the Tory party. Tim Yeo, the Conservative chair of the environment and climate change select committee, said any such shift would be a huge mistake. \"If Britain abandons or significantly delays its programme of building new nuclear power stations, there are three inevitable consequences. First, electricity prices will rise. Second, Britain will not be able to meet its carbon emission reduction targets. And third, the risk that the lights will go out will significantly increase. \"This is because other forms of low-carbon energy, such as solar or offshore wind, are more expensive than nuclear. Solar and wind are not reliable generators of electricity – on cloudy, still days they produce nothing. So they have to be backed up by reliable sources of power. If nuclear is not used, that means more gas or coal, both of which have far higher carbon emissions.\" The Department of Energy and Climate Change has carried out its own projections, which show the UK could – with a massive extra commitment to renewable energy and successful use of carbon capture on a grand scale – meet its target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 without nuclear energy. Huhne said: \"We can do the 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 without new nuclear, but it will require a big effort on carbon capture and storage and renewables.\" However, Yeo said: \"Nuclear currently provides almost one-fifth of our electricity. Nearly all our existing nuclear power stations will shut by 2020. Demand for electricity will rise steadily from now on as cars, vans, etc start to use electricity and the heating of buildings relies more on electricity. It is very likely that without new nuclear power stations we will simply not build enough other forms of reliable electricity generation in time to replace the contribution nuclear currently makes.\" Huhne has asked Weightman to draw up a report into the safety of UK nuclear plants, assessing their resistance to the kind of natural disasters that could hit this country, including flooding and storms. But ministers acknowledge that, even if plants are declared safe, the public perception of nuclear power has been undermined. The cost of meeting new safety conditions and insuring plants, as well as satisfying evacuation requirements in the event of a disaster, could make new reactors economically unviable. Huhne said ministers needed to show flexibility as untried and untested technology succeeded or failed along the way. \"The whole point about a portfolio is that over time – a 20-year view – some of those sources [of energy] will turn out to be much more economic and attractive than others,\" he said. After the anti-nuclear Lib Dems went into coalition with the Tories last May, Huhne forged a deal under which plans for a new generation of nuclear would go ahead, but without public subsidy. He said at the time that the Lib Dems' preference for meeting the country's energy needs was still to make greater use of renewable energy, such as wind and sea power. The deal marked a departure for Huhne from his stance in opposition. In 2007 he said: \"Nuclear is a tried, tested and failed technology and the government must stop putting time, effort and subsidies into this outdated industry.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/apr/22/uk-sell-urenco-stake","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-22T13:23:35Z","webTitle":"Royal Mail sell-off in the post as £3bn deal mooted for Urenco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/22/uk-sell-urenco-stake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/apr/22/uk-sell-urenco-stake","fields":{"headline":"Royal Mail sell-off in the post as £3bn deal mooted for Urenco","bodyText":"Trade unions have vowed to combat the looming privatisation of Royal Mail as the government kickstarted a series of multibillion-pound sell-offs by announcing plans to sell the state's £3bn stake in the uranium enrichment company Urenco. The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, which represents 53 trade unions and nearly 6 million union members across the UK, said the government could not fool people into believing that a Royal Mail sell-off is in the public interest. \"The British public are overwhelmingly against privatisation,\" Frances O'Grady told the annual conference of the Communication Workers Union. \"Royal Mail has already modernised and the service is now more stable than at any point in a decade, but they want to wreck it. Let us say to the government, our Royal Mail is not for sale.\" Ministers believe several assets are ripe for sale now stock markets have returned to their pre-crash peaks, and investors are ready to make long-term commitments after two years of turmoil in the eurozone. The Royal Mail is the most contentious candidate for a sell-off or flotation, with a stock market offering the most likely option in the autumn, a move that would value the business at up to £3bn. The Student Loans Company is also going under the hammer, with a deal expected by next April. The government is also working on a sell-off of blood plasma supplier Plasma Resources UK, which could be worth up to £200m. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) launched the first of the wave of privatisations on Monday by announcing plans to dispose of \"some or all\" of its 33% stake in Urenco, the world's second-largest provider of nuclear fuel. Urenco, based in Capenhurst, near Chester, and with three other plants in Germany, the Netherlands and the US, claims to provide 31% of the world's enriched uranium for nuclear power. The company is estimated to be worth €10bn (£8.6bn). There had been speculation this year that the Dutch government was preparing to sell its stake, but a deal failed to materialise. Playing down concerns of a fire sale, BIS said it would consider interest from potential buyers before pressing ahead. \"The decision to proceed towards a sale comes after the government secured agreement from its Dutch and German partners,\" the department said. The scale and timing of any sale had not been decided. \"Any sale will only be concluded if the government is satisfied that the UK's security and nonproliferation interests can be protected and that value for money is achieved for the UK taxpayer,\" it said. A government official told the Guardian that any deal to sell the stake in Urenco would have no implications for national security. The official said: \"Any sale would not give a new shareholder rights to access sensitive nuclear information, technology or material, or allow the company to act in a manner which would be contrary to our security and non-proliferation interests.\" Ministers are also adamant that any sale will not have an adverse impact on the UK's programme to build a new fleet of nuclear reactors. The official said: \"We do not expect any potential deal to have implications for nuclear new build and the UK remains fully committed to the new nuclear agenda.\" One industry source suggested that a sale to French nuclear group Areva could even improve the prospects for nuclear development in the UK, as the company has a vested interest in selling equipment and expertise for the UK's programme. Other buyers for the stake reportedly include the reactor builder Westinghouse, the Canadian uranium producer Cameco Corp, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Other assets regarded as potentially ready for privatisation include Companies House, the Land Registry, the Met Office and Ordnance Survey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2013/mar/20/budget-2013-housebuilders-retailers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-20T19:04:01Z","webTitle":"Budget 2013: great for housebuilders, terrible for retailers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/mar/20/budget-2013-housebuilders-retailers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2013/mar/20/budget-2013-housebuilders-retailers","fields":{"headline":"Budget 2013: great for housebuilders, terrible for retailers","bodyText":"It was a glorious budget for housebuilders, an inevitable disappointment for infrastructure firms and a minor catastrophe for retailers. In this period of extended mourning for HMV, shopkeepers were confident their long-standing complaints over business rates might finally be heard. A freeze was the hope; a cap at 2% was the expectation. Neither happened and so this year's 2.6% increase will proceed. The chancellor's refusal to budge on business rates will remove the shine from many of his other measures, including the cut in the rate of corporation tax to 20% in 2015 and the new \"employment allowance\" that will reduce national insurance bills for small businesses. Capping business rates at the target inflation rate of 2% would have cost £140m, the CBI calculated in its budget submission. In other words, very little in the context of the national insurance sweetener. In a budget full of helpful tweaks for business, a minor handout on rates was a strange omission. Housebuilders, though, don't have to worry. The UK now has an interventionist mortgage policy to match its ultra-loose monetary policy. The Help to Buy scheme follows the FirstBuy and NewBuy schemes and is bigger than anything seen in the past. The chancellor estimated it would fund £130bn of new mortgages over three years, equivalent to the current annual volume of mortgage lending. That's a very big scheme, assuming it takes off. One half of the scheme is aimed at new-build homes and the other applies to all homes. From the point of view of housebuilders, the design of the former is perfect since they are not required to contribute to the shared equity loans. The government will instead lend 20% of the purchase price, on an interest-free basis for five years, to buyers able to find a 5% deposit. Housebuilders' share prices, naturally, flew– Barratt Developments was up 6%. Yet the leg-up for homebuyers is odd in two ways. First, the best way to help first-time buyers would to concentrate resources solely on building new homes; and, given that home starts fell 11% last year, there's a clear need in that area. Second, a flood of cheap mortgages issued at high loan-to-value ratios risks creating another housing bubble. That's tomorrow's problem, the government seems to have decided. In the meantime, it can enjoy quite a lot of bang for a small number of bucks since most mortgage guarantees will not show up as extra government debt. Unlike mortgage guarantees, however, infrastructure spending requires up-front cash that could spoil the chancellor's borrowing forecasts. Thus his boost to infrastructure spending– £3bn a year from 2015-16 – is timid. The sum is the equivalent of about one quarter of a new nuclear power station. It's not a game changer and it will arrive – in theory, at last – once economic recovery has already started. Too little, too late, is the understandable complaint. \"The chancellor had over £11bn of under-spending in his arsenal and should have done more to fire growth now, particularly through accelerating investment in infrastructure,\" said Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/feb/10/japan-uk-inflation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-10T00:07:00Z","webTitle":"The lessons I learned from my week with Japan's power-brokers | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/10/japan-uk-inflation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/10/japan-uk-inflation","fields":{"headline":"The lessons I learned from my week with Japan's power-brokers","bodyText":"Most of us, including many bankers, now agree that the last 25 years have been a dreadful mistake. Western consumers and businesses have too much private debt, with Japan serving as an awesome warning of how that can drag an economy down for decades. There is a lot of hand-wringing over why regulation was so light-touch and why bankers were allowed to get away with so much. But those were the mistakes of a bygone world; the big question we face now is what to do next. Last week, the governor-designate of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and a man who was once a rival for the job, Adair Turner, both argued with one eye on Japan, where I have just spent an intriguing week, that it is time to open a debate about inflation. At the very least, declared Carney, we need to be very flexible about how inflation targets are met, keeping a weather eye on what is happening to growth and employment. In a formidable speech, Turner went even further. The unthinkable – printing money to finance government deficits – should no longer be unthinkable, he argued. It should be one available policy tool, a way of countering deflation. In many respects, Britain's situation is even worse than Japan's in 1990 when its lost decades began. Our stock of private debt is much higher proportionally; our banks are in much worse shape; our productivity is disastrously low and falling. What's more, our loss of share of world export markets is the worst in the G20. Incomes per head are set to stagnate for 10 years, the worst in modern times. Our government, unlike the Japanese, is mulishly opposed to increasing public debt to compensate for the private sector trying to reduce its debt. All that has stood between Britain and a Japanese-scale debacle is that at least the Bank of England has been obliged to keep inflation up rather than watch prices fall and it has been moderately imaginative about how it has done so. Nonetheless, it is crystal clear that it could, and should, have done more. In Japan, I was simultaneously aware of what a toll two decades of deflation had levied on Japanese society, but also of the compensatory force of Japan's underlying economic strength. But gloom and pessimism still suffuse the country. Hiromasa Yonekura, the president of the Keidanren, Japan's all-powerful employers' association, told me that this lack of confidence, in his view unjustified, had become hard-wired into Japan's culture by falling prices. It affected even the birth rate and was the chief cause of Japan's rapidly ageing society. Nor is the birth rate the only sign of a society in stress. Young women's role in Japanese society is being knocked back by the fashion for coquettishness and cartoon-style prettiness, complete with singsong voices and contrived ways of walking. It is a return to suffocating traditionalism masked as fashionable faddishness. A society worried about its future becomes socially regressive. Yet Japan's capacity to resist the malign element of deflation is very much greater than our own. It is still the third biggest economy in the world, with some fabulous companies possessing frontier technology, and going global rapidly. Hiroaki Nakanishi, the president of Hitachi, having just bought Horizon Nuclear Power from the Germans and aiming to build nuclear power stations in Britain, was worried that Britain was retreating from our global vocation. Tell your prime minister, he said, that Hitachi would consider it a disaster if Britain withdrew from the EU. I promised him that if the opportunity arose I would. But Hitachi's commitment to frontier engineering is only one example; others are rail company Japan Central's investment in the Maglev train, which travels at over 300mph, and textile expert Toray's commitment to new carbon materials that are many times stronger than anything known to man. Japan is engaging in investment and innovation across the board and on a scale Britain can only dream of. Time after time, as I questioned company leaders about their capacity to do this, I was referred to Japan's \"public interest\" or \"stakeholder\" capitalism – committed long-term ownership, partnership with the state to drive research forward and corporate leaderships keen to find commercial responses to the giant economic and social problems of our time. It is a world foreign to our own of shareholder value maximisation and gigantic personal bonuses, where interest in social problems is seen as \"anti-business\". This dynamism refuses to be submerged by debt deflation; Yonekura pointed out that, while New York had built 20 skyscrapers in the last decade, Tokyo had built 50. But to unleash this dynamism, Japan has had to break out of its monetary and financial trap. The newly elected government has gone some of the way, proposing a huge Keynesian stimulus and lifting the inflation target to 2%. But, as Turner argued, Japan's stock of public debt is now even more suffocating than private debt. Japan must go further: turn it from onerous debt into free cash by in effect printing money. Done right, this would not create inflation but steady the economy. There is an intense private battle raging between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan. Either the bank starts monetising public debt, as Turner argues, or the Ministry of Finance will launch another unthinkable, unilateral reduction of Japan's public debt burden by demanding borrowers accept worse repayment terms. Plans are being laid for a managed default unless the Bank of Japan prints money. This is what happens when societies face impossible demands. To sustain the social fabric, investment and innovation, governments have to do non-conservative things – reframe their capitalism and break conservative financial rules. Japan is now ready to do this, the Liberal Democrat party feeling that too much is at stake not to act. Carney and Turner are pointing the way in Britain. But there is a limit to what a central bank can do by itself. What is becoming clearer by the month is that every Tory maxim – leaving the EU, belief in smaller government, a hands-off approach to capitalism, junking the welfare state – is 100% wrong. Britain needs to learn from Japan. We don't need just a radicalisation of monetary policy – we need to recast, from top to bottom, how our companies are owned, financed and managed. Otherwise, we face an economic and social calamity. The final shredding of Toryism before brutal economic truths will signal the rebirth of the British economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2012/nov/14/rwe-raises-2012-pretax-profits-forecast","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-14T18:11:33Z","webTitle":"RWE raises 2012 pretax profits forecast to €5.8bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/14/rwe-raises-2012-pretax-profits-forecast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/nov/14/rwe-raises-2012-pretax-profits-forecast","fields":{"headline":"RWE raises 2012 pretax profits forecast to €5.8bn","bodyText":"The German power firm RWE, which trades as npower in Britain, has raised its pretax profit forecast for the year to at least €5.8bn. The Essen-based company, which generates 10% of UK electricity and supplies 6.5 million customers, reported a net income of almost €1.9bn (£1.5bn) from January to September, up 6% on the same period last year. It was helped by cost cuts, disposals and a better performance of its energy trading unit. Last year one-off writedowns following the German phase-out of nuclear power weighed on results. From July to September RWE earned €296m, compared with a net loss of €174m in the same quarter a year earlier. RWE plans to sell up to €7bn worth of assets by the end of next year, more than one fifth of which has been completed. In October the company, which has more than 70,000 employees, sold Horizon, its joint UK nuclear venture with E.ON, for £696m to Hitachi. The German utilities decided to pull out of building new nuclear plants. RWE has recently done better than E.ON, which is struggling with economic weakness in Europe and structural changes in the energy sector. On Tuesday E.ON had to cut its outlook for 2013.

The colorful former NBA star has been visiting the secretive country this week on what he calls a \"basketball democracy\" tour. On the trip's third day, Rodman met up with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, perhaps as big of a basketball fan as his father was a movie fan, where he reportedly named the Communist dictator \"a friend for life\". Rodman has been touring North Korea with a group of Harlem Globetrotters along with a Vice media production crew filming a potential HBO documentary. While it is not entirely without precedent for a US athlete to visit a Communist country with the ostensible goal of easing tensions between the two countries, former MLB pitcher Bill Lee has made many such trips to Cuba, the timing of this visit, two weeks after a reported nuclear test, makes this visit somewhat unusual. Rodman and Kim took in an exhibition game at Pyongyang, where two teams mixed with American and North Korean players played to a 110-110 tie. Later on, apparently, Rodman's group indulged in liquor provided by the leader himself. Apparently Rodman's hard partying lifestyle is well-known even in North Korea. Perhaps that comes from Kim Jong-un's younger brother, Kim Jong-chul, shown in this photo wearing Rodman's Bulls jersey. Rodman's North Korean adventure is both surprising and not. It's certainly a bit strange to see Dennis Rodman acting as a cultural ambassador to a country that is hostile to the United States and in the process of becoming a nuclear power, but it's not odd that he, among all basketball players, would be the one to visit. Despite winning championships alongside Michael Jordan as a member of the Chicago Bulls, Rodman, is best remembered for his colorful appearance (dyed hair, tattoos, piercings) and his eccentric, high profile antics: • Dating Madonna when that was still a big deal. • Wearing a wedding dress, and rocking it it should be added, to promote his first book: \"Bad As I Want To Be\". • Lying in a coffin to promote his second book, the slightly less lighthearted \"I Should Be Dead By Now\". (Bela Lugosi demands royalties from beyond the grave.) • Appearing in some of the worst action movies of all time. • Posing naked for PETA ads. • Taking on a second career as a professional wrestler during one of his NBA suspensions. • Earning one of those suspensions by headbutting a referee. • Tripping a cameraman and kicking him in the groin. So, heading off to North Korea and proclaiming that Kim Jong-un is now his BFF? Completely within character for the unpredictable Rodman. This resume may not make him sound like the ideal cultural ambassador for most countries, but it might make the man they call the Worm the perfect American ambassador to a country that is used to revering eccentric individuals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2013/feb/27/british-gas-price-profit-rise-centrica","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-27T09:23:50Z","webTitle":"British Gas price hikes help boost annual profit 11% to more than £600m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/27/british-gas-price-profit-rise-centrica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/feb/27/british-gas-price-profit-rise-centrica","fields":{"headline":"British Gas price hikes help boost annual profit 11% to more than £600m","bodyText":"Phil Bentley, the managing director of British Gas, formally announced his decision to leave on Wednesday as the company risked fresh anger from consumer groups by reporting an 11% increase in annual profits to over £600m, aided by domestic price rises. The 54-year-old former BP executive who has been at the centre of rows over the scale of Big Six energy company earnings, will exit with a combined share, salary and pension package worth more than £10m. He says he wants to go on and become a chief executive elsewhere but will be able to retire in four years time with an annual pension of £225,000 after working for British Gas for little over 12 years. A formal statement from British Gas's parent group, Centrica, paid tribute to his role in \"profit improvement\" at the UK's largest domestic energy supplier. \"In his most recent role he [Bentley] has been instrumental in restructuring, reinvigorating and materially improving the performance of the business by raising customer service standards, lowering costs, increasing productivity and creating significant value from profit improvement,\" said the Centrica statement. The well-signalled decision came as the wider Centrica group reported operating profits of £2.7bn – up 14% and announced plans to spend £500m buying back shares while raising the dividend 5% to 16.4p. Nick Luff, the finance director, said it was fair to give back cash to investors given Centrica had raised £2bn for funding nuclear power stations, plans which have now been dropped. He dismissed the suggestion the cash should be invested in operations pointing out the company was already spending £2.7bn a year building new offshore gas supplies and wind farms. Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, defended the profits at British Gas and the wider group saying they contributed to jobs and tax take. \"It's important that Centrica makes a fair and reasonable return so that we can continue to make our contribution to society and to invest. Last year we incurred a tax charge of over £1bn and invested over £2bn to secure new sources of energy for the UK, well in excess of our profits.\" Centrica said it was going to put more emphasis on its growing business in North America. It hinted that it may invest in cheap shale gas production there which could eventually be exported to Britain to supply UK homes. British Gas raised its gas and electricity prices this winter by 6%. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch, predicted that Wednesday's profit rises would grate with some customers. \"Yes, there is a huge amount of investment required to keep the lights on over the next 10 years, but there has to be a balance between energy companies making healthy profits and people going cold for fear of the cost of turning their heating on. While British Gas makes a strong case about future investment, jobs and security, I suspect there will be little sympathy, especially amongst those who have shivered at home this winter,\" Robinson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/may/21/dr-congo-funding-world-largest-hydropower-dam","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-21T14:44:31Z","webTitle":"DR Congo waits on funding for world's largest hydropower project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/21/dr-congo-funding-world-largest-hydropower-dam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/may/21/dr-congo-funding-world-largest-hydropower-dam","fields":{"headline":"DR Congo waits on funding for world's largest hydropower project","bodyText":"The dream of harnessing the mighty Congo with the world's largest set of dams has moved closer, with the World Bank and other financial institutions expected to offer finance and South Africa agreeing to buy half of the power generated. In the past 60 years French, Belgian, Chinese, Brazilian and African engineers have all hoped to dam the river. But decades of civil war, corruption, and the Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) reputation as a failed state have limited the hydropower developments at the country's Inga Falls to two relatively small dams, built in 1972 and 1982. These, known as Inga 1 and 2, have a theoretical capacity of 1,400 megawatts but produce about half that. A new $20bn (£13.2bn) development to generate a further 4,800MW was announced over the weekend in Paris, with work planned to start in October 2015. According to the DRC government, working with European and other consultants, five further stages at Inga Falls could eventually have a capacity of 40,000MW – equivalent to more than 20 large nuclear power stations. This would make the complete Grand Inga development the largest hydro project in the world, generating twice as much as the Three Gorges dam in China. In theory, say its backers, it could provide 40% of Africa's electricity needs. The attraction of developing hydropower on the Congo, says the government, is that unlike most of the world's great dam projects, it would not require tens of thousands of people to be relocated, nor would it block the river and result in significant environmental consequences. Because the Congo River around Inga is so vast and falls nearly 100 metres over a short distance, water can be diverted to create a massive new lake without disturbing its main flow. \"The impact on land use is very limited. The development can be progressive and carried out in a series of further phases, eventually providing 40,000MW of power,\" says the technical data for the proposed development. The African Development Bank, World Bank, French Development Agency, European Investment Bank and Development Bank of South Africa have all shown interest in financing the next stage of the project. No developer has been chosen but Chinese, Korean and Spanish companies are said to be in the forefront. Key to the project is South Africa's commitment this week to buy 2,500MW of capacity. \"We have affirmed our commitment to the project by already provisioning for this purchase in our budgetary plan,\" said a South Africa ministry of energy official, Garrith Bezuidenhoudt. But the prospect of local people getting power from Inga in the next 20 years is remote. Less than 10% of the population has electricity, with nearly all Inga 1 and 2 power going directly to multinational mining companies in the Katanga \"copper belt\". It is expected most Inga 3 power would travel 1,500 miles to power-hungry South Africa or large mines in DRC. Giant hydropower schemes in Africa have a poor track record. \"Projects such as Inga 1 and 2 have not unleashed economic development, but have been major contributors to African countries' unsustainable debt burden,\" said the US-based International Rivers network, which has led opposition to major dams around the world for 20 years. In a letter last week to the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, the International Rivers and 18 other civil society organisations and networks from Africa, Europe and the US said the reality of large-scale dams seldom matched their expectations, mostly adding to debt problems and allowing powerful companies to cheaply exploit and export Africa's vast natural resources. According to the groups, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has found that because of the continent's low population density, grid-based electrification – including through large hydropower projects – is not cost-effective for much of rural Sub-Saharan Africa. The letter said: \"Renewable energy solutions such as wind, solar and micro hydropower projects are much more effective at reaching the rural poor. \"According to the IEA report, 70% of the world's unelectrified rural areas are best served through mini-grids or off-grid solutions. \"In the DRC, the World Bank and other financiers have invested billions… in the construction and rehabilitation of the Inga 1 and 2 hydropower projects and associated transmission lines over the past 40 years. \"After all this investment, 85% of the electricity in the DRC is consumed by high-voltage users, while only 6-9% of the population has access to electricity. We are concerned that the bank's proposed focus on large hydropower projects will write off electricity access for the majority of Africa's poor.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/nov/19/iran-concession-nuclear-talks-geneva","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-19T21:47:00Z","webTitle":"Iranian concession and Cameron phone call raise nuclear deal hopes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/19/iran-concession-nuclear-talks-geneva","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/19/iran-concession-nuclear-talks-geneva","fields":{"headline":"Iranian concession and Cameron phone call raise nuclear deal hopes","bodyText":"Differences between Iran and the west that have so far prevented a historic nuclear deal appear to have narrowed considerably as negotiators gather for a new round of talks in Geneva on Wednesday. On Tuesday the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, launched a slickly produced YouTube channel with a declaration that the path to a resolution of the decade-old dispute over Iran's nuclear programme was open, and called on the world powers to seize a \"historic opportunity\". Zarif's move came as David Cameron spoke on the phone to Hassan Rouhani, becoming the first British prime minister to speak to an Iranian president in a decade. \"The two leaders discussed the bilateral relationship between Britain and Iran welcoming the steps taken since President Rouhani took office, including the appointment of non-resident Charges d'Affaires last week,\" a spokesperson for the PM said. \"They agreed to continue efforts to improve the relationship on a step by step and reciprocal basis.\" \"On Iran's nuclear programme, both leaders agreed that significant progress had been made in the recent Geneva negotiations and that it was important to seize the opportunity presented by the further round of talks which get underway tomorrow.\" The previous round of Geneva talks adjourned early, on 10 November, after an intense and dramatic three days of discussions fell just short of agreement following an intervention by the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, to toughen the western bargaining position. In a Saturday night meeting with the US secretary of state, John Kerry, Fabius insisted that the six powers at the talks – the US, France, the UK, Germany, Russia and France – should not grant Iran's right to uranium enrichment but should demand the cessation of Iran's construction work on a plutonium-producing heavy water reactor at Arak. Zarif said he would have to consult Tehran on the 11th-hour changes, and the high-level talks broke up. Since then, there have been clear signs of behind-the-scenes progress. On Sunday, Zarif was quoted in the semi-official Isna news agency as saying Iran's right to enrich was \"non-negotiable\", but adding that the Iranians \"see no necessity for its recognition as a right\". \"The right to enrichment does not need to be recognised because, according to the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty], this right is inalienable,\" the foreign minister said. If carried through to the negotiating table, the Iranian concession could remove a huge stumbling block. Western officials all accept that some degree of Iranian enrichment is an inevitable part of any eventual settlement but Washington and its allies have been reluctant to put that acceptance in writing as it would create a potentially dangerous precedent. Uranium enrichment is dual-purpose – it can produce fuel both for nuclear power stations and for warheads. In the western camp, there have also been hints that a compromise could be found over Arak. The French insistence on a complete halt to work on the heavy water reactor was not shared by the whole government, a French defence source said. \"There is a debate going on in Paris, between the Quai d'Orsay [the foreign ministry] and the Élysée [the presidency] on that position,\" the source said. German officials are believed to have shared some of the French concerns about a stopgap deal signed in haste in Geneva under pressure to produce results by the presence of Kerry and other foreign ministers. But the Germans disapproved of Fabius's decision to break ranks and make the divisions within the six-nation group public. Talks since the last Geneva round appear to have resolved some of the differences inside the western camp. \"I'm very optimistic there is an understanding. Some of the sensitive work will be shut down. The Europeans are hopeful this will not now be a problem,\" said Mark Hibbs, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The purpose of the interim deal under discussion in Geneva is to slow down the Iran programme, halting and rolling back some elements, in return for limited sanctions. The deal would last for six months, during which time negotiations would continue aimed at a more enduring settlement. Among the elements on the table are a halt to Iranian production of medium-enriched uranium, of 20% purity, and a dilution of the existing stockpile of nearly 200kg or its conversion into oxide for reactor fuel. That would add an extra month or so to the time Iran would need to turn it into weapons-grade uranium if it decided to make a weapon. A cap on the stockpile of low-enriched, reactor-grade uranium is also likely to form part of the stopgap deal, and a freeze on Iran's enrichment capacity, halting the production and installation of new-model centrifuges, for example. In return for such concessions, Iran would receive an estimated $10bn (£6bn) in sanctions relief, in the form of unfreezing blocked bank accounts, and the end of restrictions on trade in gold, petrochemicals and aircraft parts. Officials involved in the talks point out that each of these elements involves separate highly detailed, technical agreements, and so caution that striking a bargain could be a drawn-out and painstaking process. However, both Washington and Tehran are under pressure to achieve a deal quickly to keep domestic political pressure at bay. The US Congress is threatening to pass new sanctions legislation, which could derail the negotiations. \"The US Congress has recently been seeking to approve a bill to increase sanctions against Iran,\" said Mohammad-Hassan Asafari a senior member of Iran's parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy. \"It has been decided that the negotiations be suspended if the bill gets through the US Congress.\" Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, warned on Monday in a phone conversation with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, that \"excessive demands\" could hamper any possible deal. \"At the recent Geneva talks good progress was made, but everyone must realise excessive demands could complicate the process towards a win-win agreement,\" the Iranian president told Putin, according to the state English-language television Press TV. \"From our point of view, there should not be a situation in which the will of parties to reach mutually acceptable agreement is affected.\" The negotiations continue to put a severe strain on US-Israeli relations. Following persistent warnings against striking a deal in Geneva from the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, Kerry made it clear that he would not be visiting Jerusalem later this week, despite an announcement to that effect made by Netanyahu. Instead, Kerry's aides said he would try to find time for a trip after the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November. On Monday, the secretary of state spoke about Netanyahu's right \"to publicly state his position and defend what he believes is his interest\". But, in a direct rebuttal of Israel's position, he added: \"Nothing that we are doing here, in my judgment, will put Israel at any additional risk. In fact, let me make this clear, we believe it reduces risk.\" The progress in Geneva came as the White House also appeared to be holding congressional hawks at bay in Washington. Barack Obama held a meeting with US senators at the White House on Tuesday to ask them to hold off further sanctions for now while the talks appeared so close to a breakthrough. Obama revealed details of the proposed deal with Iran during a conference in Washington on Tuesday afternoon. It would relax some sanctions, but not oil exports or banking, in exchange for a temporary suspension in Iran's nuclear efforts while all sides seek a lasting solution. \"Some of the reporting has been inaccurate, understandably because the [countries involved] have kept the negotiations tight, but the essence of the deal would be that they would halt advances on their nuclear programme, they would roll back some elements that would get them closer to break out capacity where they could run for a weapon before the international community had a chance to react, and they would subject themselves to more vigorous inspections,\" Obama told a conference of business leaders. \"In return, [we would] open up the spigot a little bit for a very modest amount of relief that is entirely subject to reinstatement if they violate the agreement,\" he added. \"It would purchase a period of time, lets say six months, during which we could see if they could get to the end state of a position where we, the Israelis and the international community could say with confidence that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\" Details of the proposed deal, hitherto hazy, may add to pressure from Israel and hawkish Republicans in Washington who say Iran is being let off the hook."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/15/fukushima-disaster-avoided-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-15T08:58:21Z","webTitle":"Fukushima disaster could have been avoided, nuclear plant operator admits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/fukushima-disaster-avoided-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/15/fukushima-disaster-avoided-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima disaster could have been avoided, nuclear plant operator admits","bodyText":"The company at the centre of Japan's worst nuclear crisis has acknowledged for the first time that it could have avoided the disaster that crippled the Fukushima Daiichi power plant last year. In a reversal of its insistence that nothing could have protected the plant against the earthquake and tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people on 11 March, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it had known safety improvements were needed before the disaster, but had failed to implement them. \"When looking back on the accident, the problem was that preparations were not made in advance,\" Tepco's internal reform taskforce, led by the firm's president, Naomi Hirose, said in a statement on Monday. The company could have taken steps to prevent a catastrophic accident by adopting more extensive safety measures, the statement added. Tepco's about-turn came after an independent panel of experts challenged its claim that it could not have foreseen the up to 14m high waves that swept through the plant, knocking out its backup power supply and causing three of its six reactors to melt down. In a damning report released in July, a parliament-appointed panel criticised years of \"collusion\" between Tepco, industry regulators and politicians, and described the disaster as \"manmade\". The crisis forced the evacuation of 150,000 residents, most of whom have yet to return home, and led Japan to announce it would end its reliance on nuclear energy, although it has since dropped its deadline to phase out atomic power by 2040. In a rare moment of introspection, an internal taskforce set up to reform the embattled utility said the firm feared that improvements in safety would highlight the risks to nuclear power plants and encourage the anti-nuclear lobby. \"There was a worry that if the company were to implement a severe-accident response plan, it would spur anxiety throughout the country and in the communities near where nuclear plants are sited, and lend momentum to the anti-nuclear movement,\" the report said. The firm conceded that some suggested safety improvements, such as using multiple power sources and cooling systems, would have required the plant's temporary closure and added to its costs. Acknowledging that previous safety measures were insufficient could have invited lawsuits, it added. The statement said the company should have adhered more closely to international safety standards for atomic facilities, and trained specialist staff in practical disaster response rather than relying on safety drills it dismissed as a \"formality\". Tepco's admission that it was unprepared for the disaster came after the first meeting of an independent advisory committee set up to help the company reform its nuclear operations. \"It is very clear that mistakes were made,\" Dale Klein, the former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission and head of the reform committee, told reporters in Tokyo. \"It is very important for Tepco to recognise the need to reform, and the committee is very anxious to facilitate the reform necessary for Tepco to become a world-class company. \"The committee's goal is to ensure that Tepco develops practices and procedures so an accident like this will never happen again.\" Klein said individual workers at the plant would be expected to challenge the pervading culture of complacency over safety. \"The challenge that Tepco will have is establishing a culture so that every individual understands they are responsible for safety,\" he said. The report noted that Tepco had not made any safety improvements to the Fukushima Daiichi plant since 2002, and had dismissed the possibility of it being hit by a massive tsunami, even though it could not produce supporting data. It had, for example, insisted that Fukushima Daiichi's 5.7m seawall was high enough to withstand a tsunami generated by a large quake in the area, despite a warning in 2008 by its own engineers that much bigger waves were possible. Tepco repeated claims it had done everything possible to prevent a disaster as recently as July. Instead, it accused the prime minister at the time of the accident, Naoto Kan, of exacerbating the problem by interfering in the firm's response. Tepco has been forced to reform its management and operations after the government saved it from collapse in May, in effect nationalising it with a 1tn-yen bailout. Despite Japan's plan to phase out nuclear power, Tepco's 10-year business plan includes the need to restart idled reactors, beginning with those at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in northern Japan. But the company denied its admission of culpability and efforts at reform were intended to mollify the public ahead of a quick return to nuclear power generation. \"The reforms are intended to improve our safety culture, and we have no intention to link it to the possibility of resuming the [Kashiwazaki-Kariwa] plant,\" Takafumi Anegawa, a Tepco official, told the Associated Press. \"We don't have any preconditions for our reforms.\" The firm's efforts to restart other reactors received a boost from Barbara Judge, the former chair of the UK atomic energy authority, who said nuclear plants could operate safely – even in quake-prone countries such as Japan – provided the right safety measures were in place. \"It's a question of determination of the risks. It's a question of making sure that there is a plan for how to deal with the risks, or the problem, should they eventuate,\" Judge said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/nov/20/ben-goldacre-bad-science-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"How to make people 'love' nuclear power | Ben Goldacre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/20/ben-goldacre-bad-science-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/20/ben-goldacre-bad-science-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"How to make people 'love' nuclear power","bodyText":"I like nerdy days out: like going to the nuclear bunker at Kelvedon Hatch with its sign on the A128 in Essex saying \"secret nuclear bunker this way\". Last month, eight of us commissioned a boat to get on to a rotting manmade second world war sea-fort in the middle of the ocean through Project Redsand, the restoration scheme. A couple of weeks earlier, Mrs Bad Science and I travelled to Dungeness, where a toytown narrow-gauge railway takes you to the base of a magnificent, enormous and terrifying nuclear power station. I tell you this, because I should declare an interest. I quite like nuclear power stations, not just because they're clever, or even because I regretfully concede they might be one of our least bad options for power. I secretly like nuclear power stations because they remind me, in the way nostalgia makes us pine for things we disliked at the time, of a childhood in the early 1980s when I believed that I would die in a nuclear holocaust. Which leads me on to the energy company EDF, which last month conducted a poll on whether people near Hinkley Point nuclear power station would like it to be expanded. The BBC dutifully reported the results. \"EDF survey shows support for Hinkley power station,\" ran the headline. \"Six in 10 people support a new power station at Hinkley.\" Polls like this convince locals, and politicians. But Leo Barasi at the blog ClimateSock has diligently obtained the original polling questions from ICM, and what he has found is a masterclass in how to manipulate answers to a single question. Respondents are set into the frame with a simple starter: \"How favourable or unfavourable is your opinion of the nuclear energy industry?\" Then things heat up. \"To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: nuclear energy has disadvantages but the country needs nuclear power as part of the energy balance with coal, gas and wind power.\" As Leo says, this is structured in a way that makes it harder to disagree. \"It appear reasoned: taking on board the downsides of nuclear before drawing a measured conclusion that it's a necessary evil to produce a greater good.\" As a result, only 13% disagree, but the whole audience is gently nudged. Then locals are asked a whole series of branching questions, forcing them to weigh up the positive and negative impacts a new power station would have on the area. People who think it would be positive are asked to also weigh up the negative, and people who think it would be negative are asked to weigh up the positive factors, and everyone is asked to say why they think what they think. Then, in a killer move, they're asked: \"How important, if at all, do you consider a new power station at Hinkley to each of the following? To the creation of local jobs? To the future of local businesses?\" And take a moment to reinforce those concerns: \"Why do you say that?\" Finally, after being led on this thoughtful journey, and immediately after mulling over the beneficial economic impact it would have in their community, the locals are asked if they're in favour of a new nuclear power station. It's the results of this, the final question, that are reported in the press release and headlines. To me it seems clear that this long series of preceding questions will guide people down a path of thinking about a nuclear power station in a very different way to how they normally would. It's a line of reasoning, and that might make sense if you were trying to advocate a kind of structured decision making, but it is very unlikely to produce results that reflect local views. That's partly because we're all a bit thoughtless, in the real world, and follow our gut in odd ways; but partly because the penultimate question is \"do you want your children to be unemployed?\" rather than \"are you all secretly terrified we might cock up and give you cancer?\". I still quite like nuclear power stations, but more than that, as ever, I salute the PR industry for finding new and elaborate ways to muddy the waters and I salute the nerds who bust them for it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"childrens-books-site/2012/nov/08/review-homecoming-michael-morpurgo","type":"article","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-08T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"Homecoming by Michael Morpurgo - review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/nov/08/review-homecoming-michael-morpurgo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2012/nov/08/review-homecoming-michael-morpurgo","fields":{"headline":"Homecoming by Michael Morpurgo - review","bodyText":"Homecoming is a touching and sad story which seems truly written from the heart.

It adds that technician had been working onsite throughout the night to restore power to customers this morning after floodwater breached defences at Lancaster’s main substation just before 11pm on Saturday. The statement goes on to say: “We have been working on site throughout the day but unfortunately due to unforeseen flood damage at that site a significant fault has occurred. We are calling for extra generators and engineers from across the country to help us to restore power to our customers.” We are closing down the blog now. A full wrap on events from our team can be found here. Shopkeepers in the first town to be affected by the weekend floods have spoken of their devastation. The banks of the river Eden, which flows through Appleby-in-Westmorland, in south Cumbria, burst on Saturday and wreaked havoc in homes and businesses on either side. The Press Association has filed this: On the Boroughgate side of the town, locals helped each other clear water-damaged flooring, stock and debris from a row of shops in Bridge Street. While on the other side of the closed Eden bridge on the Sands it was a similar picture as locals said half the town was still without power. Among those affected was Catherine Hoggins, 42, who only opened Appleby Barber Shop in Bridge Street last Monday. She had relocated from the market arcade, which had missed much of the damage, she said. She said: “What can you say? Self-employed, three kids, single mum, three weeks before Christmas, what do you do? What do you do? “For me personally, it’s devastating. You have got to crack on, haven’t you? I’m devastated more for my kids because there is no money coming in.” While homes in the UK count the cost from the weekend’s weather, the world’s biggest climate polluters have meanwhile rallied around a stronger target for limiting warming, saying they were open to the 1.5C goal endorsed by the most vulnerable countries. Suzanne Goldenberg and John Vidal have filed from the Cop 21 UN climate change conference: In the final push to a climate agreement, the US, Canada, China and the European Union declared they were now on board with demands from African countries to adopt an even more ambitious goal to limit warming. “We can’t go home and say ‘we saved the planet, check.’ This issue will continue to be a top priority for the president and the White House coming out of Paris heading into next year and for remaining time that he is in office because there is more work to do,” a White House official said. Small island states say the current temperature goal of 2C would bring doom, drowning low-lying areas, and forcing mass migration. They want an agreement from Paris that would seek to keep warming at about 1C, which is roughly the current level of warming above pre-industrial levels. You can read the rest in full here. Here is video of Labour’s Kerry McCarthy attacking the government earlier on a £115m fall in spending on risk management and flood defences this year. McCarthy, shadow secretary of state for environment, also accused the government of climate-change scepticism. Liz Truss, the environment secretary, defended the government’s current level of spending. Some more images of scenes from some of the areas worst hit by flooding. Strong winds and flooding appear to have been a factor in at least two deaths over the weekend. • A man, 78, who was pulled from a stream close to the river Kent in Staveley. ITV Border reported that the man, who died near Kendall, had been trying to retrieve a barrel from the water to prevent flooding in the village. His wife was reported to have been at the scene but was unable to save him. His body was recovered at about 10am on Monday morning by emergency services in Cumbria, who had spent much of Sunday searching for him. • Ernie Crouch, 90, died on Sunday after he was apparently blown into the side of a moving bus by strong winds near Finchley Central tube station in London. Among those paying tribute to Crouch were Arsenal fans – he was a life-long and well-known supporter of the team – and the club itself: Carlisle United appear to have been hit particularly hard by flooding. Some images have come in: The club has released a statement in which it expressed thanks to fans and others for the patience as the club begins the process of assessing the aftermath of this weekend’s flood. It added: As things stand, we have suspended ticket and hospitality sales for home and away fixtures – please bear with us as we put new procedures in place, in conjunction with the Football League and the clubs we are scheduled to play. United Utilities have rejected any suggestion of mismanagement on their part in relation to Lake Thirlmere, where high water levels have been a factor in flooding in the Keswick area. A spokesman told Fred Searle: Thirlmere reservoir is well maintained and managed according to all the proper legislation and in accordance with the local arrangements agreed with Keswick Flood Action Group. If the volume of water coming into the reservoir exceeds what can be released, the reservoir will fill up. November saw more than twice the normal level of rainfall and on 5 December alone, around 14,000m litres of water entered the reservoir, more than a third of its capacity. Scottish councils will receive government funding if they can demonstrate that flooding from Storm Desmond caused an undue burden that could not have been accommodated in their local budgets, Scotland’s deputy first minister has pledged. The Press Association reports that John Swinney is inviting applications for an emergency funding programme known as the Bellwin scheme but advised there is no automatic entitlement and local authorities are expected to include a small amount within their annual budget to deal with unforeseen emergencies. Severe weather warnings remain in place throughout south-west Scotland but they have been downgraded to yellow from the more severe amber and the highest red level that came in the wake of Storm Desmond at the weekend. People returned to their homes on Sunday night to assess the damage from record rainfall and high winds. At the peak of the problems about 300 homes were evacuated in Hawick as the river Teviot burst its banks, while properties in Newcastleton, Langholm, Annandale and Eskdale were also affected. More than 100mm of rain fell in the area throughout Friday and Saturday, according to Met Office figures. The river Tay in Perth was also closely monitored as it approach its highest level for a decade and a handful of homes were evacuated in Bridge of Earn and Blair Atholl on Saturday night. Speaking of David Cameron, here is some video footage of him in Carlisle today. The prime minister visited a local family and the town’s flood defences, which were built during the last parliament, saying: “We built these great barriers here, which have prevented Carlisle from being flooded on two other occasions, but they weren’t enough this time.” “Furious” flooding in Cumbria, Cockermouth and other places are in line with scientists’ predictions, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has told a meeting in Paris organised by Trade Unions for Energy Democracy. “Last year, the prime minister of Britain promised that ‘money is no object’ in dealing with flooding, itself a consequence of the destruction of our environment,” he said at the event, which is taking place against the the backdrop of Cop21. He added: But this has proved to be yet another false promise. In the last parliament, the government slashed spending on flood defences before the 2014 winter floods. The government has failed to deliver on their promises. They have abandoned the consensus on flood investment built by the Labour party after the 2007 floods – and are failing the British people because of their obsession with austerity.” However, I would like to offer my thanks to the emergency services: firefighters, police, emergency services and the armed forces [for] their tireless work in keeping those suffering from flooding safe. Here’s a picture tweeted from the event by Trade Unions for Energy Democracy: Keswick’s mayor Paul Titley has suggested that more could have been done to prevent flooding in his town. The cause of the flooding was extremely heavy rainfall, he told Fred Searle, who contacted him from the Guardian. But he said that mismanagement of nearby Lake Thirlmere, which acts as a catchment for water coming off the surrounding hills, made flooding in Keswick more likely. When Lake Thirlmere is empty, we’re pretty much safe here because Thirlmere acts as a catchment for all the water coming off the fells. This time it was full. It was also full in 2009. United Utilities [who manage water levels in the lake] are paid to keep it full so the good people of Manchester can have a bath. We’d rather it had a lot more space left in it in the winter so we don’t face the risk of the water spilling over, which is what happened at the weekend. The Met Office has warned that “all the evidence” suggests climate change played a role in the floods which have devastated thousands of homes following Storm Desmond. The Met Office’s chief scientist Dame Julia Slingo said the extreme weather conditions were “extraordinary”. She told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: Is it to do with climate change? There can’t yet be a definitive answer but we know that all the evidence from fundamental physics and what we understand about our weather patterns, that there is potentially a role. This is Ben Quinn taking over the liveblog now from Andrew. Friends of the Earth says that the government’s decision to review its flood defence plans (see 11.58am and 3.52pm) shows the government has not taken climate change seriously enough. This is from FoE’s climate campaigner Guy Shrubsole. Liz Truss’s concession that UK flood projection data needs to be revisited is a clear sign that officials are seriously concerned that climate change is increasing the risk of flooding far higher than expected. Weak pledges of climate action from this government and others in Paris means the world is on course to exceed 2C of global warming, leading to catastrophic climate change. Yet the government’s flood defence plans are predicated on a 2C rise. The choice is simple. Either David Cameron must ensure tougher action on emissions at home and globally, or commit hundreds of millions of pounds more to flood defences. The power supply to 42,000 households in Lancaster, Morecambe, Carnforth was lost at 4pm this afternoon, Electricity North West said. Power had been restored to all customers in the Lancaster area this morning after flood water breached flood defences at Lancaster’s main substation just before 11pm on Saturday, cutting power to 55,000 properties. Engineers are still on site and are investigating the cause of the outage and will update customers as soon as possible, the energy firm said. Mark Williamson, operations director for Electricity North West, said: “Unfortunately power has been lost to customers in Lancaster and surrounding areas. “We are on site and investigating the cause and we will update customers as soon as we find out more and again we would like to thank our customers for their patience and support during what continues to be an enormously challenging time for everyone involved.” 2,657 properties remain without power in Cumbria, where flood water is restricting access for Electricity North West teams. Carbon Brief, the climate change website, has posted a report from earlier this year saying flood damage in Europe is set to increase 200% by the end of the century. And this graphic illustrates the problem. Prof David Balmforth, a former president of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a flooding expert, has told the Press Association that the government should consider new methods to cope with flooding, as well as conventional flood barriers, because the problem is likely to become more common. “I think there is every indication to show that rain will become much more severe and therefore flooding more frequent in future as a result of climate change,” he said. One option might be raising new buildings a metre above the ground, he said. A rule to this effect has been introduced in Nepal, he said. [In Nepal] they have regulated minimum threshold levels about a metre above surrounding ground for any new major development, whether or not it’s in a flood-risk area. So that sort of method surrounding new properties can make a lot of difference. We can make our entry to properties such that they don’t let water in quite as easily, use doors that protect against floodwater, use flood-resistant material so water doesn’t get into a property, then it doesn’t cause quite so much damage and doesn’t take a very long time to dry out. The use of cement-based materials on walls rather than plaster materials, and the use of concrete flooring rather than timber flooring, and so on, can make a really big difference to how people can get back into their accommodation once it’s been damaged. In her Commons statement, Liz Truss said that although 55,000 homes lost power during the floods, there were now fewer than 5,000 homes cut off. But she may have spoken too soon. Electricity North West says a new power cut has left 42,000 customers in Lancaster, Morecambe and Carnforth without electricity. The Met Office has been tweeting information about rainfall records broken this weekend, as well as a link to a post explaining how rainfall is measured. Here are some more pictures from David Cameron’s visit to Carlisle. Two days after the river Derwent overtopped its banks, the residents of Derwentside Gardens in Cockermouth have finally been allowed back into their homes. The flood waters have resided, leaving a dirty layer of mud and silt across lovingly laid oak floors, carpets and ruined rugs. With no electricity or running water, few planned to stay long. The fire service wouldn’t let them drive their cars on to the estate so they salvaged what they could carry on foot: sentimental paintings, favourite vases, medication, Christmas presents they had managed to move from under the tree up on to kitchen work surfaces when the evacuation warning came at Saturday teatime. Up Gote Brow they trudged in their cagoules and wellies, past homes on Gote Road still under water, eerie orange Xs spray-painted on the windows by lifeboat teams to show there was no one left stuck inside. Many said they didn’t expect to be back in their homes for six months, let alone Christmas – “That’s how long it took last time,” said one woman. “Maybe this time the water was only 2ft-deep instead of 3ft-deep but it does the same damage.” Another woman cried. “I’m 66 years old. I’ve got chronic health problems. I can’t go through this again.” Tessa Milner said they were just “numb”. This afternoon outside her bungalow on Derwentside Gardens, she was clearing up her third major flood in 11 years: her first, in 2005, was near Carlisle; the second was in Cockermouth in 2009, when she was living in a terraced house on Waterloo Street in the town centre. “That was bad – water up to ceiling height,” she said. “But I was only renting. We’ve bought this place.” The only good thing about being flooded again is that you know how to cope, she said. “I feel like I know what I’m doing this time. I know how to talk to loss adjusters on the phone. Before, I was lost. I feel like a bit of a pro now.” Michael Johnson, 60, moved into this three-floor Victorian terrace house on Warwick Road in Carlisle last October after being assured by the local council and estate agents that the 2005 floods could never happen again thanks to the flood defences. To his horror, this weekend’s floods were far worse. Some 9,000 litres of flood water was being pumped from his devastated house when he spoke to me this afternoon. After this weekend’s damage he wants to sell the £300,000 property but fears no one would buy it. “The problem is who’s going to buy a house that’s been flooded twice in 10 years? Even if you make it a palace … I feel as though I’m probably stuck here now,” he says. He added: “The saddest thing ever is that I’ve been warned not to leave my property because thieves are in the area. This is from neighbours who say they’re not local thieves, they’re coming from outside. It’s like being hit and then kicked when you’re down.” David Cameron has been visiting Carlisle, and he has filmed a clip for broadcasters beside flood defences that were built outside the town during the last parliament. He referred to them as he spoke about what he had seen. It’s an absolutely horrific thing to happen, and for many of these people it is not the first time that it has happened, which is why we built these great barriers here, which have prevented Carlisle from being flooded on two other occasions, but they weren’t enough this time. Something like 14 inches of rain in 24 hours – it really was torrential. But, obviously, the people who’ve got to move out of their homes – we need to get their insurance claims done quickly, find them alternative accommodation. The emergency services have been brilliant. But that is no consolation to people who face a very wet few days, and then perhaps not being home for Christmas. He also confirmed that the government would consider whether it needed to revise its flood defence plans in the light of this weekend’s events. After every flood the thing to do is sit down, look at the money you are spending, look at what you are building, look at what you are planning to do in the future, and ask is it enough. That’s exactly what we will do. Labour’s Liz McInnes asks if the government is considering following Scotland and Northern Ireland where the fire service has a statutory duty to respond to calls about flooding. Truss says she thinks the current system is working. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a Conservative who represents Berwick-upon-Tweed, says more trees should be planted on high land to reduce the risk of flooding. Truss says this is an issue the government is considering. In the Commons the Labour MP Dennis Skinner says it is at times like this that people worry about cuts to services such as the fire services. Can Truss assure MPs those cuts will be reversed? Truss says the fire service has provided communities with fantastic support. In terms of flood protection, there will be an increase in real terms in capital spending on flood defence. And maintenance spending on flood defences will be protected, she says. On insurance, the Met Office has been tweeting a link to this advice from the Association of British Insurers. Nigel Evans, the Conservative MP for Ribble Valley, asks for an assurance that the insurance companies will not withdraw cover from people affected. That can blight people’s homes, he says. Truss says the government will work with insurance companies to ensure people are paid promptly. Truss is responding to McCarthy. She says the government’s view is that these floods are consistent with what we know about climate change. The government’s flood defence plans contain assumptions about climate change. But that modelling will have to be reviewed in the light of the current floods, she says. Kerry McCarthy, the shadow environment secretary, says that just six years ago Cumbria was hit by flooding described as a “once-in-a-lifetime event”. But this flooding is even worse. She says Truss’s predecessor, Owen Paterson, did not acknowledge climate change. She asks if Truss accepts that cuts to flood defence spending left the UK unprepared. There should be year-on-year increases in spending on flood defences, McCarthy says. And she says Labour would like the government to be able to handle this on a cross-party basis. In the Commons Liz Truss, the environment secretary, is making her statement. This weekend has brought some extremely difficult weather conditions, she says. She expresses her sympathy to those affected. And she praises everyone who has been involved in the rescue efforts, and who has been helping those affected. She says on Saturday the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) mobilised a full national emergency response. Some 200 soldiers were sent to the flood areas, and a Chinook helicopter was dispatched. She says there have been a number of fatalities. She chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee yesterday, and another was chaired by David Cameron this morning. She says power is being restored. Only 5,000 homes are still cut off, he says. She says after this statement she will be travelling to Cumbria and Northumbria herself. She says the Bellwin scheme, which allows councils to get emergency financial assistance, will be activated. Councils will get 100% of eligible costs, she says. And she says further support schemes will come into force in the coming days. I’ve just spoken to Sam Bailey, the unit manager of one of the volunteer flood rescue teams that drove eight hours from Cornwall on Saturday to help out with the recovery efforts in Cumbria. About 100 people have been rescued so far today from their flood-hit houses around Warwick Road in Carlisle, he says, in addition to between 200 and 300 victims evacuated over the weekend in this area. “You see a lot of people breaking down as we’re rescuing them and bringing them back on to dry land. Some people have lost everything. “It’s quite humbling for us – I was travelling along in one of our rescue boats and thinking ‘you poor people’. The water was still up to their doors and their cars were floating, wheelie bins were floating. Some cars had airbags that had gone off. I just have seen 20 written-off cars on this street alone.” Bailey, who says he has only slept for three hours since Friday night, is one of an estimated 50 volunteers helping the rescue mission around Warwick Road in Carlisle. Liz Truss, the environment secretary, is about to make a statement in the Commons about the floods. There will be a response from Kerry McCarthy, her Labour shadow, and then MPs will ask questions for about an hour. I’m Andrew Sparrow and I’ve taken over from Matthew Weaver, who has been writing the blog until now, to cover the statement. Here’s a roundup of where things currently stand: The body of a man has been found in the swollen river Kent, Kendal. Police searched the river after reports that an elderly man had fallen in the water. The government will fully reimburse councils for the costs of dealing with flooding, the prime minister has said. Compensation will be offered under the Bellwin scheme, he explained. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for further rain on Thursday for south-west Scotland and parts of Cumbria. Record river levels have been recorded in Keswick, Appleby and Kendal. Environment secretary Liz Truss says the government will “learn the lessons” from the response to the floods. She will set out “futher support” to flood-hit communities in a statement to the Commons at 3.30pm. David Cameron is to visit areas worst hit by Storm Desmond. On Monday morning he chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee. Power has been restored to almost all of the 60,000 homes cut off over the weekend. Cumberland Royal Infirmary in Carlisle is running on a generator, while the University of Lancaster has closed for the rest of the term. Almost 3,000 homes in the north-west are still without power. Collapsed and dangerous bridges have caused widespread disruption and continued road closures in Cumbria. The West Coast mainline between Carlisle and Scotland will remain closed for several days after extensive flooding on the line. A driver in Kelso in the Scottish Borders has been charged after appearing to ignore “road closed” signs before driving into floodwater and being carried down a river in her car. Nearly 50 severe flood warnings – indicating risk to life – remain in place in north-west England. I’m handing over the blog now to Andrew Sparrow to cover Liz Truss’s statement in the Commons and possibly Cameron’s visit to the north-west. A driver in Kelso in the Scottish Borders has been charged after appearing to ignore “road closed” signs before driving into floodwater and being carried down a river in her car. The woman had been driving along the A699 into Kelso in the Scottish Borders on Sunday morning when her car became submerged in water and was carried down the river Tweed. The fire service was called and the woman was rescued from the vehicle, which had become wedged between trees 100 metres from dry land. She had passed a road closed sign and two barriers before entering the water, police said. Inspector John Reid said: “We’d like to remind all road users that road closures are in place for a reason. Please do not risk your safety by ignoring these, or the safety of the emergency crews who will be risking their life to help you.” A table of Cumbria police’s estimate for the number homes flooded in the county has a curious anomaly. It shows that the “most likely scenario” for the number of homes flooded in Kendal is 1,376, which is several hundred more homes than the figure it gives for the “reasonable worst case number of properties flooded”. As the force says: “The public are reminded that the figure is only a prediction.” Record water levels have been recorded in Keswick, Appleby and Kendal confirming residents’ claims that this weekend’s floods were worse than in 2009. Richard Murphy, the tax campaigner and economic adviser to opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, has been chipping in on the subject of flood defences. He says the only way you can pay for flood defences is by running up a deficit as he suggested in the idea of People’s Quantitative Easing. That and planting trees in upland areas. Josh Halliday is in Penrith where they are stocking up on supplies in case of further rain. Some residents in Keswick and Cockermouth say the damage done by Storm Desmond is even worse than the floods in 2009, writes Fred Searle. Paul Protano, the owner of Luca’s Restaurant on the bank of river Greta in Keswick, said: ‘I’m totally flooded and closed for the foreseeable future. ‘The water was halfway up the walls, over the table tops. Fridges over, freezer over, completely gutted. There’s an inch of mud right through the car park. It’s terrible. ‘This is the third time it’s happened. I was flooded in 2005 a small amount, then in 2009 I was completely closed for 10 months. The water didn’t come as high in 2009. It came higher this time … I’m right opposite the river.’ Protano, who lives in the first floor above his restaurant, is hoping not to have to move out. The water has now drained away, leaving an inch of mud and silt coating the floors, but he still has electricity. As long as he can get the heating to work again, he is hoping to stay in his home. Jason Dodson, the owner of Ravensworth House B&amp;B, said parks in Keswick have been badly hit. He said: “The waters have penetrated almost everywhere. The two main parks in the town, Upper and Lower Fitz Park, are absolutely devastated. They’re real magnets for tourists and locals … Now they’re completely covered in silt from one end to the other.” “It’s still fairly accessible. The problem, really, is the deluge after. Eight static caravans were washed away with two camping pods. They came down and took one of the bridges out and ended up at the side of the park.” Meanwhile in nearby Cockermouth, Mark Soulby, the landlord of a pub on the bank of river Derwent, said: “We were actually in Scunthorpe when the flooding hit. But when we drove back into Cockermouth, it was like a war zone. “The garage of our house on St Leonard’s Lane was completely flattened. But we can’t get to our house at the moment because the water’s too high. It’s in the part of Cockermouth that was most badly hit.” The Met Office has published computer generated animation showing how record levels of rain fell over north-west England in a 24-hour period over the weekend. Cumbria police estimate that up to 6,425 properties have been flooded across the county. The worst hit area is Carlisle where an estimated 3,500 homes are flooded. The government will fully reimburse councils for the costs of dealing with flooding, the prime minister has said. Speaking at the De Ferrers Academy in Burton, Staffordshire, Cameron said there were some levels of rainfall that it was “extremely hard” to protect against. Cameron said: “First of all our hearts must go out to families who have been driven out of their homes by flood water, many of whom will have had a very worrying 48 hours stuck in their homes and I think the emergency services have done a brilliant job. “What we must do now is make sure everything is done to help in this vital phase of dealing with the floods. “Then there’s the vital recovery phase where we need to try and help people get their insurance claims and help people get back into their homes. “We should sit down again with the Environment Agency and look at the flood schemes that have been built, look at the ones that are planned… and ask what can we do, what’s in the plan for the future and how does that need to change.” He added that the environment secretary, Liz Truss, will announce later today that the Bellwin scheme will “kick in”. He said: “That’s the scheme where central government reimburses local authorities for their costs in dealing with floods.” The Bellwin scheme was previously used to help with the clear up from widespread flooding in southern England in 2013-14. Greenpeace UK climate campaigner Pat Venditti has some advice for David Cameron as the prime minister travels to areas worst hit by the floods. “The science is clear. Rising temperatures are expected to bring heavier rainfalls to the UK, which in turn are likely to increase flood risks right across the country. The percentage points and sub-clauses ministers will be haggling over in Paris may seem far removed from the everyday reality of people in Britain, yet their consequences will be felt by thousands of UK people too. If Cameron is serious about protecting people’s security, homes and businesses from future floods, there are two things he can do right now: work hard for a strong climate deal in Paris and provide adequate funding for flood protections back home.” The Environment Agency still has 46 severe flood warnings in place for the north-west and a further 32 flood warnings for the north-west, north-east and Wales. It is urging communities in these areas and parts of the Midlands to remain vigilant. There remains ongoing flooding across Cumbria and parts of Lancashire. Severe flood warnings remain in place for the river Greta at Keswick, river Cocker in Cockermouth and river Eden at Appleby. Further flood warnings will be issued as necessary. Disruption from flooding is expected to continue today along the river Severn, through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. There is also a flood risk along the river Dee in Cheshire and the river Ouse, in York, over the coming days as it responds to further rainfall. Fire crews and the Environment Agency are pumping water from homes in St Michael’s, Lancashire. Almost 3,000 homes in Cumbria and Lancashire are still without power, according to Electricity North West. In its latest update it said: Engineers from Electricity North West are working hard in extremely difficult conditions to restore the remaining 2,657 properties in Cumbria and 300 in Lancaster and surrounding areas. Around 60,000 customers have been restored since Storm Desmond hit the region on Saturday, 55,000 of which in Lancaster after floodwater breached flood defences at the main substation. The Environment Agency has put together a battle-style map of how it has deployed resources from around England to help tackle the floods in Cumbria and Lancashire. The Guardian’s North of England editor Helen Pidd has been talking to residents in Cockermouth trying to salvage what they can from flooded homes. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for further rain on Thursday for south-west Scotland and parts of Cumbria. Spending on flood defences in England is due to fall by 14% this year, PA reminds us. The government has set aside £695m for dealing with flooding and erosion in 2015-16. This is £116m less than in 2014-15, according to figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and is the biggest year-on-year fall since 2011-12. Day-to-day government spending on flood prevention has gone up and down over the past decade. Funding tends to increase the year after the UK has suffered periods of heavy flooding. Following the floods of summer 2007, which caused widespread damage in Yorkshire, the Midlands and south-west England, annual spending rose from £584m to £647m. The year after the floods of winter 2013, investment jumped from £621m to £811m. Part of the 14% drop in funding for this year can be explained by spending returning to its long-term average following the 2014-15 peak. Day-to-day spending on flood defences has yet to be confirmed for the period from 2016-17 onwards. A programme of investment totalling £2.3bn has been announced for the six years from 2015 to 2021, however. Some £3.4bn was spent by central government on tackling floods and erosion in England from 2010 to 2015 – a slight increase on the £3.2bn spent in the previous five years. Record rain, flooded homes, evacuations, power cuts, Red Cross centres, mobilised soldiers and emergency Cobra committee meetings: this is what climate change looks like for the UK, writes Damian Carrington. Flooding is the nation’s number one threat from global warming: five million homes are already at risk, and the number is rising as temperature rises. Just as after the severe floods of the winter of 2013-14, David Cameron has pledged to do all he can to help the many thousands of people affected. But he is treating the symptoms, not the cause. Since Cameron became prime minister, the government has ignored one warning after another and overseen serious under-investment in flood defences. After taking office in 2010, annual funding for flood defences was slashed by 27%. When heavy summer flooding hit in 2012, I revealed that almost 300 planned flood defences had not been built due to the cuts. Global warming means weather records are more likely to be broken and the wettest winter for 250 years in 2013-14 caused huge floods. At that point I revealed that flood-stricken communities, including those visited by Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, had been left without planned defences following funding cuts. Undelivered defences also included schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The Thames valley also saw flooding, but planned defences had been delayed and downsized. The current flooding across Cumbria includes places where new flood defences have actually been built, but the extraordinary downpour overwhelmed them. Nonetheless, the defences delayed the flooding, allowing vital time to prepare and evacuate those most at risk. More downpours are inevitable, so imagine the impact on places where defences have not been upgraded or funding for maintenance is not sufficient. The government has been warned many times. The Pitt Review after the 2007 floods concluded much more funding was needed. The surge in funding under Labour was halted by the coalition in 2010. In 2012, the government’s own research showed increased flooding is the greatest threat posed by climate change in England. The government’s own climate change advisers then told ministers there was a £500m hole in their flood defence plans, even to just keep pace with the rising risk driven by climate change. The shortfall would result in £3bn of damages, the Committee on Climate Change said. Adapting to climate change, principally flooding, is the responsibility of the environment department. But in May 2013, under then environment secretary Owen Paterson, the number of officials working on the national adaptation programme fell from 38 to six. In November 2014, a damning report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found the risk of flooding was indeed rising as a result of government funding cuts. Furthermore, half the nation’s flood defences had been left with “minimal” maintenance, according to the spending watchdog. The NAO also contradicted Cameron’s claim that his government was spending more than ever before on flood defences. Funding had fallen by 10% in real terms, said the NAO, when £270m of one-off emergency funding after the 2013-14 floods was excluded. Spending on maintenance had fallen by 6% in real terms in the five years of the coalition, the NAO said. Flood defences are big ticket items and hard to fund when the nation’s finances are tight. But not finding the money is a clear false economy. The NAO report said every £1 spent on flood defences prevented almost £10 in damage. It noted that Cameron’s £270m bailout was a poor substitute for sustained spending: “Ad-hoc emergency spending is less good value than sustained maintenance.” Cameron is set to visit Cumbria and will see the immediate devastation wrought by Storm Desmond. What he won’t be around to see is the months and years of anguish caused by floods: precious belongings lost forever by sewage-tainted waters, months in temporary accommodation and feelings of panic at every future rainstorm rattling the windows. Cumbria’s flooding struck at the halfway point of the crucial two-week UN climate summit in Paris. Cameron’s statement at its opening contrasts starkly with his government’s long record of cuts and delays to flood defence spending. Cameron told his fellow world leaders: “What I’m saying is that instead of making excuses tomorrow to our children and grandchildren, we should be taking action against climate change today.” For the UK, today’s action means fighting floods. A Just Giving appeal to help families in Cumbria hit by the flooding has raised almost £300,000, writes Fred Searle. The appeal was launched by the Cumbria Community Foundation, which donated £50,000 of its own resources to kickstart the initiative. “It’s really heartwarming to see how much social media has picked up on this,” said the foundation’s communications officer Annalee Holliday. The campaign group 38 Degrees has also agreed to publicise the appeal and contribute up to £100,000, depending on the number of donations they receive. The appeal, which was launched at 8pm on Saturday night with a target of £1m, hit the £100,000 mark within 24 hours. Donations will be used to finance the clean-up operation, emergency repairs, clothing, food and drink, heating, childcare equipment and basic furniture. “We’re prioritising families with people over 70 or those with children,” said Holliday. She added: “We’re helping individuals and families, but we will also be supporting groups who offer support, advice and counselling to citizens, for example Citizens Advice and food banks. “At the moment we’re giving grants of £500 to £1,000, so it won’t go a long way, but it will offer immediate support. We’ve already starting to receive applications for funding so we’re hoping to make the first awards this week.” Here’s video of the environment secretary, Liz Truss, promising that lessons will be learned from the response to the floods. The Liberal Democrats have urged the government to apply for a grant from the EU’s Solidarity Fund to help support communities hit by the floods. When the 2007 floods hit, the UK was granted £134m from the fund, the party pointed out. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: “Those affected need all the help they can get, which is why I am urging the government to urgently look at applying for European solidarity funding. “This funding could provide a lifeline for local authorities, helping them pay for clean-up costs and rebuilding vital infrastructure. It would be wrong to turn it down for political reasons.” Official forecasts may underestimate the risks of flooding, Downing Street suggested this morning, writes Andrew Sparrow on the Politics Live blog. The prime minister’s spokeswoman told journalists that David Cameron raised the issue at this morning’s meeting of the Cobra emergency committee and asked whether there needs to be “adjustments” in relation to flood planning in the light of events over the weekend. She said: ‘There was an agreement that the government should look again at the level of rainfall we have seen in the floods, and how that tallies with the flood defences.’ As an example, she said that in 2005 in Carlisle the flooding peaked at a level 0.5 metres above the previous record, which dated back to 1853. But this weekend flooding in the town peaked at a level around 0.5 metres above the height reached in 2005, she said. This morning’s Cobra meeting lasted for around an hour and it also included a discussion of what needed to be done today, to help people get into their homes and to address transport and power problems, and what needed to be done in the future to get communities ‘back on their feet’, the spokeswoman said. Those contributing included officials from the Met Office, who briefed ministers on further flood warnings, and chief constables from the affected areas. More than 360 people have been rescued from their homes in the Warwick Road area of Carlisle, and more continue to be evacuated, according to Steve Janes from West Midlands fire service who is helping out with the operation. Speaking to the BBC’s Danny Savage he said: “If you need rescuing let us know and we’ll do what we can to help you.” The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, says the impact of Storm Desmond should provide an impetus to national and local authorities to help tackle climate change. In a statement she said: “Any individual event is of course weather, not climate change, but we know that scientists say that climate change will mean more frequent and higher level occurrences of extreme weather. The extraordinary Storm Desmond is a reminder that climate change is not something that will affect the distant future in far-off places, but an already existing reality that is impacting on all of our lives. “Storm Desmond also brings into serious question government plans to cut funding for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and its failure to commit to enhancing the spending for maintenance of flood defences, when this is so clearly needed. “Cumbria county council should be reconsidering the call from fossil fuel divestment campaigns to take the £108m it had invested in 2013-14 in fossil fuels into investments that tackle climate change, rather than exacerbate it.” Here’s a roundup of where things currently stand: The body of a man has been found in the swollen river Kent, Kendal. Police searched the river after reports that an elderly man had fallen in the water. Environment secretary Liz Truss says the government will “learn the lessons” from the response to the floods. She will set out “futher support” to flood-hit communities in a statement to the Commons at 3.30pm. David Cameron is to visit areas worst hit by Storm Desmond. On Monday morning he chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee. Power has been restored to almost all of the 60,000 homes cut off over the weekend. Cumberland Royal Infirmary in Carlisle is running on a generator, while the University of Lancaster has closed for the rest of the term. Collapsed and dangerous bridges have caused widespread disruption and continued road closures in Cumbria. The West Coast mainline between Carlisle and Scotland will remain closed for several days after extensive flooding on the line. Nearly 50 severe flood warnings – indicating risk to life – remain in place in north-west England. Sheila Brown, Cockermouth’s town clerk, was in her office in the town hall on Monday morning trying to coordinate clean-up efforts at local council properties. “There’s a massive clean-up operation going ahead now,” Brown told Damien Gayle. “They are cleaning up the road and the pavements, and people are coming down now to assess the damage.” Waters flooded the Cockermouth town hall basement and the tourist information centre near Main Street, Brown said. She lives in nearby Camerton and her home had escaped the flooding, although parts of that town were also flooded. “I’m surprised the water has gone down so quickly,” Brown said. “Main Street is still closed but shopkeepers can get access to their premises to see what damage there is this morning.” She said she saw only one or two people out in the streets this morning as she made her way into work. The Gote, a residential area to the north of the town which is flanked on two sides by the river Derwent, was the worst affected area and access to the area by car has been restricted. Brown’s daughter was hosting her boyfriend’s parents after their home on Derwentside Gardens was flooded. It was clear that some people expect the clean-up operation to continue for some time. “There’s lots of people looking for housing to rent in the short term,” Brown said. Some properties had been without electricity now for 36 hours, she added. However, conditions were not as bad as when devastating floods swept through Cockermouth in 2009, Brown said. Then water levels had reached up to four feet inside buildings, now they were more like 18 inches. “Everyone is just trying to be positive, we’re quite a resilient community,” Brown said. Troops from the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, based in Weeton Barracks near Preston, continue to help with the rescue and clean-up operation in Carlisle. A body has been found in the search of the river Kent, Kendal, writes Mike Glover. Police were called at 10.01am on Sunday to reports that an elderly man had fallen in the water. Officers, along with the underwater search team, are working to recover the body which has been located in the Kendal area. The environment secretary, Liz Truss, is due to make that statement to the Commons at 3.30pm. A quick telephone survey of a dozen businesses on Cockermouth’s Main Street yielded no answer, writes Damien Gayle. Six rang out, while five had engaged tones and one a single drone, suggesting that telephone connections to those premises were out of order. This map shows the areas worst hit by the floods. Collapsed and dangerous bridges, main roads washed away and deluged railways meant chaos continued to turn lives upside down in the Lake District on Monday, writes Mike Glover in Kendal. As the waters receded Lancashire and Cumbria began to count the cost of the damage caused by Storm Desmond, which tore through the region at the weekend. Typical was Kendal, a town of 30,000 people at the gateway to the Lakes. It is built on the river Kent, England’s fastest flowing river, which burst its banks, consuming homes and businesses. All five bridges were closed as structural engineers checked their safety. One, Miller Bridge, is of particular concern. Police put up rush-hour blockades to stop commuters trying to resume normal working life, effectively trapping residents in the town. Motorists are being asked not to travel on the A591 into Kendal due to flood water on the road. The road is closed from the Brettargh Holt roundabout. The A591 between Kendal and Windermere was open. Further north the A591 is the main route linking north, central and southern Lakes. It collapsed into a beck north of Grasmere, effectively splitting Cumbria in two. The number of roads falling into the fast-flowing streams and becks were growing by the hour. Schools were closed throughout the region, either because they were flooded, lost power or staff and pupils couldn’t get through. Environment secretary Liz Truss says the government will “learn the lessons” from the response to the floods. Speaking to BBC News she said she will outline “further support” to flood-hit communities in the Commons this afternoon. “We will do what we can to support those communities,” she said. Challenged on the failure of flood defences, she said: “Across the north of England 8,000 homes were protected by our flood defences, and even in the cases where some of the defences were overtopped ... it delayed the flood so it gave us an opportunity to evacuate and protect people and reduce the impact of those floods. “But I fully understand what a devastating impact it was. Of course we will learn the lessons that we can from this unprecedented event.” Readers have been submitting images of Storm Desmond flood scenes to GuardianWitness. Duncan shared this image of Cockermouth. And here’s keltyboy’s image of Dunkeld in Perthshire. Electricity North West appear to have tweeted too soon about power being restored to homes in Lancaster. In a statement it said 300 homes in Lancaster, Morecambe and the surrounding area remain cut off. In a statement it also said 2,657 properties remain without power in Cumbria. Damien Gayle has been talking to Colin Graham, owner of an antiques shop that perches on a bridge over the Cocker, who lost all his stock in the town’s 2009 flood. Flood defences had held, he said, although at the height of the inundation, water spilled over the tops of the walls and flowed into the town’s Main Street. Asked about the situation in the town, he said: “Wet is the ultimate word, I think. Miserable, wet; but having said that, the flood defences did hold to a degree. Had they not held it would have been a lot, lot worse, but they were sufficient for the amount of rain that was coming down. “I’m one of the luckiest shopkeepers in town. Main Street got it bad, the water’s just been dispelled overnight.” Graham said the flooding started on Saturday night and into Sunday morning, as torrential rain swelled the Cocker to the tops of the flood defences. “About three o’clock it was lapping the bridge tops and ready to burst over the barriers,” he said. “And then it just came. But as I said, had it not been for the barriers, it would have been a lot, lot worse. “Main Street’s seriously affected and an area called the Gote. No one is allowed down there, it’s all cordoned off and that would get it horrendously, but I’ve not seen it so I can’t comment on that.” After an initial flurry of activity on Sunday, the numbers of emergency workers in the town had fallen on Monday morning. “You couldn’t stir for them [on Sunday],” Graham said. “They were pumping out, making sure everybody was safe. The river’s gone down, it must have gone down 12ft, and it’s still high. I think we are forecast more rain this morning.” Dramatic video footage shows the impact of the floods. Helicopter footage of the flooded river Eden captures the scene in Armathwaite. Mobile phone footage from Warwick Bridge, Carlisle, shows houses half submerged in water. The West Coast mainline north between Carlisle and Glasgow will remain closed for several days after eight feet of water flooded the railway, according to Network Rail. In a statement it said: The depth of the water has reached its peak, but it is not expected to clear until Tuesday. A full assessment of the damage will take place as soon as the water recedes and everything done to reopen the railway as quickly as possible. A number of safety-critical cabinets, which house complex electrical equipment, are currently submerged and will have to be rebuilt once it is safe to do so. Railway lines in the region are being checked by trains manned by engineers with chainsaws and equipment to remove fallen trees and make repairs. Martin Frobisher, Network Rail’s route managing director, said: “North of Carlisle station, we have to wait for eight feet of water to recede before we can carry out extensive safety checks and repairs – including rebuilding a host of complex electrical and signalling equipment which is currently underwater. This, coupled with dozens of other sites which have been flooded or damaged, means we have a lot of work to do to ensure the railway is safe and able to be used.” Power has been restored to all the homes in Lancaster, according Electricity North West. Earlier the company said it was working to restore power to almost 5,000 homes in the city. David Cameron is to visit affected areas after chairing a meeting of the government’s emergency committee. The government is also due to make a statement in parliament about the floods. The Eden Bridge on the old A66 near Temple Sowerby has been closed because of flood damage. Images of the bridge showed water levels almost up to the road. Police have urged the public not to walk or drive across any bridges that are under water. As the water subsides the bridges will be checked by highway engineers and declared safe before they can be used, Cumbria police said. Lifeboats are being deployed to the Warwick Road area of Carlisle to help evacuate people from their homes. Cumbria police sent out this alert: In the next 15 minutes boats from the RNLI will be going up and down Warwick Road using loudspeakers to try and communicate with any residents that need evacuation from their properties. If residents who are in need of evacuation could make themselves available to the RNLI boats they can be safely evacuated from their homes. If you’ve been affected by the flooding, GuardianWitness would like to hear from you. Has your community been flooded? Are you without power or water? Are you unable to go to work, or are your children off school? You can share your videos and images of your experience via GuardianWitness. Electricity North West appears to have made some progress restoring power to homes in the north-west but more than 7,400 homes remain cut off. Steve Cox, Electricity North West’s incident manager, said: “While we still have a significant amount of work to do to fully repair the substation, our teams have worked round the clock and done enough to restore power to a large number of customers earlier than expected. “Rather than wait any longer for the full repair and restoration of the site, we have chosen to provide power at the earliest opportunity.” Cox told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that power had been restored to the Lancaster General hospital but the Cumberland Royal Infirmary in Carlisle is currently being powered by a generator. The A69 road in Cumbria between Brampton and the M6 motorway remains closed because of flooding from the river Eden at Warwick Bridge. But the Highways Agency, which insists on calling drivers “customers”, has announced that A66 between Keswick and Cockermouth has reopened. Sir James Bevan, the new chief executive of the Environment Agency, said his organisation will review its response to the floods. But speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he pointed out that rain levels over the weekend were unprecedented and that the EA could “never completely protect all communities”. He said: “We will review what happened and learn the lessons for the future.” He added: “You can never prevent all flooding. That’s why we prefer to talk about managing the risk.” He insisted the EA does have enough resources to deal with flood defences, but that it would have to make efficiency savings. “We have that confirmed capital investment of £2.3bn,” Bevan said. Asked about criticism by the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, that the EA had shelved hundreds of flood-defence schemes, Bevan said: “We are keen to prioritise. We can’t do them all simultaneously.” Anger is mounting at the failure of flood defences. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Cumbria county council’s leader, Stewart Young, said: “There does need to be an investigation into the flood defences. “I will be talking to our local MPs later today and if the Environment Agency needs to revisit them then that’s what’s going to have to happen because we can’t continue to have events like this in Cumbria – we just won’t be able to cope.” Environmental campaigner George Monbiot wants to see more discussion on the causes of the flooding. Electricity North West said 40,000 homes in its region should have power restored by Monday evening. In a statement it said: “Using generators from across the UK, engineers have restored power to 11,000 homes in Lancaster and aim to restore another 4,000 later this morning. “Engineers are working round the clock in shifts to repair damage caused to the area’s main substation which flooded on Saturday night. The remaining 40,000 properties should be restored by re-energising the substation by Monday evening.” The statement said that 2,685 properties in Cumbria remained without power because of 11 separate faults caused by flooding, with flood water preventing engineers from getting to the sites to carry out repairs. Electricity North West’s incident manager, Steve Cox, said: “We’ve had engineers on boats working with the emergency services to try and access faults in Cumbria, and we’ve seen sterling efforts from teams in Lancaster to repair the damaged substation, while others connect generators to speed up restoration to customers.” Welcome to live coverage of the aftermath of the flooding caused by Storm Desmond. Here’s a roundup of how things currently stand: The army has been deployed to help flood-hit communities in the north of England after Storm Desmond left at least 60,000 homes without power and many lacking clean water, as whole communities were cut off. Nearly 50 severe flood warnings – indicating risk to life – remain in place in north-west England. More than 2,500 homes in Carlisle remain flooded as local hospitals have been forced to cancel all but essential services. Lancaster University has cancelled teaching for the rest of term after losing power across much of the campus. It said staff and students should stay at home due to the lack of heat and power at the university. David Cameron is to chair a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee on Monday to assess the response to the floods. He said: “I would like to pay a huge tribute to all those emergency workers and troops who have worked tirelessly to respond to this weekend’s events.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, called on the government to provide additional funding for flood repairs. Farron, whose Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency has been badly hit by the floods, said: “That rhetoric [on the northern powerhouse] must now be backed up by action – it is essential that areas in Cumbria which have been hit by flooding are now given the resources they need to rebuild."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jul/13/uk-takes-ownership-of-german-plutonium","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-13T16:29:29Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear authority takes ownership of German plutonium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/13/uk-takes-ownership-of-german-plutonium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jul/13/uk-takes-ownership-of-german-plutonium","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear authority takes ownership of German plutonium","bodyText":"Britain risks being turned into a \"nuclear laundry\" by taking ownership of German plutonium in return for cash, the government was warned on Friday. The move came along with confirmation that ministers were moving towards a controversial decision to build a new mixed oxide fuel (MOX) plant despite having just agreed to close an existing one which lost millions of pounds. Britain has the largest stockpile of plutonium in the world but has taken permanent control of a further 4 tonnes under a deal with German nuclear power companies. Charles Hendry, the energy minister, said the agreement reduced the need to transport plutonium back to the continent and would improve Britain's overall security. \"The management of plutonium brings many challenges but also opportunities to work with our European partners. This deal provides a new commercial opportunity for the UK that will bring significant financial benefits.\" The Department of Energy and Climate Change declined to put a value on the financial benefits of the deal and played down the quantity of plutonium as \"a relatively small amount\" pointing out the total held in Britain – mainly at Sellafield in Cumbria – was 118 tonnes. But an accompanying statement to the deal with Germany said the government has concluded that for nuclear security reasons the preferred policy for managing the vast majority of civil separated plutonium was reuse. Ministers believe the plutonium should be converted to MOX fuel for use in civil nuclear reactors although the statement elaborated: \"While the UK government believes that it has sufficient information to set out this policy direction, it is not yet sufficient to make a specific decision whether to proceed with procuring a new MOX plant.\" The latest moves – coming at a time when ministers are being accused of bending the subsidy rules to encourage power companies to build a new generation of nuclear plants – was condemned by Greenpeace and other critics. Pete Wilkinson, an independent environmental consultant, said it \"beggared belief\" that ministers were going down this path after losing an estimated £600m from operating an original MOX plant. The facility opened in 2001 was originally designed to produce 120 tonnes of reprocessed fuel annually but by 2007 had only produced 5.2 tonnes in six years up to 2007. \"It just seems we are going back to becoming a nuclear laundry looking after everyone else's unwanted waste. We should be getting rid of this material [plutonium] as quickly and safely as possible in deep burial instead of trying to restart a mega-nuclear future of new plants that will leave a dangerous legacy for generations to come.\" Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace agreed: \"It would be interesting to see the commercial arrangements which justify turning Britain into a nuclear waste dump for plutonium that no-one else wants.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/apr/21/chernobyl-nuclear-power-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-21T11:30:00Z","webTitle":"Unsure about nuclear power?

Here's the five questions you must answer to decide","bodyText":"Containing the elemental forces that rage inside a nuclear reactor is one of the great achievements of science, but losing control, as happened 25 years ago on Tuesday at Chernobyl, is one of its greatest failures. So what to think of nuclear power? People often ask me if I support or oppose the building of new nuclear power stations, presuming I think that because of my job, I'll know the answer. If only it was that easy. Until the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant, I would say I was 51% in favour, on the basis that we need all the low-carbon electricity we can get to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and that I tend to trust scientists having been one. But 51% in favour is a pretty unsatisfactory position - it's 1% off I don't know. Surely I can be more certain than that, I thought. As the debate has raged, not least between my colleagues George Monbiot and John Vidal, it struck me very clearly that this is not an issue that can be resolved with cold facts alone, for the simple reason that many of the facts are not known. And how do you fairly assess the relative importance of political, economic, security, health and engineering factors? The answer, it seems to me, must lie in a series of personal judgements on the critical factors that we all must make for themselves. So I have tried to devise a series of questions which, if you answer based on your own priorities and judgements, should allow you to decide your position on nuclear power. 1. Do you think the global community can prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and, if not, do you think it can prevent a nuclear weapon being used? The existing non-proliferation regime has slowed, but not stopped the spread of nuclear weapons, the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. All recent weapons programmes have been developed under the cover of civilian nuclear power. This link has engendered a culture of secrecy in the nuclear industry that worries some. But perhaps you think there is enough momentum in the current non-proliferation efforts to be more successful. Iran might be considered a test case playing out right now. But even if weapons spread, only their use would cause catastrophe. Do you think that could happen? Would the threat of devastating retaliation prevent the launch of a warhead anywhere in the world? 2. Is the hazard of climate change greater than that posed by a nuclear disaster? This is perhaps the toughest question as the brutal truth is that no-one knows the long-term medical consequences of low-dose radiation exposure. Part of that is because identifying small effects over long periods, in the midst of myriad confounding factors, is incredibly hard. Part of it is the shameful lack of resources for those who wished to study the long term effects of Chernobyl. The threat posed by climate change, frequently to the most vulnerable in the world, is large, clear and very likely to come to pass without action. The risk of a nuclear catastrophe is low: it took an earthquake and tsunami of Biblical size to derail Fukushima. But it exists over a very long period of time - decades for operations, centuries or more for waste. Its impact on wellbeing is largely unknown: should the precautionary principle apply or is the danger of global warming too great? 3. Is global political will too weak to create a low-carbon energy future that does not involve nuclear power and in time to avert climate chaos? If existing nuclear power stations were closed down today, their 13% (and falling) of global electricity generation would almost certainly be replaced by dirty coal, which dumps both carbon and radioactive elements into the atmosphere. But if they were phased out, could renewable energy, such as hydroelectricity, wind and solar take up the slack? Renewables already have a heavy burden to bear, replacing large loads of coal and gas. But they are no slower to develop than most alternatives and almost certainly faster than nuclear. Nuclear power is backed by huge companies and states, meaning they heavily outgun smaller, newer renewables companies in lobbying firepower. Crucially, would investment in new nuclear power stations squeeze out investment in renewables? Another factor to consider is that nuclear power is a mature technology. Renewables are less mature, but offer more growth potential as their cost rapidly falls. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) - completely unproven at commercial scale - offers another alternative. Consider also the fact that electricity demand will rise, but can be slowed by better and highly cost-effective energy efficiency measures. So, in a way, this question asks whether political energy is a renewable resource - i.e. will effort expended on building new nuclear power stations mean less effort is available for alternatives? 4. Is nuclear power vital to ensuring the security of energy supply? Our civilisation depends, in much of the world, on energy. Nuclear power offers large amounts of electricity, and is not available only intermittently like some renewables. That steady supply is very useful but of course if the reactors have to be shut down, they leave a very a big gap to fill. Renewables are intermittent and continent-scale grids (which are starting to be built) and better storage will be needed to balance supplies. But renewables can be distributed more widely and are more resilient to accidents or engineering problems. CCS-enabled coal or gas plants could provide baseload. Lastly, nuclear power is not truly renewable, and for nations without their own uranium deposits, ensuring access to the fuel is an issue. The sun will always shine and the wind will always blow somewhere. 5. Can the full costs of nuclear truly be calculated? Nuclear can, in some perfectly reasonable analyses, appear fairly affordable if not \"too cheap to meter\". But that usually assumes that the technical problems of the past have been solved in the latest plant designs, which are largely untested at commercial scale. Do you believe engineers have abolished the vast cost overruns of existing generations of reactors? Will the new reactors prevent the accidents, large and small, that pile on costs? Will the temptation to operate plants well beyond their initial design lifetimes be resisted in the future? An even bigger question is the vast cost of decommissioning and waste disposal. Fully half the budget of UK's department of energy and climate change will be spent next year on clearing up and storing past waste. And nowhere in the world has a long term disposal solution been implemented. Under current UK plans, it will be at least a century before the radioactive waste from the new reactors planned will be permanently disposed of. So, do you think these costs will mount to the extent that nuclear becomes expensive compared to other options? The cost of renewables is clearer and there's no waste to deal with. So those are the questions I have arrived at. If you have answered yes to all or most of them, you are in favour of nuclear power: if you answered no to most, you oppose it. As for me, I find myself giving a clear no to questions 1, 4 and 5, a narrow no to question 3 and a yes to question 2. Which makes me pretty firmly against nuclear power and feeling better about knowing my own mind. Let me know how you get on and I'd very much like ideas about how the questions can be improved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/28/nuclear-lobbyists-senior-civil-servants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-28T15:03:38Z","webTitle":"Nuclear lobbyists wined and dined senior civil servants, documents show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/28/nuclear-lobbyists-senior-civil-servants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/28/nuclear-lobbyists-senior-civil-servants","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear lobbyists wined and dined senior civil servants, documents show","bodyText":"Senior civil servants responsible for ensuring the building of the UK's new fleet of nuclear power stations have been extensively wined and dined by nuclear industry lobbyists, documents released under freedom of information reveal. A hospitality register (.zip) released by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) show that the three most senior officials at the Office for Nuclear Development (OND) have received hospitality from nuclear industry representatives on dozens of occasions since the office's formation in September 2009. Many of the meetings have taken place at some of London's most luxurious restaurants, hotels and private members' clubs. Mark Higson, the OND's chief executive, received his first hospitality in the role just a few weeks after the office's creation with a dinner at the Lancaster hotel in Kensington hosted by Westinghouse, the US nuclear plant construction company, and the Nuclear Industry Association. In the intervening period up to last month, Higson and his colleagues Hergen Haye and Stephen de Souza separately accepted hospitality from a range of companies with a vested interest in the nuclear industry, including Babcock, EDF, Areva, and GE Hitachi, as well as a range of industry consultants and trade associations. In the year between June 2010 and June 2011, Higson received hospitality on four separate occasions from KPMG, the global financial consultants. The hospitality included two dinners at the five-star Berkeley hotel, which hosts Marcus Wareing's two-Michelin star restaurant where the tasting menu costs £98 a person. The period covered a time when KPMG was working for companies with a potential key stake interest in the UK's nuclear industry, as well as advising investors in the nuclear industry. In July 2010, KPMG published a report commissioned by RWE npower which said that unless the government raised the carbon \"floor price\", large utility companies would not deem it economic to invest in the UK's new nuclear sector. Other venues for hospitality enjoyed by the OND's senior officials include the Reform Club, the Cavalry and Guards Club, the Royal Horseguards hotel, the RAC Club, Roux at Parliament Square, the Naval &amp; Military Club, 1 Lombard Street and the Cinnamon Club . In 2008, Higson was among the civil servants criticised by Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes, for \"entirely inappropriate behaviour\" after the Independent of Sunday reported that civil servants working in the nuclear consultations and liabilities unit at the now disbanded Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform had enjoyed hospitality paid for by nuclear industry representatives at venues such as the Ritz, Royal Ascot and the Café Royale. At the time, Higson headed the unit. According to its website , the OND provides \"advice to ministers on regulatory decisions\" and \"focuses on removing potential barriers to investment, and signals clearly to the industry the serious intent of the government to push forward nuclear new build\". It adds that it is \"facilitating new nuclear investment in the UK, by enabling new nuclear to make the fullest contribution it is capable of, with no public subsidy, and with unnecessary obstacles removed\". A Decc spokesman told the Guardian: \"The government has made it clear that nuclear should be part of the UK's energy mix. Decc officials work closely with industry to bring on new investment in nuclear as well as renewables and oil and gas. All hospitality is accepted in line with Cabinet Office policy.\" Asked why so many of the meetings take place at such luxurious venues, the Decc spokesman said: \"Industry meetings are hosted at our offices as well as at external events. The choice of location for external events is a matter for the hosting organisations.\" He added that such meetings are considered to be \"informal\" and that, as a result, minutes of conversations are not kept by the department. Ministers are not routinely informed of the meetings, he said, as all hospitality is recorded in accordance with Cabinet Office policy. Craig Bennett, the director of policy and campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said: \"It is the worst kept secret in Whitehall that the energy bill due out on Thursday is almost entirely being done to rig the market in favour of nuclear power. The so-called contracts for difference are all about providing not-so-hidden subsidies for nuclear. What the taxpayer should be asking is whether this succession of lavish hospitality has resulted in lavish subsidies for nuclear.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jun/26/george-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-26T20:12:21Z","webTitle":"George Osborne: master of the game of divisive politics | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/george-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/george-osborne","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne: master of the game of divisive politics","bodyText":"He's the part-time chancellor, say Labour, but even his most vicious critics would not deny that George Osborne is a full-time politician. He proved that again on Wednesday, when he presented a spending review shot through with politics, from first croaky breath to last. His primary task was the one he toiled hardest to conceal. His mission, in American parlance, was to put lipstick on a pig, to prettify what remains a dire situation in the public finances. Recall that 2013 was meant to be the year Osborne would announce the beginning of the end of austerity, as he made cheerful progress towards eradicating the deficit in time for the 2015 election. Indeed that plan was the premise on which the coalition was built. Yet economic growth has been so anaemic, tax revenues still so low, that there is no such end in sight. Instead, the chancellor came to the Commons to announce cuts that will stretch to the far horizon, long after 2015. He did his best to divert attention from this unfortunate truth. He made great play of those departments to be spared the knife. And when, reluctantly, he had to name areas where \"savings\" – never \"cuts\" – will be necessary, he was at pains to accompany every dollop of bitter medicine with a spoonful of sugar. So the Department of Culture, Media and Sport will have its budget slashed by 7%, with capital spending cut by two-thirds, but Osborne preferred to stress a new scheme to restore the site of the Battle of Waterloo (location, incidentally, of the death in the novel Vanity Fair of a character by the name of … George Osborne). He made the same move repeatedly, cutting the budget of the Department of Energy and Climate Change by 8%, but hoping to obscure that with a promise on nuclear power. Defra got whacked by 10%, but worry not, there's to be more money for flood defences. The intention was to wrongfoot and present a Scrooge budget in the language of Santa. The trick worked easiest when the chancellor could speak of health, schools and international aid, those areas whose budgets are circled with a ring of steel first constructed when the Tories were in opposition. Those choices were, and remain, intensely political – a last vestige of the modernisation project of compassionate conservatism, when David Cameron and Osborne sought to reassure the electorate they were the nasty party no longer. That imperative survives, although it did not deny the chancellor all wiggle room. Two choices were notable. First, Osborne showed he is not above stealing from Labour when he pickpocketed Andy Burnham's long-held idea of dipping into NHS funds to pay for social care. This is one of the perils of opposition. Propose a bad idea, and it'll be mocked; propose a good one, and it'll be nicked. Second, the education budget is protected but priorities within the ringfence are telling. There are to be 180 free schools, but the Lib Dems' cherished pupil premium is to have funding frozen in real terms: Osborne has favoured Michael Gove at the expense of Nick Clegg. None of this should obscure the partisan goal of the review: to draw bright, clear battlelines for 2015 – and to put Labour on the wrong side of them. Osborne announced he would exempt the state pension from his cap on welfare spending, implicitly asking: would Labour? The tactic became most obvious in the speech's final stretch, as Osborne put away the nice guy mask and revealed his inner snarl. He proposed changes to social security motivated less by the need to save money than by the urge to show how tough this government could be. From now on, jobseekers will have to sign on every week. Those who can't speak English will have to learn or lose their benefits. Most striking of all, the newly laid off will not be able to claim benefit straight away but have to wait seven days. That may not sound like much, but for those who have just lost a job that paid little, it could be impossible. No wonder the BBC's Robert Peston called it a Wonga budget: there will be plenty who will survive that first week by taking out a loan at usurious rates. Such punitive action will have next to no impact on the deficit. It's all about the politics. Osborne has drawn a line and invited Labour to stand on the other side of it. He wants the Eds – Miliband and Balls – to balk at his proposals so that he can paint Labour as soft on scroungers. Perhaps he will keep coming up with ever more aggressive wheezes until the Eds eventually crack and refuse to follow where he leads. The aim is clear: Osborne hopes to brand the opposition in 2015 the way he branded them on Wednesday – as \"the welfare party\". In this, Osborne demonstrated his understanding of a cardinal rule of politics: you define yourself by your choice of both friends and enemies. He aimed to pose as the friend of doctors, nurses, schoolchildren, the foreign poor, soldiers and spies, all of whom will either see their funding protected or increased. And he was happy to be the enemy of public sector workers, whose \"automatic progression\" pay is to be scrapped, local government, Scotland and, above all, the unemployed. This is divisive politics, no doubt about it. But it's a game few play better than George Osborne."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"theguardian/2012/mar/23/good-to-meet-you-tim-gossling","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-23T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

Japan's tourism agency said the programme, which will begin in April, is expected to cost more than 1bn yen (£10m), equivalent to about 10% of its budget request for next year. Applicants will be asked to outline their travel plans and answer questions about post-disaster tourism in Japan, recently named favourite long-haul country by readers of the Guardian and Observer in the newspapers' annual travel awards. Tokyo won favourite city for the second year in a row. The successful applicants will receive free return air tickets, but must pay for their accommodation and other expenses. Tourism to Japan dropped dramatically after the 11 March disaster, which left almost 20,000 people dead or missing and triggered the worst nuclear accident in the country's history. In April, international visitor numbers stood at 296,000, according to the Japan national tourism agency (JNTO), down 63% on 2010; by August they had recovered to 547,000, down 32% on last year. \"The Asian market has been showing the fastest recovery, with visitors to Japan from south-east Asia having already bounced back into positive growth by month on 2010,\" said Mamoru Kobori, the JNTO's executive director of marketing and promotion. \"Within Europe, the UK is leading the way in picking up the number of visitors to Japan.\" Kobori said the agency had already invited more than 1,000 journalists and travel industry executives in an attempt to reassure the world Japan is a safe destination. \"[We want them] not to just take our word for it, but to come and see for themselves how the Japan of today offers as memorable and diverse a travel experience as ever,\" he said. The agency hopes the programme will boost spending, particularly in regional economies: spending by visitors dropped by 47% in the three months after the disaster compared with last year. Tourism officials concede many international visitors are still deterred by the continuing Fukushima nuclear crisis and the yen's rise to a record high against the dollar. Before the disaster, officials had set a target of attracting 30 million foreign visitors a year, a goal that appears well out of reach, at least for the next few years. If its budget request is approved in March, the agency will start accepting online applications the following month, and select the candidates by early summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/nov/13/eon-lowers-profit-forecast","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-13T16:19:45Z","webTitle":"E.ON lowers 2013 profit forecast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/13/eon-lowers-profit-forecast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/nov/13/eon-lowers-profit-forecast","fields":{"headline":"E.ON lowers 2013 profit forecast","bodyText":"The power company E.ON has lowered its profit outlook for next year, citing economic weakness and structural changes in the energy sector following the decision to phase out nuclear power in Germany.

I carried out a research project that examined how extreme climatic events impact nuclear power plants. Glover, like many other supporters, claims nuclear power can help our fight against climate change: \"Without more nuclear plants there is no chance of this country ridding itself of fossil fuels.\" But I wonder how nuclear power would handle a changing climate. As a result of my research, I hold my breath every time a hurricane approaches a nuclear power plant. Reading incident reports from nuclear power plants has provided no reassurance. I've read about safety doors being left open during a hurricane, communication problems, access roads flooding and, of all things, algae regularly causing reactors to shut down. After I heard about the devastating earthquake in Japan, I immediately thought about the nuclear power plants. I knew the situation was serious when I heard that the site had lost off-site power and that the back-up generators were flooded. No matter how well they build them, nuclear power plants require lots of water. As such, the plants need to be either on the coast or near a large body of water at an inland site. The loss of off-site power commonly happens during storms, particularly at coastal locations. So a strong storm, probably stronger than the historical records used in the estimates for design, could cause flooding that leads to an accident similar to the one we are witnessing. Flooding can be an issue at inland sites as well. So when Glover says \"Climate change should still trump the remote prospect of nuclear calamity\", that prospect is probably far more likely than he believes. And what about the people who live near these plants? Do they feel safe? Actions speak louder than words, and the evacuations trumped any reassurances provided by authorities. The accident isn't over, yet already the blame has been placed on the strong earthquake, without any thought to how a similar situation could happen anywhere. To really learn from mistakes one must look for similarities and not for obvious differences. Chernobyl was blamed on the Soviets and the design of their reactors. Fukushima will be blamed on the sheer scale of the disaster and perhaps the design too. The nuclear industry will address the design issues in some patchwork way and then reassure us that everything will be fine. They'll also claim that new reactors will be safer than the older models at Fukushima: Glover himself says engineers are not \"making it up when they say modern designs are better\". I put a lot of trust in science and the work of scientists, but that trust does not extend to nuclear power. Every time an accident happens, exceptional circumstances get blamed.

Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear − this is a safety warning that appears on the side mirrors of motor vehicles in the US and Canada. While the mirrors give a useful field of view, they make objects appear smaller and therefore further away than they actually are; drivers might make manoeuvres assuming other vehicles are a safe distance behind, when in fact they are much closer. Should we apply a similar warning to the way the NHS is reviewed and challenged? Do Francis and Keogh teach us that the way we review performance risks making some problems appear smaller than they actually are? That's all from us. We'll be back on Monday. Have a great weekend. Claire Burke writes A London hospital is leading the race to find a drug to slow or stop Parkinson’s disease, the London Evening Standard reports. Researchers at the Royal Free believe that reversing the impact of a gene mutation could lead to advances in treating the brain disease. And more than 700 calls have been received by health officials from patients who have been treated with by a health worker who was later diagnosed with hepatitis C, writes Wales Online. Aneurin Bevan university health board, alongside Cwm Taf and Betsi Cadwaladr health boards, are sending letters to around 5,500 women who received gynaecological or obstetric treatment at three Welsh hospitals over the past 18 years who have been identified as possibly being at risk. Sarah Johnson writes As A&amp;E departments attempt to deal with over a million more patients compared to three years ago, a BBC documentary asks whether our emergency care can be cured and takes a look at some of the more radical ways health care professionals are attempting to solve the crisis. BBC One’s Inside Out (due to air on Monday 16 September at 7.30pm) was given access to 10 different A&amp;E departments on the same day, giving a rare day-in-the-life snapshot of A&amp;E services across England. Claire Burke writes Former home secretary Jacqui Smith is to become chair of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS trust, the Birmingham Post reports. She begins her new role in December, when she takes over from Sir Albert Bore, the leader of Birmingham city council. Sarah Johnson writes NHS Scotland is to be more 'open' about mistakes, reports the BBC, after a scandal at NHS Ayrshire and Arran in which the health board withheld more than 40 reports about serious incidents involving patients. The new rules aim to ensure that anyone affected is treated in the same way and lessons are learned across the NHS. Claire Burke writes Richard Sloggett writes for the MHP Health blog about the second wave of data from the friends and family test published last month. He says: The beauty of the test is arguably in its simplicity. By asking one standard question across all providers it makes data collection and benchmarking of performance easier, improving transparency and enabling more informed choice for those with access to the information. It will also allow the system to identify pockets of poor practice and enable more rigorous action in these areas to improve the experience for patients. However, what the first few sets of data show is that, particularly month-to-month, it is very difficult to show any meaningful change – positive or negative – within the parameters of the test itself. As an example, the combined overall score for NHS trusts was 63 in July, which was the same figure as reported in June, with the inpatient score recorded decreasing slightly from 71 to 70. Does this tell us anything?

He concludes: Doctors in Canterbury are clear that HealthPathways is not a cookbook others can simply lift off the shelf and adopt: the communication between hospital specialists and general practitioners that it has forced has been an essential element in its success. But its results have been sufficiently impressive for others in New Zealand and Australia to attempt to replicate it. Sarah Johnson writes There is a sharp rise in GPs quitting CCG board roles, according to GP Online. A total of 51 GPs quit CCG board roles between April and August this year. The figures show a marked acceleration in GPs withdrawing from CCG roles compared with the previous year, with a total of 68 departures recorded in the whole 2012/13 financial year.

While there is much work to be done on demonstrating direct patient benefit, through the examples above, Change Day has demonstrated the passion for improvement is alive and that change is possible.

A report from the health service ombudsman found significant failings in the treatment of the condition, which is caused when the body's immune system overreacts to infection. It also had a story that said children living near nuclear power plants do not have an increased risk of developing leukaemia. The British Journal of Cancer study looked at data on 10,000 children diagnosed under five between 1962 and 2007, and where they lived. And, the Times (subscription) reported that Jeremy Hunt has attacked a “computer says no” NHS culture that stops doctors and nurses sharing life-saving information about patients.

We are regularly told by conventional utility companies, many politicians and commentators that energies such as solar and wind are hopelessly expensive and reliant on enormous subsidy. But this is simply wrong. Renewables have seen such dramatic price falls in the past few years that they are threatening to upset the world as we know it and usher in an almost unprecedented boom in the spread of cheap, clean, home-produced energy. Solar will be the cheapest form of power in many countries within just a few years. In places such as California and Italy it has already reached so-called \"grid parity\". Onshore wind, on a piece of land not constrained by years of planning delays, is already the cheapest form of energy on earth. These are not wild claims – those are figures from General Electric, Citibank and others. Solar PV, the area in which my company operates, is a case in point. Three years ago firms like ours were paying about €3,600 per installed kilowatt of solar capacity on barn roofs in Germany. Today it can be done for just over €1,000 – a staggering 70% fall. That is seriously cheap and will just keep getting cheaper. Thanks to a surge in global production to 60 gWp annually, (enough to supply British households – not offices or factories – with all their electricity) solar power has dropped dramatically in price. But there is more to come. Cambridge IP, a global innovation and intellectual property firm, says there is a surge of interest and R&amp;D into two new forms of solar power which are likely to be available commercially by the end of this decade. Newly built solar plants are already considerably cheaper than new nuclear plants per kilowatt hour of electricity produced and we are almost at the stage where we don't need a guaranteed price (known as a feed-in tariff) because solar energy will compete head on with conventional energy. True, there is an ongoing cost from the German government's previous support for solar, but is much lower than the subsidies pumped by the western world into nuclear, coal, oil and gas over the past decades. It is always amazing how a tax cut announced by George Osborne for North Sea oil and gas industry is greeted as somehow being good for Britain whereas any support for renewables is immediately dubbed a subsidy by the conventional energy companies wedded to their dying business model. A tax cut is a subsidy by another name. And remember the estimated £100bn plus cost to future taxpayers of disposing of Britain's dangerous pile of nuclear waste. And solar is starting to pay its subsidy back. Germany now has more than 30 gigaWatt peak (gWp) of solar plants installed, such that on almost all days in the spring, summer and autumn, solar energy surges into the grid at a time when demand is at is strongest (air conditioning etc is running like mad) and when spot market energy prices are at their highest. This peak price is being forced down by solar, helping to reduce wholesale prices. The big energy companies hate this because this peak is where they make their money. Solar in Germany is almost down to wholesale prices – in sunnier countries it already is. This brings me on to a really exciting development . Our company is starting to sell power directly from the barn roofs we have our plants on to the farmers who own the roofs and nearby towns wishing to rescue themselves from the grasp of the RWEs and E.ONs of this world. Why? Because we can produce power at around half of what farmers are paying. This so-called \"distributed\" (ie non-grid) energy is where the real revolution is taking place. Distributed energy not only saves on the huge amount of energy lost in grid distribution, but it helps lighten the load on the grid. Whole German towns are going completely renewable. The citizens get cheaper, cleaner power. If only Britain would get this. Just to be clear – Germany (Europe's biggest economy) now gets 25% of its electricity from renewables – a proportion that is increasing by the month. This is twice the level of the UK, although, interestingly, similar to that of Scotland on its own. Germany is also leading on figuring out how to overcome the problems of \"intermittency\" by storing renewable energy. I agree with the sceptical environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg that much of the world's efforts to reduce emissions in the past couple of decades have been a waste of time. I also agree with him on the need for a surge in R&amp;D to provide a cheap, renewable-energy-powered future. It is just that I think that future is already here, not decades away. And nuclear power is already a thing of the past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2012/oct/31/japan-tsunami-disaster-reconstruction-fund","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-31T11:37:32Z","webTitle":"Japan disaster: 25% of reconstruction fund spent on unrelated projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/31/japan-tsunami-disaster-reconstruction-fund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/oct/31/japan-tsunami-disaster-reconstruction-fund","fields":{"headline":"Japan disaster: 25% of reconstruction fund spent on unrelated projects","bodyText":"A quarter of the 11.7tn yen (£91bn) the Japanese government allocated to rebuild the region devastated by last year's earthquake and tsunami has been spent on projects unrelated to the disaster. A government audit also found about half of the reconstruction budget had yet to be distributed owing to red tape and indecision over how the affected communities should be rebuilt. The revelations have prompted anger among survivors, who say reconstruction is taking too long. More than 18 months after the disaster, about 325,000 people forced to flee the tsunami and radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant are still living in temporary accommodation and have no idea when, or if, they will be able to return to their home towns. A breakdown of expenditure for the 2011 portion of the disaster budget found a large amount had gone to projects that have little or no relationship to the reconstruction efforts in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures, where almost 20,000 people died on 11 March last year. They included 500m yen for road construction in Okinawa, more than 1,000 miles to the south; 330m yen to repair a sports stadium in Tokyo; 10.7bn yen for a nuclear power research organisation; and subsidies for a contact lens factory. Another 30m yen went to the justice ministry to buy equipment for prisons, while 2.3bn yen was given to the fisheries agency to protect Japan's whaling fleet from harassment by the marine conservation group, Sea Shepherd. Other expenditure included renovations of government offices in Tokyo, training for aircraft and fighter pilots, research and production of rare-earth minerals, and semiconductor research. The revelations have embarrassed the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, whose Democratic party of Japan won the 2009 election on promises to improve transparency and cut waste – particularly on public works projects. \"It is true that the government has not done enough and has not done it adequately,\" Noda said in a speech to parliament this week. \"We must listen to those who say the reconstruction should be the first priority.\" In a separate audit of a 9.2bn yen share of the total budget, Yoshimitsu Shiozaki, an expert in urban planning at Kobe University, found about a quarter had been allocated to programmes unrelated to the disaster. \"Legally speaking, there are no problems with these projects,\" Shiozaki was quoted as saying in the Japan Times. He said similar budget irregularities were found after the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, in which more than 6,000 people died, but added, \"this time the funds are being used in a more deceptive way.\" Government officials initially defended its use of disaster funds, arguing the cash would spark a general economic recovery from which the ravaged north-east would also benefit. Officials said money had been granted to companies in different parts of the country because they had business relationships with smaller firms in the disaster region. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, insisted there was \"no doubt\" the distribution of cash had benefited communities affected by the tsunami. Local media reported that money used to improve disaster readiness in areas untouched by the tsunami could be trimmed next year, but there is no sign yet that the government will rein in other dubious expenditures. Noda acknowledged, however, that the revelations had angered the public, saying he would \"wring out\" spending on unrelated projects. Reconstruction spending included in the budgets for 2011 and next year was supposed to help people affected by the nuclear crisis, rebuild infrastructure destroyed by the tsunami and create employment. The government has pledged to spend 23tn yen by the end of the decade on reconstruction and disaster prevention, 19tn of it within five years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/jul/08/precautionary-principle-science-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-08T11:35:00Z","webTitle":"Why the precautionary principle matters | Andy Stirling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/08/precautionary-principle-science-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/08/precautionary-principle-science-policy","fields":{"headline":"Why the precautionary principle matters","bodyText":"Precaution is arguably one of the most misunderstood and misrepresented issues in the global politics of science and technology. Misunderstood, because precaution is so often wrongly asserted to be unscientific or anti-technology. Misrepresented, because a large part of the resulting stigma can be a systematic – even deliberate – effect of power. Powerful interests behind a particular innovation can understandably get pretty exercised when challenged by precautionary concerns over their favoured new technology. But these highly partisan commotions need not provoke such existential angst across society as a whole. Precaution does not necessarily mean a ban. It simply urges that time and space be found to get things right. To see the value of this, we can start by considering history. Take, for example, asbestos, lead, benzene, pesticides, ozone-depleters or overfishing. In all these areas and many more, early precautionary action was dismissed as irrational by governments, business and scientific establishments alike – claiming there were no alternatives. Yet now, it is agreed on all sides of the debate that levels of risk were initially quite significantly understated. And, in retrospect, there were more viable substitutes than were claimed at the time. Similar questions arise in forward-looking dilemmas of technology choice; around alternatives to nuclear power or GM food, for example. In a nutshell, precaution reminds us that innovation is not a forced one-track race to the future. Instead – like biological evolution – technological progress entails constantly branching paths. Though often concealed behind science, each involves intrinsically political choices. This requires understanding, rather than denial, of the real nature of uncertainty. Although there exist many versions of precaution, the general gist is that, where there are threats to human health or environment, scientific uncertainty is not a reason for inaction. This does not compel a particular action. It merely reminds us that lack of evidence of harm, is not the same thing as evidence of lack of harm. In other words, the crux of precaution lies in the rigour of taking similar care in avoiding the scientific error of mistakenly assuming safety, to avoiding mistakenly assuming harm. This in turn hinges on a crucial technical distinction between risk and uncertainty. Risk is a state of knowledge where we feel confident in assigning numerical probabilities. In conventional risk assessment, the onus, burden and levels of proof typically fall most heavily on those concerned about a particular pathway, or who prefer alternatives. The balance of emphasis tends to favour those products with most powerful backing. Precaution offers to level the playing field by inviting a focus not only on risk, but also on uncertainty. Whether due to incomplete evidence, complexity, divergent values, scientific disagreement, gaps in knowledge or the simple possibility of surprise – uncertainties cannot be reduced to neat numerical probabilities. But they are still crucial to rational consideration – and there are plenty of practical ways to deal with them (pdf). Under uncertainty, then, it is not merely difficult in practice to calculate some single definitive \"sound scientific\" \"evidence based\" solution. The point is, it is irrational even to try, let alone claim, this. The notion of exclusively science-based decisions under uncertainty is an oxymoron. How has such confusion come about? Uncertainties, after all, are among the most important driving forces in science. A typical scientist is well aware of the uncertainties in their field, often strongly motivated by them. Reasoned scepticism and open disagreement about uncertainties, are among the most crucial distinguishing qualities of science. Yet when science comes into contact with economic and political power, there develops a strange kind of uncertainty denial. This brings us back at the end, to where this blog began. In order to understand the rhetorical intensity of so much opposition to precaution, we need to look behind the methodological technicalities and consider the powerful political forces and high economic stakes that often hinge on the outcomes. It is with some sympathy for beleaguered decision makers in business or regulation, that we can understand the often-overwhelming political pressures to justify decisions. This can mean building \"policy-based evidence\" to assert some pre-decided outcome. Or it can merely mean pressuring an artificially unambiguous \"evidence base\" for justifying any firm decision at all. In a myriad ways this pressure incentivises analysts and independent expert advisers to sidestep precaution and produce more apparently confident and precise \"risk-based\" prescriptions than their better judgement might suggest. It is not necessary to envisage any conspiracy or bad faith. The effect is more like iron filings lining up in the magnetic field of power. Either way, it is this pressure for justification that explains why the animosity to precaution extends beyond the partisan advocates of particular uncertain technologies, to political debates in general. But, in the end, the picture is quite optimistic. Far from the pessimistic caricature, precaution actually celebrates the full depth and potential for human agency in knowledge and innovation. Blinkered risk assessment ignores both positive and negative implications of uncertainty. Though politically inconvenient for some, precaution simply acknowledges this scope and choice. So, while mistaken rhetorical rejections of precaution add further poison to current political tensions around technology, precaution itself offers an antidote – one that is in the best traditions of rationality. By upholding both scientific rigour and democratic accountability under uncertainty, precaution offers a means to help reconcile these increasingly sundered Enlightenment cultures. Andy Stirling is professor of science and technology policy at the University of Sussex. This is the first in a series on the precautionary principle.

This elevated concerns about the health impacts of eating the fish, and some devastated sushi-buffs swore-off Pacific bluefin in response. But now researchers have released a paper intended to allay fears about eating the fish. Every year, schools of Pacific bluefin tuna migrate to the US and Mexico's west coast from the Japanese waters where they are born. In 2011 when the gargantuan, streamlined fish arrived in Californian seas, researchers tested them for radionuclides. Contrary to what many media reports suggested, these were only found in trace amounts that would have an \"essentially negligible\" impact on health, said Nicholas Fisher, lead author on the study and a marine biogeochemist from Stony Brook University in New York. This year, they followed up on that research with the paper that unleashed a fresh wave of media concern. \"People are understandably anxious about radioactivity,\" Fisher said. But the radionuclides they found in the fish—cesium-137 and cesium-134, two radioactive isotopes that have been associated with nuclear power plant waste and nuclear weapons fallout—were \"well below landmark levels that are considered safe for wildlife,\" he said. \"By 'low' I mean hundreds of thousands of times lower.\" One purpose of the original paired studies was to show that radioactive materials in fish could be used for conservation purposes to track Pacific bluefin on their epic migratory routes. But public and media concern was aroused in part because the low threat level was never stated explicitly in former papers, Fisher explained. \"While we presented units of radioactivity in fish tissue, that kind of meant nothing to most people,\" he explained, \"we didn't actually convert that into the dose that people would get by eating [bluefin].\" For instance, a typical 200g restaurant serving of Fukushima-contaminated Pacific bluefin tuna would deliver only about five percent of the amount of radioactivity one would get from eating an uncontaminated banana, which contains natural amounts of radioactive potassium. Fisher said that doses of natural radioactivity found in the fish, like that which comes from the natural decay of uranium in the sea, far surpassed the amounts of cesium-137 and cesium-134. And even these naturally occurring doses are considered safe for uptake. When asked whether he thought the Pacific bluefin might be benefiting from a possible hiatus in consumption by scared sushi-lovers, Fisher said it could be doing something to protect the fish, though he was clear that the aim of the research was never to discourage consumption. Based on the new results, people can make up their own minds about eating tuna, he said. \"I wouldn't necessarily encourage them to eat these fish—they can eat something else!\" In that spirit, perhaps it is a good time to take stock of the stocks. Pacific bluefin tuna suffers from the misconception that its population is stable. Of the three bluefin species—the others are the Atlantic and Southern bluefin, which both bear catch limits—Pacific bluefin is something of a 'middle child'; it suffers from a relative lack of attention borne out of the devastated scenarios of its sibling fish. Pacific bluefin tuna is the least threatened of the three, and so is considered a 'safer' option to eat. But this leaves conservationists wary, since it belies the fish's true status. In fact, a report came out earlier this year showing that Pacific bluefin tuna have seen a 96 % population dip over the years, due to commercial fishing across their migratory range. Much of the fishing is done in the tuna's delicate spawning grounds. Some specimens are captured, then enclosed in huge Pacific bluefin tuna 'ranches' in Mexico and fattened for sale. Most of those fished are juveniles that have not had a chance to reproduce, says Amanda Nickson, director of global tuna conservation for the Pew Charitable Trusts. \"Over 90% of the Pacific bluefin tuna are being caught as juveniles,\" Nickson said. \"There needs to be a catch limit and a size limit in place.\" If changes aren't introduced, the population of Pacific bluefin will dwindle even further. This is a concern largely in the fish's western Pacific habitat that lies along the Japanese coast, where there are no formal limits on catch. The pressure on the fish comes mostly from Japanese markets, though Mexican and US fishers took a considerable portion of the catch—19 percent—in 2011, according to Pew. \"All of the countries involved in the [fishery] have pretty much knowingly failed to take effective measures,\" Nickson said. Seeing the lack of formal management plans, conservation groups are calling for a provisional suspension on Pacific bluefin fisheries. For now, the temporary fear of eating this fish might give us the (swiftly closing) gap we really need to think over our consumption of bluefin tuna again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/22/environment-2011-year-review","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-22T12:45:00Z","webTitle":"Environment world review of the year: '2011 rewrote the record books'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/22/environment-2011-year-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/22/environment-2011-year-review","fields":{"headline":"Environment world review of the year: '2011 rewrote the record books'","bodyText":"The year 2011 was another ecologically tumultuous year with greenhouse gases rise to record levels, Arctic sea ice nearly equalling 2007's record melt, and temperatures the 11th highest ever recorded. It was marked on the ground by unparalleled extremes of heat and cold in the US, droughts and heatwaves in Europe and Africa and record numbers of weather-related natural disasters. In addition, 2011 saw the world population reach 7 billion, the second worst nuclear disaster and record investments in renewable energy. The 41 sea, land and air indicators used by the US government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to measure sea and land temperatures showed unequivocally that the world continued to warm throughout 2011. In July, NOAA reported that the last 300 months had all been above average temperature and that the 13 warmest years had all occurred in the 15 years since 1997. 2011 was additionally remarkable, it said, because a \"La Niña\" event was taking place, a naturally occurring oceanic cooling phenomenon that would normally bring temperatures down. Despite stagnation or economic recession in many industrialised countries, concentrations of CO2, measured at Mauna Loa in Hawaii, peaked at more than 394 parts per million in May and are now 39% above where they were at the start of the industrial era and approaching the point when some scientists say it will be nearly impossible to contain global warming. In September, Germany's University of Bremen reported that Arctic sea ice had hit a record low, based on data from a Japanese sensor on Nasa's Aqua satellite. Days later, the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, using a different satellite data set, reported that ice coverage in 2011 was marginally greater, making 2011 the second-lowest on record. Christophe Kinnard, of the Centre for Advanced Studies in Arid Zones in La Serena, Chile reported in November that both the duration and magnitude of the current decline in sea ice \"seem to be unprecedented for the past 1,450 years\". \"Everything is trending up – surface temperature, the atmosphere, and it seems also that the ocean is warming and there is more warm and saline water that makes it into the Arctic. The sea ice is eroded from below and melting from the top,\" said Kinnard. While eastern Europe, Russia, Pakistan and the Middle East suffered the most from weather extremes in 2010, it was the turn of North America in 2011. The continent experienced massive flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, record wildfires and a crippling drought in the south. More than 2,941 monthly records for extreme heat and extreme cold were broken in all 50 US states in 2011, said the Natural Resources Defense Council. The costs of weather-related disasters spiralled. The US experienced 14 separate disasters each costing over $1bn. In total, financial losses were estimated at over $50bn. \"In many ways, 2011 rewrote the record books. From crippling snowstorms to the second deadliest tornado year on record to epic floods, drought and heat, and the third busiest hurricane season on record, we've witnessed the extreme of nearly every weather category,\" said NOAA spokesman Christopher Vaccaro. 2011 was described by many commentators as the \"year of the tornado\". Between January and June, 43 major thunderstorms released nearly 1,600 tornadoes in the central, southern and eastern United States. Half happened in April, and 226 of them on April 27. But 2011 was also the year of too much or too little water. It began with devastating floods in Australia which covered an area the size of France and Germany combined, and ended with tropical storm Washi killing nearly 1,000 people and making 300,000 homeless in the Philippines. Thailand's worst floods in 50 years claimed 730 lives, northern China's drought that started in 2010 continued well into 2011 and was the worst drought to hit the country in 60 years. Massive droughts affected some of the world's richest and poorest communities. The worst drought in 60 years gripped more than 10 million people and led to the death of thousands of people and millions of animals in Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Meanwhile, Texas was badly hit by heatwaves and drought. The city of Austin had 27 consecutive days where the temperature was over 100F and 90 days in total when it reached that level. The Texas Forest Service said the continuing drought had killed 100-500 million trees, a figure that did not include the ones killed in wildfires that scorched around 4m acres of the state. The year began and ended with drought and record temperatures in Europe. The average temperature for northern Norway in November was 5.3C (9.5F) above normal, the Danube was at its lowest levels in 60 years, and Germany and much of northern Europe had the driest end to a year since recordkeeping began in 1881. 2011 was also an extraordinary year for major earthquakes. In the seven weeks between 1 January and 21 February, Argentina, Chile, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Tonga, Burma, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Sulawesi, Fiji and New Zealand were all hit. But by far the most damaging quake was the one that led to Japan's deadly tsunami on 11 March. This killed 15,500 people, caused the meltdowns of three nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, and led to 160,000 people fleeing the area or being moved away. By the end of the year, it was estimated to have cost around $210bn in lost production and physical damage. Decommissioning the station is expected to cost a further $15bn. Arguments still rage over the radioactivity levels, but while the industry, backed some western commentators, played down the consequences, levels of radioactive caesium were shown to have reached 50m times normal levels off the coast. As 2011 ended, it was still hard to accurately gauge the level of devastation, the amount of the meltdown and the exact radiation levels. Last week, the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said its owners had at last brought the station into a state known as \"cold shutdown\". One clear fallout of the Fukushima disaster has been European countries turning their backs on nuclear power. Most significantly, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said in May that she would bring forward the phase-out of Germany's nuclear power stations to 2022. Italians voted overwhelmingly against new nuclear reactors and the Swiss government moved to phase out its reactors. Now for the good news. In July, the UN Environment Programme announced that investments in renewable energy had grown 32% in 2010, reaching a record $211bn since 2004. For the first time, investment in faster-growing developing economies was greater than that in developed economies. Bloomberg New Energy Finance said renewable energy investments were projected to double over the next eight years and reach $395bn per year by 2020. The bad news is that the International Energy Agency (IEA) says even this will not be enough to stabilise emissions and control climate change. The IEA's sense of realism was underlined at the UN's annual climate conference in December. The talks in Durban, South Africa, avoided a major split between big emitters and others, with an agreement between 194 countries to work towards a legally binding deal to cut emissions in the future, leaving only voluntary pledges in the meantime. \"Without much stronger commitments for the next 5-10 years the Durban outcome will stay nothing more than smoke and mirrors – an illusion of ambition with no real targets or clear timelines,\" said Nnimmo Bassey, head of Friends of the Earth International. Negotiators also concentrated on establishing carbon markets for forest protection and transport. Conservationists battling the worldwide loss of forests welcomed satellite data from Brazil showing deforestation in the Amazon region had fallen to the lowest level for 23 years. However, new laws were passed in December that, if enacted, will allow ranchers to fell more trees near rivers and on mountaintop watersheds. Tigers and other charismatic mega-fauna appeared to do better in 2011. Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Burma and Nepal protected a further 2m hectares of land for tigers. India – which holds half of the world's tigers – estimated an increase in the population from 1,411 in 2007 to 1,706 today. However, the WWF announced that only 18-22 Siberian tigers remained in the wild in north-east China. Unexpectedly, a significant increase in the gorilla population was recorded in the Virunga mountains that are shared between Rwanda, The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. A WWF survey counted 480, an increase of 100 since the last count in 2003. And in a small triumph for conservation, the UN Development programme declared in December that more than $100m had been raised, mostly by Latin American countries, to temporarily leave in the ground the estimated 900m barrels of oil believed to be below the Yasuni national park in the Ecuadorian Amazon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/perth-festival-2014-tuesday-18-february-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-18T08:20:38Z","webTitle":"Perth festival 2014: Tuesday 18 February – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/perth-festival-2014-tuesday-18-february-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/perth-festival-2014-tuesday-18-february-live","fields":{"headline":"Perth festival 2014: Tuesday 18 February – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for joining us – we’re off to enjoy the festival and will be back tomorrow with more coverage of events in Perth. In the meantime, here’s a round-up of everything we’ve covered today Interview: Thomas Keneally Review: Situation Rooms Audio: Perth festival podcast episode one Pictures: A Midsummer Night’s Dream (As You Like It) Review: Paramodelic-Graffiti and The Tenth Sentiment Video: Andrew Frost on The Tenth Sentiment Feature: Perth World 2014: this week’s highlights Review: Austra While the big ticket in town might be the international arts festival, there are always gems to be found surrounding it, writes Jane Howard. In Perth, Fringe World showcases these works that can be small, rough-and-ready, and – hopefully – every bit as affecting as their big international festival counterparts. It might take a bit of a hunt to find the gems, but the joy is in the chase. Jane gives us her highlights of the coming week – we’ve included a couple of them below, but you can read them in full here. Between the Cracks Yana Alana, the “diva extraordinaire” alter ego of performer Sarah Ward, burst on to Australia’s cabaret scene at the 2007 Melbourne Fringe, and has since played festivals all over the country, picking up a host of awards. More recently, she’s been sharing the stage with La Soirée and Finucane &amp; Smith’s Glory Box. With a personality this huge though, it’s a real treat to get her full show. Ward’s cabaret is known for being political, sexual, feminist and hilarious, and Between the Cracks won outstanding reviews at last year’s Melbourne Cabaret festival. With a 10:45pm timeslot and an 18+ rating, anything could happen – and probably will. • The West Australian Spiegeltent, 20–23 February Squidboy Squidboy: Sitting somewhere between comedy and clowning, it’s packed with delights and an emotional punch. Photograph: PR/Fringe World The low-fi, slightly dorky, lone, probably bearded, male storyteller is so ubiquitous at fringe festivals the he almost needs his own category in the program. In Perth, the star turn in this genre is Squidboy. New Zealand-raised, London-based performer Trygve Wakenshaw has been touring this show about “an imaginary friend who makes imaginary friends who make imaginary enemies” for two years across Australia and Europe, so Perth audiences should expect to be treated to a production that’s firmly found its feet. Sitting somewhere between comedy and clowning, it’s packed with delights and an emotional punch. Also, who can resist a man in a squid costume? • PICA Performance Space, 18 – 22 February Andrew Frost reflects on the Tenth Sentiment, in which dancing shadows cast by everyday objects are caught in the headlights of a single moving model train. Kuwakubo’s installation is showing at John Curtin Gallery as part of the 2014 Perth festival – you can read more from Andrew Frost on this artwork here It’s not just the headline act who can make a good gig great – sometimes it’s pairing them with the perfect support that creates a particularly brilliant vibe. So it was last night at Austra, who were supported by Perth band Lilt to great success. You can read Andrew’s four-star review in full here, or here’s a snapshot. If you’re the sort of person that can’t be bothered catching the support act, you’ve made a tactical error with the Austra gig. Lilt are a local quartet playing atmospheric electronica – a perfect choice to open for the Canadian electro-pop outfit – and despite early nerves and a brand new drummer they played an absolute blinder, ranging from chilly Lamb trip-hop through to pure banging pop … They got the audience in an anticipatory mood for the headliners, who took the stage without fuss and burst into Olympia’s opening track What We Done? Katie Stelmanis was in full Kate Bush dancing form, her voice rich and pure, with Dorian Wolf a solid presence stage right on bass, and keysman Ryan Wonsiak threatening to steal the show in lycra wrestling suit and black lipstick. Tanya Voltchanskaya has taken a beautiful set of pictures from the wings of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (As You Like It) which plays at the festival until February 19. You can see the full gallery here, and some of the pictures below Andrew Frost has been down to Perth’s John Curtin gallery to take a look at two separate works by Japanese artists that share some themes. Paramodel’s Paramodelic-Graffiti and Ryota Kuwakubo’s The Tenth Sentiment have some intriguing conceptual links, says Andrew Frost, “not the least of which is a shared fascination with models, miniatures and dioramas.” You can read Andrew’s review in full here, and see an extract from it below. First about Paramodel’s work The duo set out with an expansive if limited set of materials – blue plastic toy train lines, toy cement mixers, garbage trucks and cranes, and a vast array of styrofoam, coloured cardboard and paint. Using a computer program to help design their detailed installations, the artists and an army of helpers then set up the work in the gallery space. The work has a two stage effect on the viewer. First, you’re bowled over by the intensity of the pattern of the work – the blue plastic train lines are unifying outlines that wind their way around the room covering floor, walls and ceilings, while the loops, circles and islands created by the pattern are filled with mountains of sculpted styrofoam and populated with tiny toy animals – Friesian cows, wombats, kangaroos among them – all arranged to create a kind of fractal repetition, echoing in their orientation another space on the wall or ceiling. And also about Ryota Kuwakubo’s The Tenth Sentiment, which is also a miniature world. On the carpeted floor of a darkened room there appears to be a tiny N-scale toy train engine making a circuitous journey on a tiny track. The engine has a miniature but very powerful LED light on it. As the engine snakes around the floor it passes blocks of wood, light bulbs, pencils and tiny toys, passes through paper tubes and a colander, then continues on past peg, pencils and many more everyday objects placed strategically next to the tracks. As the light hits these objects shadows are cast on to the gallery walls creating what looks like cities, nuclear power stations, forests and farm lands. The journey from one end of the track to the other takes 13 minutes but it feels like no time has passed. The effect is mesmerising. We’ll be hearing more about William Kentridge’s The Refusal of Time later this week – but our audio producer Miles Martignoni has been out talking to people about the show today. It looks a million miles away from the bright Perth sunshine Join Vicky Frost, Andrew P Street and Andrew Frost for the first of our Perth festival podcasts. Today, we discuss Batsheva’s Sadeh21, music from Austra and Ebony Bones, and festival artworks such as Sacrilege – the jumping castle Stonehenge we’re bouncing on in this podcast. (The most fun you can have in the city at the moment? Almost definitely). Perth festival director Jonathan Holloway also joins us for a chat, and gives us his festival highlights. You can listen to the podcast here, or you can also subscribe via iTunes. Yesterday afternoon I headed down to the ABC’s studios for Rimini Protokoll’s new work, an immersive experience you might call theatre, journalism, documentary or video game. It’s effectively a mixture of all four: a live action game which takes place within a warren of rooms, in which you take the role of various (real) people whose lives have been touched by the international arms trade. It’s a quite astonishing experience. It is entirely absorbing – you’re navigating your way through the experience via an iPad mini which shows or tells you how to behave – and extremely innovative. Not to mention clever: you enter the Situation Rooms with 19 other audience members, and your stories interact and cross over. It’s a challenging, exciting experience. I highly recommend a visit if you’re in Perth – there are several shows a day until February 23. You can read my review in full here, or here’s an extract. Grasping an iPad mini, headphones glued to my ears, I reach out and open the door marked number five, and step into the Situation Rooms – a complex of interlinked chambers, each with different and numerous stories, that I will navigate for the next 70 minutes, obeying on-screen commands and visual prompts. I don costumes, hoist flags, smuggle USB sticks, slurp borscht at well-worn kitchen tables. And live the stories of 10 people – real people, many of whom appear on camera here – whose lives have been touched by the international arms trade. I’m still not entirely sure how I should categorise this remarkable experience – it’s theatre with the audience as actors; journalism with the consumer interacting directly with the story; a video game where the screen bleeds into real and constructed worlds. But above all it is utterly absorbing – for more than an hour you are so busy living this piece of extraordinary art that that you do really become it.﻿ Thomas Keneally is celebrating half a century since he was first published: his novel, The Place At Whitton, was published by Cassell in 1964; a life-altering event for “a lost soul” trying to find his way back into society after studying for the priesthood. Keneally, who will be appearing at Perth Writers Festival on Friday morning, remains as vigorous as ever – in an interview for Guardian Australia ahead of the festival, the Booker-prize winning author is still energised about first world war myths, asylum seekers and the ‘transcendental joy’ of writing. You can read that interview in full here, but here’s a brief extract from the wide-ranging piece that also covers his views on literary awards, reviews, and what do to with all the plots he’ll never write. Australia should “apologise to the ghosts” of young soldiers who survived the first world war but had to fight for compensation when they returned home traumatised by the horrors of the battlefield, says the author and historian Thomas Keneally. Ceremonies marking the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war should avoid jingoism and spurious myths, and instead confront the “terrible tragedies of shell-shock and high explosive and burial alive”. “I hope it’s celebrated in the spirit of what these young men really went through, and the fact we let them down when they came back – we denied the shell-shock, we were niggardly with compensation,” says the Booker Prize-winning author of Schindler’s Ark. “We’re very hot on praising the diggers, but we should apologise to their ghosts for the lack of justice we gave them. “I also hope no one says ‘Australia was born at Gallipoli’. Australia was born in 1901, and there needs to be a certain amount of de-mythologising. Let’s hope the historians win out over the politicians, who strike me as fairly jingoistic.” Although somewhat mellowed by age – he no longer frets much over bad reviews, for instance – Keneally has clearly lost none of his vigour. Last year, he co-edited with Rosie Scott (and contributed to) A Country Too Far, a collection of writing on asylum-seekers. Speaking at his home in Sydney, he rails against “politicians becoming their own shock jocks” and whipping up “racial hysteria” against those making the perilous voyage here by boat. • Celebrating 50 Years: Thomas Keneally, Friday February 21, 11:30am, Dolphin Theatre, Perth We have lots of treats lined up – including more pictures from backstage at A Midsummer Night’s Dream (As You Like It), on today’s liveblog hosted by Vicky Frost.

Members have voted in favour of a policy proposing free universal childcare from the age of one to six. A poll has shown the people see the Lib Dems as more idealistic and honest than the Lib Dems or Ukip, but less qualified to be a serious party of government. (See 3.29pm.) Isabel Hardman at Coffee House says Natalie Bennett redeemed herself with her speech. Here’s an extract. Natalie Bennett needed to give a good solid speech to the Green Party conference after a difficult few weeks, and she managed that today. The Green leader hadn’t undergone a personality transplant though, so she still wasn’t the most stirring speaker ever .. But overall it was a solid speech. It set out what Bennett wants to do, both in terms of election campaign messages, and in terms of how she would like voters to behave. Guido Fawkes has had some fun with the fact that Natalie Bennett was speaking in front of a green screen. You can watch his take here. I’m sorry the blog has been quiet. I’ve been otherwise engaged writing a story. I’ll be rounding up now, and posting a summary soon. Caroline Lucas wraps up the session with a quote: “We are the people that we are waiting for,” she says. Q: Does the Green party need tighter links with other Green parties in the world? Molly Scott Cato says there is a green links organisation already encouraging these connections. Q: Why is Syriza hesitant on adopting renewable energy? There is a lot of sun and wind in Greece? Kostas Loukeris says there is a struggle in the Greek government over renewable energy. He says he agrees. Greece is rich in sun, wind and waves. He does not see why it should drill for oil. Scott Cato says the European parliament has specifically set aside money for renewable energy projects in Greece. Q: There is a rumour that Russia is ready to take over Greece’s debt. Would Greece accept that? Loukeris says this is a myth that has existed in Greece, since the time of the Ottoman empire. People think “the Russians will save us”. He does not see it happening. He sincerely doubts that Greece would confuse its allies in this way. And Russia cannot afford just to give money away. Q: Should we find partners with other parties? People say the left will always be split. Scott Cato says people need to understand how a multi-party system works. It inevitably leads to coalition, and compromise. People in this country do not understand it. Adam Ramsay says the party will debate a motion on Sunday allowing candidates to stand under a joint label with other parties. This could apply to parties like the National Health Action party. The Labour party thinks it has all the progressive answers, he says. The Greens should never fall into that trap. He says they have recently become the main progressive party in the UK. But they must stay pluralist. Q: Is Syriza trying to reform the economic system or change it fundamentally? Loukeris says the government has been clever enough not to promise socialism. But it might be able to create new models within the existing framework. There are many ideas around for this, he says. Q: If we are a party for everyone, aren’t we going to have to bring the right in with us? Zoe Williams says, if you want to quote a world for everyone, you even have to take everyone with you. She says Catholicism and neoliberalism have a lot in common. They are completely fabricated systems. What matters is the internal vitality of the rival movement. That is what is going to draw people in, she says. Q: [To Kostas Loukeris, a senior member of the Greek Green party] What can we in the UK do to help you? And how can we avoid the rise of fascism, given what has happened with Golden Dawn in Greece? Kostas Loukeris is speaking from Greece by Skype. He says Greens should focus on the fact they are changing the world. There is a big Greek community in the UK. It is based around the City. These ship owners have most of the wealth held outside Greece. We might need support for you. On Golden Dawn, he says it is the ugliest example of the consequence of neo-liberalism. Look at Golden Dawn, Pegida in Germany, the National Front in France, and Ukip in the UK. These are all byproducts of neo-liberalism. Zoe Williams, the Guardian columnist, says fascism does not arrive in fancy dress. It arrives looking like Nigel Farage. The fancy dress comes later. Q: We are constantly told we need growth, which is a lie. And we are told wealth creators create jobs, which is also untrue. It is workers who create wealth. Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP, says she agrees with the point about growth. But debt is also a factor too. That is why the party changed its stance on the money supply. Q: What do the panel think about TTIP [the transatlantic trade and investment partnership]? Scott Cato says the Greens are leading the opposition to this in the European parliament. It is being kept secret because it involves big corporations setting the terms of the market. It is “utterly undemocratic and must be stopped.” Adam Ramsay from Open Democracy says the new Greek government has said it is opposed to TTIP. It will veto it, he says. Given that, he cannot understand why it is not dead. He says the struggle to remake the British economy won’t just benefit people in this country. It would also help people in Greece. The panel discussion on Syriza is underway. I’ve missed the opening statements, but we’re on to the Q&amp;A now. Caroline Lucas starts by inviting a contribution from a UK representative of Podemos, the leftwing anti-austerity in Spain which has been attacting huge support since it launched last year. He says Podemos shows that ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Here’s one Green member explaining why Natalie Bennett is so popular. James Dennison, a political scientist, has posted this graph on Twitter. It suggests that, for Green supporters, having coherent policies matters less than it does for the supporters of most other parties. ComRes has published the findings of a poll it has carried out for ITV looking at public perceptions of the Greens, the Lib Dems and Ukip. On the plus side, the Greens are seen as the most idealistic and most honest of those three parties. Idealistic Greens: 41% Ukip: 17% Lib Dems: 15% Honest Greens: 23% Ukip: 18% Lib Dems: 12% But the Greens are also worse on being “fluffy” and a serious party of government. Fluffy Greens: 26% Lib Dems: 16% Ukip: 7% A serious party of government Greens: 9% Ukip: 16% Lib Dems: 24% Well, the members who are here certainly like Natalie Bennett. It was not exactly a speech that achieved “an explosion of excitement without raising unrealistic expectations” (see 9.16am), and at times it was rambling and unfocused, but Bennett did seem to get a genuinely enthusiastic reception. Perhaps there’s an element of showing solidarity with someone who’s had a tough time in the media recently (the sympathy clap), but there does seem to be an authentic buzz here too; people keep talking about how much larger this is than previous Green party conferences. Bennett had some good lines about the Greens being the agents of change, or a potential “peaceful political revolution”, but what was most interesting was her policy announcement on social care. Green support comes disproportionately from the young, but today Bennett announced a policy likely to appeal most to the middle aged and the elderly. Put simply, the Greens are going after the Telegraph vote. I’m not sure how well this will work, but it is an interesting act of re-positioning. Here are the main lines from the speech. Bennett said the Green party was committed to making social care for the over-65s free at the point of use. Free healthcare is the very cornerstone of our NHS. Whether you are rich or poor you have the right to the best that is available. That’s something the Green party will restore – and extend. For that same principle should apply to social care – the support and services that you need to lead a fulfilling life should be available when you need it, free at the point of use. We believe that to be a decent, humane, caring society, social care must be free ... Providing free social care for the over 65s means security and freedom from fear, suffering and loneliness for many, and it means 200,000 new jobs and training places. Bennett did not explain how this would be funded, but she said “those who have the most” should contribute and she confirmed that the party was committed to a new wealth tax, a financial transaction tax and higher income tax for those earning more than £100,000. She also said the party would consult on how free social care could be delivered She said people could achieve “something miraculous - a peaceful political revolution” at the general election by voting Green. This election can be a turning point in history. The moment where we can deliver a better Britain, a Britain which works for its people. A Britain which cares. Bennett says some people want business as usual politics to continue. They will vote for the politics of yesterday. But if we all vote Green, we can change Britain for good. Vote for the politics of the future. Vote Green, she says. And that’s it. She’s getting a standing ovation. Bennett it is impossible to overstate the importance of people who can vote making their voice heard. The deadline for voter registration is 20 April. But don’t wait, she says; register today. Bennett says the manifesto will include free social care as a core pledge. Social care is not a privilege; it is a right. Bennett says the same principle that applies to health care should apply to social care. It should be free at the point of use. We believe that to be a decent, humane, caring society, social care must be free. The Greens would introduce a wealth tax, crack down on tax evasion and tax avoidance and introduce a financial transactions tax, the “Robin Hood tax”. Bennett says she is glad the Greens are working on an NHS reinstatement bill to remove the market mechanism from the NHS. Bennett says the ideology of Thatcher and her successor, Blair, Brown and Cameron, has failed. The market is short-sighted and short-term. it is blind, it is senseless. It works for the 1%; it fails the rest of us. ‘All in it together’? I don’t think so. Bennett says things cannot carry on as they are. Since 2000 food prices have risen 22%. But wages have fallen 7%. It is time to end the scourge of zero hours contracts, she says. Bennet says she applauds those who run food banks. But individual charity is no substitute for collective justice. This is the legacy of both Labour and the Conservatives, she says. The Green party is calling time on the politics of low wages, job insecurity and food banks. It is calling time on the privatisation of public assets. Bennett says Caroline Lucas “put her freedom on the line” to oppose fracking. She shows “passion, sensitivity and courage”. Just imagine a group of MPs in the Commons like that, she says. Green MPs would never support a Conservative government. (This gets a big round of applause.) Bennett says the Greens approach the election as a central player in British politics. But it isn’t just the Green party. Campaigns for a new politics are getting stronger. Look at the people’s assemblies, the Occupy movement, anti-fracking campaigns and fossil fuel divestment campaigns. At last the people are fighting back. Bennett says the green surge is much more than a hashtag, although it is a very successful hashtag. She has seen the party expand all over the country. And the Greens got their first MEP in the south west, Molly Scott Cato. Bennett says no one should be living in fear of not being able to feed their families, in fear of debt, worried about fracking drilling into their communities or at risk of being driven to destitution by Iain Duncan Smith. That is the failed politics. The Green party is offering a politics that works for the many. Bennett says she is addressing her comments to the country. 90% of people will have the chance to vote for a Green candidate. For some people, it will be their first chance to vote Green. In 9 weeks time you will have in your hands something miraculous. The possibility of a peaceful political revolution. Bennett says people should vote for policies that work for the common good, not the few. Britain could be a very different country on 8 May. The politics of the future would involve the living wage, good jobs, services run for all, railways run for passengers, not shareholders, and the NHS kept in public hands. Bennett says this has been a momentous year for the party. It has taken its place at the forefront of British politics. Nearly 300,000 people helped to ensure the Greens were included in the debates. They often do better than the Lib Dems in polls. And they have become the third largest party in England and Wales. Its membership has quadrupled. Natalie Bennett is taking the stage now. She is getting another standing ovation. (I can’t tell whether this always happens, or whether this is partly a show of support in the wake of that interview.) Lucas says that, even with just one seat, the Greens have been able to shape the agenda on issues like fracking and renationalising the railways. And it will be the Greens who champion the NHS reinstatement bill. This would not just repeal the Health and Social Care Act; it would turn back 25 years of Labour and Conservative marketisation. Lucas turns to the election. This time, the Greens are fighting “from a position of strength”. With the SNP, Plaid Cyrmu and the Green surge, there is a change to create a “progressive alliance” in the next parliament, she says. She says during this parliament she has worked closely with those two nationalist parties. If there is a Labour minority government, the Greens and others can stop them advocating austerity and pandering to big business, she says. She says she is high on Ed Miliband’s hit list of target seats because Labour do not like the Greens showing that there is a progressive alternative. Labour want to end our presence in parliament because, deep down, they are ashamed at how they have abandoned their principles. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, is speaking now. She says this is the fourth venue the party has used for a conference in Liverpool. Each one was bigger than the last. If all party members attend, even Anfield would not be big enough. She says she wants to welcome new members. And she says they will have seen this party is different; there are no stands for BAe Systems, and no lobbyists from tax havens. This party is different, she says. Every person’s vote counts the same. And leadership is different here too, she says. It is something you do out of a sense of duty, not for personal gain. Lucas says when she stood down as leader, she thought her replacement would help the party grow. But she did not know by how much it would grow. She is proud to call Natalie her friend, she says. Dobson says people are working around the clock to get the first Green MP elected in Liverpool. Vivienne Westwood is coming to the city to do a campaign event, he says. Some 1,000 people have signed up to see her. Dobson says Liverpool has had the second worst cuts of any council in the UK. Every person in the city has lost £252 in services. Yet Labour have voted with the government to back another £30bn in cuts, he says. That’s a reference to Labour voting for the coalition’s charter for budget responsibility. Martin Dobson says the Green party are the official opposition to Labour on Liverpool council. He welcomes members to the city. (Joe Anderson, the Labour mayor of Liverpool, has also welcomed Green party members to Merseyside, with an open letter identifying what he describes as some of the party’s most “eye-catching” policies.) Martin Dobson, the Green candidate for Liverpool Riverside, has just taken the podium. And Natalie Bennett and Caroline Lucas have come in too, to sit on the platform. They get prolonged applause, which eventually becomes a standing ovation. I’m in the main hall of the conference centre now waiting for Natalie Bennett’s speech to start. It’s reasonably full, but they’re not turning anyone away yet. Here’s the view from where I am. Here’s the view from the balcony outside the room where we had the briefing. The Green party flag is flying over the Mersey. I’m back from the press briefing. A press officer was doing it and he began by telling us that the conference “is not really for journalists”, which wasn’t auspicious. What he meant was that it’s for members to make policy. Any member can turn up and vote on policy (unlike, for example, in the Labour party, where local parties are allocated a certain number of delegates). The conference won’t actually approve the manifesto, but the policies agreed will feed into the manifesto, which is being drawn up by a separate party committee and which will be published at the end of March. The spokesman also wanted to take issue with the idea that existing Green policy would ban almost all cars. (See 12.25pm.) That’s not the case, he said. An activist just included that line in his motion to ensure it got attention, he claimed. And here’s a shot from the bookstall. I’m off to the press briefing now. Hopefully I will be able to file again soon, but if it goes quiet, it’ll be because I’m having trouble with the wifi. You certainly don’t get this at other party conferences. I’ve just had an email from Labour highlighting these figures, showing that the Greens fell from second place to third place in a council byelection last night in St Pancras &amp; Somers Town in Camden, the war ward where Natalie Bennett lives. The Greens describe their conference as the “supreme decision-making body” for the party and the agenda, setting out the motions and amendments that are going to be discussed over the next four days, runs to 86 pages. The party says it has three key campaign themes for the election. 1 - Keeping the NHS in public hands, and fighting privatisation. 2 - Ending austerity, with the living wage rising to £10 an hour by 2020 and a new wealth tax for the richest 1% 3 - Tackling climate change, by phasing out fossil fuels and nuclear power and promoting renewables. But the full agenda is much richer. As well as containing the odd nugget for tabloid hacks looking for “barmy Greens” stories, it contains an array of proposals that you won’t find at mainstream party conferences. Here are 15 of the most interesting. Making it an offence to stop women from breast feeding in public. (Or the anti Nigel Farage law, as you could call it.) Amending the party’s current policy on cars. The explanation for this is a gem; note the masterly use of understatement. Our current transport policy has a line that would ban almost all currently roadworthy cars. As this would probably prove unattractive with the electorate, this motion replaces it with text that is more in line with the intentions of the policy [which is got manufacturers to limit the speed of cars]. Providing free universal childcare from the age of 1 to 6. This motion is sponsored by Natalie Bennett, among others. Extending article 5 of the human rights declaration “to all sentient life forms”. Extending “the human rights of life, and liberty” to ceteceans (whales and dolphins), great apes and elephants. This would ensure that the “murder, torture and kidnapping” of these creatures would “bear the same legal penalty as the relevant crimes committed against humans”. Banning horse racing and greyhound racing for commercial purposes. Non-commercial greyhound racing would have to take place on linear tracks, and non-commercials horse racing would have to take place on the flat. Banning foie gras, and any other product that is the result of force-feeding. Abolishing employers’ national insurance. This would be funded by increases in corportation tax and other business taxes. Abolishing tuition fees and writing off outstanding student debt. Mandating Green MPs, in the event of a hung parliament, to “do all they can to remove the Conservative party from government”. Green MPs would also be banned from joining a coalition unless the Greens are in the majority, and banned from supporting an administration including Ukip. Allowing parents not to nominate the gender of a child at birth if the child cannot be assigned a gender. Opposing George Osborne’s plans for greater devolution for Greater Manchester, on the grounds they have “no democratic mandate”, and promoting a north west regional assembly instead. Changing party policy so that it favours STV (the single transferable vote) as the preferred electoral system for local government, not AMS (the additional member system), so that the Greens are “in line with other democratic reform organisations”. Introducing mandatory reporting for child abuse. Cutting £1m-plus National Lottery prizes, and having more, smaller prizes instead. Natalie Bennett has arrived. Last year, as the Ukip surge was taking off, YouGov published some research looking at the composition of people supporting the Greens now. Around half of Green supporters voted Lib Dem in 2010. The figures also show that Green supporters are disproportionately likely to be under 40, university educated, professional and female. For Ukip, it’s the opposite. If you’re a detailed account of how the Green party emerged in recent years from obscurity to become semi-mainstream, this article by Adam Ramsay for Bright Green, The history of a political surge, is excellent. He looks at the internal, party, factors that have made a difference, as well as the external ones, and he argues that Natalie Bennett’s influence has been important. And choosing to have a leader in the first place was key too, he says. All of this leads us back to another vital date: November 30 2007. Because the very existence of a leader made much of this change easier. The post was only created in the party after a referendum among the membership, whose result was declared that day. The change didn’t only allow for one new role in the party: it signalled a new seriousness. Perhaps most importantly, in hindsight, it let the party finally move on from the “realo/fundi” (realist/fundamentalist) debates which had plagued Greens across Europe in the Nineties, and to focus instead on questions relevant to, well, anyone apart from the hacks. Closure on the issue also meant that two powerful groups in the party and their fellow travellers: Young Greens (who tended to be on the left, but pro-leader ‘realos’) and Green Left (who were very much anti-leader ‘fundies’), were able to move beyond these disagreements on internal structures, and push through the various changes I’ve listed above. Here’s a gem from the conference agenda. Someone once claimed that the most scary words that a politician can hear are: “Michael Crick is in the lobby to see you.”. But it’s good to see that he is welcome up here. Another sign of the Greens emergence as a more prominent party is that journalists are starting to write about personality splits within it. This does not happen with more minor parties, because reporters tend not to know who any of the personalities are. Earlier this week Anoosh Chakelian wrote a lengthy piece for the New Statesman, under the headline “the Granola Pact”, about the relationship between Natalie Bennett, the leader, and her predecessor., Caroline Lucas. Chakelian’s conclusion was that, although there are tensions between the two women, they are not too serious. The splits for now are only shallow, and the Greens’ startling last-minute success in terms of polling and membership figures remains the bigger story. Bennett is likely to hold on to the leadership, and Lucas is just as likely to remain professional and supportive, as well as a popular MP. However, signs of infighting are not necessarily a bad thing. Blair and Brown’s civil war raged throughout Labour’s most successful period in modern times, after all. Just as press scrutiny of Green policies means they’re finally being taken seriously, internal spats means they’re finally growing up as a party. As one party official quipped on the day of Bennett’s LBC interview: “So we’re getting a pasting. Welcome to the club.” If you are looking for a more hard-hitting account of splits within the Green party, you should read Matthew Holehouse’s lengthy article about the party for the Telegraph today. He has been reading what party members were saying about Bennett on a private, internal online message board after her disastrous LBC interview, and the findings are not flattering. A minority argue that the cynical public would warm to a fallible, unpolished leader. For many members, however, it was a decisive exchange. It was preceded with an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Neil in which Ms Bennett had struggled to explain how the proposed wealth taxes would work. Later, she told BBC Radio 4 that concessions should be granted to Vladimir Putin. “The SNP has been very adept. UKIP has been successful. We are throwing away golden opportunities”, said one member. Another claimed a friend had left “because she didn’t trust Natalie Bennett to be a credible prime minister.” “When she said the other day she will be our voice on the debates, my heart sank,” said another. A recent recruit wrote: “She was a total disaster and she sounded like a rank amateur. She really has to resign and let someone take over who has the intellect to think on their feet and handle the media.” And, while we’re on the subject of polling, here’s today’s Guardian seat projection. Conservatives: 276 Labour: 271 SNP: 52 Lib Dems: 25 Ukip: 4 Greens: 1 Here is a YouGov chart illustrating how support for the Greens has risen over the last year or so. It shows party support from October 2013. And here are the figures for 18 to 24-year-olds. Amongst this age group, the Greens are the third most popular party. I’ve taken the charts from the New Statesman’s excellent May2015 election data website. I’m in the press room at the ACC conference centre in Liverpool, and it’s clear the Greens have hit the big time; Michael Crick from Channel 4 News is here. There aren’t many other people about. The conference does not get going properly until lunchtime. In the meantime, here’s a statement the party released overnight from Caroline Lucas, the Green MP. She says the party should try to form a “progressive alliance” in parliament after the election with the SNP (and Plaid Cymru too, I presume). With the rise of the SNP, and with our own Green surge, we have the chance to forge a new grouping in parliament. A progressive alliance. Of course, in Scotland and in Wales we’ll be fighting hard for our distinctive values and policies. Just as we do against those individual Labour and even Lib Dem candidates with whom we have something in common. That’s the nature of British politics under the first past the post system. In her new book, Honourable Friends? - Parliament and the Fight for Change, Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, writes about how hard it has been for small parties like hers to make progress in British politics. Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats could agree on one thing at least: they wanted to leave no space for alternative voices. Indeed, if politics were a business – and I sometimes wonder if that is so far-fetched an idea – it would be a prime case for a referral to the Competition and Markets Authority for monopolistic collusion in excluding new entrants to the market. That’s a long-standing complaint, but over the last year it is starting to become marginally less applicable than it was. Ukip and the Greens have been flourishing, and they have both – Ukip, constantly, by a big margin; the Greens, sometimes – been coming ahead of the Lib Dems in the polls. (Today’s YouGov poll puts Ukip on 15%, the Greens 8% and the Lib Dems 6%). Greens have managed to secure inclusion in the proposed TV debates, despite Ofcom ruling that they are not a major party. And today they are holding a conference which is described as the largest in the party’s history. Around 1,3000 people are expected to attend the event in Liverpool. The party’s membership has quadrupled over the last 12 months, and yesterday it stood at 55,638. Almost half those coming to the spring conference, which runs until Monday lunchtime, are new members. That means the stakes are a lot higher than they used to be at previous conferences, when the party was routinely subject to a virtual national media blackout. Natalie Bennett, the party leader, is speaking this afternoon and, in a blog for the Staggers, the Green activist Adam Ramsay says this will be “the most important speech in the history of the party”. In her opening speech to her party’s conference this weekend, [Bennett] needs to inspire an explosion of excitement without raising unrealistic expectations. She has to encourage a flourishing of activity yet gather a focussing of energy. She must give journalists one hell of a headline while speaking to the manifold concerns which have attracted almost one in a thousand adults in the UK to become a signed up Green Party member in the past year. And she will have to do all of that only 240 short hours after her “day from hell”. That’s a reference, of course, to her recent “mind blank” or “brain fade” LBC interview. I’m on the train on the way to Liverpool now and I will be live blogging from the conference until about 4pm. Here’s the agenda. 1pm: Press briefing. 2pm: Natalie Bennett speaks, following an introduction from Caroline Lucas. 3pm: Panel discussion on what Syriza’s victory in Greece means for the left in Britain, featuring Caroline Lucas, Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP, Adam Ramsay from Open Democracy (and author of that Staggers piece), the Guardian’s Zoe Williams and Kostas Loukeris, a member of the ruling council of the Greek Green party.

The decision to restart reactors three and four at Oi power plant in western Japan could pave the way for the resumption of operations at other atomic facilities, amid concern over power shortages during peak demand this summer. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, announced the restart after securing support from the mayor of Oi and the governor of Fukui prefecture, where Oi is located. \"Having won local consent, reactivating [the reactors] is now the government's final decision,\" Noda said. \"We are determined to make further efforts to restore people's trust in nuclear policy and safety regulations.\" Japan's last working reactor was turned off in early May, leaving it without nuclear power for the first time in more than 40 years. Four reactors at Fukushima Daiichi were destroyed by the 11 March 2011 tsunami and another 50 around the country were taken offline for regular maintenance. Oi is the first plant to pass simulation \"stress tests\" introduced last year to address public concern over safety. Noda has pushed hard for the Oi restart under pressure from the powerful business lobby, which feared disruption to manufacturers. He was expected to give approval after the mayor of Oi, Shinobu Tokioka, gave his backing to the move earlier this week. Tokioka said nuclear safety experts had convinced him the plant could withstand a natural catastrophe similar to the one that struck Fukushima Daiichi. He added that he was concerned about the effect prolonged closure would have on the local economy and the prospect of power shortages in the Kansai region of western Japan, home to 24 million people and with an economy the size of Australia's. About 10,000 demonstrators gathered outside Noda's office on Friday night in last-ditch attempt to derail the restart. Anti-nuclear campaigners accused the prime minister of rushing into a decision and ignoring lingering concerns over safety. \"Prime minister Noda's rushed, dangerous approval of the Oi nuclear power plant restart ignores expert safety advice and public outcry, and needlessly risks the health of Japan's environment, its people and its economy,\" said Junichi Sato, executive director of Greenpeace Japan. \"Japan has already survived the peak summer and winter energy demand periods once with little nuclear power online, as well as a full month with none, and despite continued fear-mongering statements from industry and government about the need for restarting Oi, the economy has still grown remarkably well and there have been no significant energy shortages.\" The operator of the Oi plant, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), had warned that the region would face a 15% electricity shortfall in July and August, and had urged consumers to make power savings. But the trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, warned against wastefulness, as it will take Kepco about six weeks to bring both reactors to full capacity. \"Safety is our main concern,\" he said. \"It will take some time for the reactors to begin generating electricity, and we request that people continue to save energy. If there are safety problems, the process could be delayed.\" The government did not require local approval, but Noda and a small team of ministers have spent weeks attempting to win support from residents amid widespread fears over safety and a loss of trust in the nuclear industry in the wake of the Fukushima accident. The Japanese public remains divided over nuclear power, more than a year after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown sent radioactive materials into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents. According to a nationwide poll by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper earlier this month, 71% of people cautioned against a rush to restart the Oi reactors, while 25% supported Noda's stance. Noda has vowed to lessen Japan's dependence on nuclear power and increase the role of renewables. Nuclear once provided about a third of Japan's electricity, but plans to increase that share to more than 50% with the construction of more reactors was scrapped after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/nov/23/energy-bill-wind-power-davey-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-23T15:25:00Z","webTitle":"The £200bn gamble on our energy future | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/nov/23/energy-bill-wind-power-davey-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/nov/23/energy-bill-wind-power-davey-osborne","fields":{"headline":"The £200bn bet on our energy future","bodyText":"There is a simple way to think about the complex energy policy decisions made today: it is a £200bn bet on the UK's energy future. What's more, the money on the table belongs to you. Win or lose, every electricity and gas customer will pick up the tab for this wager for decades to come. In such a high-rolling game, you would have hoped for cool heads. Instead, \"unholy war\" was waged behind the Westminster scenes, a senior participant told me. Worse, the boiling row within the coalition was driven as much by ideology and party politics as cold, hard facts. In fact, the opposing sides had \"different facts\", the source said. All sides agreed on one thing at least. The problem the much-delayed energy bill seeks to solve is a fiendish one. It requires predicting the future and is not so much a dilemma as a trilemma. The solution must keep the lights on while simultaneously preventing energy bill payers from being fleeced and tackling the ever-growing dangers of climate change. Furthermore, we are not starting from a strong position. Two decades of under-investment in our energy infrastructure has left a dirty and decaying system. Action was unavoidable, meaning the question was not will energy bills go up, but by how much? The more adventurous punters among may be happy that chancellor George Osborne refused to curb his new dash for gas, spiced as that prospect is by the possibility of a shale gas revolution in the UK. Gas prices will plummet, say fracking supporters, so why waste so much money on renewable energy? Never mind that relying on gas puts the nation on the rollercoaster ride of fossil fuel geopolitics. The fact, for example, that a half of the UK's gas imports come through the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran has threatened to close, just adds to the excitement. With risky bets, of course, the odds are long. No one outside the fracking industry thinks shale gas is a silver bullet for the UK's energy trilemma. Nor is anyone placing serious money on European gas prices declining, not least because demand for the fuel is rising so fast elsewhere in the world. The alternative wager, backed by the Liberal Democrats, was a more diverse flutter - a bit of gas, renewable energy and nuclear. But energy secretary Ed Davey was out-muscled by Osborne and only a bit of the nation's stake money is backing this bet. The lack of full backing means that, despite the green sector being one of the few growing parts of the UK's torpid economy, those jobs are now more likely to go abroad. Where does this leave us? Given that keeping the lights on is non-negotiable and that cutting carbon emissions is a legal requirement, the critical factor is cost. At this point, the complexity of the energy bill starts to make the financial engineering that crashed the economy look like primary school arithmetic. In the arcane algebra of contracts-for-difference, capacity mechanisms and carbon floor prices, there are plenty of hiding places for jackpot wins for energy companies at their customers expense. Ministers are effectively negotiating with one company for the nuclear power it believes is needed soon – scarcely the scenario to deliver a bargain for energy bill payers. Those building new gas plants are demanding payments too, in case carbon targets mean the plants can only run part-time. Of course, renewable energy providers are also arguing hard for their subsidies. But they have a trump card: while the cost of gas and nuclear power is on an upward trend, the cost of green energy and its subsidies is already falling. The greatest failing of the new energy policy is the woeful underplaying of the cheapest option of all: energy efficiency. Almost all the incentives are aimed at producing more power, none at reducing the demand. Why is the UK planning for an increase in electricity demand of up to two-thirds in 2050, when Europe's manufacturing powerhouse, Germany, is planning for a cut of a quarter? As a nation we have now pretty much paid our money and taken our choice. The coalition has staked a good bit of our money on Osborne's bet that international gas prices won't spike and that the UK's shale gas hype bubble won't burst, meaning relatively cheap, clean wind power can be passed up without consequence. We still have a bit on the plan that emphasises exploiting the renewable resources on our doorstep, creating a secure and sustainable energy system. But overall, in the great energy gamble, we've chosen a long odds bet rather than back the favourite and we will pay the price."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/dec/16/japanese-hawk-victory-fears-tension","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-16T17:22:24Z","webTitle":"Japanese hawk's election victory prompts fears of regional tension","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/japanese-hawk-victory-fears-tension","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/dec/16/japanese-hawk-victory-fears-tension","fields":{"headline":"Japanese hawk's election victory prompts fears of regional tension","bodyText":"East Asia is bracing for an era of tension and confrontation after Japan's general elections returned a hawkish conservative to power. The Liberal Democratic party's resounding victory on Sunday threatens to further impair relations with China if the new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, makes good on promises to take a tough stance in a territorial row. Yesterday's result marked a dramatic comeback for the LDP, three years after it was ousted by the left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), ending its near monopoly on power for five decades. Abe, who is expected to be installed as Japan's seventh prime minister in six years on Boxing day, has vowed to strengthen Japan's military in the face of Beijing's more aggressive posture in the East China Sea and North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. A furious reaction is expected from Beijing if the LDP goes ahead with campaign pledges to develop fisheries and build on the Senkakus, a group of islands administered by Japan but also claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyu. China's Xinhua news agency warned Japan to resist the shift to the right that has characterised the election, held months after Chinese demonstrators attacked Japanese businesses following Japan's purchase of the islands from their private owners. \"An economically weak and politically angry Japan will not only hurt the country, but also hurt the region and the world at large,\" Xinhua said. \"Japan, which brought great harm and devastation to other Asian countries in the second world war, will raise further suspicions among its neighbours if the current political trend of turning right is not stopped in time.\" Some analysts believe Abe, who resigned as prime minister in 2007 after only a year in office, will adopt a more conciliatory approach towards China – Japan's biggest trading partner – once the realities of political office kick in, citing his fence-mending visit to Beijing early during his previous term as prime minister. \"For all his nationalist credentials, I suspect Abe will be more pragmatic,\" said John Swenson-Wright, senior consulting fellow for Asia at Chatham House. \"If he's in this for the long game and wants to last longer as prime minister than he did the first time, he certainly has the motivation to be more pragmatic.\" Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, predicted Abe would come under pressure from his own party to implement his hawkish agenda. \"During his campaign to lead the LDP, he said he regretted moderating his stance on China the first time he was prime minister,\" Nakano said. \"This is his last chance, so will he want to go down as someone who moderates his views when in office, or as a conviction politician? My feeling is that he'll go for the latter. \"The right wing of the LDP installed him as party leader, and I don't think he has the authority or the personality to keep a grip on them. They chose him because they know he's easy to manipulate.\" Speaking on TV after his victory, Abe, 58, signalled that he would make the economy his priority. \"First and foremost we have to bring about an economic recovery and pull Japan out of deflation,\" he said. The economy had been in dire straits for three years and was his top priority. \"We must strengthen our alliance with the US and also improve relations with China, with a strong determination that there is no change in the fact that the Senkaku Islands are our territory.\" Exit polls indicated the LDP was on course to win about 300 seats, and its traditional ally, New Komeito, about 30 seats. Combined, that would give them the \"supermajority\" they need in the 480-seat lower house to pass legislation through both houses of parliament unchallenged. The incumbent prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, whose DPJ is expected to win 65 seats – a fifth of the number it won in 2009 – said he would resign as party leader to take responsibility for its heavy defeat. \"I apologise deeply for our failure to achieve results,\" he said. \"This was the voters' verdict on our failure to live up to their expectations during our three years and three months in power.\" Abe also supports revisions to the constitution to give Japan's military a more prominent role, and is expected to reverse Noda's decision to abandon nuclear power – a response to last year's triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant – by 2040. Under Abe, Japan can expect a return to high spending on public works – a clear sign that the conservative old guard has returned. The election also saw the emergence of a third force in the form of the Japan Restoration party, a far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, that was predicted to win between 40 and 61 seats. At one point, polls suggested that the Restoration party could overtake the DPJ as the country's second-biggest party and act as powerbroker in a hung parliament. That level of influence now looks unlikely, but LDP officials suggested the new administration could turn to Ishihara for support if it decides to revise the constitution – another measure expected to antagonise China and South Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/13/snowtown-windfarm-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-13T15:55:01Z","webTitle":"Winds of change blow through Snowtown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/13/snowtown-windfarm-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/13/snowtown-windfarm-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Winds of change blow through Snowtown","bodyText":"Snowtown is surrounded by picturesque farmland and salt lakes but the beauty is at odds with its gory reputation as the home of the infamous \"bodies in the barrels\" discovery – a badge the town is hoping to lose with the completion of the country's second-largest windfarm. The stunning landscape, just two hours' drive from Adelaide, is already dotted with the turbines of the Snowtown Wind Farm, which will be the largest of its kind in South Australia. Trust Power, the owner of the enormous energy project, expects to complete the second stage of construction of 90 turbines by late 2014 and says it will power more than 40% of the state by 2020. Residents have been hoping the wind farm will give them a new kind of notoriety ever since it was proposed a few years after police discovered the bodies of eight murder victims stored in barrels of acid and hidden inside the rented Snowtown bank building in May 1999. The convoluted and gruesome story of what turned out to be one of Australia's worst mass murders horrified the country, and a highly regarded and publicised 2011 movie based on the killings contributed to international renown. Between 1992 and 1999 12 people were brutally killed by a group of Adelaide men led by John Bunting. The victims were all known to at least one of the killers – often a relative, friend or neighbour. The joint trial of Bunting and Robert Wagner revealed evidence of horrific actions including dismemberment, prolonged torture and cannibalism. The two men were sentenced to life without parole. The case has shackled the small town of 500 with a grim and undeserved celebrity. The murders didn't actually involve anyone from Snowtown. \"People themselves don't think about it,\" says resident Ros Large. \"It's when tourists come in and say 'where's the bank', and you just go 'what, again?'. \"I know they're curious to know where the bank is and that sort of thing, but gosh, that happened 15 years ago.\" Residents are well and truly over talking about the murders – but it brings them attention, and with it business. The local gift shop sells small barrel figurines and fridge magnets (\"Snowtown - You'll have a barrel of fun\"). There was also once talk of changing the name to Rosetown but it was quickly mooted. The town doesn't do a great job of helping people forget, however. Visitors do a double take when they reach the turn-off at the highway. Below the sign pointing right to Snowtown is another – the brown and white kind that signals a tourist attraction – reading \"the Big Blade\". Snowtown and a \"Big Blade\" monument? Surely it wouldn't be so crass? But it's not what you expect; the \"blade\" is a rotor blade from one of the enormous wind turbines, mounted on poles in the centre of town in tribute to the project that people hope will reassign their infamy. The windfarm is a boon for the town and Snowtown is also unique in its overwhelmingly positive reaction to the energy project. \"We've got no complaints,\" resident Alan Large told Guardian Australia when we visited. \"The Snowtown people are quite happy about the fact that the wind farms are here.\" Large said the windfarm in nearby Clare is \"getting flack about the noise and chickens laying eggs with no yolks and things like that\". But he and his wife Ros don't understand that. The sentiment echoes among the area's population. All the turbines are on private land, and Trust Power constructed several fire trails which came in handy for local firefighters when recent lightning strikes sparked a couple of bushfires. The energy retailer also contributes $15,000 a year to the community through the Lend a Hand Foundation which Large runs as president of the Snowtown Lions Club. The foundation funds small projects in Snowtown and the wider community with the money and has \"no trouble spending it every year\". Recent purchases include a lawn mower for the bowling club, a skate park for local kids and emergency response pendants for some of the elderly population. The contribution – which also received a $10,000 bump from turbine manufacturer Siemens this year – will increase to $45,000 from next year. The Larges have lived in Snowtown for around 50 years, which they said makes them \"nearly locals. You have your ups and downs with it, but all together it's really a good town,\" said Mrs Large. Dennis and Andreen Tothill, who own 1000 acres in the area, say the town got a bad name it didn't deserve from the murders, but there's nothing you can do to change it. As soon as the windfarm project was given the go ahead, the Tothills signed up, eager for the financial security it offered farmers and the environmental benefits of renewable energy. \"It's always been a daydream, always,\" says Mrs Tothill. \"The windfarm is a constant income whether it's raining or whether it's a drought.\" Mr Tothill added: \"I'd rather have these than a nuclear power station sitting here.\" The seven turbines on the Tothill property are along a high ridgeline that's only useful for grazing, and the animals aren't bothered, often seeking shelter in the shade of the machines. \"Our ridge tops don't interfere with tourism or anything else,\" Mrs Tothill said. \"And we're all just grateful as hell.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2013/sep/08/tokyo-2020-olympics-jubilation-relief","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-08T09:55:37Z","webTitle":"Tokyo 2020 Olympics: hugs, tears and shouts of 'banzai' greet news of victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/08/tokyo-2020-olympics-jubilation-relief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/sep/08/tokyo-2020-olympics-jubilation-relief","fields":{"headline":"Tokyo 2020 Olympics: hugs, tears and shouts of 'banzai' greet news of victory","bodyText":"TV presenters struggled to rein in their emotions, while newspapers rushed out special editions. Olympians yelled \"banzai!\" and a rainbow emerged through the drizzle as Tokyo greeted the news that it had been chosen to host the 2020 Olympics. Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), had barely finished uttering the city's name thousands of miles away in Buenos Aires when thousands of Tokyoites began celebrating. There were hugs, tears, and relief that the Games were coming to their city for the second time. The 2,000 supporters who had gathered at a gymnasium near Komazawa stadium – built for the first Tokyo Olympics in 1964 – cheered as the IOC's decision was relayed via a big screen. Gold ticker tape fell from the ceiling while TV reporters struggled to make themselves heard. Some had stayed up all night for the announcement at 5.20am local time; others woke early, buoyed by the news that Madrid – long seen as Tokyo's main rival – had been squeezed out by Istanbul in the first round of voting. After a two-year campaign that has been far from trouble-free, the jubilation was matched by a huge sense of relief. In recent days, Tokyo's bid appeared to be fading amid a slew of bad news from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, 140 miles to the north. But enough of the 96 voting members of the IOC – if they had any doubts about Fukushima – were won over by 11th-hour assurances from Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that radiation from the destroyed plant posed no threat to Tokyo. \"Let me assure you the situation is under control,\" said Abe, who had left the G20 summit in Russia early to make Tokyo's final pitch. \"It has never done and will never do any damage to Tokyo.\" In the end, the margin of victory – 60 votes for Tokyo to Istanbul's 36 – was wider than Japanese bid officials could have dared hoped for. \"My heart was pounding before the announcement – I am so happy,\" Abe said, adding that Japan would respond to the support it received \"by holding a successful Games. I think we conveyed the message that we can hold a safe Olympics.\" Mitsushi Matsufuji, a company worker who ran from his home to Komazawa to watch the announcement, said the decision had given Japan \"courage and hope, especially after the March 2011 disaster\". He added: \"I'm willing to trust the government to take care of the problems in Fukushima. It's going to be tough to organise the Games, but this is our chance to tell the rest of the world that Japan is OK.\" In another part of the city, more than 1,200 Olympic athletes and dignitaries crammed into a convention hall greeted the news with the traditional victory cry of \"banzai!\" \"This is a credit to the efforts of the entire nation,\" said Saori Yoshida, a three-time gold medallist in women's wrestling and a bid ambassador. \"The chance to see the highest level of sport live is a great chance for everyone, and as an Olympic athlete I'm thrilled.\" Having offered assurances that the Fukushima water leaks posed no threat to the health of greater Tokyo's 35 million residents, Abe is expected to come under renewed pressure to address the mounting problems at the plant. In the two and a half years since a tsunami on Japan's north-east coast killed almost 19,000 people and made hundreds of thousands homeless, the recovery effort has been blighted by bureaucratic bungling and a lack of leadership. Some among the 160,000 people who were forced to evacuate after the tsunami triggered a triple meltdown in Fukushima plant said the billions of dollars earmarked for Tokyo 2020 would be better spent on fixing the leaks and decontaminating their irradiated home towns. Repeated official assurances that Tokyo is safe \"only serve to show that the situation in Fukushima is serious\", a woman who was evacuated from Fukushima to Tokyo told the Mainichi Shimbun before the vote. Last month, the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, admitted that about 300 tonnes of contaminated groundwater were flowing into the Pacific every day. Then, in what some feared could deal a decisive blow to Tokyo's Olympic prospects, news emerged of more leaks from several tanks used to store contaminated water. The 1964 Tokyo Games, held less than 20 years after Japan's defeat in the second world war, signalled the country's emergence from the shadow of militarist misadventure and the start of a period of rapid economic growth. Some have questioned Tokyo's decision to bid again after unsuccessful attempts for the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, given the size of Japan's public debt – now more than twice the size of its $6tn economy. The Tokyo Olympics will use refurbished venues and several new sports arenas. Along with infrastructure projects, the bill has been estimated at just under $8bn (£5.1bn). The city already has $4.5bn in an Olympic reserve fund. Hosting the 2020 Games could produce positive economic effects of more than $40bn and create more than 150,000 jobs, according to SMBC Nikko Securities. Japanese companies will benefit from rising demand in the construction sector, with an expected boom in sales of consumer electronics and other items. The government hopes to attract 8.5 million tourists during the event. In response to concern about finances, bid officials promised a compact \"downtown Games\" with most of the venues located close to the athletes' village. The events will centre on the main Olympic stadium – a futuristic 80,000-seat arena due for completion in time for the rugby World Cup in 2019. While doubts linger about Japan's ability to clean up the Fukushima plant, there is no questioning the country's Olympic pedigree: the Winter Games came to Sapporo in 1972, and to Nagano in 1998. New stadium When the Olympic Games in Tokyo is declared open, the ceremony will take place in a striking stadium designed by British architect Zaha Hadid. The $1bn stadium, which has a retractable roof, has been described as a cross between a giant bicycle helmet and an alien spacecraft and will provide a common link between the London 2012 and Tokyo 2020. While much of Tokyo's bid stressed the certainty and safety of its plans, commissioning Hadid to redesign the Kasumigaoka national stadium was a bold statement, closer in scale of ambition to Beijing's iconic Bird's Nest than London's pared-down design. Hadid, whose signature curves and bold designs adorn a growing range of cities from Beijing to Baku, also designed the undulating £251m Aquatics Centre for the London Games. The venue, which spiralled in cost due to the ambitious design, incorporated temporary wings on either side that have now been removed. Construction is due to begin in 2015.The original stadium, now almost 50 years old, hosted the 1964 Olympics. \"The design is both light and cohesive, seamlessly connecting the stadium's different elements to create a silhouette that integrates with the city,\" Hadid said when she won the commission. The architect was not the only British link to the Tokyo bid. A company founded by consultant Nick Varley, who worked on earlier successful bids for London and Rio, co-ordinated the presentation, speeches and bid literature that were a key component in Tokyo's success after two previous bid failures.

Yet the emphasis on new roads and HS2 will be cost-escalating and take money away from the kind of local infrastructure spending that would result in economic activity nationwide. This in turn could be fairly taxed and so get rid of the need for cuts, while helping rescue our flagging economy. Tens of billions spent on low-carbon infrastructure and affordable housing would generate jobs, business and investment opportunities in every city, town, village and hamlet in the UK. Making every building in the UK energy-efficient and repairing, maintaining and improving the public transport system could prioritise the use of UK manufacturers. A crackdown on tax dodgers would make billions available to pump prime such an initiative. The result would be a reduction in public debt through a programme that improves society, the environment and the economy – the very opposite of the present cuts.

On the other hand it's consistent with the G4S/Olympics fiasco. RE Cooper Woodbridge, Suffolk • The British Geological Survey reports that the north of England could have up to 13 trillion cubic feet of shale gas underground (Report, 28 June). This government has stated that local communities could benefit by \"sharing in this wealth\", but no drilling permit should be issued without a cast-iron guarantee that the revenue is predominantly invested in the north on infrastructure, industry, especially manufacturing, and education. This potential bonanza must not be diverted to the south-east, nor, as North Sea oil revenue was, squandered on keeping million on the dole. Alan Quinn Prestwich, Manchester • Having cut millions in public spending, the government has awarded the £1.4bn contract for building the rolling stock for the cross-London Thameslink rail route to Siemens, a German company, instead of keeping the work, the jobs and the money in this country (Report, 28 June). Is this a failure of joined-up thinking or is it economic, political and social suicide? David Hurry Hurstpierpoint, Sussex • By announcing a £50bn capital investment programme for 2015-16, the government has recognised that an effective and efficient transport infrastructure is key to economic growth. While big ticket projects are important, modernisation and maintenance programmes can have a more immediate impact on the economy through the creation and retention of essential jobs. During London 2012, Thales UK, in partnership with London Underground, upgraded the Jubilee line. We urge Transport for London to press ahead with the modernisation of the rest of the network.

Yet that very day the Treasury announced £28bn of spending on the road network, without earmarking a single penny for cycling. The parliamentary Get Britain Cycling inquiry called for annual spending of at least £10 per person on cycling, noting that London's spending plans equate to £12.50 per person, while the Dutch spend £24. Outside London, England's spending levels still average below £2 per person. Yet cycling is good for our streets and communities, our local and global environments, our wallets and our waistlines. Can the same really be said of yet more road-building? Roger Geffen Campaigns &amp; policy director, CTC, the national cycling charity • The announcement that the government will be committing £100bn to UK infrastructure projects is certainly a much-needed long-term boost for the construction industry. But it will not benefit the industry for at least two years. The sector needs growth now. ONS figures and the Construction Industry Training Board's own labour market intelligence report show that the UK output fell 9% last year and is unlikely, without help, to attain 2007 levels until 2022; 60,000 construction jobs were lost in 2012 with 45,000 expected to go this year. \"Shovel-ready\" projects in the repair and maintenance sector should be receiving similar investment. Every £100m invested in repair and maintenance takes 3,200 workers off the dole. Yes, funds are tight but better to invest for growth than spend £8.1bn maintaining these same people out of work.

With wages rising in China, increasing transport costs, and benefits from production close to the fashion markets, textile production in the UK can be competitive again.

Fallon, a strong supporter of shale gas extraction, told a private meeting in Westminster: \"We are going to see how thick their rectory walls are, whether they like the flaring at the end of the drive.\" Fallon, who is MP for Sevenoaks in Kent, said exploratory studies for hydraulic fracturing – or fracking – were already poised to start in the north of England and were set to spread the length and breadth of southern England. He said: \"The second area being studied is the Weald. It's from Dorset all the way along through Hampshire, Sussex, East Sussex, West Sussex, all the way perhaps a bit into Surrey and even into my county of Kent. It's right there.\" Fallon then referred to support for fracking among what he called the \"commentariat\" – newspaper opinion writers. \"The beauty of that – please don't write this down – is that of course it's underneath the commentariat. \"All these people writing leaders saying 'Why don't they get on with shale?' – we are going to see how thick their rectory walls are, whether they like the flaring at the end of the drive.\" Fracking experts have already admitted that the extraction method could result in flares several feet high as leaked gas is burned off rather than being allowed to leak into the atmosphere. Charles Moore, biographer of Margaret Thatcher, lives in a £1.5m rectory in Etchingham, East Sussex, and has admitted that his support for shale gas extraction may conflict with his personal interests. Moore wrote last month that shale gas was \"a great advance\" though it was lucky that much was in the north where there were \"not many spoilt rich people to complain\". But he added that there was said to be \"lots more under the Sussex Weald where I live\" and he faced having to be \"true to my beliefs\". Drilling for oil close to the West Sussex village of Balcombe has begun after a week of blockades and protests by both villagers and anti-fracking activists. Fallon has said in public that fracking will not damage the countryside. \"Claims that exploration involves ruining the countryside are nonsense,\" he said. \"A typical shale gas pad is expected to be little larger than a cricket ground.\" He said he had visited a conventional drilling site \"tucked away in the South Downs national park, which shows how oil and gas operations can work even in the most sensitive environment\". Fallon conceded that there was bound to be some disruption but said this could be overcome with compensation of £100,000 for each exploratory well site. The concern for the Tories is that they are about to find themselves pitted against their rural base again, as they have been over windfarms, planning laws and the High Speed 2 rail line. But Fallon has said that in the US, where the fracking industry is well advanced, \"there is no evidence of fracking causing any groundwater contamination\". Energy companies are only being authorised to search for the possible location of shale gas – not to exploit it. But ministers are preparing generous compensation to overcome resistance as they have for wind farms and nuclear power stations. In his private briefing at Westminster, reported in the Mail on Sunday, Fallon stressed that local communities affected by fracking would be rewarded with generous royalties in the form of compensation to improve local facilities. He said: \"If that is between five and 10m quid and there are 20 wells in your area, the local area and the immediate residents will benefit substantially.\" Fallon said it was time to \"get on\" with fracking. \"We now know there is probably twice as much shale in the north as we originally thought. \"It looks as if there's much more shale gas here than anybody realised and it looks as if the shale is thicker than the shale in the US where there have been dramatic reductions in people's gas bills and in the cost of energy for business. \"What we don't yet know is whether we can get it out as efficiently and cheaply as they have been able to in the States and that is the purpose of these studies. \"We are sitting on all this shale. We owe it to the next generation to go down there, let these companies go down there and find out whether we can extract it and whether this is a new, large source of cheap energy.\" The official estimate is that the UK has 37 trillion cubic metres of shale gas in the north of England; geologists have yet to quantify reserves in the south. Polling for the Sunday Times by YouGov shows quite strong support for fracking so long as it is part of an energy mix. But the Liberal Democrat president, Tim Farron, put himself at the helm of those in the coalition concerned at the pace with which the government is moving. He said: \"I am afraid the government has seen flashing pound signs, and has not considered the long-term threats fracking poses to the countryside. \"I think this is a very short-sighted policy, and we will all be left to live with the consequences. With a wind farm you can actually choose where you put it; that is not the case with fracking. \"This technology can lead to earth tremors and I'm particularly worried that buried nuclear waste in my part of the country could be affected. We should be investing more in renewable fuels. \"I am very sceptical. The green movement were pro wind farms, and countryside groups were against. With fracking you are already seeing powerful alliances forming between those two groups, so opposition could become very strong.\" Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat communities minister, warned there could be danger from fracking in his Bath constituency since it would take place very close to the water tables that supply the city. Foster said his Lib Dem colleague the energy secretary Ed Davey was taking a proportionate, cautious approach: \"There is a potential for significant benefit to our energy security but because of environmental concerns we are doing it in a very careful way.\" Craig Bennett, director of of Friends of the Earth's policy and campaigns, said: \"Michael Fallon's unguarded comments will resonate across the UK and fuel more opposition to the government's disastrous support for fracking. \"Ministers must pull the plug on shale gas and oil extraction, especially as there's plenty of evidence they won't lead to cheaper fuel bills. \"We need an energy policy based on cutting waste and developing the nation's huge renewable power potential – not one that wrecks our clean and pleasant land and pumps more pollution into our atmosphere.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/30/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-30T16:25:55Z","webTitle":"Green news round-up: Nuclear power, adder abnormalities and Earth Hour in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/30/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/30/1","fields":{"headline":"Green news round-up: Nuclear power, adder abnormalities and Earth Hour in pictures","bodyText":"Climate and energy • Fukushima disaster causes fallout for nuclear industry worldwide • Nuclear is the safest form of power, says top UK scientist • UK slips down global green investment rankings • Smart meters predicted to save UK households £23 a year by 2020 • Lord Lawson's 'misleading' climate claims challenged by scientific adviser Wildlife • Adder abnormalities lead to UK's first genetic survey of snakes • India's tiger numbers increase for first time in a decade, says census • Serengeti highway threatens national park's wildebeest migration • Spring's here: skylarks overhead, moles in the garden, moths in the bathroom Multimedia • Agricultural patterns from space – in pictures • Below the waste line: Rolling with London's bin men - video • Genetic survey of adders - in pictures • Earth Hour - in pictures Green living • Nissan Leaf charges into UK car showrooms • Cycling England will soon be no more – but what can its successors achieve? • Neil Ansell: My life as a hermit • Why don't governments push for more hydrogen cars?

Local authorities decided to open Nakoso beach, located just 65km (40 miles) south of the stricken plant, after declaring the water safe. Radiation doses in the air were also low, at up to 0.07 microsieverts an hour, far below those considered a threat to health. On Monday, which was a national holiday held to celebrate the ocean, about 1,000 people, including young families, headed to the beach for the first time in two summers. \"The water's still cold, but it's going to be a good season,\" Yukiei Hakozaki, a local guide, told Kyodo News. \"We want lots of people to come.\" All 17 beaches in Fukushima prefecture, a popular surfing spot, were closed last summer amid concern over contamination from the power plant and debris created by the tsunami on 11 March, in which almost 20,000 people died. According to the local authorities, the concentration of radioactivity in the water is negligible, at below 1 becquerel per litre, and poses no risk to the health of sunbathers and swimmers. Radiation readings are displayed on the beach twice a day. Nakoso, the prefecture's southernmost beach, will have to accommodate local holidaymakers alone for the time being, as there are no plans to reopen other beaches in the area. While sunseekers in Fukushima marked the day with music, hula dancing and beach volleyball, tens of thousands of people marched in Tokyo calling for the closure of all of Japan's nuclear power plants. Organisers estimated that 170,000 people crammed into Yoyogi park in the capital, while the police put the figure closer to 75,000. The demonstration was part of a campaign to put pressure on the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, into reversing his decision to restart two nuclear reactors in western Japan to avoid possible power cuts this summer. One reactor at Oi power plant in Fukui prefecture was restarted earlier this month, while the second is expected to go back online later this week. The march was led by the Nobel literature laureate Kenzaburo Oe, who told the crowd: \"The government allowed the Oi nuclear reactors to restart and it's going to allow more reactors to restart. We feel we have been insulted by the government.\" Oe, along with the composer and musician Ryuichi Sakamoto and other activists, is putting together a petition of 10m signatures demanding an end to Japan's use of nuclear power.

It is understood to be the first such reported incident in the UK, although blades have fallen from turbines in a small number of cases. The turbine was sited on farmland in the Bradworthy area and fell down in the early hours of Sunday morning. Margaret Coles, chairwoman of Bradworthy parish council, which opposed the erection of the turbine, told the Daily Telegraph that strong winds had hit the area. \"The bolts on the base could not withstand the wind as we are a very windy part of the country. Dulas [the energy company] have egg on their face,\" she said. \"There are concerns about safety.\" A spokeswoman for Dulas said: \"We can reassure the local community that due to the isolated location of the turbine, no one was put at risk and we are currently working hard to establish the precise cause of the incident. Our technical team is one of the most experienced in the UK. They are working alongside the turbine manufacturer to conduct a full root-cause analysis investigation. Our initial assessment suggests the turbine did not catch fire, as has been reported.\" The turbine was relatively small, with a hub height of 24 metres and with a generating capacity of 0.05MW. Paul Thompson, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, said: \"It is important not to over-react to this incident, given that there are over 3,500 turbines in the UK with a total capacity of over 5,500MW. One benefit of having that capacity distributed across several thousand small generators is that when one goes offline, it doesn't have a major impact on the grid. However, that is not to take away from the safety concerns this incident raises, which industry will be looking at very carefully.\" Sources contacted by the Guardian were unable to identify any previous example of a turbine collapsing, but in 2009 a 20-metre blade fell from a turbine in Lincolnshire. Andrew Pendleton, at Friends of the Earth, said it was essential to determine how the turbine had come to collapse. \"But in a way the incident shows the advantage of having a decentralised energy system: when any one part goes down, it has no effect on energy security, unlike when major power stations go down.\" In 2011, a jellyfish bloom caused both reactors at Torness nuclear power plant to close down, taking 1200MW of capacity off the national electricity grid. The owners of East Ash Farm, where the Bradworthy turbine was sited, were recently given planning permission by Torridge district council to erect a second turbine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/may/22/scotland-independence-cost-billions-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-22T13:18:27Z","webTitle":"Scotland warned independence could cost billions in renewable subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/22/scotland-independence-cost-billions-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/may/22/scotland-independence-cost-billions-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Scotland warned independence could cost billions in renewable subsidies","bodyText":"Ed Davey, the UK energy secretary, has warned that Scotland could lose billions of pounds in subsidies for renewable energy projects if it voted for independence, putting its green energy revolution at risk. Davey told a renewable energy conference in Aberdeen that more than one-third of the UK's subsidies for wind, wave and tidal projects – currently £1.4bn a year – was spent in Scotland. That was worth £530m, even though only 9% of all UK electricity sales were in Scotland. The energy secretary said that there had been pledges of £13bn worth of investment, and 9,143 jobs, announced in Scottish renewables since 2010, with a further £16.5bn of promised investment in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. UK-wide investment in renewables would rise to £7.6bn a year by 2020, he said. Asking whether an independent Scotland could ever afford supporting that type of investment with just 10% of the market to fund it, the cabinet minister said: \"At present Scottish renewables benefit from the ability to spread investment costs across the whole of the UK consumer base. [I] believe Scottish renewables have flourished precisely because Scotland is part of the United Kingdom. Our collective energy system has underpinned the success seen to date.\" Davey's remarks will fuel further conflict with Alex Salmond's government after tit for tat threats about the potential conflicts between Scotland and the UK, assuming the nationalists overturn a big gap in the opinion polls to win next year's independence referendum. Political tensions between the two governments are growing, raising the stakes over future renewable energy cooperation. The first minister claimed on Tuesday that a future independent Scotland could refuse to pay its £92bn share of the UK's debts if the UK government refused to set up a new sterling currency zone. Salmond claims that all the current assets of the UK, including sterling, are commonly owned by all parts of the UK, and insists that Scotland's substantial green energy resources – theoretically the largest in Europe - greatly increase the arguments for close cooperation between Edinburgh and London. Scottish ministers claim that if the rest of UK hopes to hit its post-Kyoto climate and renewable energy targets, it is in London's interests to share the heavy investment needed to exploit Scotland's marine energy reserves. That potential was underscored at the same conference, when a major new wave power project off the Isle of Lewis – the largest in the world so far – was approved by the Scottish energy minister, Fergus Ewing. Ewing said Scottish ministers had now agreed a new system for increased funding for marine energy. Up to 50 Oyster 800 wave power machines, totalling 40MW, will be deployed by Edinburgh-based Aquamarine Energy off the island's north-west coast. UK ministers dispute that the rest of the UK would be heavily reliant on Scottish energy: Irish renewables, nuclear power and the UK's own offshore projects would be heavily used. Scottish power firms, which share a UK-wide \"single market\" of 23 million consumers, would have to compete with other suppliers, they state. Davey told delegates in Aberdeen: \"We cannot assume that English, Welsh and Northern Irish consumers would still be willing to subsidise Scottish renewables. \"But it will be much harder for a nation potentially having to spread the costs of investment in renewables across just two and a half million households to keep prices competitive.\" The £29bn of private sector investment in renewables is money that has been announced by companies, between January 2010 and April 2013, but much of it has not yet been delivered. The Department of Energy and Climate Change was unable to say how much had been deployed and how much was still at the planning stage. The projects that are being planned are uncertain – some may be windfarms or other installations such as biomass power plants that fail to gain planning permission, and the money also includes other investments that may not go ahead, depending on the financial and political environment. Private sector investors have repeatedly warned that they will reconsider their investments in renewables in the UK if the political environment is perceived to be hostile or policies liable to be revised in future. Many Tory MPs have fuelled this uncertainty through outspoken attacks on renewables and the subsidies for them. According to Decc estimates, the number of jobs to be created by the £29bn in private sector money is likely to be about 30,000. That would represent about £1m per job. However, a department spokesman stressed that this measure is only of the jobs directly created in the projects, and does not include jobs in the supply chain and related industries that will also be supported by the new investments. It also does not take into account existing jobs that are supported by the projects, nor the benefits of an overhaul to the UK's infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/29/ed-davey-energy-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-29T18:06:17Z","webTitle":"Ed Davey: energy reforms yield 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/29/ed-davey-energy-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/29/ed-davey-energy-reforms","fields":{"headline":"Ed Davey: energy reforms yield 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities","bodyText":"Reforms to the energy market announced on Thursday will yield \"once in a generation\" opportunities to cut bills and greenhouse gas emissions, according to the energy secretary, Ed Davey. Davey hailed the new energy bill as \"the biggest transformation to Britain's electricity market since privatisation\" and the product of a \"grand bargain\" within the coalition – the legislation has taken months of tough negotiation between the parties. Under the new bill, companies producing low-carbon energy – including renewables such as wind and solar power, and nuclear power – would receive a higher price for their energy than for that produced in fossil fuel power plants. But the prices will not be set until next summer, at the earliest, leaving investors in such power plants hanging. The government has also refused to set a date of 2030 for \"decarbonising\" the UK's power generation sector, as campaigners had urged. As a result of the continuing uncertainty, potential investments worth tens of billions in new manufacturing capacity for offshore wind and other renewable energy are still on hold, as investors weigh the UK government's commitments against those of rival economies. None of these details will be available until the middle of next year at the earliest. Davey said: \"The energy sector can play a major role in stimulating economic growth, creating jobs, and positioning British companies for success in export markets.\" Green campaigners had been hoping for more – both the Liberal Democrats and Labour favour a target of ensuring that the UK's electricity generation would be largely dependent on low-carbon sources, including renewables and carbon capture and storage technology, from 2030. That target is in line with a trajectory to meet international commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. The chief executive of Vestas, the world's biggest wind turbine manufacturer, told the Guardian such a target would generate new investment. Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"There is a gaping hole in the energy bill in the shape of a 2030 decarbonisation target. Billions of pounds of investment rest on this target being made law. Without it, there is serious risk of an investment vacuum after 2020, and of jobs and money being lost to our economic rivals.\" Under the proposed reforms, household energy bills should be, on average, between 5% and 9% lower than they would be otherwise between 2016 and 2030, despite the probability of rising fuel prices, if the government's forecasts are correct. The UK should also be able to meet its internationally agreed targets to cut emissions by more than a fifth by 2020, compared with 1990 levels. Talks are going on under the United Nations in Doha, Qatar, this week, on a new agreement on greenhouse gas emissions to be put in place after 2020. However, crucial details were missing from the energy bill. These include details on the support for the nuclear power industry, which is expected to receive a minimum price for electricity generated under the reforms. That price is expected to be greater than that for renewable energy such as offshore wind, but the details of how much taxpayer-funded support will be available for each technology will not be available until next year. That is likely to delay investments, industry experts have warned. The move to improve the UK's creaking energy infrastructure is a huge undertaking that will outweigh investments in telecoms, water, and transport, and will come in at several times the cost of the Olympics – as much as £200bn may needed to be poured into the energy sector by 2020, according to government estimates. But the money is needed because of decades of underinvestment, in large part because the (mostly foreign-owned) privatised energy companies over the past two decades have sought profit over investment in the future. Davey argued on Thursday that investing in the energy sector could stimulate economic growth. \"Industry and investors have told us very clearly that government has to play its part, by creating a regulatory framework against which they can invest and by giving them clarity on the level of incentives available,\" he said. \"We cannot afford to miss this opportunity – we need those shovel-ready projects [such as home insulation] to get under way now, and the energy security challenge we face is real, with fossil fuel imports set to increase, electricity demand to rise, and around a fifth of our existing power plants to close by 2020.\" But campaigners said the energy bill was a \"lost opportunity\" to make substantial changes to the UK's energy infrastructure and would fail in the long term, because it did not give investors enough incentive to put money into renewable energy rather than gas or other fossil fuels. The forecast cuts in bills would come largely from energy efficiency measures to be supported by the government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/16/john-hayes-windfarms-gas-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-16T11:13:34Z","webTitle":"John Hayes: 'windfarms will not replace gas or nuclear'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/16/john-hayes-windfarms-gas-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/16/john-hayes-windfarms-gas-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"John Hayes: 'windfarms will not replace gas or nuclear'","bodyText":"Windfarms are \"extremely inefficient and costly\" and will not be able to replace gas or nuclear power generation, according to a letter sent by the Conservative energy minister, John Hayes, which reveals the extent of his antipathy to the technology. It is well known that Hayes is sceptical about onshore wind and he was slapped down by his boss at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), Ed Davey, last month for saying that \"enough is enough\" for windfarm growth. But the letter gives the clearest account of his objections and is likely to concern proponents because it repeats misapprehensions about the technology. In a letter to the chief executive of South Holland district council, seen by the Guardian, the energy minister said: \"Wind turbines … create barely a trickle of nonstorable electricity and none at all when wind speed is unsuitable. They will always have to be backed up by conventional power stations because of their unreliability. Because the wind by nature is intermittent and cannot generate a steady output of energy to supply constant demand, even thousands of wind turbines won't replace gas or nuclear power generation.\" The letter is dated 14 July 2012, barely two months before the reshuffle that put Hayes into the energy minister's job. His views will do nothing to reassure investors who are nervous about the battle within the government over energy policy. Several large multinational companies are holding off their final decisions on investments totalling tens of billions of pounds into wind turbine manufacturing plants in the UK because of the perceived political turmoil over the renewables issue. The government has also been rattled by the Guardian's revelations that Chris Heaton-Harris, the Tory MP who orchestrated a letter by more than 100 MPs to the prime minister earlier this year calling for dramatic cuts to subsidies for onshore wind, had given covert support to a rival candidate in the Corby byelection because of his antipathy to windfarms. Hayes' letter also repeats his \"profound concerns\" over a small development of seven wind turbines proposed for West Pinchbeck, in his constituency. He says: \"Industrial wind turbines, such as this proposal, are known to have a detrimental impact on wildlife habitats of birds, bats and other forms of wildlife, which reportedly include those of weasels, stoats, newts and other species.\" He also objects to the turbines on aesthetic grounds, as they would \"have a dominating and overbearing impact\", and complains that local people will suffer from the noise of the turbines. His complaints were rebuffed by Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of RenewableUK who said it was a myth that windfarms were \"unreliable\". \"Modern wind turbines are highly efficient – they generate electricity for 85% of the time. Just last week, National Grid announced that another record amount was being generated by wind – 13.5% of the UK's entire electricity needs. As we install more turbines onshore and offshore this is set to increase to 30% by the end of the decade.\" The UK has the highest wind resource in Europe, but is way behind many other EU member states including Germany and Spain in exploiting these resources. There are now more than 4,000 wind turbines connected to the grid and wind produced 48GWh of usable electricity per day on average during September, adding up to about 6% of overall daily national electricity requirement. Data from that month show that wind turbines are displacing carbon emissions from conventional power plants. Hayes' letter and remarks continue the impression of a government divided over energy policy. While the prime minister courted renewable energy investors on his recent visit to the middle east, he has also allowed the chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, to brief heavily in favour of gas instead of renewables. The chancellor is antagonistic to subsidies for renewable power and wants more emphasis on building gas-fired power stations. As a result, the government is planning for as many as 20 new gas-fired power stations, which has angered green campaigners. The new energy bill is expected to be published next Thursday. Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, warned that the government's deep divisions over renewable energy were scaring off investors: \"This letter from Hayes reveals what the energy minister really thinks about wind power and begs the question of why he is being allowed to conduct the government's so-called review into wind power. Onshore wind is the most developed and cheapest source of clean energy. Letters like this one put investment in new jobs and industries at risk. Hard-pressed families should not be left to foot the bill if the energy minister wants to play politics with good-paying clean energy jobs and Britain's energy security.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/mar/04/biden-aipac-speech-iran-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-04T17:56:00Z","webTitle":"Obama not bluffing over Iran military threat, Biden tells Aipac","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/04/biden-aipac-speech-iran-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/mar/04/biden-aipac-speech-iran-threat","fields":{"headline":"Obama not bluffing over Iran military threat, Biden tells Aipac","bodyText":"Barack Obama's threats to use military force to prevent Iran securing a nuclear weapon are more than idle bluffs, vice-president Joe Biden told the biggest pro-Israeli lobbying group Aipac on Monday. Biden said that while the US preferred a diplomatic solution to the standoff with Iran, a military option remained on the table. \"The president of the United States cannot, and does not, bluff. President Barack Obama is not bluffing,\" Biden told the audience in Washington. Israel is seeking assurances of support from the US, should it decide to launch air strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities. There has been scepticism about Obama's commitment to a military option against Iran, given the administration's general unwillingness to be drawn into new conflicts after the experience of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Some observers feel that Obama's threat is aimed purely at putting pressure on Iran to resolve the standoff diplomatically and not embark on another conflict. Pro-Israel supporters of the military option, speaking at Aipac's annual conference, attempted to counter Obama's reticence by insisting the military option would only require an overnight air strike, rather than a prolonged conflict. In contrast with the run-up to the Iraq war, the US is determined to show that it is pursuing all alternatives to conflict. Biden said that if the US had to take military action, it was critical that the world knew it had tried everything in its power to prevent such an eventuality. Obama, in an interview last year, insisted he was not bluffing. But his public pronouncements contrasted with behind-the-scenes US pressure on Israel to hold back from an air strike, particularly in the White House election year. The White House views Iran as the top foreign policy priority of Obama's second term. The US and other governments held inconclusive talks with Iran recently, and further talks are planned. The new US secretary of state John Kerry, at a press conference in Saudi Arabia on Monday, said there was a \"finite\" time for conclusion of the talks. Iran denies it is pursuing a nuclear weapon, and insists it only wants nuclear power to meet domestic energy needs. Addressing the conference via satellite link from Israel, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said Iran had not yet crossed the red line on the nuclear issue but it was getting closer. He expressed scepticism about the value of sanctions and called for a more credible military threat. Biden was speaking before a trip planned by Obama to Jerusalem later this month, provided an Israeli government is in place by then. Iran, not Palestine, is the key issue for Israel at present, though Biden stressed that the White House remained committed to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Obama is viewed with suspicion by many Israelis who see him as too sympathetic to the Palestinians, but Biden's credentials as a staunch supporter of Israel have seldom been challenged. Biden insisted that he and Obama were deeply committed to the security of Israel. \"It is in our naked self-interest, beyond the moral impertive,\" Biden said. The vice-president said the US works hard to ensure Israel retains a qualitative edge in military hardware, even at a time of recession. Aipac members are planning a mass lobby of Congress on Wednesday and, among other issues, will be seeking to establish whether US aid to Israel will suffer from the $85bn in budget cuts ordered by Obama on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/22/nuclear-power-cost-delay-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-22T10:13:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power's real chain reaction: spiralling costs | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/22/nuclear-power-cost-delay-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/22/nuclear-power-cost-delay-edf","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power's real chain reaction: spiralling costs","bodyText":"Time is money, they say, and the new nuclear power plant being built by EDF at Flamanville in France is now at least four years behind time and €2.7bn over budget. EDF blamed the delay on two fatal construction accidents and dealing with safety analyses prompted by the Fukushima disaster. So what does the news mean for the role for nuclear power in delivering the low-carbon electricity essential to tackling climate change? The three 'Cs' of energy policy are carbon, cost and continuity of supply, and Wednesday's announcement by EDF is relevant to the latter two. The Flamanville fiasco shows once again that new nuclear power plants are not being built on time or on budget, diminishing the arguments in favour of them. The only other new nuclear plant being built in Europe is at Olkiluoto in Finland. Areva, like EDF a state-controlled French company, told me this will be connected to the grid no sooner than 2013 and costs are now estimated at €5.6bn. That is four years late and €2.6bn over budget. I wanted to understand better the effect of the delay and ballooning costs at Flamanville 3 on the ultimate cost of the electricity produced, and Jim Watson, professor of energy policy at the university of Sussex, kindly agreed to help. The details of his working are at the end, but the summary is that the cost per kilowatt hour has jumped between about 33% and 45% in the last few years. Watson notes that the cost is particularly sensitive to delays, as this widens the gap between the heavy capital outlay and the point at which money starts to flow back in. The UK's committee on climate change estimates nuclear power as the cheapest low carbon source, but budget busting comparable to that at Flamanville would make it the same, or higher, than wind power. So, the construction of nuclear is stalling and the costs are rising. Contrast that with renewable energy, where installations are surging, and most of the technologies are coming down in price as they mature and reach scale. In the UK, the government has bet heavily on nuclear to keep the lights on at a cost we can bear, while cutting carbon emissions. The plan is to build eight new plants, with EDF's reactors operational by 2018. But EDF has already said \"we will publish an adjusted timetable in the autumn [to] take account of the final [Fukushima] report from the UK's Chief Nuclear Inspector and the lessons we are learning from experiences and challenges at our new build projects.\" I'd bet my house the adjustment will not be to an earlier date. As I have said before, assessing what role nuclear power should have can only be done by making judgement calls on a range of key factors. Numbers are important but only get you part of the way, as there are too many uncertainties to be able to calculate your way to a definitive answer. So do you believe EDF when it says: \"Nuclear power in the UK [is] the lowest cost large scale form of low carbon electricity generation, and it can be delivered in time to meet this country's needs.\" If you do, you have more reason to back nuclear. But, based on track record, I don't believe them. Taking this and other factors, such as safety, into account, I see no place for nuclear power in the UK's future energy mix. Professor Watson's calculation: \"First, I have assumed the Flamanville capital costs, a lifetime (the number of years to pay off the capital) of 30 years, a high load factor (the percentage of the time the station will operate) of 85%, a discount rate of 10% (which is what the UK's Committee on Climate Change uses) and a construction period of five years. That ends up with a rough generation cost of 8p per kWh. This is in the middle of the CCC range in their Renewable Energy Review (5p to 10p/kWh). \"Second, I have varied these assumptions. I have shortened the repayment lifetime to 20 years, and increased the discount rate to 12% - which are both closer to the criteria used in recent years by investors in the UK. Then the figure rises to 11p/kWh. \"If you assume the same conditions as in the first case above, but put in an earlier construction cost estimate of €4bn, you get a cost of electricity of between 5.5p and 6p/kWh instead. [Hence, the price has risen 33-45%] \"Under both these scenarios, a significant delay in construction such as that being experienced at Flamanville would push costs up further because of a longer wait before the plant starts earning any money.\" Note: The CCC estimates the cost of nuclear at 7p/kWh (p256), including decommissioning costs, unlike Watson's calculations. But the CCC figure excludes \"some additional costs [that] may be incurred for the first few nuclear plants in the UK.\" It estimates onshore wind at 9p/kWh and offshore at 10-13p/kWh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/feb/07/carbon-emissions-uk-energy-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-07T17:06:00Z","webTitle":"Leaping UK carbon emissions deliver two red-hot lessons | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/feb/07/carbon-emissions-uk-energy-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/feb/07/carbon-emissions-uk-energy-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Leaping UK carbon emissions deliver two red-hot lessons","bodyText":"The big jump in the UK's carbon emissions has two searing lessons for energy and climate secretary Ed Davey, newly installed in the hot seat. First, he must prevent his department's flagship \"green deal\" plan to boost the warmth of the nation's ageing and draughty homes from self-combusting in a blaze of apathy, as it is currently on course to do. Secondly, he must pour a little cold water on the UK establishment's burning love affair with nuclear power, to take better account of its unreliability. The biggest single cause of the first rise in the nation's carbon footprint since 2003 was from the increased heating of homes during cold weather at the start and end of 2010. People faced a choice when winter's chill began to bite: they could turn up the heating, despite the soaring cost of energy, or tackle the draughts through which the heat escapes. The 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide added to national emissions from home heating alone - two-thirds of the entire rise - shows the people of Britain overwhelmingly chose the former. Yet almost half of all lofts in the UK - 10 million - remain poorly lagged or completely bare, while 8m homes have empty cavity walls. Installing this type of insulation instantly cuts bills and some energy companies, driven by soon-to-end regulation, will do it for free. The government has trumpeted its green deal as the solution to this woeful state of affairs, calling it a world-leading programme set to transform 14m homes in a decade. Homeowners will be able to take out loans for refurbishments, with the repayments guaranteed to be lower than the energy cost savings. Warm words, but sadly adrift from reality. The government's own impact assessment shows that loft lagging will plummet by 93% when the green deal starts. Instead of 2m lofts a year being stuffed with plump, cosy fibres, as is needed to curb carbon emissions in line with legal targets, just 70,000 will be done. People have been reluctant to let in the workmen even when the work was free, so why would they do so when they have to take out a loan? The good news for Davey is that all is not yet lost ahead of the green deal's October launch. He already has £200m from the Treasury to shower on early adopters, but many more incentives are needed. Council tax rebates and cuts in stamp duty are on the table and getting them will be an early test of his ability to win cabinet arguments. Virtually all of the rest of the leap in the UK's carbon emissions comes from technical problems forcing nuclear power stations to shut down. The biggest reactor in the country, Sizewell B, was offline for six months, meaning more coal and gas had to be burned to fill the electricity gap, pumping more climate-warming gases into the air. Other reactors had problems too in 2010 and more recently events as varied as a rogue school of jellyfish and winter tornadoes have closed atomic energy plants. When a wind turbine explodes, as in a recent storm, a megwatt of power is lost. When a nuclear plant falls off the grid, 1000 megawatts is lost. The comparison puts the lie to the sceptics charge that wind power is \"unreliable\". Davey has stridently opposed nuclear power in the comfort of opposition, but now has to back it. An even more difficult test of his political skills will be to win the argument on the clear benefits of wind power, in particular with the 100 Tory MPs and their supporters who greeted his first day in the office by demanding drastic cuts to onshore windfarms. Keeping energy bills down, keeping the lights on and keeping the world safe from global warming was never the easiest brief in Whitehall. The new leap in carbon emissions means Davey is set for a baptism of fire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jun/26/spending-review-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-26T21:45:22Z","webTitle":"Spending review: Osborne the axeman | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/spending-review-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/spending-review-osborne","fields":{"headline":"Spending review: Osborne the axeman","bodyText":"Before getting into the detail of Wednesday's spending review, one fundamental fact should be borne in mind: this was not a statement George Osborne ever wanted to make. In March 2011, he told the House of Commons: \"We have already asked the British people for what is needed, and … we do not need to ask for more.\" The coalition laid out its proposed spending cuts in 2010: its austerity programme was meant to be finished within this parliament. According to that fabled plan A, the economy should by now have been well on the road to recovery. As the chancellor admits, that turnaround has not materialised. The result is that government borrowing is far above official forecasts, and so cuts that were supposed to be all but over by 2015 now stretch all the way out to 2018 – and economists are already talking about a further extension to 2020. It is against that backdrop that Wednesday's spending review must be read: more misery to be heaped on the poorest and most vulnerable, additional cuts to public services along with further privations for teachers, firefighters, council employees – as a direct result of this government's failed economic policy. Yet so skilled an operator is Mr Osborne that he was able to present £11.5bn of cuts, beaten out of his cabinet colleagues and only agreed last Sunday, as an economic strategy – and to use the opportunity to draw battle lines ahead of the next general election. Plenty of the themes that will shape the next two years were laid out on Wednesday afternoon: Labour painted as the \"welfare party\"; the Conservatives' support for pensioners (unless they happen to be expats on the Spanish coast, in which case they will lose their winter fuel allowance); the protection for soldiers and their families at the expense of teachers and civil servants, who will now have their pay capped until 2016. It was an adept performance that almost covered up for the fact that, as even senior cabinet ministers acknowledge, this spending round was almost pointless. To be much use, spending reviews should cover three- or four-year periods: this one told us about the outlook for one, 2015-16, when another government may well be in charge. Second, as major economic statements go, this one has all the hallmarks of answering the wrong exam question. At a time of deep slump, the first priority for any government ought to be to create decent, well-paying jobs and a sustainable recovery. That will not be accomplished by announcing another round of public works on Thursday. Set aside the neat political choreography and what Danny Alexander is set to promise are infrastructure projects that will begin well after the next election and will in any case be funded by pulling money out of other government budgets. Mr Osborne's aim on Wednesday was to make the best fist of hard times by appealing to middle Britain with the logic \"my enemy's enemy must be my friend\". The primary enemy was, once again, the imaginary slob who passes his days on the sofa courtesy of generous benefits. The chancellor lacked all conviction as he mouthed his old lie about the burden being shouldered by those with the broadest shoulders, a claim only justified by factoring in Labour tax changes. Wednesday was supposed to be about the running costs of government departments not benefits, but room was nonetheless found for fresh welfare cuts. The newly laid-off will be denied benefits for their first week without work, an invitation to debt, if not crime. There was a shin-kicking requirement for the workless to sign on at the jobcentre weekly rather than fortnightly, a policy to waste the time of scarce officials too. There will be higher rents, and a stealthy hit to the elderly poor in receipt of pension credit. Although mean-spirited, the chancellor's plan to \"cap the system as a whole\" was more significant. Just as Gordon Brown once attempted to lock future Tory governments into his social legacy with child poverty legislation and 30-year PFIs, Mr Osborne now wishes to taunt the opposition into matching his cap, and cement a new consensus for his cuts. In one sense, he has already succeeded – Ed Miliband is now committed to the principle of a cap. That, however, is just a phrase; the important thing is for Labour to hold its nerve and reject the specifics of Osborne's cap. It must do so, first, on grounds of economics. While jobseeker's allowance is outside the cap, housing benefit and tax credits that flow from both un- and under-employment would be included, weakening the mechanisms that automatically stabilise an economy through a recession. It should reject, too, the irresponsible plan to fix the cap in cash rather than real terms. Above all, it must knock down \"the something for nothing argument\", seeing as many of the payments capped are to people who work hard for low pay. Liberal Democrat ministers listened while a Conservative chancellor cut the student grants that were their supposed compensation for tripling fees. There was a promise of nuclear power which the party has long opposed, and money for Michael Gove's free schools, but a real-terms freeze for Nick Clegg's pupil premium. The picture that emerged from Wednesday's spending review was of a Britain in 2016 that resembles a joyless version of Britain in 2006. Rebalancing? Forget about it. Overhauling the banks? Not a chance. And growth is likely to come from the housing market and rising personal debt. The future, in other words, will look a lot like the bad old past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/blog/2011/apr/04/fear-nuclear-power-fukushima-risks","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-04T11:40:00Z","webTitle":"Fear of nuclear power is out of all proportion to the actual risks | Melanie Windridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/apr/04/fear-nuclear-power-fukushima-risks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2011/apr/04/fear-nuclear-power-fukushima-risks","fields":{"headline":"Fear of nuclear power is out of all proportion to the actual risks","bodyText":"People are getting nervous about nuclear power in the wake of the problems at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, questioning whether nuclear power is a sensible option for energy production in light of the perceived risks. It has been three weeks since the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. There have been problems at the Fukushima plant with cooling, gas explosions (not nuclear), and radiation leaks – all serious issues, but so far no one has died. The earthquake and tsunami have killed more than 10,000 people. In fact, the disaster shows how safe nuclear reactors actually are. Reactors designed half a century ago survived an earthquake many times stronger than they were designed to withstand, immediately going into shut-down (bringing driven nuclear reactions to a halt). But the radioactive products in the reactor keep decaying, producing heat, so they must be cooled. The real problems began when the tsunami took out all the back-up generators that were meant to provide power to circulate the coolant. Loss of site power is the worst-case scenario for a nuclear power plant, so for Fukushima this was the worst crisis imaginable. New reactors have improved safety features, including passive systems that allow cooling to take place without power. Radiation leaks are undoubtedly serious. But it is worth remembering that we are subjected to background radiation every day as a result of natural processes – some people more than others. Those living in UK areas with a lot of granite rocks, such as Cornwall, will have higher exposure than those who live somewhere like the Thames Valley. People who take flights expose themselves to radiation from cosmic rays, and airline pilots flying high-altitude routes can receive doses that put them in the top 5% of all workers in terms of radiation exposure. People routinely and willingly expose themselves to large amounts of radiation for medical checks, with dental x-rays providing perhaps the highest doses, often for purely cosmetic reasons. Safety limits for nuclear facilities are necessarily stringent and contamination is taken extremely seriously. However, these precautionary limits can cause unnecessary alarm. For example, there were recommendations for restrictions on drinking water, which have now been lifted, but the radiation dose received by drinking Tokyo water for a year would have been less than that from moving to Cornwall and living there for a year. So far the releases from Fukushima have been relatively low, but continual monitoring is essential. Calls to widen the exclusion zone or to evacuate must be weighed against the risks of evacuation, which itself leads to many deaths, especially among the old and infirm. Also of concern is the breach of containment leading to the contamination of cooling water, and the reports of radioactive material leaking into the sea. While very serious, it is fortunate that the worst effects are contained on the site and that anything that flows into the ocean – either by accident or to relieve storage problems on land – will be greatly diluted. Clearly we should learn from the mistakes that have been made during the crisis. However, we should remember that Japan has few natural energy resources, so nuclear power is important for its self-sufficiency. The country has been generating nuclear power for 45 years and currently produces almost 30% of its electricity this way. Is it reasonable to decry nuclear power because of a crisis that has killed no one, caused by a natural disaster that killed thousands? Compared with other sources of energy, nuclear power is one of the safest. We worry about radiation but are happy to accept air pollution from fossil fuels. Coal-related air pollution from power plants is globally responsible for more than 100,000 deaths per year.1,2 The World Health Organisation estimates that indoor air pollution from biomass and coal causes 1.5m premature deaths per year.3 Coal mining accidents also kill thousands every year, but are seldom reported. I do not wish to trivialise the problems at Fukushima. I dislike the radioactive waste and safety issues of nuclear fission as much as anyone, which is why I work in research into a new form of nuclear energy – fusion. It's the energy source that powers the sun and has none of the downsides of fission. Fusion will produce abundant energy cleanly and safely, but it is not yet ready. With continued political and financial support we hope to have fusion power stations by the 2050s. However, I believe we cannot sideline nuclear fission because of Fukushima. We are in a critical situation. The threat of climate change is much greater than the threat of radiation, but no one is scared of carbon dioxide. Millions of people in the developing world still live in poverty, which access to energy can alleviate. Global energy demand will continue to rise, so energy will continue to get more expensive as fossil fuels become more and more difficult to extract. The use of renewables is increasing and will play an important part in the future energy mix, but it's questionable whether renewables alone will be able to satisfy rising energy demands. Technical advances in storage, transportation and efficiency are still required. In the meantime, if we want to provide sufficient carbon-free energy we will have to use nuclear fission. I don't think this is incompatible with an environmentalist attitude. People working in nuclear power often care deeply about the environment and the energy problem. Despite some obvious downsides, they see nuclear power as the best solution. Sitting back and doing nothing, or – worse still – cutting off possibilities, is not an option.

It portrayed a rudimentary skull-shape and a symbolic zig-zag bolt of electricity and displayed these three plain words of warning. She found it in the gutter on the corner by the sweet shop in her home town of Leeds, and she was very fond of it. Her mother tolerated it, and it survived many a half-hearted spring clean and attempted clearance. Eight years later she added to it another sign which she found lying under the lichen-entrusted stone wall of a French cemetery in the Auvergne, declaring: \"danger de mort\". She thought of building up a collection of similar items, but she didn't. She didn't persist. And when her parents sold the house and moved to a cottage in Wharfedale, her childhood bedroom was dismantled and the danger signs, along with other more easily valued treasures, disappeared during the removal. Her love of trespass, however, did persist. She was attracted to \"keep out\" notices and enjoyed breaching boundaries and exploring forbidden ground. She dated this tendency to the early thrill of breaking into the abandoned garden of a large derelict house which she and her two friends passed every day on their way home from school. The front gate to the drive was chained and padlocked, but it was easy to squeeze through the fence and set up a little camp in the overgrown shrubbery. They called their camp the Wilderness, a word that delighted them. They would crouch there and eat the lurid little shop tartlets of scarlet jam and glaringly white artificial piped cream that they had bought with the money they had saved from their bus fares. If they opted to walk the mile and a half home, they could afford a tartlet each. Their mothers would have disapproved, both of the trespass and of the tartlets, but the sense of the illicit added to the pleasure. In later years, she encouraged a succession of admirers to scramble after her over barbed wire and through hedge bottoms to find picnic places and hidden bowers and dells and burrows. She discovered overgrown public footpaths and pursued long-lost rights of way and opened up new tracks of her own. She wasn't dogmatic about it. She wasn't a rights of way ideologue. She just wanted to go over the stile or through the gap to see what was on the other side. She was drawn to nettles and brambles and deadly nightshade and teasels and other lingering signs of ancient human habitation. Not all her followers were as keen as she, and some dropped by the wayside, complaining of barked shins, of stings and insect bites, of mud and thorns. By middle age, when her husband and her children had flown the nest, she found she preferred solitary forays, with no one to act as a clamp or a clog. She took her own risks, happily. Occasionally she took a companion, but the timidity of others made her nervous. It wasn't as though she was very bold herself: she was a cautious trespasser. And as she grew older, she found she needed all her courage for herself. She couldn't afford to waste it on encouraging others. She went through a summer or two of exploring empty listed buildings. The English countryside was full of them, just standing there, vast, abandoned, too big to develop but architecturally and historically too important to destroy. She found country houses which had been through various stages of deterioration: some were commissioned during the second world war as boarding schools and military hospitals, some declined into asylums for the mentally handicapped, some were recovered as care homes for the elderly or as field study centres, but others were simply left to the elements, behind high security fences with warning systems and threatening notices. There was always a way through for a determined trespasser: the grounds were too extensive to protect or patrol efficiently. Apples fell to the ground from unpruned trees in old orchards, and asparagus tips reared up like bracken in the undergrowth of dilapidated walled kitchen gardens. Blackberries and elderberries flourished and hedgerows grew tall and tangled, threaded and festooned with bindweed and traveller's joy. She ate her sandwiches amid the growing wilderness. She discovered, to her surprise, that there was also a whole subset of listed properties that had been purpose-built in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as asylums and psychiatric institutions, some of them in the parkland of abbeys and priories and manor farms, some of them in green fields. They had served their purpose, and the medical theory and practice of dealing with the insane and the handicapped had moved on, as had the language that described the one-time inmates. Now they stood empty, intractable brownfield sites, caught in an unending recession, surrounded by CCTV and \"private land\" and \"keep out\" notices, sad monuments to the pioneering hopes and the sullen despairs of the past and to the institutional and financial paralysis of the present. Some of the buildings were very grand, with high water towers that surveyed the surrounding domain: an old-English red-brick Queen Anne style had been favoured by many local authority architects, whereas a few had opted for the palatial Palladian Italianate. She could see from the Ordnance Survey maps where these clusters of buildings stood, though pedestrian access was not always obvious. They were hidden behind modern housing estates with crescents and avenues and cul-de-sacs that would terminate in a hidden footpath that led through scrubby fields to the perimeter fence. One, with a burnt-out roof and, according to the local farm boys, a population of dangerous drug-taking squatting vandals, was concealed from B-road access by a self-contained, marooned development of large and prosperous five-bedroomed executive two-car homes. She would have explored these ruins more fully, but the farm boys, bored in the field on their quad bikes, were too friendly, too eager to help. She said she was looking for a site for a film shoot. That had been a mistake. The interest which she aroused when looking for the once-celebrated hospital where Lionel Penrose had worked on the Down's syndrome chromosome was different and more disconcerting. It put her off the asylum trail for good. Although large and in its day famous, it was exceptionally hard to locate, lost amid the notoriously confusing maze of ring roads and motorways and mini roundabouts of Essex, and she almost gave up in her quest. She came across council housing for the unemployable, and nature trails through tragic woodland, and electricity pylons with traditional \"danger of death\" notices, but she could not work out where the asylum lay. Eventually she parked her car in a little ultra-modern shopping mall on the edge of a business park, and went into a hairdressers' shop to ask after the building called Severalls. She did not like to ask her way. She preferred to find it. She asked the shiningly young and well-coiffed woman in pink at the reception desk for Severalls asylum, using the name by which she believed it would be known locally, if at all. She did not expect so glossy and healthy a person to have any memory of history a century old, and was surprised to be greeted by recognition and a certain dignified air of reprimand. Yes, the young woman knew the hospital, it was still standing, but there had been arson attacks, it was a shame really, it was a lovely and comfortable place in its day, its grounds were beautiful. The young woman had recoiled from the word \"asylum\", and her reasons became clear. Her grandmother had lived there as a patient for many years, and an aunt had worked there until it closed. Severalls had provided good local employment; it had housed two thousand inmates and a large staff. She had happy memories of visiting her grandmother. Her granny had been well cared for. The hairdresser's receptionist, whose lapel told her customers that she was called Zoe, tried to give directions to her interrogator, but was clearly suspicious of her interest. And Elizabeth Clitheroe felt, as she made her way back to her car, that Zoe was suspicious with good cause. Her interest had been idle, and she felt rebuked. She abandoned her search, and ceased to follow the many mysterious and overgrown paths to the asylum. Acts of trespass, however, she did not abandon. The next summer she found a worthier aim. It was prompted by her ignoble rage at the sight of her electricity bill from EDF, alias Électricité de France, but she was able to translate this fury into a sense of a higher cause. This was the summer when energy bills for the British householder soared, despite an alleged fall in the cost of raw materials. The Big Six power companies, scenting the helplessness of householders in the wake of their passive suffering at the hands of the banks, moved in for the kill, and nobody seemed able to stop them. Elizabeth Clitheroe protested, she rang numbers and helplines that never responded, she wrote letters, she logged on to the EDF website and read her meter and kept on recording and phoning and emailing her meter readings, hoping to force a response from this impassive, cruel, exploitative company. But answer came there none. She was infuriated by the way the website invited her to play meter reading games, as though she were a child, not a householder and a professor emeritus. And she was also illogically infuriated by the fact that the company demanding so much of her hard-earned money was French. The French seemed to be buying up the power stations of England, as the Americans and Malaysians had bought up Britain's water supplies. Elizabeth Clitheroe did not think of herself as a Little Englander, she thought of herself as a European, but there was nothing European about this disembodied rapacious monster of a company. It had no loyalty to its English clients, no love of the land it built upon. It was the invader from across the Channel, a conquering Bonaparte from an empire without borders or defensible frontiers, French in name but global in ambition. She was taken aback by her xenophobic, ancestral rage. She had always liked France and the French, had enjoyed French poetry, French food, French cathedrals, she spoke good French and had French friends. She did not like to think the French were out to rob her. She was not happy to have been made suspicious. But she was surprised that nobody in the press and very few politicians seemed concerned about energy security. They went on a lot about food security, but they blithely sold off their energy resources without any due sense of foreboding. Probably all the companies were as greedy and deceitful as one another – E.ON, npower, British Gas, Scottish Power and Southern Electricity were probably as rootlessly unlocated and un-British as EDF. But it was EDF she hated most, because it was hers, or rather, she was its. She belonged to it. She turned down her thermostat and switched off her appliances one by one and resolved to find an outlet for the pressure building up within her by taking a walk along the South West coast path to the nuclear power stations of Hinkley Point. She had long been familiar with these extraordinary structures, these geometric blue-grey slabs rising against the backdrop of the cement-grey, yellowish, bruised waves of the Bristol Channel. They drew the eye from all the land around, like the fabled pleasure domes of Kubla Khan. From the coast path and the Quantock Hills, from the heights of Exmoor and from Wales across the water the traveller could see them, airily suspended, looking curiously weightless for such a heavy industrial plant. Coleridge and Wordsworth, who knew this coastline well, would have wondered at their fearful symmetry. Coleridge had composed The Rime of the Ancient Mariner up on the Quantocks with a fine view of where they now stood, and his familiar words rolled with the wavelets through her head as she walked the stretch above the mudflats. In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure dome decree Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea … EDF, of course, was engaged in that characteristically twenty-first century French endeavour, the development of nuclear power. Without full planning permission it was already clearing the land for a third reactor to join the decades-old Hinkley Point A (built by Magnox) and Hinkley Point B (purchased by EDF from British Energy), reviving a scheme which had been explored and abandoned as unviable over twenty years ago. You would have thought that the Japanese nuclear disaster at Fukushima earlier this year would have caused concern and raised questions about the safety of building on mud and sand and submarine forest on an estuary with the second highest tidal rise and fall in the world, but no, the digging and the prospecting and the clearances had continued. The chief executive of EDF (whose name didn't look French to Elizabeth, it looked sinisterly South American) countered complaints from the public about rising energy prices with the argument that nuclear power was in the long run cheaper. This might be true, in a sense, but only a fool would think that the profits of the two new nuclear reactors of Hinkley Point C would in the long run be distributed among the humble householders of Britain. Down to a sunless sea, Elizabeth repeated to herself as she strode eastward along the footpath towards Hinkley from the fabled settlements of East Quantoxhead and Kilve. She had once thought those lines referred to the river Axe, the sacred river that ran through the subterranean chambers and caverns and stalactites of the Cheddar gorge, but she now saw that the Alph of Xanadu was the Severn, and that the sunless sea was Coleridge's prophetic vision of the pewter post-nuclear wasteland of this estuary, spreading out westwards in the post-nuclear future towards the metallic fish-free Atlantic. Thus far, the fish of the Severn had not suffered much from the power plants of the 1950s. Some fish were killed on the screens in the early days as they were sucked into the cooling plants through the bottom of the concrete tower, but many were left. Fishermen even told tales of increased catches thriving in the unnaturally warmed water of the estuary. Tests had been done, experiments conducted, species counted. Sprat, whiting, poor cod, pout, sand goby, dab, flounder, mullet, eel and bass were abundant. More rarely a conger eel or a turbot was caught. The flora of the Hinkley Point nature trail toward which she was making her experimental way was also said, over past years, to have flourished, but that could have been a claim put about through good PR. She had walked the trail years ago, long before Hinkley Point C had reached its earliest draft on the planning board, and she had seen the blue and copper butterflies and the pale flax and the golden birds' foot trefoil and the royal purple proud-headed knapweed. There were said to be orchids, but she hadn't spotted any. Would they still be there, the ghost orchids? Was the trail still open? And had EDF managed legally or illegally to cut out a segment of the coast path? It was a challenge, and she was armed for combat with her foil-wrapped sandwiches and a plastic bottle of water. It was early autumn, the first week of the school term, and there were no family parties walking the coast path. The weather was not good. A stiff north-westerly wind blew bracingly in from the grey and ochre ocean, soughing noisily through a field of high green corn stalks, bending the inland ash and thorn and willow, scraping the short turf and the bare headlands. Few walkers had braved the day. A hardened couple, featureless and hooded inside their green anoraks, gave Elizabeth Clitheroe a muffled greeting. An old man, walking his slow dog, head down, ignored her. She walked on, eastwards, in an uncomfortable direction, braced with an uncomfortable purpose, in a direction she felt to be against nature. Walking westward was nature's way and the natural way of the rambler. Sometimes the twin reactors hove into her view, hanging like a mirage against the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm, and sometimes they were obscured by the lie of the land and the curve of the path. Their configuration altered as she walked on, and other features disclosed themselves in the moving landscape: a church tower and a silage tower in the distance, a yellow combine harvester far off at a field's edge, a shed, a sewage outfall. Below her at the foot of the low and crumbling fossil-packed cliffs the surging water groaned and heaved and strained. This was a sterile coast, with solid layers of petrified mud, with strangely geometric rock pavements, with wave-carved slices and ridges of stone. It was bare of weed and vegetation. It looked like the aftermath of a nuclear disaster that had happened long ago. On such a day, there seemed to be no colour in nature. Slate greys, dull browns, dirty yellows, grim purples, and the monotony of a cement not made by man. The weather-beaten brambles showed colour, with jewelled berries black and valiant red, but it was too cold to linger to pick them. If the wind abated, she would gather some later, after she had eaten her sandwiches. For her picnic, she thought to seek the shelter of a lofty look-out tower gazing out over the channel, a structure on which she had been slowly gaining for half an hour and more, intrigued by its strangely cheerful, almost Butlinesque sea-side architecture, by its white paint and turquoise glass windows and its jaunty railings. But of course, when she neared, the site was unpleasant, forbidding, bristling with barbed wire and fencing and surrounded by heaps of rubble. A notice told her it was a Royal Navy aircraft range, and that all construction workers should report to the chief petty officer. This officer had only a number, not a name, and seemed to reside far away at Yeovil. Compared with the installations of Hinkley Point, this look-out post was low tech, small scale. A new and well-made little wooden gate behind the tower tempted her, and she thought it might lead to steps or a footpath down to the beach, or to some mystery in the banks of bramble shrubbery, but in fact it led nowhere at all. It ended in a bush. She ate her sandwiches further on, by a cairn on which a handwritten notice invited her to add a stone in memory of Molly. This was to be the last and most desolate feature before she reached the perimeters of Hinkley Point. Molly's cairn was surrounded by signs of late summer picnics, old sweet wrappers, a polystyrene carton, a grey sock, a muddy cigarette packet saying: \"smoking kills\". SMOKING KILLS DANGER OF DEATH She remembered the little dull metal tablet on her childhood mantelpiece. Her daughter Constance, following her mother's genetic patterning, had stuck a more colourful and playful but less authentic notice on her bedroom door in Stoke Newington, labelled in bold black and red lettering: WARNING AREA 51 IT IS UNLAWFUL TO ENTER WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE INSTALLATION MANAGER USE OF DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED Connie hadn't found this in the gutter, she'd bought it from Ridley Road market. It was a replica of an American signal, you could tell that from the violence of its language. Refreshed, Elizabeth Clitheroe tipped away the remains of her water, planning to use the plastic bottle for collecting blackberries, and made her way onward. Soon the official path veered steeply away from the sea and coastline, uphill through fields of wind-dried cow pats and behind hedges and down a deep and narrow drover's road. She lost her view of the power stations, but knew she was very near them. She heard a dog bark and the sound of men calling to one another at work, and there, on a rising slope ahead of her, was a group of builders, working on a construction site that seemed to be based round an old brick ivy-clad farm building. She could heard them, and they, if they looked her way, could have seen her. Soon the warning notices and the barbed wire and the fencing began. She was still on a public footpath, for she had obediently followed signs, some marked with a white ammonite and some with the yellow traditional lettering carved into wood. She could not yet be trespassing, and they could not yet apprehend her. The cloud was lifting, the wind was dropping, and the heavily clouded bundling harvest sky was lightening. To her left lay great pale fields of stubble, lit by a gleam of watery straw-coloured sun, and above the curved brown furrows swooped and swirled great flocks of dark birds, like the congregated spirit of many souls in torment. And there, in the middle of the track ahead of her, speaking into his mobile phone, and outlined against the nuclear skyline, stood a stolid stocky man in fluorescent yellow wearing a white helmet. She walked on towards him, and he glanced towards her, and went on talking indifferently into his mobile. She passed him, nodding politely, as walkers and ramblers do. He returned her nod, but did not speak, or not to her. Ahead, the path came up abruptly against a high wire fence, and turned at an unnatural right angle to the south. The path and she pursued their way along the edge of the diamond mesh fencing, behind which stood a large red sign fifteen feet high stating: \"You are entering a nuclear licensed site, according to the Nuclear Installations Act of 1965, As amended.\" She wasn't entering it, she was walking alongside it, but she could peer into it, at the rubble and the red and white striped measuring devices and the signs of excavation. The protest literature had said that EDF was planning to clear 435 acres of greenfield land, including ancient woodland, footpaths, hedgerows and historic agricultural barns, and to excavate more cubic metres of soil, subsoil and rock than the London Olympics. Well, yes, she could see they were at it already, though modestly as yet. She now found herself skirting the site where the new installation would, if planning permission in the fullness of time were granted, be built. It was all angles now, cutting across the curve and contour of the old paths, the old farmland. She felt anxiety mounting, as she geared herself for confrontation, but there was as yet nobody to confront. She made her way through a gate on the path and encountered a large board saying: THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND IF YOU PROCEED BEYOND THIS POINT YOU MAY BE REGARDED AS A TRESPASSER. That word \"may\" was interesting, and it was not at all clear to her what point it was that she should not pass. Perhaps she had already passed it. A little further on was the low patch of scruffy humble well-intentioned woodland through which the permissive nature trail had once led, and as she neared it she could see a white notice tacked on to the weathered wooden board. \"Nature trail closed,\" it declared in large print, and in smaller print it said it was closed until further notice because of engineering works. Further notice, she knew, would mean forever. She clambered over the stile into the forbidden land, her land, and walked on into the undergrowth. There was a tangle of elder and bramble, and a little flurry of small birds took flight at her approach. They took flight from a slender tree with silver shaking leaves, small birds moving like the flickering spirit of one small soul, silver leaves moving and lifting their light faces in the dying wind of autumn. An inexpressible and overwhelming sadness entered her as she watched the birds fly away and the leaves turn and turn in their beautiful distress. It was a grief for the animate world that she felt, for the fluttering of the little leaves and little birds. It was all over, nobody would stop her in her trespassing, but nobody would stop this process of appropriation either. It would continue, the digging and grubbing and excavating, until all this land was gone. There would be little flickers of protest, a few sparrow people gathered together peacefully on street corners with banners, a small headline in the local press. But protest and trespass were hopeless and pointless, and everyone knew it. And who knows, maybe nuclear is best? Bonaparte would conquer England now although he had not conquered her then. Two centuries ago the people of the farms and fishing villages and hamlets had waited for him in fear on this coastline, they had built their cairns and lookouts and beacons, they had dreaded invasion, but, two centuries ago, he had not come. Now he was here, although mightily changed in form and aspect, a many-headed, many-limbed, polyglot monster of enormous generative power. Yes, \"closed until further notice\" meant \"closed forever\". Nobody stopped her, nobody cared about her intrusion. She reached the tarmac path at the other side of the woodland and stared at the obsolete reactors. She photographed them for posterity on her mobile. Nobody cared. Cars passed her indifferently on their way to and from the site. An elderly and lone woman walking was of no interest to them. She had done her best to bear witness, and now she would make an ignominious retreat. She was less observant of signposts and way marks as she began to make her way back westward to her car, gathering as she went some nuclear blackberries from the hedgerows for her supper. Coleridge, writing in 1798 \"during the alarm of an invasion\", and composing his lines on Fears in Solitude as he walked through this very landscape towards Nether Stowey had broken out, to his own surprise, into almost embarrassed outpourings of patriotic fervour, after lambasting the English for their many faults: O native Britain! O my Mother Isle! There lives nor form nor feeling in my soul Unborrowed from my country! O divine And beauteous island! Muttering these lines to herself, and thinking of how much she felt for her country, and why, she found herself at a little crossroads and paused, wondering which path to take. She was tired, and did not wish to miss her way home and needlessly prolong her walk as evening approached. She stood and pondered and wondered whether to bother to consult her map. She did not like to consult her map. Consulting her map made her feel vulnerable, even when nobody was there to watch her. But somebody was watching her. As she hesitated, she became aware that she was being watched. A man in a fluorescent yellow jacket straight ahead of her on the track, and standing stock still slightly downhill from her, was watching her. He was staring at her. She could have avoided him and turned off and taken the other path to the right, but she walked on towards him. And he began to walk towards her. He was going to speak to her. He was not smiling. And he was not English. He was not a man of the West Country. He was short, and stout, and foreign. He was not of this Mother Isle. Slowly they came together on the narrow track. His words were not hostile. She had been nervous, familiar though she was with solitary walking, but his words were kindly. \"Are you lost?\" was what he asked her. He had seen her hesitate, and had come up to her to offer help. That was a possible reading of his question. Malaysian, she thought, or Filipino. Not a Frenchman, not a rambler. A surveyor? A security guard? A spy? \"I'm trying to get back to the coast path,\" she said, \"towards Kilve and East Quantoxhead.\" He knew her way. Her exotic English words and local place names were not strange to him. He told her to go straight on down. At the bottom of the hill there was a little bridge, she should cross the bridge then take the cinder track to the left, uphill along the side of the field, and there at the end of the field she would see the gate that opened on to the coast path. She would see the sign. She thanked him, gravely, formally. Neither of them smiled. What was he doing here, this middle-aged man from over the seas with his unplaceable accent, alone in this wilderness, so far from his colleagues, in this little country lane? What was she doing here, alone in this wilderness? She walked on, leaving the stranger at the crossroads. She could feel his eyes upon her and she knew that he watched her until she was out of sight. Solitary he stood there, apart and alone and far from home. The rising slope of the field was clad in dull golden stubble and great rolled stooks of corn marched up it, a grey stag-headed oak reared up on the low horizon and leaned against the great clouds and silver fringing western light of evening, the dark birds of the mind swooped and poured and circled through the darkening air. The spirit was crying out in protest and abandon from the furrows of the ancient fields. The tree had one branch living, one great sheltered branch reaching to the south and in stubborn autumn leaf. Its other branches were dead wood. That evening, she thought of the dark-countenanced stranger as she ate her modest low-energy supper. She had a fried egg with baked beans on toast, and cooked the blackberries with some apples from the garden in the microwave. They took only a minute and a half on high, that couldn't have done much damage to the bill, not even the CEO of EDF could screw her much for that. She wouldn't have to report the energy consumption of that modest meal to Ofgem. As she ate her supper she listened to the music on her radio, it was Verdi's Don Carlos, she recognised it, the most tragic of operas. Where would he be now, the poor copper-skinned invader, in what hut or trailer did he lodge, with his plastic beaker of pot noodles and his foreign beer? Or was he sumptuously housed in Bristol, laughing companionably, triumphantly, amid his fellow countrymen? She knew nothing of his life, or he of hers. He had not rebuked her, as Zoe the grandchild of Severalls had rebuked her. And yet she felt rebuked. As she pulled the curtains against the night, Verdi's grand aria of grief and loss swelled through her little cottage and through the valley. The exiled and heartbroken princess sang: \"Io sono straniera in questo suol, I am a stranger in this land, all hope for me on earth is gone …\" Yes, she thought, so it is. So it for me, so it is for him. I am a stranger in this land. • Margaret Drabble is a novelist, biographer, critic and editor of two editions of The Oxford Companion to English Literature.

Let us consider the area of nuclear energy. \"[We will] … reject a new generation of nuclear power stations; based on the evidence nuclear is a far more expensive way of reducing carbon emissions than promoting energy conservation and renewable energy.\" That was the Liberal Democrat general election manifesto 2010. \"In addition to posing safety and environmental risks, nuclear power will only be possible with vast taxpayer subsidies or a rigged market.

On one hand we have sponsors Barclays and Coutts threatening to walk away if the charity persists with its highly popular award category Bigot of the Year. Stonewall says it surely will. On the other, we have one of the nominees, Christian activist Alan Craig – who branded his critics the \"gaystapo\"– complaining that, try as he might, he can't get a ticket. He has been in touch, he says, seeking \"details about their voting, when the count takes place and whether I can attend and speak at the award dinner as a nominee\". No answer thus far. \"These are reasonable accountability questions for a high-profile open event run by a registered and apparently responsible charity.\" The nomination wasn't supposed to be a badge of honour. But these are strange days. • The phone rings. The voice is recognisable. It is the MP Austin Mitchell. Now see here, he says, in that genial way. The 1989 Guardian cuttings file may endure, but I never said that \"In Grimsby we know a woman's place ... on her back on a kitchen table.\" What did you say back then, we asked him. \"I am pretty sure I said you people in the south think that in the north we say a woman's place is on her back.\" For he would not, he said, be daft enough to insult the females in his beloved constituency. That's logical. As for us in the south, we're fair game. • More from Spear's, the magazine for the super-wealthy, on how readers of \"high net worth\" might cope in this dangerous time of recession. Alongside advice about what to do if rioters invade your west London mansion, there is good news. Even the fashion-conscious can now wear a bulletproof vest. \"Fashion and technology have combined to make defensive garments not just lighter and safe but even somewhat stylish,\" it says. \"You'll need a little bit of spare shrapnel – at least £5,000 – for your turn on the armour-plated catwalk, but it's cheaper than – well, dying.\" There are bulletproof dress shirts, blazers, polo shirts, raincoats. Everything is there to make the high net-worther feel just that bit safer. Mind you, they could just pay their full whack of tax instead. • Finally, a word from Paolo de Canio, the controversial manager of Swindon Town. He is speaking on behalf of League Cup sponsors Capital One, the credit card company, and discusses with the Evening Standard's Mihir Bose his thoughts on Benito Mussolini as \"basically a very principled ethical individual … deeply misunderstood\". I \"don't take everything from one regime. I am talking of leadership,\" says Paolo. \"It is in my book. I don't say I want fascism. These ideas, they begin to help people, the pensioners, to make new schools, build new cities for the people. That was good at the beginning. Then, at the end, everything went wrong for many reasons. I don't want go through it now because I am not a political person. I have friends who are black, Jewish.\" We get the drift, Paolo. At Swindon, we suppose, the training always runs on time.

In a highly critical assessment published on Thursday, a Japanese parliamentary panel challenged claims by the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), that the triple meltdown at the plant in north-east Japan had been caused solely by a 14-metre tsunami on 11 March last year. The panel said the magnitude-9 earthquake that preceded the waves could not be ruled out as a cause of the accident. It accused Tepco and regulators at the nuclear and industrial safety agency of failing to take adequate safety measures, despite evidence that the area was susceptible to powerful earthquakes and tsunamis. \"The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties,\" said the report, compiled by the Fukushima nuclear accident independent investigation commission. \"They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly 'man-made'. \"We believe that the root causes were the organisational and regulatory systems that supported faulty rationales for decisions and actions, rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual. \"Across the board, the commission found ignorance and arrogance unforgivable for anyone or any organisation that deals with nuclear power. We found a disregard for global trends and a disregard for public safety.\" The commission's chairman, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a professor emeritus at Tokyo University, said in a scathing introduction that cultural traits had caused the disaster. He said: \"What must be admitted – very painfully – is that this was a disaster 'Made in Japan.' Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the programme'; our groupism; and our insularity. \"Had other Japanese been in the shoes of those who bear responsibility for this accident, the result may well have been the same.\" The 641-page report was published on the same day a nuclear reactor in western Japan became the first to produce electricity since the accident. All of the country's 50 functioning reactors had been switched off after the crisis to undergo safety checks. Japan, which once depended on nuclear power for about a third of its energy supply, was briefly without atomic power for the first time in more than 40 years after the last reactor went offline in early May. The No 3 reactor at Oi nuclear power plant in Fukui prefecture is the first to be restarted after passing stress tests that the government introduced last year to ease public concerns over safety. The government approved the restart of reactors 3 and 4 at Oi amid warnings that without them a large area of western Japan, including the industrial city of Osaka, could face power shortages this summer. The No 3 reactor should reach full capacity by 10 July, the plant's operator, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), said, while the second unit will begin producing electricity towards the end of the month. The last of the plant's 11 reactors were switched off in February. Thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the prime minister's office every Friday evening to protest against the restart, while polls show a majority of Japanese want the government to phase out nuclear power. \"We have made a step toward the safe and stable supply of electricity by being able to deliver nuclear-generated electricity for the first time in four and a half months,\" Kepco's president, Makoto Yagi, said in a statement. While not unexpected, the critical tone of Thursday's report contrasts with a similar investigation by Tepco in which the utility insisted it had acted appropriately in the wake of a natural disaster it claimed it could never have predicted. Tepco has always maintained that the damage to four of Fukushima Daiichi's reactors was caused by the tsunami, which knocked out cooling apparatus and prompted a core meltdown in three of the units. More than 15 months later, the plant has been brought to a safe state known as \"cold shutdown,\" although concerns have been voiced about the state of a pool containing spent fuel rods in reactor No 4. Thursday's report called for an investigation into the role the earthquake played in the accident. \"As for direct cause of the accident, the commission reached the conclusion that we cannot definitely say any devices that were important for safety were not damaged by the earthquake,\" it said. \"We cannot rule out the possibility that a small-scale LOCA (loss-of-coolant accident) occurred at the reactor No 1 in particular.\" The panel was also critical of Naoto Kan, the prime minister at the time of the accident, whose \"direct intervention\" in the early days of the crisis had caused confusion in the chain of command and wasted valuable time. Kan has said he decided to intervene in the emergency response because Tepco and safety officials appeared incapable of doing so. The parliamentary panel said there was no evidence, however, to support Kan's claim that Tepco was preparing to withdraw all of its workers from the plant in the immediate aftermath of the accident. But it accused Tepco of ignoring warnings going as far back as 2006 that a tsunami could cause a blackout at the plant. The firm, regulators and the government had \"failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements, such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release,\" it said. \"Since 2006, the regulators and Tepco were aware of the risk that a total outage of electricity at the Fukushima Daiichi plant might occur if a tsunami were to reach the level of the site.\" The 10-member commission is one of several panels investigating the Fukushima Daiichi accident. The report follows a six-month investigation involving more than 900 hours of hearings and interviews with more than 1,100 people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/15/hundreds-injured-meteorite-russian-city-chelyabinsk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-15T18:14:00Z","webTitle":"Meteorite explosion over Chelyabinsk injures hundreds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/15/hundreds-injured-meteorite-russian-city-chelyabinsk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/15/hundreds-injured-meteorite-russian-city-chelyabinsk","fields":{"headline":"Meteorite explosion over Chelyabinsk injures hundreds","bodyText":"Almost 1,100 people have been injured after a huge meteorite flared spectacularly in the skies above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. It broke windows, damaged buildings and caused panic as mobile networks overloaded. Videos from the scene at 9:23am local time showed objects plunging through the clear morning sky and erupting into enormous fireballs to the sound of multiple explosions. Long vapour trails were seen hundreds of miles away. \"I didn't understand what was going on,\" said Galina Zaglumyonova, who lives in Chelyabinsk, a city of over a million people to the south of the Ural mountains. \"There was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions … our first thought was that it was a plane crash,\" she said. The alarms of all the cars on the street went off after the loud bangs. The Russian Academy of Sciences estimated that the meteorite weighed about 10 tons and entered the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of at least 54,000 kph (33,000 mph), shattering about 30-50km (18-32 miles) above ground. Russian officials said that they had already found where the main chunk of the meteorite had fallen, on the outskirts the city. At the last count, 474 people had been injured with over 20 hospitalised, according to Russia's emergency situations ministry. The figure rose throughout the morning and is expected to continue to rise. Many of those who suffered were hit by flying glass, but there were no reports of any deaths or life-threatening injuries. Zaglumyonova told the Guardian that the windows of her balcony were shattered by the explosion, and the clay pots containing plants on her windowsill were broken. Mobile networks were down for about two hours after the meteorite plunged to Earth as people attempted to call each other and find out what had happened, she added. The Chelyabinsk authorities said that radiation levels in the region, which has several nuclear power stations, were normal and that evacuations were not underway. But schools and universities were closed, staff sent home early, and heavy damage reported at one zinc factory that suffered broken windows and collapsed walls. Rumours swirled in the hours after the incident. The meteorite may have been engaged by local air defence units and blown apart at an altitude of 20km (12.4 miles), according to reports on state-owned TV channel Russia Today. There was no official confirmation of any military action. The ultranationalist leader of Russia's Liberal Democrat party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said that it was not a meteorite shower, but \"a test of new American weapons,\" Interfax reported. Both the president, Vladimir Putin, and the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, were informed about the incident. \"I hope the consequences will not be serious,\" Medvedev said at an economic forum in Siberia, Interfax reported. \"It's proof that not only are economies vulnerable, but the whole planet.\" The deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's former ambassador to Nato, called for an international initiative to create a warning system for \"objects of an alien origin\". Neither the United States nor Russia has the capability to bring down such objects, he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/04/mps-back-decarbonisation-target-energy-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-04T05:30:01Z","webTitle":"MPs must back decarbonisation target in energy bill vote | Tim Yeo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/04/mps-back-decarbonisation-target-energy-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/04/mps-back-decarbonisation-target-energy-bill","fields":{"headline":"MPs must back decarbonisation target in energy bill vote","bodyText":"For more than two decades I have accepted the overwhelming scientific evidence that the increased concentration of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution is causing global temperatures to rise. Thankfully in parliament there is largely cross-party consensus on the evidence linking carbon emissions to climate change. The question now is how to move to a low-carbon economy in the most affordable way possible. Decarbonising our power sector is – after greater energy efficiency – the most cost-effective way of achieving our carbon reduction goals. Other sectors such as transport will rely heavily on a clean electricity supply to reduce emissions using electric cars and high-speed rail. Failure to decarbonise the electricity sector now could mean that we are forced to take more costly action to constrain emissions in future. That is why today's vote in parliament on the energy bill is so vital. The legislation aims to ensure that the UK attracts £75bn in investment in new generating capacity over the next decade by introducing long-term contracts to guarantee a price for low-carbon electricity, thereby reducing risks for investors building new nuclear power stations and offshore windfarms. The need for rapid electricity market reform is clear. One-fifth of existing capacity is due to close in the next decade – and our capacity to meet everyday energy demand will be down to less than 5% by 2015. Worryingly, the UK is currently experiencing an investment hiatus as investors wait for the process to be concluded before committing to any new large, long-term projects. It is still uncertain whether EDF and the government can agree on a strike price for Hinkley C. Gas plants are barely making money while the economics of coal are seeing coal plants burn rapidly through the remaining hours available to them under the large combustion plant directive. Odd and sometimes contradictory signals are coming from government about its commitment to a low-carbon future, putting off investment even in renewable projects. The gas generation strategy published last December contemplates building as much as 37GW of new gas-fired capacity, a prospect that is incompatible with the UK meeting its legislated carbon reduction targets. The sensitivity of a high gas-based power system is great not just because of energy security – the UK faces a growing gas import gap which will take years to eliminate even if we exploit our shale gas potential – but also because of price volatility and its potential impact on consumer bills. There is no doubt that gas generation is needed to provide flexible backup capacity when all of the country's kettles are put on at the same time, but the resilience of the UK system could be called into question if we rely on it too heavily. I am an advocate of the exploitation of our shale gas reserves as it would cut imports and improve our balance of payments but we need to be realistic. Until more exploration has been done we cannot know how much of our reserves are economically recoverable and the planning and public acceptance difficulties will be far greater here than in the US. Few in government have faced up to the fact that investment confidence is so low. Ministers must provide clarity quickly on the proposed strike price levels, the allocation process for the new contracts and details about the capacity mechanism. Government must also set a decarbonisation target for electricity generation in 2030 sooner rather than later. The inclusion of a carbon intensity target was a unanimous recommendation of the cross-party energy select committee following our scrutiny of the draft bill. As the energy bill currently stands though, the energy secretary may set one but not before 2016 at the earliest giving very little confidence to the sector. I have tabled an amendment with cross-party support to bring the date of this decision forward to 1 April 2014 and ensure it is set in line with the advice of the Committee on Climate Change, the government's statutory independent adviser tasked with monitoring the latest climate science and ensuring the UK meets its legally binding carbon reduction targets in the most cost effective manner. Its analysis suggests that consumers and the wider economy will benefit from the early adoption of a 2030 target. The committee recently recommended the adoption of a target in 2014 and estimated that it would help deliver savings of between £25-£45bn on consumer energy bills. There is strong support from the business community for a 2030 target and other countries are also pressing ahead with their own investment, with China and the US spending $65bn and $35.5bn respectively on low-carbon energy last year. Investment decisions in the energy sector are long term and investors working in a global marketplace need confidence in the UK's policy framework. The UK needs a secure and clean energy supply that is affordable. More clarity now on our long-term strategic direction will increase confidence in the sector, reduce the perceived risks and hopefully cut the cost of capital. Setting a target to make our power sector virtually fossil fuel-free by 2030 will benefit the economy, climate, consumers and business alike. I urge my colleagues on all sides of the House to seize the opportunity today to set it into law."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/gallery/2012/apr/16/fukushima-residents-return-to-kawauchi-in-pictures","type":"gallery","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-16T16:38:17Z","webTitle":"A year after Fukushima, residents return to Kawauchi - in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/apr/16/fukushima-residents-return-to-kawauchi-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/gallery/2012/apr/16/fukushima-residents-return-to-kawauchi-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"A year after Fukushima, residents return to Kawauchi - in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jan/30/cumbria-rejects-underground-nuclear-storage","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-30T16:09:00Z","webTitle":"Cumbria rejects underground nuclear storage dump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/30/cumbria-rejects-underground-nuclear-storage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jan/30/cumbria-rejects-underground-nuclear-storage","fields":{"headline":"Cumbria rejects underground nuclear storage dump","bodyText":"Government plans to undertake preliminary work on an underground storage dump for nuclear waste were rejected by Cumbria county council on Wednesday, adding a major roadblock to plans for a long term solution to the problem of nuclear waste. The county and its western district councils Allerdale and Copeland which make up the \"nuclear coast\" opposite the Isle of Man were the only local authorities in the UK still involved in feasibility studies for the £12bn disposal facility. Cumbria's cabinet voted 7-3 against research continuing, after evidence from independent geologists that the fractured strata of the county was impossible to entrust with such dangerous material and a hazard lasting millennia. An impassioned campaign by environmentalists also raised fears for the western Lake District, winning backing from the Lake District national park authority and hundreds of influential landscape groups in the UK and overseas. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said the government would continue to search for an underground storage site. \"We remain firmly committed to geological disposal as the right policy for the long-term, safe and secure management of radioactive waste. We also remain committed to the principles of voluntarism and a community-led approach. \"The fact that Copeland voted in favour of entering the search for a potential site for a GDF [geological disposal facility] demonstrates that communities recognise the benefits associated with hosting such a facility. For any host community there will be a substantial community benefits package, worth hundreds of millions of pounds. That is in addition to the hundreds of jobs and major investment that such a huge infrastructure project could bring.\" Suitable candidates for the depot, the size of an underground Workington and required to meet unprecedented safety guarantees of up to a million years, had been whittled down to an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on the Solway Firth and the wild grandeur of the western fells around Ennerdale and Eskdale. Voting to proceed would have been only a very early step along the way, but evidence that drilling and prospecting would have brought roads and temporary settlements to some of the UK's loveliest countryside left many aghast. The plan was strongly supported by unions and many Labour councillors and MPs with almost 10,000 jobs at the Sellafield plant in Copeland and many more indirectly dependent on it. It would have created up to 1000 additional jobs, with storage scheduled to start in 2040 if feasibility studies were approved. Labour's Tim Knowles, who holds the environment portfolio in Cumbria's cabinet, fought for a compromise which would have see research continue eveywhere in Copeland except the national park. But he was outvoted after a series of colleagues including the county's Conservative leader, Eddie Martin, warned of radioactivity risks and the huge potential blight on tourism, Cumbria's biggest earner. He said after the vote: \"Cabinet believes there is sufficient doubt around the suitability of West Cumbria's geology to put an end now to the uncertainty and worry this is causing for our communities. Cumbria is not the best place geologically in the UK – the government's efforts need to be focused on disposing of the waste underground in the safest place, not the easiest. \"Members have remained concerned throughout on the issue of the legal right of withdrawal if we proceed to the next stage. Despite assurances from government that they intend to introduce this as primary legislation, we do believe that this could have been done far sooner to ease our concerns. The fact remains the right of withdrawal is not yet enshrined in statute and we could not take the risk of saying yes today without this being absolutely nailed down. \"Cumbria has a unique and world-renowned landscape which needs to be cherished and protected. While Sellafield and the Lake District have co-existed side by side successfully for decades, we fear that if the area becomes known in the national conscience as the place where nuclear waste is stored underground, the Lake District's reputation may not be so resilient.\" The government is expected to focus now on major improvements to current surface storage of waste at Sellafield, on the lines demanded in a National Audit Office report in November which was scathing about standards. Both opponents and supporters of the underground dump agree that this would be an alternative source of new work in West Cumbria. The council's Labour deputy leader, Stewart Young, said: \"The case for investment in Sellafield is now more pressing than ever. We had always raised concerns over the lack of any plan B from government and the fact that West Cumbria was the only area to express an interest in the process left the government with few options if we decided not to proceed. It is now time for the government to secure the long-term future of the nuclear industry and put in place robust storage arrangements at Sellafield while it decides how to continue the search for a repository elsewhere in the UK.\" Greenpeace's energy campaigner, Leila Deen, said: \"This decision represents yet another major blow for the government's attempts to force the construction of costly nuclear power plants. Even the prime minister admits we need a plan to store waste before we can build a single new plant. This decision shows that dumping waste in uncertain geology near one of the country's most pristine national parks is not a solution. Ministers must now re-consider their nuclear ambitions and turn their attention instead to clean, sustainable and renewable energy.\" The three councils deferred a decision in October because of unease over a guaranteed right to withdraw right up until construction work started, and to look at alternative disposal methods. Evidence given by Prof Stuart Haszeldine (Haszeldine), a geologist at the University of Edinburgh, played an important part in raising concern. He said: \"This has been a very short-sighted policy, run by driving local councils into volunteering for the wrong reasons: financial inducements. A lot of information is being suppressed in the process to entice councils into accepting technically flawed sites. He recalled how a £400m examination of a site chosen close to Sellafield in the 1980s and 1990s was eventually abandoned due to the highly complex and fractured nature of the geology. He said: \"I am very concerned we are heading into a cul-de-sac as before. Ultimately, do we believe in evidence-based policy or political opportunism to exploit communities with limited economic opportunities?\" Deep geological disposal was the best long-term solution for nuclear waste, but only if the site is suitable. Davey offered reassurance to Sellafield workers that the vote did not signal the winding down of the \"nuclear coast\" which has the huge complex at his heart. He said: \"We respect the decision made today by Cumbria councillors. They have invested a great deal of time in this project and have provided valuable lessons on how to take forward this process in future. While their decision to withdraw is disappointing, Cumbria will continue to play a central role in the energy and nuclear power sectors.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/21/edf-legal-action-democratic-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-21T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Letters: EDF legal action is blow to the right of democratic protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/21/edf-legal-action-democratic-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/21/edf-legal-action-democratic-protest","fields":{"headline":"EDF legal action is blow to the right of democratic protest","bodyText":"EDF's decision to take out a £5m lawsuit against a handful of climate activists represents a new low in corporate attempts to stifle democratic dissent (Protesters who occupied power station sued for £5m, 21 February).

Nancy McEldowney for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 1. (C) Summary: Despite its status as Bulgaria's highest priority energy project, the Belene Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) is foundering. Marred by cost over-runs, financing problems, infighting between strategic partners, XXXXXXXXXXXX and serious delays, the project is looking increasingly like a lemon. The relationship between the government and the project's strategic investor, the German RWE, is one of mutual buyer's remorse. But with 700 million euros in sunk costs, in addition to priceless political capital already invested, the government is unlikely to walk away from the project. End Summary. 2. (C) When Bulgarians talk about the Belene nuclear power plant, they increasingly do so in hushed tones. Issues of delays, financing woes, non-transparent horse-trading and side deals, Russian influence, middle-man rent seeking, and the interests of well-connected politicians and energy oligarchs inevitably come up. Belene's construction offered the perfect chance for Bulgaria to decrease its independence on Russian energy sources. But the Stanishev-led government, indebted to Russia-connected energy oligarchs, let the opportunity slip away. In 2006, Bulgaria chose Russian company AtomStroyExport over a Skoda-led consortium as Belene NPP's main contractor. The tender was managed by former Minister of Economy and Energy Rumen Ovcharov, a pro-Russia energy maestro, who left office (but not political life) in June 2007 after an energy-related corruption scandal. The Belene deal lacked transparency and reeked of side deals involving the proposed South Stream gas pipeline and the long-term gas transit contract Ovcharov was negotiating with Gazprom at the same time. ------------------------------- ONE OLD PROJECT GETS A NEW LIFE ------------------------------- 3. (C) Belene was originally started in the 1980s, but was abandoned in the early 1990s due to lack of funds. In 2005, to make up for the European Commission's decision to close Bulgaria's Kozluduy NPP reactors 1-4, the Bulgarian government approved the construction of a new 2000 MWe plant at Belene. (Note: Kozluduy units 1 and 2 were shut down due to safety concerns in 2003, while units 3 and 4 were taken off-line at the end of 2006, on the eve of Bulgaria's EU accession.) The Bulgarian National Electric Company (NEC) hired WorleyParsons as the strategic architect engineer for the financing and construction of the plant in 2005. Belene,s two units (1 and 2) will be of the Russian A-92 design (third generation) with pressurized water reactor (PWR), each producing 1000 MW electric power. The main contractor of the project, AtomStroyExport, is working with the main foreign contractor CARSIB Consortium (Areva and Siemens). In December 2008 NEC and RWE (Germany) signed a strategic investor agreement for the project with NEC controlling 51 percent and RWE with 49 percent. 4. (C) Bulgarian company participation in the Belene project is approximately 30 percent. XXXXXXXXXXXXThe French bank PNB Paribus financed the pre-construction loan of 250 million Euros. Currently, teams are preparing the site for new construction by tearing down old infrastructure from the 1980s. The plant's construction is expected to begin in late 2009 or early 2010. Construction will be in two stages. Unit 1 was originally planned to come on-line in 2014-2015 followed by Unit 2 in 2015-2016, according to the Belene NPP Managing Director, Jordan Georgiev. These time frames are now widely in doubt. --------------- BUYER'S REMORSE --------------- 5. (C) Despite its due diligence, our contacts tell us Belene,s strategic investor, RWE, is now experiencing regret about its purchase. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, RWE SOFIA 00000069 002 OF 002 worries about the project's lack of transparency and the need to work with AtomStroyExport. RWE wants to enforce European business practices, and is now demanding to review all Belene-related agreements. RWE is reportedly negotiating with Belgium's Electrabel to join it as a subcontractor (likely to be announced in mid-March) to help re-inforce standard European business practices. RWE's insistence on reviewing all agreements is causing Bulgaria heartburn. Delays of 3-5 years have already been announced, and Belene is not expected to come on-line until 2016-2017. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, RWE realizes that working with Russian and Bulgarian companies in the energy sector is a \"poisonous combination\" for European investment. Transparency is affecting financing. RWE (and Electrabel) want European banks to finance their half of the project, hoping EU restrictions and western lending standards would help with transparency. However, with the current global financial crisis, they believe finding a European bank will be difficult and may reluctantly have to turn to Russia for the money. 6. (C) The Bulgarians are also experiencing buyer's remorse. Despite Russia's offer to extend a loan of about four billion Euros for the project, rumors abound that the Russians do not have the money to finance the project and the Bulgarians have been reluctant to take the money in any event, for fear of being seen as \"too close\" to the Russians. For their part, the Bulgarians at Belene are chafing at RWE,s close scrutiny of all decisions and complain that this approach is needlessly slowing the project. Our contacts say that some Bulgarian officials are beginning to admit privately that in Belene, they have bought \"a lemon.\" NEC has sunk approximately 700 million euros into the project, while the Russians are not out of pocket and could walk away losing nothing. Meanwhile, cost estimates for Belene continue to creep up, running as high as eight billion euros, double the original price. ------------------------------ BELENE VS KOZLUDUY UNITS 7 &amp; 8 ------------------------------ 7. (C) The rumors of trouble at Belene have resurrected the idea of a competing project at Bulgaria's only working nuclear power plant, Kozluduy. Bulgarian Minister of Energy and Economy Petar Dimitrov has been actively and publicly courting Westinghouse to invest in a project to build two new reactors at Kozluduy -- units 7 and 8. Contacts say that the existing infrastructure, powerlines connecting Kozluduy to the national power grid, and a highly-skilled workforce close by at currently-operating Kozludy 5 and 6 give Kozluduy 7 and 8 at least a one billion euro cost edge over Belene. Westinghouse officials are cautiously interested, but only if the Belene project is abandoned and Bulgarian government financial support is put into Kozluduy. They want to avoid being used simply to create a new sense of urgency to jump-start Belene. 8. (C) Comment: There is clearly something amiss at Belene. Asked whether the project was in jeopardy, a senior WorleyParsons official privately told us that while the project was still likely to go forward, \"countries walk away from deals like this all the time.\" With elections on the horizon and 700 million euros in sunk costs, in addition to priceless political capital already invested, the government is unlikely to abandon the project any time soon. But it may be on a very slow track.

Stan was born in Middleton, Manchester, the eldest of three children. He attempted to join the RAF at the outbreak of the second world war but was initially turned down because his job as an apprentice draughtsman was seen as important to the war effort. He instead assisted the air-raid wardens as a fire spotter. Stan finally joined the RAF in 1942 and before long was flying Mosquito fighter bombers. The attack on the Gestapo headquarters followed the arrest of the leader of the Danish resistance and 145 of his men. The Gestapo had captured records and the destruction of these was imperative, in order to save the lives of other fighters. Twenty-six Mosquitos from the RAF's 2 Group undertook low-level precision bombing of the two college buildings of the University of Aarhus which housed the Gestapo and their records. The entire operation was to be flown at \"zero\" feet, to avoid being detected by radar, and most of the journey was over the sea. In his memoirs Stan observed: \"Whilst I was refuelling [back in England], I was asked to take a passenger back to base. Their aircraft was damaged and unserviceable. They had flown so low that their tail had hit the roof of the building and had left their tail wheel back in a street in Aarhus.\" The Danish resistance organisations were vital as they prevented German reinforcements and supplies in Norway being transported to the European front. Many Danish resistance members were to play an important role in the formation of the postwar government. In May 1945 all the crew members who had taken part in the raid received a letter of thanks, accompanied by a pair of silver cufflinks embossed with the Danish royal crest. After the war, Stan remained in the RAF for a while. One of his missions was to transport the former German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to his trial and subsequent execution at Nuremberg. Stan was eventually discharged and found work in the engineering industry, in time joining the Central Electricity Generating Board and working on the design of the UK's first wave of nuclear power stations. His passion for flying never waned and he continued to fly gliders well into his late 80s. My mother, Christine, whom Stan married in 1945, died in April 2012. He is survived by his siblings Jessie and Norman; his three children, Peter, John and me; and seven grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/sep/28/labour-nuclear-power-subsidy-horizon","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-28T08:47:09Z","webTitle":"Labour's love-in with the nuclear industry still blossoming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/sep/28/labour-nuclear-power-subsidy-horizon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/sep/28/labour-nuclear-power-subsidy-horizon","fields":{"headline":"Labour's love-in with the nuclear industry still blossoming","bodyText":"Labour's love-in with the nuclear industry continued at a fringe event at the party conference in Liverpool, though not without some indiscreet words slipping out. Public consultations on the building of new nuclear power stations are required by law, but would not cause problems in getting them built, Alan Raymant, COO of Horizon Nuclear Power said. \"As a developer we are not obliged to follow the results of the public consultation. But we have to take it into account and explain why we have not include its recommendations,\" he said. Horizon is the joint venture of E.on and RWE npower looking to build 6GW of new nuclear powers. There was more: \"It's absolutely fundamental to have public consultations but we have to realise that we can't please everyone if we are to have an economic project,\" Raymant said. He got support from Malcolm Grimston, an energy policy expert at Chatham House: \"Public consultations have become a type of referendum. What they should be is: This needs to be done, do you have better ideas of how to do it?\" I'd say the same about big renewable projects, so won't argue with that. But Grimston argued that public and political consent must be considered as a factor just as important as the three fundamental issues of energy we usually talk about, cost, carbon and continuity of supply. He's right, as it's no good having a plan that meets the three Cs if the public and their elected representatives won't accept it. Raymant talked calmly about the long regulatory and business path that leads to switching on a new nuclear power plant, but in doing so emphasised the great challenge. Horizon will apply for its licenses in 2013 and, \"if market conditions are right\", start building in 2015. \"We expect to be generating from our first site in Wylfa [in Wales] in early 2020,\" Raymant said. Energy efficiency and renewables could be much faster out of the blocks, and less prone to delays and cost overruns, but will they provide enough secure power to keep the lights on? Well, that's the debate. The panel also included Labour MPs Huw Irranca-Davies, shadow energy minister, and John Robertson, chair of a parliamentary nuclear group. Arguments were strongly made that nuclear power was needed in the UK as part of a balanced energy approach. But the panel itself, convened by the Nuclear Industry Association, wasn't balanced. In the UK, and post-Fukushima, 41% of the public think the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks, with 28% saying the opposite. On the panel, 100% supported nuclear power. Nonetheless, despite Labour's nuclear love being a relatively new one – dating only from the mid-2000s – Irranca-Davies felt secure enough in the industry's affection to warn against it taking him for granted. The new nuclear plants had to be built on time and on budget, he said sternly. \"And I don't want nuclear to be used as a disguise for walking away from renewables. We will be watching with an eagle eye.\" I asked why one of the UK's big six, SSE, had just walked away from nuclear? \"Some will come in [to specifc energy sectors], some will come out, which is why we need many players,\" he said. The trouble with that is that the only door being used in the nuclear industry is the exit. A Labour party member asked how much subsidy the nuclear industry received and whether it would be better used in funding a huge energy efficiency drive. He didn't get an answer. Raymant, with a straight face, said: \"No-one who is looking to develop nuclear is asking for subsidies. We are asking for a stable framework in which to develop low carbon technologies.\" It fell to Grimston afterwards to make sense of that. Raymant is right, he said, but only because of the \"farce\" the coalition has got into where it can't call its support for nuclear a \"subsidy\" because of the political contortion needed to keep the anti-nuclear LibDem party on board. On the subject of semantics, I suppose the many millions of pounds that existing nuclear operators will reap from the forthcoming carbon floor price isn't strictly a subsidy either: it's a windfall. The toxic nature of that in public opinion is in fact shared by Horizon, as they don't have any old nukes. EDF energy does, and in an interesting line in the NIA newsletter handed out at the event, Steve Hargreaves, corporate strategy director at EDF, says: \"2011 has seen the government listen to its stakeholders.\" As the proposals for electricity market reform and shocking collusion over playing down the Fukushima disaster showed, the government certainly listened to EDF. So the nuclear bandwagon creeps forward with all main political parties on board. But will the new power stations be built on time and on cost? I remain to be convinced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/may/29/uk-emissions-fell-further-eu-2011","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-29T14:17:07Z","webTitle":"UK emissions fell further than other EU nations after mild 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/29/uk-emissions-fell-further-eu-2011","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/may/29/uk-emissions-fell-further-eu-2011","fields":{"headline":"UK emissions fell further than other EU nations after mild 2011","bodyText":"The mild winter of 2011-12 may seem a distant memory after this year's big chill, but the warmer temperatures helped the UK achieve a fall in greenhouse gases steeper than any other nation in the European Union. In 2011, the latest year for which figures are available, UK emissions of climate-warming gases dropped by 7%, compared with an EU average of 3.3%, according to data released on Wednesday by the European Environment Agency (EEA). The decrease in the UK's emissions, according to Europe's environment watchdog, came mainly from lower gas use in homes, owing to the milder temperatures, and lower demand for electricity. There was also more hydro-electricity production and technical problems that cut nuclear power output in 2010 had been resolved, bringing more low-emission power onstream. The fall in greenhouse gas emissions across the EU was significantly deeper than the 2.5% that had been expected, and came despite a marked recent increase in the use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. A mild winter across other member states was a big contributor to the decline, as it was in the UK. Overall fossil fuel use – including coal, natural gas and oil – fell by 5% in the EU in 2011, but the use of coal alone rose by 2%. At the same time, renewable energy use fell, mainly because of a lack of hydroelectricity across the EU. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA executive director, said: \"The greenhouse gas emissions cut in 2011 is good news, however, it was largely due to a warmer winter. If Europe is to achieve the transition towards a low-carbon society, it will need sustained investment in technology and innovation.\" Coal use had been falling in the EU, as emissions from the highest carbon fossil fuel were penalised under the EU's emissions trading scheme, which requires heavy industries to produce permits for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit. This was supposed to make coal less economic than cleaner alternatives such as renewables. But the emissions trading system no longer has any bite – businesses received so many free permits to emit carbon that they flooded the market, reducing the price to record lows. Earlier in 2013, the European commission proposed a tightening of the system, by postponing the release of a number of new permits. But after fierce business lobbying in Brussels, and a rebellion by Tory MEPs, that attempt was scotched and there is now little prospect of the trading scheme picking up in the next few years. At the same time, the boom in shale gas in the US has resulted in a glut of cheap coal no longer wanted there, that is now being imported into Europe instead at bargain prices. In the UK, coal use has increased significantly this year. As much as a third of power generation is now regularly coming from the ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations. The emissions data from Europe's environment watchdog came as a new report from Ernst &amp; Young, the consultancy, found that the UK was failing to attract renewable energy investment. The UK is no longer one of the most attractive EU member states for renewables companies, having slipped to fifth place in the rankings. Ben Warren, environmental finance leader at Ernst &amp; Young, said the government had not capitalised on the opportunities to move ahead of other EU states, where investment has been hampered by the eurozone crisis and economic uncertainty. He said: \"We are at a stage where the UK is presented with a unique opportunity to become a safe harbour for renewable energy investment in Europe. The foundations are there [but] competing visions and strategies within the government about the country's future energy mix pose serious questions among investors about whether we can compete for capital on a global level.\" He pointed to successes such as the green investment bank, set up with £3bn in taxpayer funding, but said more needed to be done – and done quickly – if the UK was to be a leader in green investment. \"There has never been a better time to turn the UK into the go-to market for investment in renewable energy in Europe.\" Whether the coalition has the appetite to be a leader in green investment has come under question from the green power industry. At the weekend, Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said that the UK would oppose an EU-wide 2030 target for renewable energy, to take over when the current 2020 goal, of generating 20% of energy from renewable, expires. Such a target is seen as essential by many green power generators to give investors the long term certainty to invest. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said that the UK was instead championing a tough limit on emissions target for 2030, of an EU-wide cut of 40% compared with 1990 levels, that would spur investment. But Guy Shrubsole, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"Investors want politicians to stop dithering, stand up to George Osborne, and demonstrate that the UK's green economy is open for business long-term.\" He urged MPs to vote for an amendment to the energy bill now progressing through parliament – and which will move to its third reading on Monday – that would ensure the power sector was effectively decarbonised by 2030. He said: \"MPs must vote to set a clean power target now, to drive forward investment in renewable energy and create thousands of UK jobs. Any more delays will see business lost abroad.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/sep/07/live-web-chat-nuclear-kirk-sorensen","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-07T10:34:28Z","webTitle":"Live chat: nuclear thorium technologist Kirk Sorensen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/sep/07/live-web-chat-nuclear-kirk-sorensen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/sep/07/live-web-chat-nuclear-kirk-sorensen","fields":{"headline":"Live chat: nuclear thorium technologist Kirk Sorensen","bodyText":"Kirk Sorensen, nuclear technologist and former Nasa engineer, will be on-hand today between 1 and 2pm for a live session to discuss your questions on nuclear energy.

But your policy recommendations are naive. Much of the CO² that will affect the climate this century is already in the atmosphere. Global warming will lead to further warming, through several mechanisms including the greater absorption of sunlight that you mention and the release of trapped methane and CO². Any attempt to stop the process would have to involve international agreement and action on an unprecedented scale because, even if Britain were able to stop producing CO² completely, the impact on the climate would be small. The actions necessary to halt or restrict climate change are politically impossible to deliver: massive investments in nuclear power worldwide, dramatic constraints on travel and other activities that burn fossil fuels, and much more. This could not be implemented even in Britain, let alone internationally. The debate about further runways in the south-east of England illustrates just how far British politicians are from understanding the global warming crisis. The speculative geoengineering \"solutions\" that have been proposed would be a high risk gamble with the planet and unlikely to succeed. We need instead to accept that increased global warming is inevitable and plan on that basis. Rather than policies reminiscent of King Canute, we need a mature recognition that sea levels will rise and that large parts of the world will become uninhabitable. When the worst happens, it will become clear that we should have acted now (or sooner) to build large-scale defences and to relocate vulnerable cities and communities to higher ground. If we started seriously planning to relocate London to somewhere safe, it would demonstrate a realistic understanding of the situation that would make it far easier to lead opinion nationally and internationally. Before long, talk of better insulation, electric vehicles, new runways and wind power will be seen for the minor considerations that they largely are. The solutions need to match the scale of the crisis you have rightly identified. Martyn Thomas London • Your editorial says climate change is happening faster than anybody expected. That may not be true. I think you'll find that those who actually know what they are talking about when it comes to climate change expected it to be at least as bad as it's turning out to be.

The fact that many seemed reluctant to pursue the accusations very vigorously. The fact that great efforts were being made to keep the whole matter away from \"the bourgeois court system\". News of a second case has only made matters worse. In the first instance, the alleged victim claimed she was subjected to offensive questions about her sexual past and drinking habits. As the row rumbles on, members are quitting. Now, the anger over the way the SWP has handled sexual abuse allegations has spread to India. Central committee member and international secretary Professor Alex Callinicos was to play a starring role in next week's first South Asian Historical Materialism Conference. He would have been part of one debate and chaired another. He has been abruptly disinvited. He's not happy. \"I understand of course how important the issue of rape and sexual violence is in India, especially after last December's gang rape and murder in Delhi,\" he says in a letter to the organisers, posted on Facebook. \"It is also a very important question in Britain, and for me personally, as it is for the Socialist Workers party. We are strongly committed to women's liberation. We took the rape allegations against a leading member extremely seriously; the controversy over how the party handled these allegations is indicative of that seriousness.\" A special conference held recently will \"review our procedures, and we intend to use this to reinforce our efforts to combat the oppression of women\", he says. But there's been no reply. Maybe, if the party can find its way to the 21st century, he'll be asked again next year. • Endlessly scratchy in Tower Hamlets, east London where there is total war between Labour and the independent mayor Lutfur Rahman. He says the party stitched him up, forcing him to run as an independent. Critics accuse him of disloyalty and consorting with extremists, and vow that next time Labour will give him a jolly good thrashing. It's ugly. How ugly? Well, this week three Lab activists – Ian Mackenzie, a former special adviser to Lord Prescott, former MP Greg Pope and Rob Marchant, a former Labour manager and party sage – were discussing the prospects on Twitter. The worry was that Rahman might win again or even seek readmission to the Labour party. \"Makes mental note to keep revolver well cleaned and oiled,\" tweeted Marchant. The gloom ran deep. \"I will load the revolver and we can all take turns,\" he said. To shoot themselves or to shoot the mayor? One guesses the former, and Marchant says the thought was indeed self-harm rather than assassination. For all that, Rahman's office – gleaning a \"death threat\" – has reported it to the police. • It's the life of Brian at Liverpool's John Moores University as the Queen guitarist and animal rights activist Brian May stands down as chancellor.

They are not company executives, but they feel a sense of guilt and responsibility, even though they were not the perpetrators. \"They deserve more respect, as they are doing one of the hardest jobs in the world.\" Public criticism of the slow pace of decommissioning, coupled with the stress of working at the site, has reportedly prompted several Tepco workers to quit. Others complain that, two years on from the triple meltdown, they lack motivation, raising the prospect of a shortage of technicians and other experts when the Fukushima clean-up reaches its most critical stage. Labourers employed by the many sub-contractors with a presence at the plant complain of the discomfort of long days spent in stifling protective masks, the stress of the job, and their relatively low pay. About 70% of a sample of workers surveyed by Tepco late last year made more than 837 yen an hour, while day labourers on regular construction sites in the same part of the country can earn up to 1,500 yen an hour. A worker in his 40s, who is employed by a a small Tepco subcontractor, told Reuters: \"I get stomach aches. I am constantly stressed. When I'm back in my room, all I can do is worry about the next day. They should give us a medal.\" At a more senior level, workers insisted that familiarity with the plant had quelled any initial fears over their proximity to dangerous levels of radiation. \"Radiation is something that has no colour, no smell,\" said Hiroshige Kobayashi, whose company is clearing debris from the most irradiated area of the plant. \"Just as with normal labouring work, you get used to your environment. That's the kind of psychological change that happens here, too.\" The clean-up operation, involving thousands of casual labourers, has been dogged by reports of shady employment practices and routine violations of health and safety regulations. This month, the health ministry revealed that at least 63 Fukushima Daiichi workers had been exposed to radiation levels higher than those registered in their personal records. Last summer, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that Tepco subcontractors had been doctoring readings on workers' personal radiation monitors by covering them with lead shields. By the end of last December, 146 Tepco workers and 21 contract workers had exceeded their maximum permissible exposure of 100 millisieverts over five years, the utility said. The annual allowable limit was raised to 250 millisieverts immediately after the disaster, but returned to 50 millisieverts nine months later. Senior staff at the plant dismissed suggestion that some of the 3,000 people who work at the plant every day had become blase about their health. \"I don't think [reports of health and safety lapses] happen because workers are exercising less care, but perhaps these things have happened because they have been doing the same jobs repeatedly over time, and are becoming accustomed to the working environment here,\" said Harufumi Uchida, a manager whose company is helping to construct a shield to stop radiation leaking into the sea. • This article was amended on 8 March 2013 to change average hourly earnings for labourers at Fukushima from 800 yen to 837 yen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
