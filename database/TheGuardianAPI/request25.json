The mammals rely on echo-location to hunt and navigate and researchers say noise from pile-driving work to install the turbines interferes with the animals' ability to find each other and their prey. Karsten Brensing, a biologist at the Whales and Dolphins Conservation Society said: \"These animals are so dependent on their acoustic sense … we need an acoustically clean environment. But a report by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation has suggested an ingenious solution. A \"bubble curtain\" could contain the disturbance. Using simple, low-cost technology, bubbles released from pipes on the seafloor would create a sound-insulating barrier. Germany is a leader in the field of wind-power technology and with the country's phase-out of nuclear power, incentives are being offered to encourage the expansion of offshore wind farms. A Greenpeace campaigner, Thilo Maack, believes that if \"bubble curtains\" can mitigate the impact on wildlife, they should be used. But he also said quieter construction methods such as drilling need to be investigated. \"We have to be sure that the wind parks don't harm harbour porpoises and other marine mammals,\" Maack said. \"On the other hand, we need these renewable energies to fight the consequences of climate change.\".\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/06/nasa-scientist-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-06T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"Nasa scientist: climate change is a moral issue on a par with slavery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/06/nasa-scientist-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/06/nasa-scientist-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Nasa scientist: climate change is a moral issue on a par with slavery","bodyText":"Averting the worst consequences of human-induced climate change is a \"great moral issue\" on a par with slavery, according to the leading Nasa climate scientist Prof Jim Hansen. He argues that storing up expensive and destructive consequences for society in future is an \"injustice of one generation to others\". Hansen, who will next Tuesday be awarded the prestigious Edinburgh Medal for his contribution to science, will also in his acceptance speech call for a worldwide tax on all carbon emissions. In his lecture, Hansen will argue that the challenge facing future generations from climate change is so urgent that a flat-rate global tax is needed to force immediate cuts in fossil fuel use. Ahead of receiving the award – which has previously been given to Sir David Attenborough, the ecologist James Lovelock, and the economist Amartya Sen – Hansen told the Guardian that the latest climate models had shown the planet was on the brink of an emergency. He said humanity faces repeated natural disasters from extreme weather events which would affect large areas of the planet. \"The situation we're creating for young people and future generations is that we're handing them a climate system which is potentially out of their control,\" he said. \"We're in an emergency: you can see what's on the horizon over the next few decades with the effects it will have on ecosystems, sea level and species extinction.\" Now 70, Hansen is regarded as one of the most influential figures in climate science; the creator of one of the first global climate models, his pioneering role in warning about global warming is frequently cited by climate campaigners such as former US vice president Al Gore and in earlier science prizes, including the $1m Dan David prize. He has been arrested more than once for his role in protests against coal energy. Hansen will argue in his lecture that current generations have an over-riding moral duty to their children and grandchildren to take immediate action. Describing this as an issue of inter-generational justice on a par with ending slavery, Hansen said: \"Our parents didn't know that they were causing a problem for future generations but we can only pretend we don't know because the science is now crystal clear. \"We understand the carbon cycle: the CO2 we put in the air will stay in surface reservoirs and won't go back into the solid earth for millennia. What the Earth's history tells us is that there's a limit on how much we can put in the air without guaranteeing disastrous consequences for future generations. We cannot pretend that we did not know.\" Hansen said his proposal for a global carbon tax was based on the latest analysis of CO2 levels in the atmosphere and their impact on global temperatures and weather patterns. He has co-authored a scientific paper with 17 other experts, including climate scientists, biologists and economists, which calls for an immediate 6% annual cut in CO2 emissions, and a substantial growth in global forest cover, to avoid catastrophic climate change by the end of the century. The paper, which has passed peer review and is in the final stages of publication by the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, argues that a global levy on fossil fuels is the strongest tool for forcing energy firms and consumers to switch quickly to zero carbon and green energy sources. In larger countries, that would include nuclear power. Under this proposal, the carbon levy would increase year on year, with the tax income paid directly back to the public as a dividend, shared equally, rather than put into government coffers. Because the tax would greatly increase the cost of fossil fuel energy, consumers relying on green or low carbon sources of power would benefit the most as this dividend would come on top of cheaper fuel bills. It would promote a dramatic increase in the investment and development of low-carbon energy sources and technologies. The very rich and most profligate energy users, people with several homes, or private jets and fuel-hungry cars, would also be forced into dramatically changing their energy use. In the new paper, Hansen, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and his colleagues warn that failing to cut CO2 emissions by 6% now will mean that by 2022, the annual cuts would need to reach a more drastic level of 15% a year. Had similar action been taken in 2005, when the Kyoto protocol on climate change came into force, the CO2 emission reductions would have been at a more manageable 3% a year. The target was to return CO2 levels in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million, down from its current level of 392ppm. The paper, the \"Scientific case for avoiding dangerous climate change to protect young people and nature\", also argues that the challenge is growing because of the accelerating rush to find new, harder–to-reach sources of oil, gas and coal in the deep ocean, the Arctic and from shale gas reserves. Hansen said current attempts to limit carbon emissions, particularly the European Union's emissions trading mechanism introduced under the Kyoto protocol which restricts how much CO2 an industry can emit before it has to pay a fee for higher emissions, were \"completely ineffectual\". Under the global carbon tax proposal, the mechanisms for controlling fossil fuel use would be taken out of the hands of individual states influenced by energy companies, and politicians anxious about winning elections. \"It can't be fixed by individual specific changes; it has to be an across-the-board rising fee on carbon emissions,\" said Hansen. \"We can't simply say that there's a climate problem, and leave it to the politicians. They're so clearly under the influence of the fossil fuel industry that they're coming up with cockamamie solutions which aren't solutions. That is the bottom line.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/feb/16/china-nuclear-thorium","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"China enters race to develop nuclear energy from thorium | Duncan Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/feb/16/china-nuclear-thorium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/feb/16/china-nuclear-thorium","fields":{"headline":"China enters race to develop nuclear energy from thorium","bodyText":"Imagine how the nuclear energy debate might differ if the fuel was abundant and distributed across the world; if there was no real possibility of creating weapons-grade material as part of the process; if the waste remained toxic for hundreds rather than thousands of years; and if the power stations were small and presented no risk of massive explosions. What you're imagining could fairly soon be reality judging from a little-noticed development in China last month. Two years ago, as part of the Manchester Report, a panel of experts assembled by the Guardian selected nuclear power based on thorium rather the uranium as one of the 10 most promising solutions to climate change. Thorium – which is found in large quantities across much of the world – could be used to create nuclear energy in various ways. But the approach that impressed the Manchester Report panel so much was a currently obscure technology called the liquid-fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR). I wrote at the time: \"This technology was developed by the US military in the 1950s and 1960s and was shown to have many benefits. For example, reactors of this type can be smaller than conventional uranium reactors, partly thanks to their low-pressure operation. Despite its early promise, research into liquid-fluoride thorium reactors was abandoned – the most likely reason being that the technology offered no potential for producing nuclear weapons.\" There's a big difference between a demonstrably good idea and a multimillion-dollar research and development programme, however, so it's exciting to hear about a major new push to actually develop LFTR technology in China. Thorium-energy expert Kirk Sorensen recently blogged about the announcement of the new scheme at the Chinese National Academy of Sciences in late January. Technology journalist Andrew Orlowski followed up with a story claiming that a private company in China is aiming to build a prototype within five years that can produce electricity at for as little as 6.8p per kilowatt hour (much cheaper than the retail price of power in the UK today). Despite not making a ripple in the wider press, there's a chance this development could be very significant. If the advocates of LFTRs are proved correct – and their arguments are certainly very compelling – then the Chinese could be taking one of the first substantial steps in a new type of nuclear race. And the stakes are high: as Sorensen reports, the project \"aims not only to develop the technology but to secure intellectual property rights to its implementation\". It will be very interesting to see what happens next."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jul/13/fukushima-skilled-veterans-corps-nuclear-offer","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-13T18:11:13Z","webTitle":"Fukushima pensioner army waits for call-up to frontline duties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/13/fukushima-skilled-veterans-corps-nuclear-offer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jul/13/fukushima-skilled-veterans-corps-nuclear-offer","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima pensioner army waits for call-up to frontline duties","bodyText":"So far, about 9,000 workers have been involved in the four-month operation to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, where three of six reactors experienced meltdown in the aftermath of the 11 March tsunami. If Yasuteru Yamada gets his way, the Fukushima workforce of the future will include a band of fearless pensioners calling themselves the skilled veterans corps. This month the retired engineer for Sumitomo Metal Industries, one of the world's top steel manufacturers, is expected to visit the plant with four colleagues to carry out preliminary inspections. They propose to help design a replacement for the destroyed reactor cooling system. The 72-year-old graduate of Tokyo University will survey the damage and, pending final approval from the government and Tepco, the plant operator, call on hundreds of registered volunteers, all over 60, with expertise in a range of disciplines. In April, he and two former colleagues reached out to 2,500 potential volunteers by phone and email. Before long their plea had been repeated on Twitter and via blogs, and for days Yamada's phone did not stop ringing. As of last week, 430 people had volunteered, according to the group's website. Their average age is in the late 60s. The oldest is 82. The government and Tepco have welcomed the plan with caution – they have yet to approve the hiring of hundreds of eager pensioners while conditions at the plant remain hazardous. Goshi Hosono, a special adviser to the prime minister, initially likened Yamada's offer to a \"suicide mission\" and suggested his and his corps's services would not be required. But Hosono has since made more enthusiastic noises. \"People who are willing to sacrifice their daily lives to help the nation resolve these problems are invaluable,\" he told reporters. \"First we will have to check on their health status, as people at an advanced age working in that kind of environment could fall ill.\" Yamada, who helped build power plants as a Sumitomo Metal employee, insists that the skilled veterans corps should be allowed to replace younger plant workers who, over time, are more susceptible to developing cancer. Unlike the young engineers currently exposing themselves to high levels of radiation at Fukushima Daiichi, Yamada, a cancer survivor, reckons he has, at best, about 15 years left to live. \"Even if I were exposed to radiation, cancer could take 20 or 30 years or longer to develop,\" he told the BBC. \"That means us older ones have less chance of getting cancer.\" Having benefited from the limitless supply of power nuclear gave resource-poor Japan in the postwar years, Yamada believes his generation now has a moral duty to it help stabilise the stricken plant. \"In particular, those of us who hailed the slogan that 'Nuclear Power is Safe' should be the first to join,\" the corps says on its website. \"This is our duty to the next generation and the one thereafter.\" Yamada shuns inevitable comparisons with the kamikaze, the specialist pilots who flew suicide missions for imperial Japan during the second world war. His team, Yamada said, would only enter the plant with guarantees of limited exposure to radiation, and with the support of the country's nuclear authorities. \"The kamikaze were something strange, no risk management there,\" he said. \"They were going to die. But we are going to come back.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/mar/21/oil-price-jumps-libya-attacks-japanese-demand","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-21T17:41:00Z","webTitle":"Falklands oil bonanza hopes revived while price climbs again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/21/oil-price-jumps-libya-attacks-japanese-demand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/mar/21/oil-price-jumps-libya-attacks-japanese-demand","fields":{"headline":"Falklands oil bonanza hopes revived while price climbs again","bodyText":"Hopes of an oil bonanza in the Falkland Islands have been revived after a positive update from Rockhopper Exploration, one of the many UK companies drilling in the area. The news came as the price of crude continued to rise thanks to the military action in Libya and strong demand for hydrocarbons from Japan. Results from the Falklands – whose ownership is still disputed by Argentina – have been mixed, the most notable recent setback being Desire Petroleum's decision in January to abandon a key well after failing to find oil. But on Monday Rockhopper said an appraisal well at its Sea Lion discovery area had discovered enough evidence of oil to suggest it was commercially viable. The rig involved in the testing, the Ocean Guardian, will now move to drill Desire's Ninky prospect, where Rockhopper has a 7.5% interest, before coming back to Sea Lion for more appraisal wells. The news sent Rockhopper's shares soaring 70.75p to 287.75p, a 33% increase, while other explorers in the area also benefited. Desire climbed 3.25p to 40p, Argos Resources added 1.75p to 34.75p and Falkland Oil &amp; Gas rose 0.5p to 80p. Charlie Sharp, an analyst at Matrix, said: \"This was a crunch well for Rockhopper; failure would have raised enormous questions about the viability of the Sea Lion discovery. But the result appears to have matched or beaten expectations, raising the likelihood of a commercial development. There are still significant obstacles related to the scale of project, the need for a partner (greater reserves and preferably another field would be helpful), infrastructure and political issues. However, [now] the story looks back on track.\" Meanwhile Brent crude climbed nearly $1.50 to $115.50 a barrel by the time London's equity market closed, following the Operation Odyssey Dawn attacks in Libya. Analysts predicted that the strikes against Colonel Gaddafi could push oil above its recent highs, with Brent tipped to break through $120 a barrel. \"The sell-off in the oil price on Friday afternoon proved to be short-lived with the events in the Middle East over the weekend lifting oil back to its recent highs,\" said Jane Foley, senior strategist at Rabobank. The oil price has been unsettled in recent weeks. Brent broke through $100 a barrel in early February as the Egyptian uprising took hold. The Libyan conflict has added to the pressure, with the International Energy Agency predicting that the country's oil output will be severely curtailed for some time. Libya is one of the largest oil producers in the region, but production had already almost stopped. Military operations in the region could also hamper supplies from other countries. But some analysts are confident that Saudi Arabia can increase production to compensate. Mike Wittner, head of commodities research at Société Générale, said oil traders were trying to calculate how long Libyan production could be offline. \"We could end up by having two countries or a protracted civil war,\" he said. With Japan's nuclear power industry disrupted by the earthquake and tsunami, the country is now buying more oil to cover its energy gap. Reuters reported that Japan has bought all the available stock of some types of crude oil in the Asian markets, which is expected to push prices higher. In the UK, the high oil price has led to record petrol prices. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to scrap scheduled increases in fuel duties in the budget, and also freeze air passenger duty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/jul/10/energy-market-reform-fuel-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-10T16:41:53Z","webTitle":"Energy market reform expected to lead to higher household fuel bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/10/energy-market-reform-fuel-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/jul/10/energy-market-reform-fuel-bills","fields":{"headline":"Energy market reform expected to lead to higher household fuel bills","bodyText":"The government will reignite the row over soaring energy bills on Tuesday when it unveils a long-awaited electricity market reform package that will boost nuclear power but hit householders with another major increase in costs. Ministers insist the planned shake-up will move the UK away from fossil fuels and the kind of market instability that led to the announcement last Friday of an increase of up to 18% in some British Gas bills. Ofgem, the industry regulator, has previously estimated that the average household bill could rise by £500 annually by 2030, while Cambridge academics have claimed that Britain's energy costs could become the highest in Europe. Chris Huhne, the energy and climate change secretary, on Sunday called the prediction \"absolute nonsense\", saying that it was based on \"rubbish\" calculations, which did not take into account the eventual savings that different energy sources would bring. \"The reality is that we have some of the lowest energy prices [in Europe] and we can get them even lower,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. But campaigners against fuel poverty – defined as when more than 10% of household income is spent on heating – have already warned that the number of households facing such a situation in Britain could soon rise from 5.5m to more than 6m in the wake of the latest price rises. They also claim that government plans will make the problem worse. National Energy Action said: \"The energy market reform document ... is likely to indicate that further increases in energy prices are on the horizon to fund additional measures proposed by government.\" The government's white paper will propose providing a fixed price above the market value for electricity generated from nuclear power and windfarms, via a floor on the carbon price from 2013. There will also be further details on a carbon emissions performance standard, a hedging mechanism called \"contracts for difference\" and a \"capacity mechanism\" for ensuring utilities can be rewarded for keeping excess power on standby for when the wind does not blow. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is struggling to reconcile industry differences on some of these measures and there are fears that the process may be less advanced than many would want. Tim Yeo, chairman of the energy select committee, told the Guardian that decisions were \"urgently needed\" but said that he feared there would be a lack of concrete initiatives. \"The danger is that we are given more of a green [consultative] paper than a white paper and that would just promote uncertainty and leave us longer dependent on volatile gas imports,\" he said. But the DECC said it was doing all it could to increase the UK's energy security while reducing CO2 emissions. \"The measures included in the EMR are cheaper than the cost of doing nothing, not replacing power stations and infrastructure. We believe annual household bills could increase by £200 by 2030, or even £160,\" said a DECC spokesman. British Gas caused a storm on Friday by raising its electricity bills by an average of 18% and gas bills by 16% but other utilities are expected to follow suit as wholesale energy costs continue to soar. • This article was amended on 11 July 2011. In the original, the final paragraph gave British Gas's recent rises in electricity and gas bills as averaging £18 and and £16 respectively. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2012/mar/14/energy-bills-why-gas-electricity-prices-fluctuate","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-14T11:19:23Z","webTitle":"Energy bills: why gas and electricity prices fluctuate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/14/energy-bills-why-gas-electricity-prices-fluctuate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2012/mar/14/energy-bills-why-gas-electricity-prices-fluctuate","fields":{"headline":"Energy bills: why gas and electricity prices fluctuate","bodyText":"The boss of British Gas predicts energy prices will rise for 10 years – terrible news given that the proportion of people calling debt counsellor National Debtline who are suffering \"energy debt\" has risen from 2.7% in 2004 to 13.7% in 2011. British Gas faced calls to cut the price of energy after reporting annual pre-tax profits of £2.4bn in February. However, much of this profit was generated by the oil and exploration business, which has offset a slump in earnings in the domestic retail business, despite prices for electricity going up by 18% and gas 26% since December 2010. So how does the market for energy actually work, and why are prices so high? Where and how do energy companies buy gas? Gas and electricity are bought on the wholesale market from electricity generators, gas producers and importers. Some is bought on a short-term basis, to meet extra demand if there is a cold snap, but a large proportion is bought a long way in advance of when it will be used. Longer-term gas and electricity purchases are made over different timescales and at different prices, ensuring there is always energy when customers flick a switch and helping to smooth out price fluctuations. This is called hedging. However, it can sometimes backfire on suppliers. Christine McGourty, chief executive at the energy companies' trade association Energy UK, says the UK's energy suppliers bought lots of gas during the prolonged cold snap in the winter of 2010/11, only to be left with much of it unused. They sold it back into the wholesale market later in the year, causing gas prices to fall. To complicate matters further, the \"big six\" suppliers in this country are also energy producers, so buy and sell at the same time. What factors affect wholesale prices? Since 2004 Britain has used more gas than it has produced, meaning gas prices are increasingly influenced by world events that affect availability. A war or natural disaster in a country that produces gas or oil is likely to reduce production and accessibility, pushing prices up. In 2011, the conflict in Libya saw oil prices jump to a two-and-a-half-year high, while the earthquake in Japan disrupted nuclear power generation, meaning Japan bought more liquefied natural gas, putting it in direct competition with British buyers. According to the regulator Ofgem, in winter Britain relies on gas supplied through pipes from Belgium and Norway. To buy this gas we have to pay at least as much as customers in mainland Europe, where prices are linked to high oil prices. As a large proportion of electricity is generated by burning gas, this has a knock-on effect on electricity prices. What other things affect the cost of energy? Prices are also affected by market reforms proposed by Ofgem, and tax charges imposed by the government. The networks which transport energy from the producers to the regional distribution networks, and then to your home, comprise about 20% of your bill, but the ageing infrastructure needs replacing. The government also has to meet carbon reduction targets and spend money on energy efficiency programmes. Ofgem reckons all this will cost about £30bn over the next 10 years. I've read that wholesale gas prices are down. Why aren't my bills falling too? All of the big six suppliers have cut prices in the past few months, but are still under pressure to reduce costs further. Energy companies do not always pass on wholesale cost increases immediately and, likewise, falling wholesale prices may not immediately result in bill reductions. It may seem hard to believe, but compared with consumers in other European countries Britain's domestic energy prices are relatively low: London comes 12th out of 15 capitals for electricity, with only Helsinki, Paris and Athens enjoying cheaper energy; for gas, London is the cheapest place in Europe to be, according to research by E-Control and VaasaETT. So if my supplier won't cut the price, how can I reduce my bills? Check if there is a cheaper deal you can switch to. You can contact your provider to see if it can offer some assistance or switch you to a social tariff; alternatively you could switch provider. Which? says UK consumers are over-paying energy suppliers by £4bn a year and have missed out on £16bn in the past four years by not switching tariffs. Its Big Switch campaign is encouraging people to sign up by 31 March and become part of a collective bargaining group that will be able to negotiate big savings from the UK's major energy firms. Alternatively, the PeoplesPower concept aims to use consumers' collective bargaining power to set up reverse auctions with energy companies, buying at the lowest rate possible for customers. As a not-for-profit community it charges a £2 handling fee to pass on more savings to customers. If you can't wait to make savings, check out deals through the Guardian's switching service. The next thing to do is reduce energy consumption in your home. All the energy and water companies offer information on their websites about saving energy and money, and most offer free gadgets or discounts to help you do so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/27/japan-nuclear-fukushima-radiation-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-27T09:42:44Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear workers evacuated after radiation levels soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/27/japan-nuclear-fukushima-radiation-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/27/japan-nuclear-fukushima-radiation-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear workers evacuated after radiation levels soar","bodyText":"Radioactivity levels in one part of the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant are 10m times higher than normal, Japanese officials have said, amid warnings that the operation to avert disaster at the facility could last for months.. Tests on the surface of a pool of water that has formed in the No 2 reactor revealed radioactivity of 1,000 millisieverts (mSv) per hour – four times the level deemed safe by the government. The worker carrying out the test reportedly fled before taking a second reading. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency (Nisa), said: \"This is quite a high figure.\" The water was \"likely to be coming from the reactor\", he said. The discovery prompted another evacuation of workers at the site, halting work to pump and store radioactive water that has built up in the turbine buildings of three of the plant's six reactors. Evidence of dangerous contamination in the No 2 reactor emerged after three workers were exposed to high levels of radioactivity while repairing the cooling system at the No 3 reactor. Two of the men received suspected beta ray burns after stepping into water with radiation levels 10,000 times higher than normal. Reports said the workers were due to be discharged from hospital on Monday. Modest progress was made over the weekend to remove contaminated water and step up work to cool the reactors with fresh water, rather than corrosive seawater. But Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned that Japan's nuclear emergency could go on for weeks, and possibly months. \"This is a very serious accident by all standards,\" he told the New York Times. \"And it is not yet over.\" With just one pump currently being used to extract radioactive water, two more will be taken to the site. The US military is sending barges loaded with 500,000 gallons of fresh water to nearby Onahama Bay. Two of the plant's six reactors are considered safe, having achieved \"cool shutdown\", but the remaining four have yet to be brought under control. Nisa said temperature and pressure inside all six reactors had stabilised. The unusually high levels of radioactivity in the puddles \"almost certainly\" indicated that water had seeped from a reactor core, said Yukio Edano, the chief government spokesman. Edano denied the situation was deteriorating, but conceded that the myriad problems facing the power plant workers were no closer to being resolved. \"We are preventing the situation from worsening,\" he said. \"We have restored power and pumped in fresh water, and we are making basic steps towards improvement. But there is still no room for complacency.\" The deterioration in the state of the reactors is the latest in a string of complications to have hit the Fukushima operation since the plant was seriously damaged by the earthquake and tsunami along Japan's north-east coast on 11 March. The nuclear crisis has raised fears about the safety of food in the area, while Tokyo, 150 miles to the south, experienced a brief rise in radioactivity in tap water that prompted a one-day ban on consumption by infants. Bans have been imposed on the shipment of milk and leafy vegetables from the Fukushima region, and several countries have introduced restrictions on Japanese food imports. Last week, the US became the first country to ban the import of milk and some vegetables from contaminated areas. Growing concern over food safety spread to the fishing industry over the weekend, when officials said seawater samples taken 20 miles off the coast of the Fukushima plant contained 1,850 times the normal level of radioactivity. Nisa said the tainted seawater posed no risk to health. \"Ocean currents will disperse radiation particles and so it will be very diluted by the time it is consumed by fish and seaweed, and even more by the time they are consumed by humans,\" Nishiyama said. \"There is no need to worry about health risks,\" Officials said on Friday they suspected one or more of the reactors had been damaged, leading to water leakages and raising the possibility of large amounts of radiation finding their way into the environment. The plant's owner and operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has yet to determine the source of the leak. A Nisa spokesman said the length of time workers spend inside units was being closely monitored. \"It is definitely a severe environment, but the amount of time workers are allowed in there is strictly controlled so that their exposure does not exceed the limit,\" Minoru Ogoda said. Most of the radioactivity found in the No 2 reactor came from iodine-134., which has a half-life of 53 minutes, meaning it dissipates quickly. The government urged the Tepco to be more transparent after it emerged that the firm knew radiation levels had risen dramatically days before the workers were injured. \"Regardless of whether there was an awareness of high radioactivity in the stagnant water, there were problems in the way work was conducted,\" Nishiyama said. The men were exposed to radiation of between 173 and 180 mSv, lower than the upper limit of 250 mSv per year introduced by the health ministry soon after the disaster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/oct/07/fukushima-power-plant-worker-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-07T08:06:40Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: third worker death 'not related to radiation'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/fukushima-power-plant-worker-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/oct/07/fukushima-power-plant-worker-dies","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima: third worker death 'not related to radiation'","bodyText":"A man in his 50s is the third worker at the Fukushima nuclear power plant to die since it was crippled by the 11 March tsunami. Nuclear officials said his death was unlikely to have been caused by exposure to radiation. The man, whose name has been withheld, was rushed to hospital on Wednesday after falling ill during a morning meeting at the plant, where three of six reactors melted down after they were hit by waves of up to 14 metres (46ft) high. He died early on Thursday morning in hospital, the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said, adding that the cause of death was being investigated. The death is the third among the Fukushima Daiichi workforce since May, when a man in his 60s had a fatal heart attack. In August a labourer died from acute leukaemia. Tepco said radiation was not a factor in either death. The most recent victim had been working at the plant for 46 days installing a tank that will be used to process contaminated water pumped from damaged reactor buildings. Reports said he had worked three hours a day and had been exposed to a total of 2.02 millisieverts [mSv] of radiation, well below the 100mSv per year level at which, experts say, the risk of cancer increases. Over the past six months, thousands of \"nuclear gypsies\"– many of them poorly paid, inexperienced labourers hired by Tepco sub-contractors – have taken part in the hazardous job of repairing and clearing the plant. The enormity of the wider cleanup operation was underlined this week after high levels of radiation were found in soil in Fukushima city, located about 37 miles (60km) away. Calls to evacuate pregnant women and young children from areas beyond the 12-mile radius around the plant increased after a study showed 307,000 becquerels of caesium per kilogram of soil had been found in the city, well above the government-set legal limit of 10,000 becquerels per kg. The discovery came days after the government said it would lift an advisory warning residents in five areas within 12-18 miles of the plant to evacuate should the situation worsen. Those areas include parts of the city of Minamisoma, where thousands of residents who fled in the days after the accident have yet to return."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/andrewbrown/2011/mar/15/religion-japan-earthquake-and-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T10:28:00Z","webTitle":"Faith, evidence, and tsunamis | Andrew Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2011/mar/15/religion-japan-earthquake-and-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2011/mar/15/religion-japan-earthquake-and-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Faith, evidence and tsunamis","bodyText":"Do you know anyone who has actually changed their minds about nuclear power as a result of the catastrophe in Japan? One of the most interesting aspects of this crisis -- viewed from a very great, very safe distance -- has been that it has served to prove to all the onlookers how very right they are. I was in favour of nuclear power beforehand. I am still more in favour now. If the power stations can withstand an earthquake five times larger than anyone thought was possible, and all of the multiple failures since then, I conclude that this technology is safer than the alternatives. At the same time, everyone I know who was doubtful about nuclear power is now feeling entirely vindicated and will use this story to argue that it is far too dangerous to trust our future to here. All of us, of course, are jumping to conclusions. At the moment it is simply impossible to know what is going on and the prospect of future earthquakes means that even if we did know the present state of the reactors it would be foolish to bet on its stability. Foolish, but necessary. We must act, after all, one way or another. And even when we cannot act, we feel bound to form an opinion. Our minds could hardly be otherwise, since intelligence evolved as a way of taking decisions. I think this also explains the quite extraordinary focus of the coverage on a nuclear catastrophe which may very well not happen, and which has not, so far as we know, killed anyone at all as opposed to the quake and the tsunami which have killed tens of thousands and rendered hundreds of thousands homeless. That couldn't happen here. For people in Europe (except, perhaps, the Dutch) a tsunami is a foreign catastrophe. It doesn't factor in to any of the decisions we might have to make here. So it blurs in our minds. It's very horrible; and that's about all we can think. But though there may be reasons for our failures of rationality, and of sympathy, that doesn't make them correct. The tendency to cling on to our beliefs, and even to strengthen them, in the face of disconfirming evidence is often a real and dangerous problem. After all, one side or the other has to be right about nuclear power, and people on both sides are confirmed in their beliefs by almost anything. Nor could we abolish it by getting rid of religious belief."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/02/environment-2017-pollution-division-exclusion","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-02T19:55:18Z","webTitle":"The environment in 2017: a polluted wasteland hit by floods and droughts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/02/environment-2017-pollution-division-exclusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/02/environment-2017-pollution-division-exclusion","fields":{"headline":"The environment in 2017: a polluted wasteland hit by floods and droughts","bodyText":"In 2017, the snarled-up roads of just six years earlier are a fading memory for many. A huge road and bridge building programme has left the nation with hundreds of miles of fresh tarmac, but the free passage motorists enjoy owes more to record petrol prices and falling incomes keeping people off the roads. Air pollution eases on the motorways, but the stubborn hotspots in cities remain in flagrant breach of European law. The latest austerity measures have slashed funding for clean-up projects, despite the costs to health and the certainty of heavy fines for the UK. Air pollution also crops up as the latest obstacle to the planned \"Boris island\" airport in the Thames estuary, where weak demand for holiday flights has also undercut the economic rationale. Further up the Thames, the giant flood barrier has seen an unprecedented level of use as climate change causes increasingly heavy winter storms. In the north, central Leeds still remains all but abandoned after the overwhelming of the flood defences, whose upgrade was cancelled for cost reasons. Those made homeless are housed in some of the estates built outside the city after planning rules had been radically relaxed but across the country many remain vacant as would-be buyers find mortgages impossible to get. A flashpoint is the Norfolk Broads, where the relaxing of rules protecting wildlife and places of natural beauty permits new building, to the horror of environmentalists. Another rural battle is fought in the west country, where the culling of badgers to control bovine TB is halted after an activist is shot. Global warming has had a different effect in the south-east, where the drought conditions persist for the second year running, forcing compulsory metering and sharp rises in water bills. The same effect drives up food prices, as supermarkets are forced to stock more expensive alternatives to the fruit and vegetables no longer coming from the parched Mediterranean nations. British farmers try to fill the gap, but plummeting subsidies from the debt-stricken European Union means prices still rise. Adding to the challenge of balancing household budgets are record energy prices. With the government having failed to convince investors to fund nuclear power - plans for new stations are now abandoned - or the vast offshore wind farms hoped for, there is a new dash for gas. But with the international gas supply dominated by Russia and its new Arctic finds, costs soar. The development of the UK's shale gas fields remains uncertain, as geological problems are compounded by persistent protests that stop drilling. Protest have also blocked onshore windfarms in Wales, which is struggling to meet its carbon targets. One bright spot is Birmingham, where a huge energy-efficiency programme, has transformed the city's homes, cutting bills and making it almost the only part of the nation where property prices have remained stable. Thanks to the dash for gas, and the failure to get carbon capture and storage technology off the ground, the UK's carbon emissions are rising. With the International Energy Agency declaring that the world has now built all the fossil-fuel-burning infrastructure it can without tipping into runaway global warming, a newly-emerged \"clean bloc\", led by Germany and Japan, threatens imminent carbon penalties on imports from \"dirty\" nations.

It was encouraging to hear you acknowledge that the main cause of recent energy bill hikes has been rising gas prices – not green policies, as many in your party and your government seem intent on claiming. Indeed, since you were elected as prime minister, a yawning gulf has emerged in the government over key energy and climate change policies and, as you will know, there is widespread concern that this is proving disastrous both for our economy and our environment. I share these concerns. Since the CEM was a high-level ministerial event, attended by energy ministers from 23 different countries, I would have expected the prime minister of what aspires to be the \"greenest government ever\" to make far more of this opportunity. It was an ideal chance to show real ambition for our trailblazing renewables sector and champion the potential for building a resilient economy through investment in tackling climate change, as well as addressing fuel poverty. Instead your remarks were short on real content and commitment. They revealed poor leadership, poor understanding of the risks of climate change and a poor grasp of the opportunities afforded by renewables and energy efficiency. You have confirmed that your government believes the UK should remain addicted to gas and fossil fuels. Given the huge potential of our national renewables and energy efficiency sectors to provide secure and home grown clean energy for the future, and in particular our potential to become a world leader in marine renewables, this lack of vision is bad for the economy and bad for consumers. I agree that renewables need to become financially sustainable. That is the purpose of providing public subsidies to new industries. But it is disingenuous to demand that renewables suddenly become financially sustainable at the same time as your government is indirectly subsidising the dirty fossil fuel industry to a tune of six times more than renewables. Your weak position on our long term energy mix is ill-informed, will be costly to householders in future, and won't put our country on track to exploit the employment opportunities of a truly thriving renewables industry. Nor does your position recognise the need to cut carbon emissions in line with the science. The Climate Change Act commits the UK to cutting carbon emissions reductions by 80% by 2050, but these are the wrong targets. They only give us a 50-50 chance of keeping climate change to below 2C. Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the International Energy Agency, warns that \"under current policies we estimate energy use and CO2 emissions will increase by a third by 2020, and almost double by 2050. This would probably send global temperatures at least 6C higher within this century.\" Achieving a more secure, sustainable energy system, in line with the goal of limiting the rise in global temperatures to under 2C, is still possible but requires urgent action by the world's governments. And it requires honesty with the public about the risks of inaction to the economy, for example, to health, agriculture, food production, water resources, coastal flooding, and extreme weather events. As prime minister, you can begin to make a real difference if you attend the Earth summit in Rio in June. Governments are currently failing to avert the prospect of catastrophic climate change, so the UK has an opportunity to lead by example on the world stage, starting by giving its backing to an EU target of at least 30% greenhouse gas reductions by 2020. The scale and urgency of the threat of climate change demands national and international leadership of extraordinary boldness. It's time for you, who rebranded the Conservative party on the environment, to step up. Yet we clearly need some better policies than those you are offering at the moment. Your government's nuclear policy is tatters – you pledged not to spend public money on subsidising new nuclear, yet it's clear that it cannot be built without state aid. The huge costs and liabilities involved in nuclear make it completely uneconomical, and it certainly won't deliver energy security or emission reductions in the timescales required. Meanwhile, carbon capture and storage remains little more than a pipe dream, and the era of cheap fossil fuels is over. So here are five measures that would help, and should have been in your speech: • Instead of saying yes to shale gas exploration, the government must declare a ban on all fracking. Serious questions remain over the impacts on groundwater pollution, health, air pollution, whilst the evidence indicates that the exploitation of shale gas is incompatible with tackling climate change. Moreover, since shale gas extraction will also divert investment away from renewables, the UK's potential reserves must be left in the ground. • A commitment that electricity market reform (EMR) legislation will be designed specifically to enable the development of various renewable energy technologies, rather than being written by and for the nuclear industry. Nuclear power has no place in a green energy future. • We need a road map to demonstrate how the UK's electricity sector will be virtually zero carbon by 2030, as recommended by the UK's own independent advisers on the Committee on Climate Change, and required to meet existing climate targets. • An end to subsidies to fossil fuels, and for the UK to show leadership on this internationally. The UK and other G20 leaders committed to this in 2009 and have done little since. The UK fossil fuel subsidy is estimated at £3.63bn in 2010, mostly in the form of VAT breaks and considerably more than the £1.4bn subsidy for renewable energy in the same year. • Reducing energy demand should be made a priority, both in the proposals for EMR and elsewhere across government policy making. Energy efficiency is the best way of keeping bills down, addressing fuel poverty and reducing the need for new energy supply of any kind, yet your speech yesterday was silent on the subject These polices don't just make economic and environmental sense, they have public support too. A recent poll by YouGov revealed that 64% of people want their electricity 10 years from now to be sourced from renewable energy, while just 2% want more gas. The climate crisis is real – so too is the economic one. That's why I am urging you to use the Queen's speech to announce legislative proposals that will help us overcome both, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, eliminating fuel poverty and reducing climate emissions – and sending a clear message to your party, to detractors in your government and to other leaders internationally. I look forward to your response.

It is the most perfect specimen of a compass jellyfish I've ever seen. Slightly domed and perhaps the size of a large side-plate, the creature is so pale a cream as to be transparent, the sand on which it is resting clearly visible beneath. Unlike that wickedly pretty and fantastical false jellyfish the portuguese man o' war, this is a creature whose good looks are based on restraint in both form and colour. From a dark spot at its centre, a series of V-shaped red-brown lines radiate outward and it is these, with their fancied resemblance to the compass rose, which gives the jellyfish its name. Sometimes the base of the V is filled with colour but on this individual the markings are simple, consisting of the lines alone. The perimeter of the stranded bell is fringed with scalloped lobes tipped with the same rich brown and, emerging from beneath the seaward side of its perfectly circular form, four long frilled feeding tentacles stream like a comet's tail. There is something about these bowl-shaped creatures that never fails to remind me of Lucie Rie's ceramics. But there is another side to this attractive creature: the tentacles can deliver a painful sting, and one this large is not something I'd necessarily want to encounter while swimming. This summer there are a lot more jellyfish to encounter than usual, with the Marine Conservation Society recording not only increased numbers, but also sightings of various species earlier in the year than normal. Some idea of the numbers involved are indicated by the incident of Monty Python-like improbability earlier this year when Torness nuclear power station was temporarily closed after the cooling water intake screens were blocked by a huge influx of moon jellyfish."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/24/fukushima-nuclear-plant-selfish-gene","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-24T14:29:41Z","webTitle":"The very human heroes of Fukushima | Johnjoe McFadden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/24/fukushima-nuclear-plant-selfish-gene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/24/fukushima-nuclear-plant-selfish-gene","fields":{"headline":"The very human heroes of Fukushima","bodyText":"Like all disasters, the Japanese earthquake and tsunami brings forth its toll of both tragedy and heroism. Among the latter is the daily trek of 180 workers to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, who continue to work 50-hour shifts in their efforts to cool the wrecked reactors. The men are voluntarily exposing themselves to extreme levels of radiation knowing that it is likely to seriously damage their health. But why? Why don't they run away? A recent study by a group of US researchers provides new clues to the origin of human kindness. Altruism – helping others at our own expense – puzzled Charles Darwin, whose theory predicted that individuals should act selfishly to serve their own interests. Why should wolves share their kill, or sparrows draw attention to themselves by issuing a warning call when they spot a hawk? The problem was solved, to the satisfaction of at least most sociobiologists, in the 1970s with kin selection theory. Robert Trivers, EO Wilson, Richard Dawkins and others pointed out that most of our genes are also in the bodies of our close relatives. Being kind to our relatives makes biological sense so long as it boosts the chances of our selfish genes, carried in our relatives' bodies, making it through to the next generation. The theory fitted well with observations of altruism in animals whose kindness was mostly restricted towards kin. The notion that kindness was, deep down, a form of (genetic) selfishness appealed to many of the entrepreneurs who drove the economic powerhouses of the late 20th century. The former Enron boss, Jeffrey Skilling, claimed that he was inspired by Dawkins's book, The Selfish Gene, to implement his infamous \"rank and yank\" system that either rewarded or fired employees on the basis of their perceived rank order in the company. But although kin selection works well in the animal kingdom it seems an unlikely mechanism to account for human altruism and co-operation. A Japanese nuclear plant worker who wanted to benefit his genes would serve them better by buying train tickets to take himself and all his relatives far from Fukushima. Sociobiologists usually argue that such unselfish human acts are misdirected kin selection. It was reckoned that our earliest ancestors lived in tightly knit groups where everyone was closely related. An indiscriminate form of altruism that benefited all your neighbours was all that was needed to ensure the survival of selfish genes. That same indiscriminate altruism leads to misdirected acts of kindness towards strangers today. But a key component of the theory is that early human groups were closely related. A recent study published in the journal Science undermines this claim. The research, led by Kim Hill and colleagues at Arizona State University, examined social structures of surviving hunter-gatherer groups from around the globe. In diverse peoples from the Inuits in Labrador to the Ache in Paraguay or the Wanindiljaugwa in Australia, they discovered the same collection of uniquely human characteristics, including a predominance of monogamous pair-bonding and a tendency for both male and female children to leave home. This pattern of dispersal ensures that most individuals in modern hunter-gatherer groups are unrelated. They are friends, rather than family. Of course we don't know if our ancient ancestors lived in the same way as contemporary hunter-gatherers. But the predominance of this pattern amongst so many diverse groups suggests that it is ancestral and possibly key to what makes us human. The researchers argue that this more dispersed pattern of human relationships allowed early humans to make loose though extensive alliances with friends and neighbours in nearby groups. A key component of these alliances was likely to be the emergence of kindness towards strangers, not through genes, but a product of culture. Rather than a misdirected selfishness, the heroism displayed by Japanese nuclear plant workers may be our most ancient and valuable human asset."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/22/nuclear-inspectors-safety-breaches","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-22T11:07:28Z","webTitle":"Safety breaches reported at UK nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/22/nuclear-inspectors-safety-breaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/22/nuclear-inspectors-safety-breaches","fields":{"headline":"Safety breaches reported at UK nuclear reactors","bodyText":"EDF Energy, the company that runs Britain's nuclear power stations, has been reprimanded by government inspectors after a series of safety blunders at reactors in Scotland. Two reactors at Torness in East Lothian have suffered failures in electricity supplies, several \"unplanned shutdowns\", and a seaweed blockage. It was the loss of power caused by the earthquake and tsunami that triggered the still unfolding nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan. The revelations have reignited concerns about the safety of Britain's nuclear stations. French-owned EDF Energy admitted that it had not followed the correct procedures, but insisted that there had been no danger to the public. A report posted online by the UK government's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) discloses that there were two significant safety \"events\" at Torness in September last year. \"Correct operational procedures appear not have been observed,\" says the report. In one incident, an equipment malfunction cut off the electricity supplied to a gas circulator. Gas circulators are critical components because they ensure that air is kept moving to cool reactor fuel and prevent it from overheating. The second incident also involved problems with electricity supply, though this time to a radioactive fuel dismantling facility at Torness. According to EDF Energy, the two events were \"entirely unconnected\". The NII report says: \"The events included contributions from operators not complying in full with the instructions provided to ensure safe limits and conditions are observed during plant operations.\" Nuclear inspectors have written to EDF Energy requiring more information about the incidents, and have received a response. The NII is satisfied there is \"no immediate safety issue\" but has left open the possibility of taking enforcement action in the future. The report, which covers the final three months of 2010, also reveals that one Torness reactor had \"several unplanned shutdowns, requiring action to correct adverse conditions which affected operation of the reactor\". This happened after the reactor had restarted after a planned maintenance shutdown. In addition, the second reactor at Torness had to be manually shut down because the screens that take in seawater for cooling were blocked by a large mass of seaweed. Inspectors identified \"a number of areas where further enhancement may be possible\" in the safety arrangements for dealing with seaweed. \"These are all events that should ring very loud alarm bells,\" said Pete Roche, an Edinburgh-based nuclear consultant and editor of the no2nuclearpower.org.uk website. \"As we've seen with Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and now Fukushima, a combination of unexpected events all happening at once can quickly lead to a serious accident because of the highly dangerous nature of the fuel used to power these reactors.\" The Scottish Nationalist MSP, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said: \"EDF Energy must confirm that these issues have been resolved and that they have every measure in place to make sure there are no further problems at the plant.\" She added: \"The SNP's opposition to nuclear power has been long held and while there are nuclear power stations operating in Scotland we must take every possible step to ensure their safety.\" EDF Energy, which owns British Energy, operates eight nuclear power stations across Britain. It is also the lead company bidding to build a new programme of nuclear power stations in England. The director of Torness, Paul Winkle, argued that the company had a good safety record and welcomed input by the NII. The problems with electricity supplies to the gas circulators occurred because \"one piece of a group of equipment failed\", he said. \"While power to one gas circulator was removed, others operated as normal, as they are designed to do, and there was, therefore, no possibility of losing cooling.\" The issue with power supplies to the radioactive fuel dismantling facility was reported to the NII because \"we hadn't followed procedure exactly as we should\", he added. According to Winkle, the seaweed blockage had been predicted by \"sophisticated monitoring systems\". None of the incidents had caused any danger to staff, plant or the public, he insisted. • This article was changed on 23 March - \"the last three months of 2010\" now reads \"in September last year\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/12/japan-tsunami-nuclear-meltdown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-12T07:11:00Z","webTitle":"Japan battles to stave off possible nuclear meltdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/12/japan-tsunami-nuclear-meltdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/12/japan-tsunami-nuclear-meltdown","fields":{"headline":"Japan battles to stave off possible nuclear meltdown","bodyText":"Workers are battling to stave off a possible nuclear meltdown at a plant in north-eastern Japan as the country struggles with the aftermath of Friday's enormous earthquake and tsunami. Japanese media said officials had detected caesium, one of the elements released when overheating causes core damage, around the reactor at Fukushima No 1 plant in Futuba, 150 miles (240km) north of Tokyo. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said it did not believe a meltdown was under way, but Ryohei Shiomi, an official with Japan's nuclear safety commission, said that it was possible. Experts and authorities played down the dangers of a Chernobyl-style disaster, saying they believed a partial meltdown was controllable. The government urged people to remain calm. Officials had earlier evacuated 20,000 residents living within 6 miles of the plant on the orders of the prime minister, Naoto Kan, who had inspected it via helicopter. Experts told Associated Press that the risk area was 4 miles. The crisis began when the 8.9 magnitude shock cut off power, turning off the water supply needed to cool the system. The tsunami is thought to have cut off the backup diesel generator an hour later, leading to pressure rising rapidly within the reactor. Broadcaster NHK said attempts to vent radioactive gas to lower the pressure had been suspended because the radiation level on one valve was higher than expected, heightening the risk of exposing workers to radiation. Earlier in the day a Japanese nuclear safety panel said radiation levels were 1,000 times higher than normal in a control room and eight times higher than normal just outside the plant. Workers were changing shifts frequently. Tepco has also declared an emergency at the Fukushima No 2 plant after reporting problems with a reactor there. The chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, said the pressure control system was not functioning at the plant's three reactors. Officials were evacuating residents within a 2 mile radius and had ordered those with 6 miles to stay indoors, NHK said. Naoto Sekimura, a professor at the University of Tokyo, told AP a major radioactive disaster was unlikely. \"No Chernobyl is possible at a light water reactor. Loss of coolant means a temperature rise, but it also will stop the reaction,\" he said. \"Even in the worst-case scenario, that would mean some radioactive leakage and equipment damage, but not an explosion. If venting is done carefully, there will be little leakage. Certainly not beyond the 3km radius.\" A partial meltdown in one of the light water reactors at Three Mile Island in 1979 resulted in the release of radioactive gases in the most serious incident in the history of the US nuclear power industry. The reactor was eventually brought under control despite a series of errors. Across the worst hit area of Japan, the north-east Tohoku region, at least 630 people are dead and a similar number missing, according to police sources, with 1,128 injured. The country has mobilised 50,000 rescuers but they have yet to reach the most severely affected areas. Residents woke up after a freezing night on rooftops and in emergency shelters to a sea of mud, water and debris. Earthquakes continued to rock the north-east coast overnight, although some said the worst tremors appeared to be subsiding. Japan downgraded tsunami warnings in most areas but Tohoku remained on high alert for waves up to 10 metres high. The tsunami has reached countries across the Pacific region but there were no reports of major damage outside Japan. Images shot from helicopters showed many people still crowding the rooftops of buildings surrounded by water and mud. Some, including children, were winched to safety by rescuers. Other footage showed the letters SOS spelled out on the roof of a hospital in Iwanuma, Miyagi prefecture. Photographs from Sendai – one of the worst hit cities – showed families crammed into schools. \"The flood came in from behind the store and swept around both sides. Cars were flowing right by,\" said Wakio Fushima, who owns a convenience store in Sendai, which has around 1 million inhabitants and is 80 miles from the quake's epicentre. Witnesses said the tsunami had reached about six miles inland. \"The tsunami was unbelievably fast. Smaller cars were being swept around me and all I could do was sit in my truck,\" said driver Koichi Takairin, 34, who was trapped in his four-tonne vehicle by the torrent. Hundreds queued outside supermarkets for basic supplies and petrol stations were crowded with cars. Authorities warned citizens in northern Japan to be prepared for severe power cuts due to the shutdown of nuclear plants, which provide about 30% of the country's electricity. More than 1 million households are without water.

A state of emergency was declared around the Fukushima No 1 power plant as a precaution, because a cooling system was not working after the quake, officials said. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, said there had been no reports of radiation leaks at any of the country's nuclear facilities. Residents within a 2 mile (3km) radius of Tokyo Electric Power's (Tepco) Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant had been told to evacuate, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, told a news conference. Kyodo news agency said around 3,000 residents were being moved out. Work had begun on restoring the cooling function at the reactor, Jiji news agency quoted the trade ministry as saying. Tepco confirmed that water levels inside the reactors were falling but it was working to maintain them to avert the exposure of nuclear fuel rods. The company was trying to restore power to its emergency power system so it could add water to the reactors, a Tepco spokesman said. \"There is a falling trend (in water levels) but we have not confirmed an exposure of nuclear fuel rods,\" he said. Tepco had been operating three out of six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant at the time of the quake – the No 1, No 2 and No 3 units – all of which were shut down. Reactors core remain hot and still need cooling after they have been shut down. The spokesman said there were no concerns of a water leak in the other three reactors at the plant, which were closed for planned maintenance. \"We launched the measure so we can be fully prepared for the worst scenario,\" Edano said. \"We are using all our might to deal with the situation.\" Eleven nuclear reactors were automatically shut down in the wider quake-affected areas of Japan, the government said. Kan said: \"Parts of nuclear plants were automatically shut down but we haven't confirmed any effects induced by radioactive materials outside the facilities.\" A fire broke out in a turbine building and was extinguished at the Tohoku Electricity company's Onagawa nuclear plant in north-east Japan. Smoke was seen coming from the building, which is separate from the plant's reactor. The four nuclear power plants closest to the epicentre had all been safely shut down, the International Atomic Energy Agency said, adding that it was seeking more information and had offered its help to Japan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2012/mar/20/who-killed-hilda-murrell","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-20T16:27:28Z","webTitle":"Who really killed Hilda Murrell? | Michael Mansfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/20/who-killed-hilda-murrell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2012/mar/20/who-killed-hilda-murrell","fields":{"headline":"Who really killed Hilda Murrell?","bodyText":"Hilda Murrell was murdered in March 1984. Who killed her - and why - has already been the subject of books, plays and films, and the conviction of a man for her abduction and murder in 2005 failed to answer many of the questions surrounding her death. The reasons for this enduring enquiry are exposed at length in A Thorn In Their Side, a book being launched this week to mark the 28th anniversary of her death. The author is Hilda's nephew, Robert Green, with whom she had a close relationship and who was a commander in naval intelligence during the Falklands war. He has followed and chronicled the case meticulously. Was this just a random, bungled burglary by a lone 16-year-old - as the police would have it - or was it an operation involving several individuals on behalf of a government agency, namely the security services? The book cannot definitively answer this question, but it raises serious and substantial doubts about the criminal investigations to date. The accumulated concerns make an overwhelming argument for these to be reopened by an independent police force unconnected with any previous enquiries, or by an independent commission of inquiry. \"Nuclear disaster is both avoidable and inevitable. Nuclear technologies have too many inherent risks and widespread consequences to be a sensible choice for energy production.\" The words are those of Rebecca Johnson, a former senior advisor to the Blix commission on weapons of mass destruction, writing about the disaster at Fukushima earlier this month. Back in 1984, this was exactly Hilda Murrell's position. Murrell was a respected horticulturist: a rose was named after her shortly before she was murdered at the age of 78. She was a committed environmentalist and regarded Margaret Thatcher's nuclear power policy as utterly misguided. She began campaigning against it, accumulating high quality information about the risks from scientists and activists, and intended to provide it in person to the Sizewell B public inquiry, where she had was accreditated as a witness. She was an outstanding and outspoken independent voice. The murder occurred before she could be heard. Her nephew's book chillingly reveals the threats, fears and surveillance she reported to others before she died. A central theme of her research was the hazardous nature of radioactive waste and the difficulty in managing it. This still besets the nuclear industry, to the extent that the US currently has a moratorium on new reactors in some states. Murrell was also acutely aware of the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979. Her critique embraced nuclear weapons as well. At which point we pan across to Commander Rob Green. The Argentinian cruiser, the General Belgrano, was sunk in 1982 during the Falklands war by HMS Conqueror, a nuclear submarine. Green was in naval intelligence. The truth about where the Belgrano was whether it was really necessary to sink her became a very hot political potato. A great deal of speculation and information entered the public domain that undermined the government's position. Although entirely without foundation, there must have been at least a suspicion that Green might in some way have been connected with the supposed leaks. Ultimately, the MP Tam Dalyell, who had been asking questions about the Belgrano's sinking just before her disappearance, was driven to tell the Commons that British intelligence lay behind Murrell's murder in their search for material they thought she may have secreted at her home. In the official version of her murder, Murrell was the victim of a demeaning and callous assault, abduction and murder by a young adolescent, on his own, without obvious motivation. The police version of the sequence of events is bizarre. On one and the same day, Hilda - having been assaulted in her home - is forced into her own car, driven through Shrewsbury in broad daylight past the police station and a number of witnesses, to a country lane some miles away. The car crashes into a verge with the driver's door jammed. The driver then exits via the passenger seat and takes Hilda with him, but not before she has retrieved the car keys and put them in her pocket. He assaults her again in a field, where she loses her hat and spectacles. She is then either dragged or pushed across a ploughed field over a fence into a copse where she is stabbed,although not fatally, and left to die of hypothermia. Her body was not found for two days. While DNA from the convicted man shows he was in Hilda's house, there are a huge number of other evidential matters that Rob Green has assembled which challenge the manner of this killing. Although many of them are not new, most have not been assembled in an intelligible format until now, and some have never been presented in court proceedings. A few of the features which tend to undermine the idea that only one person was involved are: (a) DNA discovered in relation to Hilda is not from the man convicted, but from at least two others; (b) Photographs of Hilda's body in the copse show that she was clearly visible, and confirm the striking evidence of a local landowner. Ian Scott took his dogs for a walk the day after the murder in the very area where the body was supposed to have been left. He saw nothing and has always maintained he would have done had she been there because he was carefully identifying trees for felling. (c) The 16-year-old could not drive and the descriptions given by witnesses of the driver do not fit him; (d) Changes at her house over the days of her disappearance. Until an independent inquiry takes place, the reader must be the judge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/jul/16/nuclear-energy-quango-bonuses","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-16T17:33:01Z","webTitle":"Staff at nuclear decommissioning quango see bonus pots increase to £5m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/16/nuclear-energy-quango-bonuses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/jul/16/nuclear-energy-quango-bonuses","fields":{"headline":"Staff at nuclear decommissioning quango paid £5m in bonuses","bodyText":"Bonuses at taxpayer-funded quango the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority rose by almost a third last year even though it faces a £4bn budget shortfall by 2015. Staff were awarded £5m, according to an answer to a Freedom of Information request tabled by the Guardian, compared with just under £3.8m the previous year. The NDA, which employs about 300 people, will publish its annual report by the end of the month when it will outline how much it paid to directors for the last financial year. The TaxPayers' Alliance said that the pay-outs would be hard to justify at a time of public sector spending cuts. The NDA's chairman Stephen Henwood recently admitted there were \"shortcomings\" in the way the bonus scheme worked, and it has since been tightened up. He has also promised to cut a third of its staff and its £800m annual running costs by a fifth within three years. Staff costs went up by over 40% in two years, according to the NDA's most recent published annual reports. A spokesman for the NDA said that senior managers received between £15,000 and £20,000 in bonuses last year and that the average bonus was about £12,000. According to its annual report, executive directors were awarded £65,000 each. The NDA is responsible for decommissioning the UK's old reactors, estimated at costing £73bn. It is supposed to fund about half its annual clean-up budget through its commercial activities, such as operating the remaining Magnox reactors and reprocessing spent fuel. The rest is paid for by the taxpayer, via the energy department. But recently, lower income and higher decommissioning costs mean funding the NDA takes up two thirds of the energy department's annual budget. During the year corresponding to last year's pay-outs – 2008/2009 – the NDA increased its income by over £500m largely as a result of higher electricity prices. It also said that it achieved £183m of efficiency savings. An NDA spokesman said: \"In order to attract and retain the calibre of people necessary to deliver the NDA's required performance, NDA staff have the contractual opportunity to achieve an annual bonus dependent on the achievement of strict performance targets.\" But Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will struggle to understand why ... a multi-million pound bonus pot is necessary ... when there is so much pressure to cut spending in order to address the fiscal crisis. At the same time, using cash bonuses to this extent, at an organisation that has such a long term objective, could clearly create the wrong incentives for staff and lead to the pursuit of short term efficiencies at a greater long term cost. The NDA needs to review how it rewards staff and do more to deliver value for taxpayers' money.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/apr/22/will-hutton-argentina-oil-grab-justified","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-21T23:04:00Z","webTitle":"Argentina's oil grab is timely retort to rampaging capitalism | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/22/will-hutton-argentina-oil-grab-justified","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/22/will-hutton-argentina-oil-grab-justified","fields":{"headline":"Argentina's oil grab is timely retort to rampaging capitalism","bodyText":"Suppose the British government knew that a key shareholder in Centrica, our last great British energy company and owner of British Gas, was to sell its stake to Gazprom, so making Russian state ownership inevitable. I hope that, in this scenario, the government would expand the provision of the Enterprise Act that allows Britain to block takeovers that are against the national interest to include gas and nuclear power. (The act is currently confined to defence, financial services and the media.) I'm pretty certain that Centrica chairman Sir Roger Carr, also president of the CBI, shares the same view. No country can be indifferent to the ownership of strategic assets and thus the use to which they might be put. Its first obligation is to the well-being of its citizens. The Argentinian government was faced with just this dilemma last week. YPF is its national oil and gas company, which it sold to the Spanish oil company Repsol for $15bn in 1999 as part of its privatisation drive. It has not been a great deal for either party. Argentinian oil and gas production has slumped, exploration for new reserves has been run down and this oil-rich country is now an oil importer, with Repsol accused of looting the company and betraying its obligations. Repsol's excuse is that Argentinian price controls are absurdly tough. It has wanted to sell its holding for some time and last July finally found a potential buyer: the Chinese state oil company Sinopec. On Monday, fearing that the deal was about to be done, the Argentinian government seized the lion's share of Repsol's stake to get majority control. Better that YPF is owned by the Argentinian government than the Chinese Communist party is their reasoning. Many governments would have done the same. Ownership matters. Yet Argentina has been roundly condemned – the EU, Spain, Mexico and even Britain have all weighed in. The Economist thunders that President Cristina Fernández's antics must not go unpunished; nationalisation is a sin beyond redemption. The inference is that Repsol should have been allowed freely to dispose of its shares to whichever buyer and at the best price it could achieve. Argentina and its citizens have no right to intervene. Ms Fernández was certainly high-handed and very arbitrary. She only seized enough shares from Repsol to secure 51% control and has yet to say what the state will pay in compensation; the other shareholders are hapless bystanders with their investment shredded. There is more than a whiff of shameless populism to her actions. But to portray Repsol as an injured innocent whose natural rights have been unfairly suborned is to traduce economic and political reality. For too long, companies and the rich worldwide, egged on by American Republicans and British Tories, have shamelessly exploited the proposition that there is only one proper relationship between them and society: they do what they want on their own terms. And society must accept this because it is the sole route to \"wealth generation\". Capital exists above state and society. Fernández's actions, however clumsy and unfair in their execution, are part of a growing worldwide reaction to the excesses that this proposition has brought. Repsol does not, and did not, have a God-given right to sell control in YPF to whomever it pleases while Argentina's interests can go hang. It exists in a symbiotic relationship with the society in which it trades. The right to trade and to own are privileges that come with reciprocal obligations as the Ownership Commission, which I chaired, argued earlier this year. They cannot exist in a vacuum because companies' actions have profound effects. Moreover, companies, especially energy companies, need public agencies to help mitigate the risk of undertaking huge investments in a world where the future is unknowable. Across the globe, business and the rich insist on denying these elementary truths. Now they are reaping the whirlwind as a hostile reaction gathers pace worldwide. Capitalism's self-appointed custodians have become its worst enemies. It is the driving force behind the Occupy Movement. It is why Jean Luc Melénchon, the hard left French presidential candidate, has had such a successful election campaign. It is why so many governments are co-ordinating their investigation into Amazon, the company paying negligible tax on its worldwide profits. It is why President Obama has adopted the Buffet tax on millionaires as a popular part of his re-election campaign. It is why George Osborne felt he had to balance his high-risk reduction in the top rate of income tax to 45%with a passionate declaration of war on the rich evading tax. The reaction is long overdue and is producing some long-needed corrections. For example, in the last fortnight alone, Goldman Sachs' Lloyd Blankfein, Barclays' Bob Diamond and Citibank's Vikram Pandit have all faced angry shareholders, responding to the new mood, protesting about the extravagance of their bonuses compared to their institutions' paltry performance. They are being forced to accept less. Proportionality in top pay is beginning to be restored, if still a long way off. But the mood needs to be channelled. Argentina may have done everyone a service by forcibly reminding global business that there are unpleasant consequences for neglecting economic and social responsibilities, but summary nationalisation without compensation is hardly a solid template for the future. It is a harbinger of Chinese-style arbitrary government; a move from crony capitalism to crony statism. It is time to reassert that while capitalism may be a proven route to prosperity, it only works in a complex interdependence with the state and society. There have to be rules at home and abroad to make a desirable world of open borders, free trade and free business work. Taxes have to be paid rather than evaded. Pay has to be proportional to contribution. Labour leader Ed Miliband was roundly and universally criticised as a leftist innocent just seven months ago when he differentiated between good and bad capitalism; now he looks extraordinarily prescient. If more of his party – especially the shadow cabinet – would rally to his cause, there is a phenomenal political opportunity. The mood is changing. It needs to be channelled: the creation of a new and different compact with business, finance and the rich. It is what electorates across the world want to see. President Fernández, in her gauche way, has tapped into a global mood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"theguardian/2011/mar/21/westminster-council-big-business-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-21T00:05:06Z","webTitle":"Letters: Big business society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/mar/21/westminster-council-big-business-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2011/mar/21/westminster-council-big-business-tax","fields":{"headline":"Big business society","bodyText":"Having never expressed an opinion, privately or publicly, on the subject, I was surprised to read (Report, 19 March) that I am against the no-fly zone in Libya.

The report by the House of Common's Environment Audit Committee (EAC) on the UK's targets for cuts in carbon emissions concludes that there is a fundamental \"inconsistency\" in David Cameron's government simultaneously committing to long-term reductions and to a \"politically motivated\" review of those reductions in 2014. It also finds fears that lobbying by highly polluting industries is \"dictating policy\" are fuelled by a \"lack of transparency\". \"The Treasury still doesn't get climate change, or the risk it poses to global stability and economic prosperity,\" said Labour's Joan Walley, chair of the EAC. \"Green investment should be seen as a 'win-win' solution to our economic problems; helping to stimulate growth and rebalance the economy, at the same time as reducing pollution.\" Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative member of the committee, said that uncertainty over the government's commitment was harming the UK's transition to a low carbon economy. Changes in policy were \"the one risk all investors highlight when they consider putting funds into clean technology\", he said. Ofgem calculates that £200bn of investment is needed over the next decade in the UK's creaking and dirty energy infrastructure. \"The Treasury has made important progress on a range of green initiatives,\" a departmental spokesman said. \"We are introducing a carbon price floor – a world first – as the basis of an innovative and economically ambitious green policy.\" Osborne stunned green businesses and campaigners on 3 October when, for the first time, he publicly attacked environmental measures as harming some businesses and appeared to reverse previous government ambitions to be a world leader in low carbon technologies, such as wind power and carbon capture and storage. \"We're not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business,\" he told the Conservative party conference. His statement followed months of behind-the-scenes rows between the Treasury and other government departments over green policies, which continued on Sunday with reports that Osborne is the cause of continuing delays to an urgent review of subsidies for renewable energy. Conservative sources say soaring energy bills and the unpopularity of green policies with Tory voters were behind Osborne's reversal of green ambition, as well as fears of the affordability of some policies in a world gripped by economic crisis. Critics respond that renewable energy, energy efficiency and other sustainable sectors represent the best sectors for economic growth and employment in the UK, not energy intensive industries like steel and cement. \"Osborne is a 20th century chancellor in a 21st century world who has totally failed to grasp the financial necessity of building a low-carbon future,\" said Andy Atkins, director of Friends of the Earth. \"I hope the prime minister has a better grasp of modern economics than his chancellor.\" Cameron pledged to lead the \"greenest government ever\" within days of taking office. The EAC report focuses on the carbon budget approved by the government in May, which commits the UK to cutting its emissions by 50% by 2025. Cameron had to overrule Osborne's objections to get the budget passed, but Osborne exacted two concessions. First, there would be a review of the budget in 2014 to ensure it was not harming UK competitiveness; and second, exemptions, rebates or grants would be given to heavy energy users to offset the impact of new emissions restrictions. The EAC report found: \"There is, more fundamentally, an inconsistency in the government's position of trumpeting its acceptance of a recommended carbon budget for 20 or so years hence, while at the same time envisaging the possibility of overturning that commitment just three years from now.\" The Treasury spokesman called the 2014 review pragmatic. Energy and climate change minister Greg Barker said: \"By legislating for clear targets up to 2027 we are doing more than any other country in providing long-term certainty to those investing in the low carbon economy. At the same time, it's right that we review progress towards the EU emissions goal in 2014 so that we're not disadvantaging British industry, which would simply result in emissions being shipped overseas.\" The 2025 carbon budget was proposed by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the official advisers to the government. The CCC will also carry out the 2014 review but its chief executive, David Kennedy, said he did not expect the \"significant change in circumstances\" needed to weaken the legally binding budgets by that time. \"The climate change act is a very powerful piece of legislation,\" he said. \"It is there to mitigate against these short-term political and economic difficulties.\" The EAC also criticised the government over the help it has signalled it will give to heavily polluting industries, some of which have received windfalls of billions of euros from unused carbon pollution permits. \"Government has given little priority to generating hard evidence of 'carbon leakage' [where jobs are lost to nations with weaker emissions controls]. A lack of transparency and information on the risks to energy intensive industries ... needs to be resolved to allay fears of lobbying dictating policy.\" Political insiders saw Osborne's conference speech as \"a little gift\" to energy intensive industries. Neil Bentley, the CBI deputy director general, said: \"A review of the carbon budget is sensible and will ensure the UK doesn't get out of step with European competitors, but what's really important is that the government delivers a clear framework for companies to invest with confidence.\" Before Osborne's speech, environment, energy and climate change ministers had talked of the dangers of being a \"follower\" not a \"leader\" in the global low carbon economy. On the eve of the chancellor's speech, environment secretary Caroline Spelman told the Conservative party conference: \"I passionately believe going green is an economic and moral imperative.\" The Treasury has pledged £1bn of public funds to build the country's first commercial-scale demonstration of carbon capture and storage, but the only bidder for the contract is on the verge of pulling out. It has also implemented a minimum price for carbon emissions, which will discourage carbon-heavy energy generation but give a windfall to existing nuclear power operators. Two power companies considering building new nuclear power stations in the UK have, however, either pulled out or are reviewing their plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2011/feb/14/anonymous-stuxnet-nuclear-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-14T13:15:00Z","webTitle":"Anonymous claims to have Stuxnet access","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/14/anonymous-stuxnet-nuclear-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2011/feb/14/anonymous-stuxnet-nuclear-iran","fields":{"headline":"Anonymous claims to have Stuxnet access","bodyText":"The \"hacktivist\" group Anonymous claims to have access to the sophisticated computer virus reportedly developed as a joint Israeli-US cyber attack against Iran's nuclear facilities. Anonymous says it has obtained details of the Stuxnet worm from the emails of HBGary, a US security company the loose hacker collective attacked earlier this month. It is not yet clear whether Anonymous plans to deploy the computer virus, but last week the group signalled an intention to attack Iranian government websites in support of a planned green movement rally in Tehran. However, security experts told the Guardian on Monday that even though Anonymous does have access to parts of Stuxnet, it does not control the crucial code enabling it to attack Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant – an attack Russia's Nato ambassador said could potentially trigger a \"new Chernobyl\". Orla Cox, a security operations manager at Symantec, the cyber security firm that has been researching Stuxnet since its discovery, said it was \"very difficult to tell\" how dangerous Anonymous's copy of Stuxnet is. \"It would be possible [for Anonymous to use Stuxnet in an attack],\" Cox said. \"But it would require a lot of work, it's certainly not trivial. \"The impressive thing about Stuxnet is the knowledge its creators had about their target. So even if you have got access to it you need to understand the target – that requires a lot of research.\" Iran admitted its controversial nuclear programme had been delayed by Stuxnet last year, with reports later claiming that the worm was a joint US-Israeli project intent on knocking Tehran's nuclear ambitions off course. No group has yet claimed responsibility for building Stuxnet. Experts told the Guardian last year that Stuxnet would have taken five to 10 people around six months to create and required large amounts of funding. Computer viruses are largely uncharted territory for Anonymous, which has built its notoriety on crippling the websites of governments and multinational corporations, such as Visa and MasterCard, which it deems a threat to freedom of speech. Late last month the Metropolitan police arrested and then released five people on bail, including three teenagers, it suspected of being involved in December attacks in support of WikiLeaks. Snorre Fagerland, a senior threat researcher at the Norwegian internet security firm Norman, said it would be \"very difficult\" for Anonymous to use its version of Stuxnet in an attack. The hacker collective has obtained a \"decompiled\" version of the virus, rather than the critical source code which would enable an attack. \"The trouble with this [version of Stuxnet] is that you lose almost all context to its abilities,\" Fagerland said. \"The original source code would contain all the text information about why it's built this way – that's gold if you want to use it. If you decompile it you lose all of that.\" A new Symantec report released on Friday shows that Stuxnet was built to repeatedly infect five key industrial facilities in Iran over a 10-month period. The worm, reportedly tested at Israel's nuclear development centre at Dimona, worked by sending Iran's centrifuges spinning out of control, while making it appear that everything was working as normal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2011/nov/22/christopher-busby-nuclear-green-party","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-22T13:45:29Z","webTitle":"Christopher Busby's wild claims hurt green movement and Green party | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/nov/22/christopher-busby-nuclear-green-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/nov/22/christopher-busby-nuclear-green-party","fields":{"headline":"Christopher Busby's wild claims hurt green movement and Green party","bodyText":"One of the most widespread human weaknesses is our readiness to accept claims that fit our beliefs and reject those that clash with them.

An example is the long-running failure by people within the green movement to challenge the claims made by a Dr Christopher Busby. Chris Busby is a visiting professor at the University of Ulster. He was formerly the science and technology spokesperson for the Green Party, which still consults him on matter such as low-level radiation and depleted uranium. Following the extraordinary revelations published by the Guardian on Monday, this may now change. More of that later. One of Busby's best-known contentions, widely repeated by anti-nuclear campaigners, is that there is a leukaemia cluster among children living close to the coast of north Wales. This cluster, he maintains, is caused by radionuclides in the sea, from Sellafield and other sources. His findings were self-published and released by the environmental consultancy and research organisation he runs, called Green Audit. This means that they were not subjected to the scientific assessment required by peer-reviewed journals. Data and claims have to withstand the peer review process if they're to be treated by other scientists as worthy of further investigation. Busby's claims were later assessed by professional scientists working for the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit at the NHS, whose role is to record and analyse the incidence of cancer and monitor any trends in its occurrence. They published their assessment in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the Journal of Radiological Protection. Their paper reported a simple and devastating finding: there is no such cluster. Busby's claims, it seems, were the result of some astonishing statistical mistakes: • He counted the overall leukaemia incidence for Wales twice • He mixed up the figures from urban areas with those from small rural areas, \"trebling the local incidence in north Wales\" and creating \"spurious clusters in various locations\" • He claimed there were ten cases of leukaemia in young children in Snowdonia. In reality there was just one case Worst of all, the paper says: • \"We found clear evidence of data dredging which renders all subsequent statistical inference spurious … the dataset has been systematically trawled.\" Though Busby's \"findings\" had not been subject to peer-review, they were repeated uncritically in the Welsh media, spreading fear and distress among local people. As for his \"second event theory\", which maintains that radionuclides are far more dangerous than scientists say they are, the paper shows that there is no evidence supporting this, and it has \"no biological plausibility\". None of this, however, is as disturbing as the remarkable story published in the Guardian today. Busby appears in a video broadcast on YouTube. In it he makes a number of wild allegations. Among them is a startling conspiracy theory: that the Japanese government is deliberately spreading radioactive material from Fukushima all over Japan. The reason, he says, is that when clusters of childhood cancer start appearing in Fukushima, the parents of the victims will want to sue the Japanese government. \"But the only way that they can say that they've got high levels of cancer is to have a control group in an area that's not contaminated, for example the south of Japan. So I believe that the project to take this material and burn it all over Japan is to destroy all of Japan, to increase the cancer rate in the whole of Japan, so that there will be no control group to which you can compare these children in the Fukushima area.\" He produces no evidence to support this claim. Given that no radioactive waste has been removed from Fukushima prefecture, and there are no plans to do so, it is hard to see how he could. He then goes on to promote expensive new pills and tests which, he says, will protect people in Japan from these alleged horrors. Scientists contacted by the Guardian describe these treatments as useless and baseless. An organisation based in Japan, calling itself the Christopher Busby Foundation for the Children of Fukushima, and linked to Busby's own enterprise in Wales called Busby Laboratories, solicits donations for its work. But the bank account it asks people to send them to is not in Japan. It is called Green Audit, and the bank is in Busby's home town of Aberystwyth. Green Audit is an environmental consultancy and research organisation founded by Busby. When I phoned Busby to ask him some questions about these issues, his responses were less than enlightening. He began as follows: \"You can fuck off frankly.\" When I asked him what his involvement was with the Christopher Busby Foundation for the Children of Fukushima, he told me: \"I think you can fuck off. I'm not going to answer your questions.\" When I asked whether the products being sold in his name are snakeoil, he responded: \"Of course it's not snakeoil you fuckwit\". Busby answered some of my questions but put the phone down on me before I could ask what I considered to be the key points. These are: - Are you receiving money from the sale of these products and services? - Have the pills being sold in your name been subjected to a randomised controlled trial to test their efficacy? - Are the tests being sold audited by external assessors? - Do you draw money out of the Green Audit account for your own use? When I emailed these questions and others to him he sent me, \"as my response to your questions\" a summary of the proceedings of a conference that took place in 2009. Given that this was held before the Fukushima disaster, and before he started promoting pills and tests to the people of Japan, it was hard to see the relevance of this answer. No other response from him has been forthcoming. Those who oppose nuclear power often maintain that they have a moral duty to do so. But it seems to me that moral duties cut both ways. We have a moral duty not to spread unnecessary and unfounded fears. If we persuade people that they or their children are likely to suffer from horrible and dangerous health problems, and if these fears are baseless, we cause great distress and anxiety, needlessly damaging the quality of people's lives. We have a moral duty not to use these unfounded fears as a means of extracting money from frightened and vulnerable people, whatever that money might be used for. We have a moral duty not to divert good, determined campaigners away from fighting real threats, and into campaigns against imaginary threats. Dedicated and effective activists are a scarce resource. Wasting their lives by encouraging them to chase unicorns is a disservice to them and a disservice to everyone else. We have a moral duty to assess threats as clearly and rationally as we can, so that we do not lobby to replace a lesser threat with a greater one. If, as is already happening in Germany, shutting down nuclear power results in an increase in the burning of fossil fuels, especially coal, far more people will suffer and die as a result of both climate change and local pollution. If, as now seems likely, we wildly miss our carbon targets and commit the world to runaway warming, partly as a result of the nuclear shutdown, history will judge the people who demanded it harshly. So this article is a plea for people to try to step back from their entrenched positions and see the bigger picture. It asks you to be as sceptical about the claims you like as you are about the claims you dislike. It asks you to subject everyone who makes claims about important and contentious subjects to the same standards of enquiry and proof. I know that's a tough call, but it is not as tough as wasting our lives inadvertently campaigning, on the basis of misinformation, to make the world a worse place. www.monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/jun/17/hague-uk-iran-talks-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-17T17:42:27Z","webTitle":"Tough knife crime measures pass: politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/17/hague-uk-iran-talks-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/jun/17/hague-uk-iran-talks-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Tough knife crime measures pass: politics live blog","bodyText":"So, that's your lot on a busy day in politics: • MPs have voted to introduce amendments to the Criminal Courts and Justice Bill, which will see tougher jail sentences imposed for people caught twice with a knife. • William Hague has announced the reopening of the UK embassy in Tehran. It is not clear when the embassy will open; the foreign secretary said it would begin with a small diplomatic staff at first. Hague said he hopes there will be a wider knock-on effect in Syria: Iran could have a positive role across the region. You can read the latest on the situation in the Middle East in our live blog here. • The head of the Passport Office has disclosed that there are nearly 500,000 passport applications still \"in progress\" as a union representative said staffing cuts had contributed to the huge backlog. Paul Pugh, chief executive of the Passport Office, said he had considered resigning but decided against it. • The Chinese premier Li Keqiang has arrived at Downing Street for talks with David Cameron. Li said he wanted the trip to \"change misperceptions and misgivings\" in the UK about China. Cameron said the links between the two countries were \"very strong\" and the visit was an opportunity to \"take them to a new level\". China has announced it will invest in two big UK infrastructure projects, including HS2. • A civil servant has been fired over edits to the Hillsborough entry on Wikipedia. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said social media guidelines were being updated for users of government computers. • Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has \"ruled out completely\" charging patients to see their GP. In a lunch with the press gallery, he also said he stood by his belief that the abortion limit should be cut to 12 weeks and said the government had no plans for a sugar tax. The NHS should aim to claw back £500m a year from overseas visitors who use the health service,Hunt said. • Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have both suffered a sharp drop in their personal popularity, falling to their lowest figures ever recorded in a Guardian-ICM poll. Isabel Hardman, assistant editor of the Spectator, tells us the bill was passed 404 to 53 And provides some light evening reading on the power of the Tory backbenches under athe Coalition government @labourwhips have helpfully told us who the \"Tory rebels\" are, ex-Justice Minister Crispin Blunt and Geoffrey Cox QC: As if by magic, here is a statement from Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, speaking after the \"House of Commons voted for tougher mandatory sentences for knife crime\" He said: David Cameron promised that everyone caught carrying a knife would go to jail. After four years as Prime Minister and four years of broken promises, it’s not surprising that David Cameron and his ministers failed to support these measures. They have only been passed because of Labour support. We must send out a strong message that knife crime is unacceptable. Now, someone caught, charged, prosecuted and found guilty of carrying a knife for a second time will almost certainly be sent to prison unless there are particular reasons why they shouldn’t be. There will still be judicial discretion, but the message is clear, those who repeatedly commit knife crime face prison. We don’t believe this in itself is enough to rid our streets of the scourge of knives, which is why its important work is done with families, schools, colleges and youth clubs to prevent people carrying a knife in the first place. So it is definitely mandatory then, \"unless there are particular reasons why they shouldn’t be\". Glad that's has been cleared up. How much of a change will the amendment make? According to my colleague Alan Travis, unlike the billing the amendment has received, it will not impose \"mandatory\" sentences. This from his earlier article: The measure is often described as mandatory or an automatic six-month prison sentence for an offender caught with a knife for a second time. But the detailed wording of the de Bois amendment makes clear it is actually a sentencing guideline, which is not binding on the courts. It says that for repeat offenders the courts must pass a sentence of at least six months on adults and four months on those aged between 16 and 18 – \"unless there are particular circumstances which relate to the offence or to the offender and would make it unjust in all the circumstances\". This leaves room for judicial discretion. Labour says will support the move precisely because it is not a mandatory or automatic sentence. The official sentencing guidelines for judges since 2008 have made clear that their \"starting point for the lowest level of knife possession amongst adults should be 12 weeks' custody\". So the effect of the new measure would be to double that \"starting point\" when they consider their sentence. Which is why, you might argue, Labour MPs keen to look tougher on crime have been able to support the bill, despite being opposed to mandatory sentencing. MPs have voted to introduce amendments to the Criminal Courts and Justice Bill, which will see tougher jail sentences imposed for people caught twice with a knife. Former Conservative solicitor general Sir Edward Garnier said he opposed the idea. \"I'm not at all convinced, despite the enthusiasm (of Mr de Bois) for this particular provision, that this new clause provides the answer.\" \"Nor am I persuaded that the default position is that a community sentence is the right answer. There will be cases where it is imperative the individual offender should be sent to prison, and sent to prison for a very long time. \"But by and large that will involve cases where the knife has been carried in order to commit a crime which is then carried out.\" Labour MP Heidi Alexander (Lewisham East) endorsed the amendment, naming a series of fatal stabbings in her constituency in recent years. \"There is a degree of uncertainty about this but I think one of things we need to consider today in deciding how we vote on these particular new clauses is not just the message it sends to those who may be caught up in knife crime but the message that is sent to the victims of knife crime and their families. \"I know how our communities are scarred by the use of knives and I know many of my constituents live with the loss of knife crime and I believe this House needs to demonstrate with which we take this issue, not just in terms of sentencing but in all the action government takes to address the problem.\" No news of the vote yet, so here is some more from the debate ahead of the vote on the amendments. Prisons minister Jeremy Wright said policy agreement had not been reached in relation to the two new clauses. Basically the coalition couldn't agree. \"Although both coalition parties are fully committed to protecting the public, with regard to these particular new clauses, policy agreement has not been reached so it will be for the whole House to decide upon them at the conclusion of this debate.\" Shadow minister for justice Andy Slaughter spoke in favour of the amendments, describing knife crime as one of the \"most serious and intractable criminal justice issues, one that leaves irrevocable damage in its wake\". He accused Clegg of trying to \"buff his tarnished Liberal credentials\" and a \"cheap political stunt to throw a bone to his increasingly malnourished base\". \"Prevention is better than cure... but it is important the message goes out from this House that carrying a knife without good reason is unacceptable.\" David Burrowes, Tory MP for Enfield Southgate, who co-drafted the amendments, said: \"This is making a clear, clear point that the expectation is for the victims, the public and for the offenders that they will go to prison if they carry a knife.\" Back in the debating chamber: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's understanding of the issue has been questioned, by de Bois who said he had \"not quite got this right\" while shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: \"The lack of knowledge of the Deputy Prime Minister is frankly shocking.\" De bois argued: \"What is in front of the House today is not an attempt to change the basis of prosecution, we are simply toughening up the sentencing. \"Our amendment doesn't change the basis for prosecution for someone for carrying a knife, so a tradesman carrying his tools or, as the Deputy Prime Minister seemed overtly worried about, someone carrying a small pen knife are excluded from this by existing legislation.\" \"The sort of scaremongering that we hear about penknives is absolute nonsense and defies common sense.\" Concluding, Mr De Bois said: \"Our amendments will just make it clear, to the criminals, to the public and the victims of the minimum expectation that if you choose to knowingly go out and carry a knife for a second offence, I believe everyone should get a chance, but I think the patience of the public, the patience of this House and the patience of victims is being sorely tested with what is happening presently with our judicial system in this matter and we here today can make a difference by supporting this amendment.\" Labour's Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) said the Justice Committee had interviewed people who had been given prison sentences or community service orders who said it was worse than prison. \"Some of them have said that community service orders and restorative justice is tougher and more effective than going to prison. Much tougher and much more effective because they had to make decisions themselves and follow a programme. Does he not think that we should think about this a little bit more?\" Justice minister Jeremy Wright argued that sending more people to prison would result in fewer people in prison: \"This Government's very clear policy is to make sure that the right people are in prison and that the courts have the opportunity to send the right people to prison whenever they deem it appropriate to do so, and that the way to deal with the prison population and to reduce it is very straight forwardly to make sure that reoffending is reduced so that those people do not continue to return to custody.\" Meanwhile in the corridors of power: at his press conference with David Cameron, Chinese premier Li Keqiang has said he wanted to see a \"united United Kingdom\" in an apparent boost for the no campaign ahead of September's Scottish independence referendum. Li said he wanted a \"strong, prosperous and united United Kingdom\". He added: I believe that the United Kingdom can stay at the forefront in leading the world's growth and development and also continue to play an important and even bigger role for regional stability and global peace. But he added: \"We certainly respect the choice you make.\" Debating the amendments de Bois said it was vital to send a message to people carrying knives at at a time when thousands of children are being caught in possession of a blade. PA again: He said: \"I believe that this House should require courts to send a clear and unequivocal message on carrying a knife. \"And if we need any more convincing that the message that you should not carry a knife is currently a weak message, you need look no further than to the thousands of children who are not regarding this as a serious offence. \"Over 2,500 of those caught in possession of a knife last year were aged from 10 to 17.\" Intervening, former coalition children's minister Tim Loughton spoke of the importance of Mr de Bois's proposals as more and more primary school pupils form fledgling gangs and try to emulate older children who carry knives, seeing them as a \"badge of honour\". Mr Loughton said : \"Do you agree with me that having spent some time amongst gangs in Birmingham and trying to understand gang culture, the most worrying thing that is already in the playgrounds of primary schools you can see gangs that are starting to form, trying to emulate their teenage and older colleagues? \"And a knife is a badge of honour which they see the older kids using and therefore they think it's acceptable to do it themselves and it's getting younger and younger and that's why your amendment is so important.\" Mr de Bois replied: \"In fact you touch on a very important point - that people should be looking to the carrying of a knife as a badge of honour, we should be looking to create more positive role models to follow that can replace such a badge of honour.\" The pair both agreed that central and local government programmes are not as good at tackling the root causes of knife crime than under-resourced volunteer and local groups, with Mr de Bois suggesting the Government's own strategy is failing in this sense. He said: \"I don't believe people like me - a suit - will ever reach the sort of people effectively that those from communities that have been touched by knife crime can do. \"My concern is that despite even this Government's own gang strategy, that right down at the bottom end of it we are not getting some of the resources to help support some of those groups.\" Earlier during the Bill's report stage, the Government saw off Labour amendments that would have removed ministers' reforms to judicial review, which are aimed at stopping the hijacking of the process for political reasons. Hello, Lexy Topping here ahead of tonight's knife crime sentencing vote. The vote will decide if tougher jail sentences should be imposed for people caught twice with a knife. In parliament this afternoon Tory MP Nick de Bois (Enfield North), who is proposing mandatory prison terms for second-time knife offenders, claimed current sentences are too lenient and can fuel knife crime. The plans have caused a split in the coalition, and Conservative ministers will abstain because the proposals are opposed by the Lib Dems and they cannot support policy that has not been agreed by both governing parties. However the amendments are expected to be passed with support from Conservative backbenchers and Labour. This primer from the Press Association: Under his amendments to the Criminal Courts and Justice Bill, adults would receive a minimum six-month jail term on their second conviction for carrying a knife, while 16-year-olds would be given at least a four-month detaining and training order. During the Bill's report stage in the Commons, Mr De Bois said: \"Some have argued that sending a signal may not be enough, that potential offenders do not think of the consequences of pocketing a knife. \"This is entirely possible but it would, I think, also be to miss the wider point of this sentencing change, because for those that are actually embarking on a journey that embraces the knife culture, the eventual destination of this journey may be serious injury to someone else or even to the carrier of the knife, and frankly it can lead to the death of someone. They may take a life. \"And that journey to destruction which quite simply ruins lives included picking up and carrying a knife for the first time. \"Quite simply, in the vast majority of cases, let's face it, to kill someone with a knife you first have to carry a knife, and I believe our courts are dispensing sentences for possession of a knife in thousands of cases that are quite simply treated by offenders as little more than an occupational hazard. \"With nearly 8,000 last year being fines and cautions, I would suggest that in some cases that fuels knife crime and does nothing to halt knife crime.\" I will shortly be handing over this live blog to a colleague to cover the knife crime sentencing vote this evening. In the meantime, a brief summing-up of today's main developments: • William Hague has announced the reopening of the UK embassy in Tehran. It is not clear when the embassy will open; the foreign secretary said it would begin with a small diplomatic staff at first.

That's it from me for today; my colleague will be picking this up in a moment. Thanks for reading and for all your comments here and via Twitter (@Claire_Phipps). Around half of Labour's candidates selected to fight in marginal seats at the next election have links to Westminster as former special advisers, party workers, researchers, lobbyists or MPs, a Guardian analysis has discovered. My colleagues Rowena Mason and Aisha Gani have mapped the backgrounds of candidates for 2015 and found Labour and Liberal Democrats are choosing more from the political classes than the Conservatives, whose contenders are overwhelmingly male and drawn from business and finance. You can read the full report here. Cameron has been fielding a question about the EU and his efforts to prevent Jean-Claude Juncker becoming the new head of the EU executive. The Press Association has filed this snappy take on the news so far on the passports backlog: The head of the Passport Office has apologised to applicants who have suffered delays after coming under considerable pressure from MPs over a backlog crisis at the agency. Paul Pugh, chief executive of the Passport Office, said he was sorry for every case when 'service standards' had not been met – but only after a grilling from chair of the home affairs select committee Keith Vaz. Pugh also confirmed figures provided earlier to the committee by Mike Jones, of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), that as of yesterday around 480,000 passport applications were logged as work in progress at the agency. Jones earlier revealed that this figure has surged from around 290,000 work-in-progress applications in March this year. Addressing Pugh, Vaz asked said: 'Would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting? I have a sheaf of letters from members of the public, from members of parliament, who are very, very angry. You don't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry. Would you like to apologise?' Pugh replied: 'I absolutely recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.' Vaz asked: We can take that as an apology?' Pugh replied: 'It is an apology.' Pugh revealed he had considered resigning but decided against such a move as it was his responsibility to lead the Passport Office through 'tough times'. A report shows the office estimated a year ago that applications would surge by as much as 350,000 this summer because of overseas embassies shutting their passport desks and transferring operations to Britain. But Pugh admitted this forecast was incorrect and was likely to be closer to 400,000. At the press conference with Chinese premier Li Keqiang, David Cameron has been talking about the current crisis in Iraq. He said Isis represents the most serious threat to British security today … What matters is we do everything we can to make this country safe. The linguistic skills of BBC reporter Carrie Gracie have been the highlight of the press conference so far: Cameron is not so fluent: Vaz asks Pugh if he has considered his position. He has thought about whether he needs to step down, Pugh replies, but decided his job was to lead the Passport Office through this. Vaz asks Pugh if he was responsible for a leak to the Guardian of a memo showing the Passport Office had ordered its staff to relax checks on applicants for British passports from abroad in an effort to reduce a backlog of at least 30,000. The story on that is here: A briefing note sent to staff on Monday, passed to the Guardian, allows Passport Office workers to drop checks on countersignatories, as well as requirements for evidence of addresses and letters of confirmation from employers and accountants. It says the changes are required to achieve the right balance between 'customer service, public protection and organisational requirements', adding: 'These changes are being published now in light of the need to speed up turnaround times.' Pugh says the briefing note was a mistake and did not have the approval of ministers. There have been no requests to relax scrutiny of overseas passports, he says. Pugh says 250 staff have been redeployed internally from within the agency into passport processing. Staff have also been redeployed to answer customer queries. Pugh tells MPs that he can't say the Passport Office works \"perfectly efficiently\". When he arrived as chief executive, he said he found that many staff did not have enough to do in the quieter months outside the summer peak. That doesn't happen any more, he says. He says around 90% of passports last week were processed within the timeframe set down by the service standards. Vaz tells Pugh he was forced to text the home secretary on Saturday to sort out a passport case for an individual in his constituency after his calls to the head of the Passport Office were not picked up. Pugh says he thinks two members of his team received a bonus last year – he wasn't one of them. He can't recall how much the bonuses were. Keith Vaz, chair of the committee, asks Pugh if he would like to apologise to those affected by delays to getting their passports. Pugh says \"of course\" the Passport Office is sorry for that. Is that an apology, asks Vaz. It is, Pugh confirms. Pugh says that, as of Monday, just under 480,000 passport applications were classed as \"work in progress\". This is 200,000 more than this time last year. Paul Pugh, chief executive of the Passport Office, is now answering questions from MPs on the home affairs select committee on the applications backlog. He says there have been 3.6m applications since the start of January this year, with 1.9m of those since 1 April. David Cameron and Chinese premier Li Keqiang will hold a joint press conference at the foreign office imminently. Here's a snap from their earlier meeting in the cabinet room. It looks to have been a very male affair: Former prime minister John Major has made his first major speech on the Scottish independence referendum. My colleague Severin Carrell was there and sends these thoughts: His view is that Salmond has no chance of winning the same highly preferential EU rebates and opt-outs that Major won in the 1990s. This is significant as Major was the last Tory PM to fight against devolution – and also the last one whose Tory vote went up in Scotland (1992). Major says Scotland's membership of Nato will be in severe doubt if it ditches Trident: doing that would anger the US and also alarm other EU member states. Jones says cuts to staffing levels and the closure of embassy passport facilities around the world lies behind the surge in passport applications and the backlog in the UK. Leader of the PCS union Mike Jones is answering questions from MPs on the home affairs select committee about the Passport Office and the mounting backlog of applications. Jones says that on 8 June there were 493,000 passport applications in progress, a huge increase on previous years. The applications backlog has soared by nearly 200,000 in the last three months, he says, adding that he thinks the Passport Office has lost control of the situation. The latest Guardian/ICM poll has recorded the lowest ever popularity ratings for Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. You can read the full report here, but here is a taster of the analysis by my colleague Patrick Wintour: ﻿In figures that will concern the Labour leader's team, Miliband's net satisfaction rating slipped from -25 to -39; the figure is the difference between the the 22% who said he was doing a good job and the 61% who said he was doing a bad job. The drop from May's rating is thought to be largely due to previous don't knows firming up with a negative opinion of his performance. Clegg has seen his satisfaction ratings fall 16 points over the same period to -37, as voters respond to his European elections performance. This is also his lowest satisfaction rating since he became deputy prime minister. On a party level, Labour is on 32%, up one point on the last poll; the Conservatives are on 31%, down 2; Lib Dems on 10%, down 3; Ukip on 16%, up one. News that the UK ambassador to Iraq, Simon Collis, has met with Khodair al-Khozaei, the Iraqi vice-president today. MPs are currently voting on an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Courts bill, which would impose minimum six-month jail sentences on those repeatedly caught carrying a knife. My colleague Alan Travis reports: An unusual cross-party alliance of Conservative and Labour MPs is expected to vote to include the knife crime measure in the criminal justice and courts bill despite the opposition of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. [Justice secretary Chris] Grayling, despite drawing up the proposal himself, is expected to delay its implementation, possibly until next April, just before the general election, because it would 'impose a substantial new pressure' on the prison population. The justice ministry says that no official estimate has been made of the impact of the tougher sentencing guideline, but penal reformers estimate that a further 1,945 adults and 200 children could be jailed if it were implemented. The result of the vote﻿ should come in five to ten minutes. [Update: that was for just one particular amendment. The vote on sentences will be at around 6pm.] Hunt says he stands by his view that the abortion limit ought to be lowered to 12 weeks (the current legal limit is 24 weeks, although more than 90% of terminations take place before 12 weeks). Hunt was, as culture secretary, an enthusiastic proponent of local TV channels. But the viewing figures for one high-profile launch, London Live, have been on the (very) low side. Surely local TV champion Hunt is among them, journalists at the press gallery lunch wonder: Hunt also tells reporters he wants to increase the amount the NHS claws back from overseas patients who use the health service. The amount claimed back is currently around £73m, he says: A flurry of tweets is unleashed, as health secretary Jeremy Hunt has lunch with the press gallery at Westminster. (Have a look at #pressgallery if you want to see more.) He said he \"ruled out\" the possibility of patients paying to see a GP, and also said there were no plans to introduce a sugar tax, which the government's own chief medical officer has said might be necessary. Naturally, much of the conversation seems to have been about the NHS: Some of the admissions seem a little … strange: This is evidently the winner: David Cameron and Chinese premier Li Keqiang will hold a joint press conference later this afternoon. In the meantime, the Press Association files this on the early stages of their meeting at Downing Street: David Cameron said he wanted to strengthen the UK's relationship with China as he welcomed premier Li Keqiang to Downing Street. The prime minister and Li were holding talks aimed at boosting trade links between Britain and the economic superpower. But campaigners have urged Cameron to raise China's human rights record with Li during the discussions. Cameron said the links between the two countries were 'very strong' and the visit was an opportunity to 'take them to a new level'. As talks began in the Cabinet Room Li, speaking through an interpreter, said: 'You and I, and the people of China and the UK, share a strong wish for stronger co-operation.' On the eve of Li's visit to No 10 deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the government would not shy away from raising China's \"large scale and systematic\" human rights abuses. Activists campaigning for a variety of causes including Tibetan independence staged a colourful and noisy protest opposite the gates of Downing Street. Their chants could be heard outside No 10 as Cameron and Li shook hands and posed for photographers. Buzzfeed, of course, has managed to find a picture of Nick Clegg enjoying a school lunch of apple crumble and custard. That should silence the critics who say he doesn't match his words with actions. In this ever-so relaxed meeting, the Queen, the Duke of York and Sir Sebastian Wood, Britain's ambassador to China, sat with Li, his wife Cheng Hong, China's ambassador to Britain Liu Xiaoming and China's foreign minister Wang Yi. My colleague Patrick Wintour wrote this in advance of Li's visit: A three-day visit to Britain by the Chinese premier Li Keqiang is expected to lead to nearly £18bn of deals being signed, including a deepening Chinese involvement in energy, nuclear powerand other UK infrastructure. In his first visit to Britain since becoming prime minister last year, Li will also announce investment plans that George Osborne, chancellor, will argue show that London is going to be the world centre for renminbi trading. China Construction Bank, China's second-largest lender, has been selected to become the first clearing service for renminbi trading in London. Chinese companies are expected to announce fresh details of their plans to provide finance and technology for the proposed nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. And the recently created China Minsheng Investment (CMI) is expected to reveal plans to set up a London office and put money into British companies. CMI, led by Dong Wenbiao, chairman of China Minsheng Banking Corporation, has about £5bn under management. Li will be accompanied by about 200 Chinese business leaders, not all of them part of the official visit, including the heads of some of his country's biggest banks. The Chinese premier Li Keqiang has arrived at Downing Street for talks with David Cameron. It is the first visit to the UK by a Chinese premier since a row was sparked in 2012 when Cameron met with the Dalai Lama. Li says he wants the trip to \"change misperceptions and misgivings\" in the UK about China. But the UK government says it remains \"deeply concerned\" about human rights abuses. It's not clear whether Cameron will raise the issue with Li directly; the focus of the meeting is trade. (And lunch – they're being catered for by Chinese chefs based in Manchester.) ITV's political editor, Tom Bradby, says the decision to reopen a UK embassy in Iran is \"is a startling development in a remarkable week\". In his blog, he writes: It represents a striking potential turnaround in our dealings with Iran, which have by and large been marked by extreme hostility for a generation … ﻿This hostility persisted up until last week. We have been on totally different sides in Syria, the British and the US supporting (periodically) the rebels, whilst the Iranians have devoted considerable energy and resources to propping up the Assad regime. And yet now we have both Iranian and probably American and British Special Forces more or less in next door buildings to each other in Baghdad as they face a common – and frightening – enemy in Isis. Although Hague's written statement on the embassy move made no reference to the current crisis in Iraq, he said in foreign office questions that he hoped the thawing of relations with Iran would promote greater stability in Iraq and the wider region: Hague said negotiations over Iran's nuclear capabilities would continue: And he said the embassy would open with a small diplomatic staff, with their safety a \"primary concern\". Nick Clegg has decided to risk a social media meltdown by posting this teaser on Twitter: Some of the replies might not make suitable reading for a family live blog … It reminded me of something Michael Gove said in February, at a high point of the ongoing coalition row over the costs of introducing free school meals for infants this autumn: One of the things that sometimes occurs in Coalition politics is that the smaller party understandably seeks to draw attention to itself by saying we’re in favour of apple pie, cream and custard, and it’s the meanies in the bigger party that are trying to take it away.﻿ Perhaps politicians need to rack their brains more thoroughly for some variety in school dinner memories. That's it for foreign office questions. I will round up some reaction shortly. You can read the latest report on Hague's decision that the Tehran embassy will be reopening here: Hague's announcement came amid reports of clashes in the city of Baquba just 37 miles (60km) north of Baghdad, the closest the fighting has come to the Iraqi capital since jihadists led by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) took over most of northern part of the country last week. The prospect of Iraq breaking up has forced the US and Britain to look to Iran. Hague said on Tuesday that the circumstances were right to reopen the British embassy in Tehran once 'a range of practical issues' were resolved. The embassy closed in 2011 after being ransacked by a mob protesting against sanctions. Hague, however, has said that there was no prospect of a British military intervention, although counter-terrorism support could be offered. A Ministry of Defence (MoD) team has been sent to Iraq to assist embassy staff in contingency planning.﻿ Hague says his primary concern in reopening the Tehran embassy is that staff will be safe and secure. It will be a small embassy, with only a core team, until the situation allows for it to build up, Hague says. Alexander asks what pressure the UK is putting on the Russian government to engage with the leadership in Ukraine. Hague says the western world has sent a \"very strong message\" that Russia must engage with new Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. Alexander presses Hague on the status of talks with Iran about its nuclear capabilities. There is no plan to move the deadline – 20 July – Hague says. Iran needs to be realistic in its negotiations. Douglas Alexander, shadow foreign secretary, welcomes the reopening of the embassy in Tehran. What is the foreign secretary's thinking on how engagement with Iran over the conflict in Iraq could help the situation in Syria, he asks. Hague says he hopes there will be a wider knock-on effect. Iran could have a positive role across the region; it has played a sectarian, divisive role in the past. An improvement in relations between Iran and its neighbours would be of huge importance in defusing tension in the region, Hague says. On to Iran. Hague says the UK is \"absolutely relentless\" in efforts to defeat terrorism. There is no softening of policies towards Iran, he says. But it is important to discuss issues such as nuclear weapons with Iran, and we need the channels to do so, he says. Labour MP Keith Vaz asks how the minister would describe British values. This uncomfortable task falls to Hugo Swire. He says so many people want to come to Britain because of its \"excellent\" economy and mentions Cameron's favourite slogan: #longtermeconomicplan The next question concerns human rights abuses in Honduras. Hugo Swire, foreign office minister, says he is travelling to Geneva tomorrow and will call on the UN to do more. Back to foreign office questions in the Commons. William Hague is now talking about the situation in Israel and Palestine. He says the UK has a longstanding recognition of Israel but wants to see a two-state solution. The UK government continues to press both sides to reach a solution, he says: time is running out. If the opportunity is not seized, he says, \"the outlook will be very, very bleak\" over the next few years. Meanwhile, the Queen is meeting Chinese premier Li Keqiang – I've grabbed this from Sky News: The next questions are about Boko Haram and what the UK government is doing to aid the international effort against it. Mark Simmonds, foreign office minister, says the UK maintains its support for girls' education, as well as providing practical support to the Nigerian government. William Hague is now in the Commons to answer foreign office questions. The first question from Richard Drax, who says it's important that the UK remains a united nation, with reference to the upcoming Commonwealth games. Sir Menzies Campbell, former Lib Dem leader, reminds him that the UK's constituent parts also take part in sports as individual nations. We would expect some Iran-based questions during this session too. It's notable that Hague's statement on the reopening of the UK embassy in Iran makes no mention at all of Iraq, Isis or the current crisis. He does say that \"Iran is an important country in a volatile region\", but the statement seems to be presented more as a logical next step after the appointment of the non-resident chargé d'affaires late last year, and the restoration of direct diplomatic contacts in February. My colleague Saeed Kamali Dehghan wrote then: Since Hassan Rouhani took office as Iran's new president, Britain and Iran have upgraded ties and taken significant steps towards reopening their missions. David Cameron and Rouhani also spoke on the phone in November in the first direct contact between a British prime minister and an Iranian president in a decade … The flag of the Islamic republic of Iran [has been raised] over the Iranian embassy in London as the mission is giving a limited consular service. The embassy is not yet officially reopened and permanent Iranian national staff are not yet stationed in London. A British embassy plaque will instead go up soon, plus an 'Embassy Closed' sign. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has come out fighting against claims in the Sun today (paywall) that he has employed four people on zero-hours contracts over the last year. This is potentially embarrassing as Labour has pledged to end the \"epidemic\" of zero-hours contracts and Ed Miliband has, of course, not had an easy relationship with the Sun in recent days, apologising after he was pictured holding a copy of the paper's World Cup promotional issue. Balls has rejected the claims. A spokesperson for the shadow chancellor said: On the advice of IPSA we use their casual contracts solely to allow us to pay the living wage to interns and students on temporary placements. Labour’s policy is to tackle the exploitative use of zero-hours contracts, for example by ensuring that employees who have worked regular hours over a year automatically get a fixed hours contract. I've taken the quote from Labour List. My colleague Mark Tran has now filed this story on the civil servant fired for making offensive comments about the Hillsborough tragedy from his government computer. You can read the article here. It is not yet clear when the UK embassy in Tehran could open. Hague admits there are \"a range of practical issues\" that will have to be resolved before the embassy – which was closed in 2011 – could operate again. In his written statement to MPs, Hague says: It is our intention to reopen the embassy in Tehran with a small initial presence as soon as these practical arrangements have been made. Inevitably, the initial embassy presence will only able to offer a limited range of services at first. For the time being, Iranians will still need to apply in Abu Dhabi or Istanbul for visas for travel to the UK. But encouraging people to people contact is an important priority and something that I hope we will be able to make progress on as the embassy grows in size and capability over the following months. Last year the foreign office named the head of its Iran department, Ajay Sharma, as its non-resident chargé d'affaires for Iran. Sharma travelled to Iran in December 2013, in the first diplomatic visit by a UK envoy in two years. For those whose eyesight isn't quite up to reading the grainy image of Hague's written statement posted below (my own included), Press Association has this take on the announcement: William Hague has announced that Britain's embassy in Iran will be reopened as the West looks to Tehran to help ease the crisis in neighbouring Iraq. The foreign secretary said the 'circumstances are right' to restore the diplomatic base after a significant thawing in relations over recent months. 'Our two primary concerns when considering whether to reopen our embassy in Tehran have been assurance that our staff would be safe and secure, and confidence that they would be able to carry out their functions without hindrance,' Hague told MPs in a written statement. 'There has never been any doubt in my mind that we should have an embassy in Tehran if the circumstances allowed. 'Iran is an important country in a volatile region, and maintaining embassies around the world, even under difficult conditions, is a central pillar of the UK's global diplomatic approach. 'I have therefore now decided the circumstances are right to reopen our embassy in Tehran.' David Cameron is cheered by the latest inflation figures, not least because it gives him the opportunity to use his favourite hashtag: Here is the text of Hague's written statement (via @rosschawkins): We will presumably hear more detail on when this might happen in Hague's full statement at 11.30am. My colleague Simon Tisdall offers some words of caution ahead of William Hague's statement on Iran later this morning. You can read his comments in full on the Middle East live blog. Here's a taster: ﻿Much that is being represented as new has already happened for example the appointment by both countries of non-resident charges d'affaires; exchange visits; and stated intention of resuming ties. The Iran embassy in London is not open now, and Hague is not going to announce the sudden opening of our embassy in Tehran, but the plan is to do so by the end of the year, or possibly sooner now due to Iraq. What Hague is doing is flying wing man for Obama, by strengthening an existing channel for indirect US-Iran contacts – Britain has traditionally acted as a conduit for the US in Tehran since the Americans left in 1980. Cabinet office minister Francis Maude said users of government computers are being \"reminded of their responsibilities\" and social media guidance is being updated, after a civil servant was fired after making offensive comments about the Hillsborough tragedy from the government network. Maude said: These incidents have given rise to questions about the Government Secure Intranet, about the way in which the internet is accessed from Government and its use recorded, and about social media policies in departments. We will continue to encourage and enable civil servants to use the internet and social media, as essential tools enabling them to work openly and to be connected to the society they serve. But the misuse of social media is unacceptable and carries consequences. We will be reminding all civil servants of their responsibilities and updating social media guidance. I would like to thank the families themselves for their patience during the weeks it has taken to bring this matter to a conclusion. I was deeply distressed that, at a time when the hearings of the Hillsborough inquests were unfolding, the civil service was brought into disrepute by these edits. No one should be in any doubt of the government's position regarding the Hillsborough disaster and its support for the families of the 96 victims and all those affected by the tragedy. However, efforts to find other potential culprits are being abandoned, Maude said: There are substantial technical obstacles to investigating the other edits. The deletion of internet data logs in the ordinary course of business means that tracing historic edits to a particular department, building or individual has proved extremely difficult. In the absence of other specific leads, and despite a great deal of forensic and other work, it has not been possible to identify the originators of the 2009 edit or any of the others in question. Subject to further information or leads coming to light, the investigation into the edits is therefore concluded. And some more inflationary news: UK house prices have leapt by 9.9% in the 12 months to April to reach a new high of £260,000 typically, Office for National Statistics figures show. The full ONS release is here. My colleague Graeme Wearden on the business live blog offers this on the inflation figures just published: ﻿Just in: the UK inflation rate has fallen to just 1.5% in May, down from 1.8% in April, and the lowest reading since October 2009. That's much lower than expected – economists had expected a reading of 1.7%. And the retail prices index (the wider measure of inflation) also fell, to 2.4% from 2.5%. The rate of consumer price index inflation fell to 1.5% in May from 1.8% in April; retail price index inflation fell to 2.4% from 2.5% in the same period. The Telegraph investigation into the civil servant's Wikipedia edits and how he was tracked down is here. It quotes Margaret Aspinall, chair of Hillsborough Family Support Group, saying: We had a meeting on Friday evening and all the families agreed that his name should be withheld. He has been sacked, and we all took the decision not to name him because social media can be very unpleasant. The most important thing is that this has been dealt with and it has not been covered up. He has been punished. The sacking follows a Cabinet Office investigation into claims that insults which were sent to the victims and families of the Hillsborough disaster were sent from government computers. The Liverpool Echo said it had discovered that text on the Wikipedia page of the disaster had been changed from computers within Whitehall. It said that in 2009, \"Blame Liverpool Fans\" was added to the page, while in 2012 the phrase \"You'll never walk alone\" was changed to \"You'll never walk again\" and other insulting variations. This report has just been filed by the Press Association: A civil servant has been sacked for making offensive Wikipedia edits about the Hillsborough disaster, but efforts to find other culprits are being abandoned, Francis Maude said today. A junior administrator has been identified as being behind posts in 2012 and fired for gross misconduct, the Cabinet Office minister said. The 24-year-old, born in London but based in Liverpool, changed the phrase 'You'll never walk alone', the anthem of Liverpool FC, to read: 'You'll never walk again'. He was tracked down after the Daily Telegraph and internet group Wikipediocracy cross-referenced his social media history and work records. Maude said in a statement to MPs: 'Extensive further inquiries were taken forward as a Civil Service disciplinary matter, involving potential breaches of the Civil Service Code and of individual departments' policies on acceptable behaviour. 'An individual was then subject to a formal disciplinary investigation and dismissed for gross misconduct, on the grounds of responsibility for the 2012 edits.' Here's a quick rundown of what we can expect to see today: • 9.30am: official inflation figures for May are published. There will be much more on that on the business blog, with economists predicting that inflation will have slowed. • 11.30am: Hague statement to the Commons on cooperation with Iran (more here). • 2.45pm: Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh and PCS union give evidence to the home affairs committee about the applications backlog. • 3:45pm: David Cameron holds a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang; we'll get the official photocall a bit earlier. • 4pm: The busy home affairs committee takes evidence on the so-called Trojan horse affair. Lee Donaghy, the assistant principal of Park View school in Birmingham, one of those slammed by Ofsted last week; and Sir Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham city council will give evidence. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog. It's Claire Phipps today, stepping in for Andrew Sparrow. This morning's main action will be foreign secretary William Hague's further statement to the Commons about the crisis in Iraq. Yesterday Hague told MPs that the UK was not considering military intervention, but pledged humanitarian assistance as well as advice to the Iraqi government on counter-terror measures. In a key strategic move, Hague will today announce that the UK is deepening its diplomatic ties with Iran, leading to the reopening of the UK embassy in Tehran, as part of an effort to increase leverage over the besieged Maliki government in Iraq. Iran has been supporting the Shia-led Maliki government. That statement is expected around 11.30am. I will cover it here. You can also track developments in Iraq in our Middle East live blog here. I will post a round-up of today's other political news shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/19/cost-nuclear-power-debate-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-18T23:05:35Z","webTitle":"Ministers refuse to attend debate on price of nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/19/cost-nuclear-power-debate-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/19/cost-nuclear-power-debate-government","fields":{"headline":"Ministers refuse to attend debate on price of nuclear power","bodyText":"The government has refused an invitation to attend a public debate on the cost of new nuclear power today, which will be attended by industry figures, academics and many other interested parties. Paul Dorfman, a senior research associate at Warwick University and the event's organiser, said it showed ministers were scared about the cost to consumers and taxpayers of nuclear power. Companies at the forefront of plans to build new reactors, such as EDF and Centrica, have said they will attend the meeting at Portcullis House, next to the Houses of Parliament. But the Office for Nuclear Development (OND) – an arm of the Department of Energy and Climate Change – said: \"On this occasion ministers and officials have decided not to attend.\" Dorfman said the OND had offered to talk through the issues but insisted this happened in private. \"The government do not want to be challenged in public. I think it is reasonable to assume that they are deeply concerned about their position and know reactors cannot be built at a competitive cost without public subsidies.\" Based on the industry's track record, there is good reason to be sceptical about the economics of nuclear power, even before the debacle in Finland. The last reactor constructed in Britain was Sizewell B in Suffolk. It was originally budgeted to cost about £1.9bn but eventually came in at about £3bn. The cash was all provided by the public sector – half of it being taken from the nuclear levy that was created to help cover decommissioning and waste disposal costs. There have also been financial – and technical problems – with other plants such as the mixed oxide (Mox) and Thorp fuel reprocessing facilities at Sellafield, the UK's largest atomic complex. Mox was meant to cost £265m but ended up costing £490m within three years. It produced only 5.2 tonnes of reprocessed fuel between 2001 and 2007, despite an promised annual output of 120 tonnes. The government has also promised nuclear developers that taxpayers will meet any of their cost overruns from decommissioning the new reactors and storing the waste. Officials are in charge of setting a fixed price for the waste and experts are setting it deliberately high to factor in any cost overrun. But Gordon MacKerron, who up to 2007 was chairman of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, set up by the government to work out how to deal with the UK's nuclear waste, admits that it will be decades before we know for sure what the bill is and whether the taxpayer will have to pay more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jan/24/bedouin-tribesmen-egyptian-tourist-resort","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-24T14:46:26Z","webTitle":"Bedouin tribesmen storm Egyptian tourist resort","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/24/bedouin-tribesmen-egyptian-tourist-resort","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jan/24/bedouin-tribesmen-egyptian-tourist-resort","fields":{"headline":"Bedouin tribesmen storm Egyptian tourist resort","bodyText":"Bedouin tribesmen have stormed a tourist resort in the Sinai peninsula in an effort to reclaim land – the latest in a string of conflicts between the Egyptian state and local communities emboldened by the revolution. Egyptian media reports said dozens of gunmen took control of Aqua-Sun, a Red Sea hotel complex boasting 2km of private beaches to the south of Taba, and were demanding 4m Egyptian pounds (£425,000) in exchange for leaving the site peacefully. No tourists were staying in the resort at the time, and although several Egyptian security guards were taken hostage during the incident their lives are not believed to be in danger. Disputes over land have been common in the Sinai ever since the central government embarked on a mass \"Red Sea Riviera\" programme of resort construction along the eastern coast in the 1990s. Customary law was replaced by a new system of land ownership, and large swaths of previously bedouin-controlled coastal areas were sold to private investors under the auspices of the state, leading to allegations by some locals that they were being cheated out of their property. Egyptian officials said it would be difficult to mount any police or military response given the constraints imposed upon Egypt as a result of its peace treaty with Israel, which regulates the amount of security personnel the government can deploy to this sensitive border region. The relationship between the two countries became a significant political issue during the recent Egyptian parliamentary election campaign, but no major party has seriously suggested withdrawing from the 1978 Camp David accord. The Aqua-Sun occupation is the latest example of Egypt's military government being challenged by communities in different corners of the country. From water shortages to factory pollution, long-held grievances have bubbled to the surface as a result of the ongoing revolution, which has intensified popular expectations of social justice. Many groups, including some bedouin tribes, believe national political instability has offered them a unique opportunity to drive home their claims. \"The bedouin are among the many marginalised groups in Egypt pressing for their rights since the revolution began last year,\" Elijah Zarwan, a Cairo-based political analyst, said. \"There's long been a security vacuum in the Sinai and now on top of that you have a more generalised security vacuum throughout Egypt. It's no wonder that the bedouins, who are often well-armed, feel emboldened to press for their rights more forcefully.\" Earlier this month, residents in the Mediterranean coastal town of Dabaa broke through the security perimeter of a large, government-owned site earmarked for a future nuclear power plant and blew up several buildings, including one believed to be the reactor, that were under construction. The Mubarak-era nuclear project has long attracted fierce opposition from members of the community, who say they have been deceived by the authorities on multiple occasions and are now intent on reclaiming the land for themselves. Last week, it emerged that some protesters had stolen radioactive material from the site following clashes between security forces and protesters in which dozens were injured. On Monday, the government vowed to press ahead with the nuclear plant, warning locals against any more \"violations of state-owned property\". Meanwhile, preparations for Wednesday's highly-anticipated anniversary, which will mark one year since Egypt's revolution began, are continuing. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which took power following the fall of Hosni Mubarak last February and has since itself become a target for revolutionaries, has announced plans for a range of official celebrations including military parades, air shows, a specially-commissioned operetta and the distribution of prize coupons to citizens on the streets. But anti-junta demonstrators have vowed to ignore the planned events and instead hold large protests calling for an end to military rule. \"We are not going down to the streets to celebrate,\" Ahmed Emam, a member of the Popular Alliance party, insisted at a press conference last week. \"We are going down to continue our revolution. We will not celebrate while the blood of the martyrs hasn't dried yet.\" In recent days, the authorities have begun bolstering security at places expected to be a target for the revolutionaries, including central Cairo's state television building by the Nile. Some high-end hotels in the city are boarding up their windows in expectation of violent clashes, and several airlines have cancelled flights to Egypt on the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/16/fukushima-cold-shutdown-japanese-pm1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-16T12:05:39Z","webTitle":"Fukushima is in cold shutdown, says Japanese prime minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/16/fukushima-cold-shutdown-japanese-pm1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/16/fukushima-cold-shutdown-japanese-pm1","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima is in cold shutdown, says Japanese prime minister","bodyText":"Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has declared an end to the most critical phase of the accident at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, but conceded that the crisis is far from over. In a nationally televised address on Friday, Noda said the plant had been brought to a state of \"cold shutdown\", a significant step towards resolving the crisis, nine months after it was struck by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that left almost 20,000 people dead and missing along the country's north-east coast. Cold shutdown is achieved when the temperature of water used to cool nuclear fuel rods remains below boiling point and radiation emitted by the reactors is no higher than the government-set limit for the public of one millisieverts a year. In April, the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said it aimed to stabilise the reactors by the end of the year, but it managed to bring water temperatures to below boiling point for the first time in September. Officials say that the temperatures inside reactors number one to three, which all suffered meltdown, now range from 38C to 68C. Noda apologised for the anxiety the nuclear accident – the world's worst since Chernobyl 25 years ago – had caused before paying tribute to the thousands of workers, soldiers and firefighters who had risked their health battling to bring the plant under control. He said radiation levels at the plant's boundary could be kept at low levels, even in the case of an \"unforeseen incident\". But he was unable to offer a date for the return of any of the 80,000 residents evacuated from a 12-mile radius of the plant in the immediate aftermath of the accident, when three of six reactors suffered core meltdown. \"Our ultimate aim remains to get people back to their homes and resume the lives they had before the accident as quickly as possible,\" he said. The government, he added, would do its best to decommission the plant now that it has been stabilised. \"The government is due to set a clear road map and will do the utmost to decommission the plant,\" he told reporters. Decommissioning will be a time-consuming and expensive process; estimates put the cost at between 1.15 trillion yen (£9.5bn) and 4 trillion yen. The government has conceded that workers will not be able to start removing the molten fuel from the three worst-hit reactors for another 10 years. They plan to remove spent fuel from four storage pools within the next two years, reports said. Tepco must also find a way to treat and dispose of an estimated 90,000 tonnes of contaminated seawater that has been used to cool the reactors. The operation to cool nuclear fuel rods and prevent further radiation leaks into the sea and atmosphere has suffered several setbacks. Earlier this month, for example, Tepco said about 45 tonnes of highly radioactive water had leaked through a crack in the wall of a treatment facility. On Thursday, government officials said it could take as long as 40 years to decommission the plant and decontaminate an area of about 930 square miles (2400 sq km). Experts have warned that another strong earthquake or tsunami could damage the plant's makeshift cooling system and set off a second crisis. The government is expected to review the evacuation of at least some of the residents forced to abandon their homes in the hours after the tsunami on 11 March. Those living closest to the plant have been told their former neighbourhoods could remain uninhabitable for decades. The crisis has taken a huge financial toll on Tepco, which has been criticised for its haphazard initial response to the accident and its handling of compensation claims. Reports said the government was preparing to inject $13bn into the firm, a de facto nationalisation designed to keep it afloat as it compensates victims and begins the clean-up operation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/01/japanese-mp-drinks-water-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-01T14:09:09Z","webTitle":"Japanese MP drinks Fukushima water under pressure from journalists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/01/japanese-mp-drinks-water-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/01/japanese-mp-drinks-water-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Japanese MP drinks Fukushima water under pressure from journalists","bodyText":"It was a simple gulp of water, but one that Japan's government hopes will carry symbolic importance as it seeks to ease concern over decontamination efforts at the scene of the country's nuclear crisis. Yasuhiro Sonoda, an MP in the governing Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), was visibly nervous as his lips met a glass of water collected from inside two reactor buildings at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 44-year-old had been cajoled into making the gesture by journalists who repeatedly asked him to substantiate government claims that decontamination efforts at the plant were progressing. Sonoda's hands shook as he half-filled the glass from a plastic bottle, before polishing off the water in two swift gulps. He briefly held the glass up to the cameras, as if to prove that no sleight of hand had been involved. Despite his reticence, Sonoda was not engaging in an act of masochism: the water in question, while once radioactive, had been stripped of radioactive iodine and caesium-134 and -137. Its source, reactors Nos 5 and 6, suffered less contamination than other units at the plant. Sonoda, parliamentary secretary at the cabinet office, said his gesture was no publicity stunt: \"I am aware that just drinking [the treated water] doesn't in itself mean that safety has been confirmed. The best way to do that is to present data to the public.\" The cleanup effort at Fukushima Daiichi has been complicated by the buildup of massive quantities of contaminated water in and around the complex. Its operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], has started treating the water but is running out of places in which to store it. Water from the reactors that were the source of Sonoda's drink is being used to spray trees to limit the buildup of dust and prevent fires. But, according to officials, it was never intended for human consumption. He was making good on a promise delivered in response to a challenge posed Yu Terasawa, a well-known freelance journalist, at a press conference last month. Sonoda reportedly said at the time: \"I don't want it to be seen as some kind of performance, but if that's the best way to prove that the water is safe then I would gladly drink it right here, in front of you, any time.\" He wasn't the first Japanese politician to demonstrate his faith in the safety of food and water amid widespread concern about the presence of radioactive substances in beef and other produce from Fukushima prefecture.

The sage of Omaha was making a trip postponed after March's devastating earthquake and tsunami. He flew in by helicopter to Iwaki City in northeast Japan, 40km from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Buffett posed for photographs with workers from the plant and held a sign saying \"Never give up, Fukushima\". The nearby nuclear power station leaked radiation after being hit by the earthquake and tsunami. He also visited Tungaloy's plant. Buffett bought a 71.5% stake in Tungaloy, which makes manufacting tools used in car production, in 2008. Buffett told Reuters he was looking for opportunities in the country, as he reiterated his view that the fundamental strengths of the Japanese economy had not changed as a result of its devastating natural disaster. He also told CNBC that Europe's debt crisis had illustrated a \"major flaw\" in the eurozone. \"There is a major flaw in the euro system. I do know the system as presently designed has a major flaw and that flaw won't be corrected just by words.\" Buffett also said the crisis was creating opportunities in European equity valuations. \"We bought Tesco earlier. I can think of a dozen euro stocks that are attractive … there are stocks I like and wonderful businesses. I could buy more Tesco if the price came down.\" It emerged last week that Buffett had made an $11bn (£7bn) investment in IBM. His name is also frequently mentioned as a possible provider of new capital for European banks – although he said on Monday that he was unsure how the eurozone debt crisis would end, and that his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway was not considering a direct European investment. Buffett said earlier this year that the disaster in Japan had created a buying opportunity. \"Frequently, something out of the blue like this, an extraordinary event, really creates a buying opportunity. I have seen that happen in the United States, I have seen that happen around the world. I don't think Japan will be an exception,\" he said. The trip has raised hopes in the country that he could invest further. Bloomberg quoted Shuhei Abe, president of Tokyo-based Sparx Group, Asia's second-biggest hedge fund, saying there were \"expectations that Mr Buffett may invest more in Japan\". He said: \"The fact that a renowned investor like Mr Buffett is actually coming all the way to Japan and to the very place where it became the centre of the disaster means a lot and may shine a light.\" Separately, it emerged that Buffett will allow investment analysts to ask questions at the annual Berkshire Hathaway annual general meeting. The Wall Street Journal has named the three analysts as Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital, Cliff Gallant of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods and Gary Ransom of Dowling &amp; Partners. It will be the first time in years Buffett has talked publicly with analysts about Berkshire's performance. \"We're trying to broaden the conversation,\" he said. Carmaker Toyota meanwhile has said it had restored vehicle output in Japan to \"near-normal levels\", after flooding in Thailand disrupted the company's supply chain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/12/nuclear-safety-worries-spread-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-12T23:53:53Z","webTitle":"Nuclear safety worries spread to Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/12/nuclear-safety-worries-spread-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/12/nuclear-safety-worries-spread-europe","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear safety worries spread to Europe","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of people have taken part in an anti-nuclear demonstration in southern Germany. The demonstration had been planned for some time, but after the news of Japan's nuclear emergency, organisers were overwhelmed by crowds of around 50,000 people who turned up. The demonstrators, who stretched in a 45km chain from Neckarwestheim power plant to the city of Stuttgart, were demanding that the German government move away from nuclear power. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has extended the lifespan of Germany's nuclear power plants, summoned senior cabinet ministers to an emergency meeting. The Japanese radiation leak comes at a difficult time for Merkel, whose conservatives face three state elections in March where worries over nuclear safety could rally her opponents. The opposition Social Democrats and Greens have called for change and claim several German nuclear plants could not withstand a direct hit by an aircraft or an earthquake. \"We cannot master nature, nature rules us,\" said Renate Kuenast, the Greens' parliamentary leader. The government's decision last year to keep Germany's 17 nuclear plants running for about 12 years beyond their original shutdown date has weighed on the popularity of Merkel's coalition. In Italy a senior government politician said the earthquake would not change plans to move ahead with a new nuclear power scheme. Italy is the only G8 industrialised nation that does not produce nuclear power, but prime minister Silvio Berlusconi wants to generate a quarter of the country's electricity from nuclear in the future. Italy is also at high risk of suffering natural disasters, mainly due to earthquakes. \"The position remains what it is, you can't keep changing it,\" Fabrizio Cicchitto, leader of Berlusconi's PDL party in the lower house told reporters. \"It's not just recently that we have energy problems,\" he said. In the UK the energy secretary Chris Huhne said the government was monitoring the nuclear situation in Japan. \"It's too early to say what the cause was, let alone what the implications are. We are working extremely closely with the IAEA to establish what has happened. Safety is the number one priority for the nuclear industry.\" Privately, many in government and the private energy sector in the UK are worried that the raising of the spectre of nuclear disaster will have implications for the coalition's huge building programme for ten new power stations to replace the UK's ageing reactors. The accident in Japan comes days after the Navy admitted the reactors on British submarines are 'significantly below benchmarked good practice', and weeks before the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, which will push fears over nuclear safety back to the forefront of the minds of the British public. Jan Beranek, head of Greenpeace International Nuclear Campaign, asked for the construction project to be scrapped in the wake of the Japanese earthquake. \"Governments should invest in renewable energy resources that are not only environmentally sound but also affordable and reliable,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/jan/27/nuclear-waste-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-27T08:00:03Z","webTitle":"'Sellafield is where we house the toxic legacy of our failed nuclear industry'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jan/27/nuclear-waste-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/jan/27/nuclear-waste-legacy","fields":{"headline":"'Sellafield is where we house the toxic legacy of our failed nuclear industry'","bodyText":"There are many uncertainties about the renaissance of nuclear power in the UK, particularly surrounding the level of public subsidy, but one thing remains constant: the industry's waste problem hasn't gone away. The clean-up of nuclear legacy waste at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant – a site historically plagued with mismanagement and technical difficulties – is running behind schedule, according to the 2009-10 annual report from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which was quietly released in December. The safe removal and treatment of legacy waste has failed to hit the targetsdue to \"factors including deteriorating building structures, uncertain material inventories and difficult working conditions,\" the report says. The consolidation of \"legacy sludges\" in a storage pond are running behind, and the report gives no explanation for the delay. An NDA statement says: \"Dealing with these facilities is the most challenging and complex task within the current decommissioning mission. The facilities date back to the early days of the civil nuclear industry and the nature of the materials they house and the facilities themselves all present major challenges in planning a detailed work programme.\" On the specific clean-up delays, the statement said assessing the state of the facilities and undertaking repair and reinforcement work were part of the explanation. Experts in the field say the ongoing problems at Sellafield are worrying, especially in light of the possibility of waste that will be created from new-build nuclear. \"Sellafield is a national disgrace. Sellafield is where we house the toxic legacy of our failed nuclear industry,\" said Paul Dorfman from the University of Warwick, who has worked extensively on radiation and nuclear waste issues with the government and industry. \"The history of waste storage in Sellafield is vast and complex and it's only recently that the NDA had to ask for further billions from the Department for Energy and Climate Change to make safe elements of our waste storage. We're not talking about bells and whistles here, we're talking about things that really need to be done.\" Prof Andrew Blowers from the Open University became involved in the nuclear waste debate as a councillor in 1983, when a nuclear waste dump was proposed in Bedfordshire. \"The trouble with Sellafield is that it is a great big hybrid facility. Even just as a lay-person you can see it is just in a dreadful state ... I believe it to be the most dangerous spot in the world because of the pure concentration of stuff on the site. You have highly active liquid waste in tanks stored at Sellafield bubbling away. You have a platform above it and you have a load of pipework above it. I mean the risks at Sellafield are massive.\" Blowers was a member of the first independent Committee on Radioactive Waste Management in 2003 and heavily involved in developing policies for dealing with nuclear waste. He is critical of the way those policies have been adopted by the government and the nuclear industry. \"Waste is clearly now one of their major difficulties. You have to have a scientifically robust and publicly acceptable solution,\" he says. The setbacks in dealing with the legacy waste come as the government's commitment to new-build nuclear appears to be intensifying, with revelations recently that funds from the green investment bank could used. The eight new nuclear power stations being proposed have no place in the UK, in Blowers's view, unless the real scale and impact of the waste and how it is to be dealt with is made clear to the public, and progress is made on dealing with legacy waste. The approaches being considered by the government to manage new waste include geological disposal, which involves burying waste in underground rock formations, longer term storage on nuclear sites themselves, and disposing of low-level waste in landfill sites – a plan that has encountered fierce opposition from locals at the first proposed site in King's Cliffe, Northamptonshire. He said proposals for storing waste longer term on site should be more explicitly discussed before new reactors are developed on sites. \"I don't think the process will be fair. I think the problem is that waste has been almost covertly dealt with because new build implies something completely different. Waste will be stored on the sites, which hasn't really been done before and the public is completely unaware.\" Prof Gordon Mackerron, the director of the science and technology policy research unit at the University of Sussex and who chaired the original Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, agrees that the consequences of creating more nuclear waste have not been properly addressed and debated. \"The government has proposed a requirement that they store nuclear waste on site for a very long period, and why that's politically important is that spent fuel has been moved off to Sellafield as soon as it was feasible to do so in the past.\" The consultation process on how to deal with nuclear waste and new nuclear plants across the country has been clearly lacking, according to both Blowers and Mackerron. \"What they're actually saying implicitly is that we don't care about the far future. Essentially they make it up as they go along. We have been calling very vigorously for another proper consultation. The consultation that they've been going through [which started in September 2010] has been pretty farcical,\" said Blowers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/24/japan-nuclear-plant-workers-hospital","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-25T00:42:00Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear plant workers in hospital after radiation exposure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/24/japan-nuclear-plant-workers-hospital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/24/japan-nuclear-plant-workers-hospital","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear plant workers in hospital after radiation exposure","bodyText":"The dangers facing workers battling to avert disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were underlined on Thursday when three men were exposed to high levels of radiation after stepping in contaminated water. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), admitted that the workers had not measured radioactivity levels before beginning work, and that two, who are being treated for radiation burns, were not wearing protective boots. The two more seriously injured men were diagnosed with possible beta ray burns and were due to be taken to a special unit at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba, east of Tokyo, Japan's nuclear safety agency said. The injuries are similar to regular burns, but can lead to serious complications over a period of several weeks. Tests on the workers, who are all in their 20s and 30s, showed they were exposed to between 170 millisieverts (mSv) and 180 mSv of radiation while laying cable in the basement of the No 3 reactor's turbine building. That is above the usual legal limit of 100 mSv per year for nuclear power workers in Japan, but below a new limit of 250 mSv, introduced soon after the nuclear crisis began to enable them to spend more time inside the crippled facility. The two hospitalised men, employees of a Tepco affiliate, were part of a team of six workers attempting to connect a water pump to the power supply and restart the supply of fresh water in an attempt to cool the reactor. Workers in the first and basement floors of the No 3 reactor's turbine building were ordered to evacuate the area after the accident. Japan's nuclear safety agency said water had probably seeped through their protective clothing, allowing radioactive materials to stick to their skin, as they stood in a 15cm-deep puddle. The two injured men were wearing shoes, while the third had boots on and so escaped serious injury. Radiation levels on the surface of the puddle were later measured at 400 mSv per hour, while the level in the air reached 200 mSv per hour. The source of the water was not immediately clear. Tepco said no puddle had been spotted in the turbine building the previous day. Fire trucks have been dousing the reactor in recent days in an attempt to cool a storage pool for spent fuel rods. The accident cast doubt on Tepco's ability to properly monitor radioactivity at the site. \"This kind of exposure, from water, was unforeseen,\" the government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, told reporters. \"Atmospheric radiation levels are monitored constantly, but in this case the workers stepped into water. We are trying to find out exactly what happened so we can ensure it doesn't happen again.\" Edano said the injuries were \"very regrettable\", but defended the health ministry's decision to raise the exposure limit for teams of workers soon after the start of the world's worst nuclear power emergency since Chernobyl. \"The decision to increase permissible radiation exposure was taken on the advice of experts, who say that workers are able to withstand up to 250 mSv per year before radiation has an effect on their health,\" Edano said. He conceded that the emergency at Fukushima would lead to a review of Japan's heavy dependence on nuclear power. \"It is certain that public confidence in nuclear power plants has greatly changed,\" Edano told Reuters. \"In light of that, we must first end this situation and then study from a zero base.\" More than 20 workers have been injured at the Fukushima plant, 150 miles north of Tokyo, since it was badly damaged in the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. They include 11 who were hurt when the No 3 reactor building exploded. To date, 17 have been exposed to radiation exceeding 100 mSv at the plant, though none has been exposed to contamination exceeding the accumulative 250 mSv limit. The condition of the No 3 unit is of particular concern as it contains plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel and would release highly toxic plutonium in the event of a meltdown. On Wednesday afternoon, workers were temporarily evacuated from the plant after black smoke was seen rising from the same reactor. The smoke receded after an hour and radiation levels remained unchanged, the safety agency said. The release of radioactive substances from the plant continued to cause anxiety in Tokyo. Wednesday's warning that radioactive iodine levels in the capital's tap water had exceeded levels considered safe for babies prompted a rush of people buying bottled water. The warning was lifted on Thursday after iodine-131 dropped to safe levels, but they were still above the safe upper limit for infants in the neighbouring prefectures of Chiba and Saitama. In Tokyo, a city of 13 million people, supermarkets quickly ran out of bottled water; the metropolitan government said it would distribute an extra 240,000 bottles to families with infants. \"Customers ask us for water, but there's nothing we can do,\" Masayoshi Kasahara, a supermarket worker, said. \"We have asked for extra deliveries but we don't know when they will arrive.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/07/uk-emissions-rose-economy-recovered","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-07T11:13:29Z","webTitle":"UK emissions rose 3.1% as economy recovered in 2010","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/07/uk-emissions-rose-economy-recovered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/07/uk-emissions-rose-economy-recovered","fields":{"headline":"UK emissions rose 3.1% as economy recovered in 2010","bodyText":"The dramatic fall in the UK's greenhouse gas emissions caused by the recession has proved to be a blip, with national emissions rising 3.1% in 2010. The new energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, attributed the rise, the first in almost a decade, to increased home heating during a cold winter and shutdowns at nuclear power stations after technical problems. \"One year won't knock the UK off meeting its long-term emission reduction targets, but it serves to underline the importance of the coalition's policies for insulating homes to cut bills and emissions and moving to greener alternative forms of energy,\" said Davey, a Liberal Democrat who took over from Chris Huhne, who resigned on Friday after being charged over an alleged attempt to avoid prosecution for a speeding offence. On Sunday, a letter to the prime minister from over 100 Tory MPs was made public, which advocated cutting subsidies to renewable energy, despite renewable energy's role in reducing emissions. But environmental groups see the rise in emissions last year as a warning and said the sharp jump in home heating emissions showed the government had to increase the ambition of its home insulation plans, dubbed the \"green deal\". \"This was meant to be the decade when we slashed our emissions and sparked a green jobs bonanza, but instead we're seeing progress stalling,\" said Louise Hutchins from Greenpeace. \"The fact that rise is partly down to the cold snap in 2010 is no excuse, after all Sweden has colder winters but their bills are lower because they have better insulated homes. To copy their success the government's flagship green deal will need more resources, and that requires greater political ambition.\" Keith Allott, head of climate change at WWF-UK, said: \"If the government ever needed a wake-up call on greenhouse gas emissions here it is. \"It is alarming to see emissions from homes rising when people are struggling to pay their energy bills. The UK's overreliance on gas has pushed up emissions along with people's energy bills. It's a clear sign that the government needs to back investors in renewable energy and get us off the fossil fuel hook once and for all.\" The UK's carbon dioxide emissions, which are the tenth largest of any nation in the world, have been falling over the past 20 years as power stations used less coal and more gas to generate power. The rise in 2010, of 18m tonnes of carbon dioxide, follows a steep year-on-year fall of 8.7% in 2009 when the financial crisis hit as economic activity. The department of energy and climate change statistic, published on Tuesday, showed 11.8m tonnes of carbon dioxide came from the increased heating of homes, mainly by gas. Problems with the country's biggest reactor Sizewell B reactor in Suffolk, which meant it was shut down for six months in 2010, led to more coal and gas being burned. That added 5.6m tonnes to the UK's emissions of climate-warming gases. Other sectors, including business, agriculture and transport, remained all but unchanged. Despite the rise, the UK's emissions are about 23% lower than in 1990, the benchmark year for the nation's international commitments to tackle global warming under the Kyoto protocol, meaning the current Kyoto pledge has been comfortably met. A legally binding domestic target of cutting emissions 35% by 2020, compared with 1990 levels, also remains likely to be met. However, since 1990 manufacturing taking place in the UK has fallen sharply and goods imported from elsewhere have filled the gap. When the emissions linked to those imported goods are included, the UK's national carbon footprint has risen by 20%, though critics argue that the exporting country, which benefits from the employment, rightfully is responsible for these emissions. The Nasa climate scientist James Hansen has calculated that, in order to keep the global temperature rise within the 2C limit accepted by the world's nations, industrialised countries would have to cut their emissions by 6% a year from 2013 onwards. Andrew Simms of the New Economics Foundation said: \"The market set up to give incentives to cut carbon is not delivering in anything like the speed or scale necessary. The UK's 3% rise is so wrong, it takes the breath away.\" Historically, greenhouse gas emissions have move in lock-step with GDP, as higher economic activity uses more energy, which generates more emissions. The Stern review in 2006 of the economics of climate change calculated that a 1% change in GDP brings a 0.9% change in emissions. However, the 2010 data for the UK shows that the 3.1% in carbon emissions occurred with just 2.1% of GDP growth. • Get the Guardian's environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/27/windfarms-axed-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-27T09:48:00Z","webTitle":"Windfarms axed as UK loses its taste for turbines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/27/windfarms-axed-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/27/windfarms-axed-uk","fields":{"headline":"Windfarms axed as UK loses its taste for turbines","bodyText":"The government and energy industry have quietly shelved plans for windfarms equivalent to four large traditional coal and nuclear power stations, amid growing public and political anger over the cost and sight of the turbines. A report by the Electricity Networks Strategy Group (ENSG), which is the most up-to-date view of government officials, the regulator Ofgem, and leading industry investors, estimates that 28.3GW of onshore and offshore wind power may have been built by 2020. The estimate has fallen by 4GW in the two years since its last forecast. Another 1GW of other renewables such as tidal and wave power have also been removed from the forecast. There is also a big rise in the expected contribution from nuclear energy, by just over 5GW, allowing the government to still meet its pledge of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by a third by the end of the decade. In the same report, the officials warn that the cost of linking new power generation to the national distribution network has increased from £4.7bn to £8.8bn in just two years. Nearly all the extra cost is the money needed to connect wind and marine renewable energy from the Scottish islands to mainland Britain, and to transfer power from generators to consumers via two new undersea cables from Scotland to England and north to south Wales. The remainder is a £450m increase due to inflation. The figures, published on the website of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) (pdf) in the past few weeks but not publicised, come as political and public pressure grows over the cost of renewable energy through taxpayer subsidies and higher energy bills. In addition, MPs are concerned about opposition from local communities to the blight of onshore turbines. This month, a letter signed by more than 100 Conservative MPs urged the prime minister to further cut subsidies to onshore windfarms – beyond the planned 10% reduction already announced as the government consulted on the future of the system of Renewable Obligation Certificates, under which some forms of generation are entitled to extra payments to support emerging technologies. Despite ministers' assurances that the average household will pay less as a result of its policies, the Guardian also revealed this month that Decc's own unpublished analysis shows two out of three bill payers will pay more, while only a third will benefit from the energy savings and other measures which that will make their bills lower than they would have been without the policies. Decc said it was still committed to meeting the emissions reduction pledge and a separate EU target to produce 15% of the UK's energy from renewable sources by 2020. A department official also said it did not consider the ENSG report to be the \"best or full picture\" of future renewable energy, and preferred its own Renewable Energy Roadmap report published last summer. This gave a mid-range prediction of 31GW of installed generating wind power capacity by 2020. However, the ENSG membership – which includes the National Grid, Decc, generators and trade associations – and the fact that the government described it as a \"high-level forum\" intended to \"address key strategic issues\" for distributing renewable energy, will give credibility to its forecasts and cost estimates. Furthermore, Dr Robert Gross of Imperial College's respected UK Energy Research Centre said the ENSG report should be \"pretty balanced\" given that the National Grid, as a utility that generates more income from a bigger asset base, also has an interest in increasing investment rather than downplaying it, while Ofgem has a duty to keep prices low. Responding to the latest cost figures, Chris Heaton-Harris, the Tory MP who co-ordinated the letter to David Cameron, said: \"The more the true full cost of wind energy is exposed the more you have to ask why we continue to back such an expensive and intermittent source of energy. All this money ends up coming from consumers at the end of the day and this raises the question: how many people will be forced into fuel poverty because we continue with such a high level of direct and indirect subsidy to the wind industry?\" A Decc spokesman said: \"Estimates for future generation will vary over time, but Decc's renewable energy roadmap sets out the best view of the ranges of possible mixes for meeting our 2020 target. \"That said, [this] scenario has been compared to the renewable energy roadmap central range and, to quote ENSG, 'lies at the upper end of that range for all renewable generation sources'. \"We specifically don't dictate to the market exactly what the share of each technology will be. But in any future scenario, whatever the level of demand, we intend to meet the UK commitment to meet 15% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources.\" The pledge to supply 15% of energy from renewables can be met despite building less generating capacity partly because since the last analysis, aviation emissions – which would have to be offset by renewable electricity in the short term at least because of the difficulty of finding affordable alternatives to kerosene – have been removed from the calculations. The ENSG report also assumes 12% of heat and 10% of transport will be powered by renewables by 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2011/nov/05/lets-move-to-bridgwater-somerset","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-05T22:59:01Z","webTitle":"Let's move to Bridgwater, Somerset","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/nov/05/lets-move-to-bridgwater-somerset","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2011/nov/05/lets-move-to-bridgwater-somerset","fields":{"headline":"Let's move to Bridgwater, Somerset","bodyText":"What's going for it?

The country currently has Africa's sole nuclear plant, Koeberg, near Cape Town, which began generating electricity in 1984. It is surrounded by a private game reserve and has been targeted by environmental protesters. The three new nuclear stations – provisionally known as Nuclear 1, 2 and 3 – would each be able to deliver twice as much electricity as Koeberg, South Africa's Die Burger newspaper reported today. The report said details had emerged from an environmental impact study by the engineering consultancy Arcus Gibb, carried out on behalf of the government. The study suggested two new stations in Western Cape and one in Eastern Cape. A site next to the existing Koeberg power plant could be ready by January 2011, with construction of Nuclear 1 starting in 2012 and likely to take six years. The government wants to begin work at the same time on Nuclear 2 at Bantamsklip, south-east of Pearly Beach, and Nuclear 3 at Thyspunt near Cape St Francis in Eastern Cape, the impact study said. The project would create thousands of jobs and help to meet rising demand for power in South Africa. Since the end of apartheid, the governing African National Congress (ANC) has connected many townships to the grid for the first time. But more than a million people still live in shacks, often without access to electricity, a source of frustration that has contributed to this week's violent demonstrations over poor service delivery. There was an outcry last month when Eskom, the national electricity supplier, applied for a price increase of 34%. It currently operates 11 coal-fired power stations as well as Koeberg.. Eskom claims that Koeberg is \"vital\" for grid stability in the Cape. The two units there each produce about 20 tonnes of radioactive waste in 18-month cycles. Low and intermediate level waste is transported by road in steel and concrete containers to a remote disposal site in the Kalahari desert. High-grade radioactive waste is stored on site in steel rods about 3.7 metres long and as thin as an adult's little finger. Andrew Kenny, an independent engineer and energy specialist, said: \"Koeberg has wonderful safety mechanisms. The new nuclear power reactors are also extremely safe. It can be regarded as the safest industrial infrastructure existing in Cape provinces.\" In 2002, Greenpeace activists raided Koeberg from the sea in inflatable dinghies. Six climbed the five-storey seawater cooling pumphouse to hoist banners protesting against South Africa's use of nuclear power. Years earlier, while Koeberg was still under construction, members of the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), planted limpet mines at the unfinished power station. Four blasts rocked Koeberg over two days, delaying the commissioning of the plant for 18 months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/06/green-light","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-06T15:41:03Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: The race for the Arctic, reader pictures of meadows and Yellowstone oil spill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/06/green-light","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/06/green-light","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: The race for the Arctic, reader pictures of meadows and Yellowstone oil spill","bodyText":"Arctic special • Oil and gas spills in North Sea every week, papers reveal • Thawing Arctic opens up new shipping routes on the 'roof of the world' • Britain's richest man to build giant Arctic iron ore mine • Melting ice caps open up Arctic for 'white gold rush' Environment news • Yellowstone river oil spill spreads • EU votes against reducing carbon emissions by 30% • Japan faces power shortages due to nuclear shutdowns • UK government claims it has exceeded its own carbon reduction target • Sulphur from Chinese power stations 'masking' climate change Multimedia • Hay meadows: Your Green shoots photographs • The 'cold rush': industrialisation in the Arctic - interactive • The week in wildlife – in pictures On the blogs • Map lays bare landscape of UK in intimate detail • How I accidentally stole a bike • Why Norway cannot resist the lure of its buried natural treasure • Why thorium nuclear power shouldn't be written off Green living • What is the greenest pension? • Low carbon products in demand despite challenging economic climate • How can I help save our bees? ...And finally • The incinerator that doubles as ski slope in Copenhagen Architect Bjarke Ingels' latest project to transform an incinerator in heart of Copenhagen shows the playful side of sustainability"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2011/dec/08/ftse-nervousness-eu-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-08T17:35:38Z","webTitle":"FTSE falls 1% as nervousness grows ahead of EU summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/dec/08/ftse-nervousness-eu-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/dec/08/ftse-nervousness-eu-summit","fields":{"headline":"FTSE falls 1% as nervousness grows ahead of EU summit","bodyText":"With the European Central Bank not impressing the market and the results of the latest bank stress tests revealed, financial stocks came under renewed pressure. It was not just the banking sector either. Investors are also worried about the exposure of insurers to the beleagured eurozone. Aviva lost 9.8p to 314.2p after Exane BNP Paribas downgraded the company from outperform to neutral. Analyst Andy Hughes said Aviva could have recorded £811m of losses in Italy, mainly on government bond movements, and suggested the company could \"hand back the keys of its Italian operations to their partners.\" He said: These [Italian] losses could be reversed out leading to a gain on disposal. This, despite giving away the business for zero on a local statutory basis in an extreme economic scenario. We still see upside in Aviva's valuation, but have cut our rating given our below consensus earnings forecasts and this level of sovereign sensitivity which increases risk within the business. Among the banks, Lloyds Banking Group lost 2.005p to 25.08p while Royal Bank of Scotland fell 1.22p to 20.92p after the European Banking Authority found a €114.4bn capital shortfall across all of Europe's banks, up from €106.5bn in October. Adding to the nervousness ahead of Friday's summit, the ECB failed to unveil increased bond purchases to help alleviate the crisis, which some optimists had been hoping for. All this helped push the FTSE 100 down 63.14 points lower to 5483.77, with European markets down around 2% and Wall Street around 120 points lower by the the time London closed. Italian bond yields soared by 0.45 basis points to 6.5%, while Spanish and French yields also moved higher. GKN fell 6.5p to 183.4p after Credit Suisse downgraded the engineering group from outperform to neutral. It also cut IMI, 34.5p lower at 737p, from neutral to underperform. Safe havens were in demand, with British American Tobacco 45.5p better at £30.15 and GlaxoSmithkline 12p higher at £14.40. Among the mid-caps Ashtead added 25.7p to 211.7p after the equipment hire group reported a strong first half, but Imperial Leather soap group PZ Cussons slid 36p to 308.7p following a profit warning, partly due to rising raw material costs and adverse exchange rate movements. Panmure Gordon said: Despite strong top line growth in the core markets of the UK, Nigeria and Indonesia, PZ's profits in the half have been below expectation due to the combination of continuing high raw material costs and very difficult trading conditions in Australia (retail environment) and in smaller markets of Greece (economy), Thailand (floods) and the Middle East (social unrest). We are reducing our earnings per share forecast for the full-year by 8% from 17.8p to 16.3p and cut our 12-month price target from 380p to 355p. Lower down the market Bango, the mobile payments company, jumped 12p to 68.5p after unveiling a deal with Amazon. Mark James at Liberum Capital said: Bango has signed an agreement to provide services to Amazon (presumably to enable mobile billing for the Amazon portal). I would expect that to be very well received - it should help reverse some of the disappointment with recent results. Beowulf Mining, which has a number of iron ore projects in Sweden, has begun drilling at the north end of its Kallak licence area, with a second rig due to start work before Christmas. The company, where Beowulf actor Ray Winstone has a stake, believes it is fully funded for 2012 after recently raising £6.7m from investors. Elsewhere uranium miner Kalahari Minerals climbed 3.2% to 242p after China Guangdong Nuclear Power finally unveiled an agreed 243.55p a share offer, valuing the company at £632m. Finally Bowleven rose 1.25p to 71.25p on renewed talk of a possible bid for the West Africa focused oil and gas explorer, with Chevron one name in the frame."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/standard-bank-business-sustainability-role","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-18T11:46:00Z","webTitle":"Africa's biggest bank takes a sustainable approach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/standard-bank-business-sustainability-role","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/standard-bank-business-sustainability-role","fields":{"headline":"Africa's biggest bank takes a sustainable approach","bodyText":"At 150 years of age, Standard Bank is one of South Africa's oldest companies and no stranger to thinking in the long term. The group's total assets of 1,497bn rand (£113bn) make it Africa's biggest bank, a heavy burden of responsibility in the world's poorest, least developed continent. Standard Bank's most recent sustainability report describes efforts to extend financial services, reduce environmental impact, support carbon trading schemes in Africa and, since 2007, help more than 300,000 South Africans on low incomes to buy homes. Internally, in the past year the bank hosted a sustainability expo, ran awareness raising campaigns, offered discounts to staff to buy solar water heating systems and made its own offices greener. The group says it is also playing a part in undoing the legacy of apartheid, which for decades systematically denied opportunities and wealth to South Africa's black majority. It operates a community trust but admits that some of its black business beneficiaries have been forced into liquidation by the economic downturn. Karin Ireton, director of group sustainability management, believes that the logic of sustainability and profitability are increasingly seen not as antagonistic but complementary. \"There are still some people who say this is going to be at cost and at odds with straightforward 'business as usual',\" she says at Standard Bank's headquarters in downtown Johannesburg. \"But I think what we are building in the organisation is a greater realisation that there is a new 'business as usual' and that for our clients, as well as for ourselves, the need to reduce energy costs and to increase renewables is significant.\" Eighteen years after the end of white minority rule, South Africa's socio-economic problems remain deeply entrenched. An estimated one in three people is jobless while 44% of workers live on less than 10 rand (75p) a day, according to a 2010 report by the UN Development Programme. The economic bottom half of the population lives on 8% of national income, trade unions say, making this one of the world's most unequal societies. Race is still a vital if slowly diminishing factor. Ireton cites South Africa as an example of how business and government can work together to harness markets and deliver societal impact. \"I think we have a slightly unique approach in this country; we are more collaborative than you get in most economies where there tends to be almost an 'us and them' approach. Maybe that's born out of the absolute need that there was in South Africa to overcome some of these issues and get on with it.\" She adds: \"There are a number of fundamental requirements. One is clarity around what are the rules, are they going to change, are they set, what is the framework within which you undertake these issues. Second is some incentivisation to the private sector – and it doesn't necessarily have to be financial incentives – to get involved and to be able to move quickly. \"I think the benefit from the government's side has been that they have been able to move faster on some things than they would had it just been through state-owned enterprises. But there's also an aspect of mutual recognition of the benefit of actually tackling some of these issues.\" This is illustrated by South Africa's renewable energy programme, which had been hindered by the domination of a state-owned electricity provider focused on coal-fired and nuclear power stations. \"In order to crack through into the renewable energy market we needed to bring on board some independent power production into the system,\" Ireton says. \"That was an obvious gap for the private sector. \"The way they've managed to unlock private sector funding is to create the rules framework. Of course there have been moments when there have been slanging matches on either side, but when we did finally find each other, what you've seen is a great surge of private sector funding.\" Standard Bank says its focus is on sub-Saharan Africa where it is on the ground in 17 countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. It invests in infrastructure development, finances and advises governments, helps trade between markets and partners with organisations that tackle social problems. Ireton continues: \"If you look at the African economies they're very seriously linked to export of natural resources – whether those are crops or mining and oil or gas products – but all of them require water, require energy and, for us to project forward into a growth scenario, firstly the underlying economies need to grow, which means people need to start to see some benefits. \"You'll see it in a social compact that we've crafted which basically says we'll provide financial services and products responsibly, bearing in mind the needs of society and customers. That, I think, puts down on paper what we've known intuitively for a long time: if people are benefiting, they've got more to spend, more to save, and therefore you can offer them a diversity of banking products. \"But it's also that wellbeing and [economic] growth are linked to our ability to grow. So for us it's really important to get that through and start to recognise that it's not just from our perspective as an operating entity but also, more importantly almost, from the perspective of clients. That could be individuals grappling with their first bank account, mobile services or whatever.\" One of the major hindrances to business development in Africa is the massive informal sector which offers little by way of credit history or securitisation. In response Standard Bank says it has launched an initiative to test entrepreneurial capability and likelihood of payback. \"Products like that help you to extend services and build small businesses which in Africa is absolutely crucial because a lot of the African economies are based on small businesses,\" Ireton adds. \"You look in any marketplace and people have put their kids into school and university on the back of informal market trading. But how do you lock those into a system where the money is more secure because it's not in a shoe or in a box or under the bed but it is actually working for them, and then also enable them to access other financial services?\" One answer is banking via mobile phones, which has spread fast around Africa and transformed millions of lives. Another is a scheme of small \"bank shops\" in South Africa's townships, which are often distant from major urban centres and bank branches. Standard Bank has opened roughly 9,000 such outlets so far. \"So now instead of saying to people catch the taxi and go 10 rand's of taxi ride to the local branch, this guy in your neighbourhood can provide you with some basic banking services.\" Ultimately, is it the job of business or government to heal the social and economic scars that persist in Africa? \"It's how you approach it,\" Ireton replies. \"Do I think it's the primary role of business to stand on a street corner and hand out parcels? No. But by thinking through your business differently you can have a mature impact and a lasting impact by actually recognising that these are potential customers and, lifted out of poverty, they can do a lot more themselves and move from the downside of the balance sheet to the upside.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Answer: an article on the otherwise pointy-headed IP Global, website of the German Council on Foreign Relations (www.ip-global.org). \"The Bomb For Beginners\" \"provides step-by-step instructions for going nuclear\" for the information of countries such as Iran, and using countries such as Israel as role models. If only Nato was always as droll as this, and if only more diplomats were like the author, Michael Rühle, deputy head of the policy planning unit for the military alliance's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. Step one of Rühle's easy-to-follow guide involves \"developing a civilian nuclear program\" – for which \"you may even ask for help from the IAEA\" – and establishing \"research and nuclear enrichment facilities\", some of which will need to \"remain secret, preferably underground\". A next section entitled \"Getting Off The Ground\" advises prospective nuclear states how to procure \"a lot of stuff\" they will need, \"from centrifuges all the way to warhead designs\". Rühle laments the unavailability these days of the great Pakistani nuclear smuggler AQ Khan, but assures the reader that \"with enough patience and money, you will still be able to get what you need\". \"You need appropriate systems to deliver your nuclear weapons\" reminds Rühle, and despite many options, \"let us be honest: ballistic missiles are the real thing\". There are tips on how to \"designate your missile program as a 'space launch' program\", thereby getting the Russians to help, above board, as they do Iran. When it comes to the testing stage, unfortunately, \"the old trick of staging a 'peaceful nuclear explosion' will no longer suffice\", but the nascent nuke-power can \"try to have another nation test weapons on your behalf, as South Africa did for Israel and China did for Pakistan\". It is important, however, to \"keep a low profile\". Once caught in the act, as is inevitable, Rühle has sound advice: \"First and foremost, do not overreact… Bring up Israel again\" – and, if a Muslim country, \"cite some arbitrary fatwas that argue nuclear arms are incompatible with Islam. If none can be found, have one written by a clergyman.\" Of course, \"the Security Council will seek to punish you\" but \"no serious punishment will ever be set\" – though \"never argue that you need nukes because your neighbours have them, as that would give away your true intentions\". The crucial thing is that \"fortunately, time is on your side\" – only by this point, with the expense of this exciting project, \"your country may now be impoverished\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/may/22/energy-bill-gas-carbon-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-22T16:49:52Z","webTitle":"Energy bill: will it help the UK meet its climate goals? | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/may/22/energy-bill-gas-carbon-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/may/22/energy-bill-gas-carbon-targets","fields":{"headline":"Energy bill: will it help the UK meet its climate goals?","bodyText":"10.40am: The government publishes its long-awaited draft energy bill today. Much of the advanced publicity seems to be centred on how the nuclear, renewables and gas sectors will each fare. There seems to be a consensus, particularly among environmental groups, that the bill will largely favour the nuclear and gas industries, with the new long-term contracts known as \"contracts for difference\" disadvantaging the smaller renewables companies. But if the bill does lead to, say, a \"dash for gas\", or an extension in the working life of our existing nuclear power stations, what will this all mean for the UK's carbon reductions targets? The government is committed to decarbonising electricity generation by 2030, as well as slashing overall carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050. Will it likely blow such ambitions off-target, or can they still be achieved? What are your views? If quoting figures to support your points, please provide a link to the source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict. 10.57am: John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, has already issued this statement ahead of the draft bill being set out in the Commons later today: This is a looming energy omnishambles. The energy bill could be a huge opportunity to get energy bills and carbon emissions under control, and to bring security to our power supplies. But ministers seem hell-bent on scuppering all of these aims by encouraging a big increase in our dependence on burning expensive gas to generate electricity. This would increase the burden on families and businesses, and see money from bills going to countries like Qatar and Norway instead of back into the British economy. It's obvious that plans for new nuclear power stations have crumbled. The government now has to drop its misguided affair with this hugely expensive pipe dream. Energy secretary Ed Davey should ramp up the efficiency of our energy system and invest in home-grown renewable energy to boost the economy and reduce consumers' exposure to rocketing gas prices. 11.14am: Ed Davey, the climate and energy secretary, was quizzed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning. You can listen to the interview here. It largely focuses on whether the nuclear industry will receive public subsidies - Davey tries to argue not - but he also insists the energy bill will focus on carbon targets, as well as \"keeping the lights on\": What our reforms today do is they try to keep the lights on through energy security and getting investment in infrastructure and they get the low carbon transition we need to hit our climate change targets and get to clean energy, and we need to do that at the most affordable way for the consumer. 11.25am: The Department of Energy and Climate Change has just posted the draft energy bill on its website. It is accompanied by a statement from Ed Davey, the energy and climate secretary, which includes this: At the heart of our Electricity Market Reform (EMR) measures are Feed-in-Tariffs with Contracts for Difference (CfDs), long-term instruments which will provide stable and predictable incentives for companies to invest in low-carbon generation...An Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) will limit carbon dioxide emissions from the most polluting fossil fuel power stations by setting appropriate standards for all new fossil fuel powered generation. Taken as a whole, EMR will enable large-scale investment in low-carbon generation capacity in the UK and deliver security of supply, in a cost-effective way. A separate press release says the bill's \"new market mechanisms\" will be supported by: • An Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) that will provide a regulatory backstop to prevent construction of new coal plants which emit more than 450g/kWh i.e. the most polluting form of electricity generation. • The Carbon Price Floor – this was announced by the Chancellor in the 2011 Budget and was introduced in the Finance Bill. This provides a clear economic signal to move away from high carbon technologies by increasing the price paid for emitting carbon dioxide. It places an initial value on the price of carbon of around £16/tCO2 (2009 prices) in 2013, which will rise to £30/tCO2 (2009 prices) by 2020. With or without reform, household electricity bills are likely to increase over time, driven primarily by rising fossil fuel prices... Gas will continue to play an important role in the transition to a low-carbon economy, to provide flexibility and help maintain security of supply. A separate strategy on the role of gas will be published in autumn 2012. 12.21pm: Terry Macalister, the Guardian's energy editor, has forwarded me this reaction from Volker Beckers, chief executive of RWE npower, one of the \"Big Six\" providing energy to households in the UK. It has just pulled out of building new nuclear plants in the UK. I remain concerned by the amount of change being implemented in the energy sector and the time it is taking. I applaud Government's appetite for reform, but pulling so many levers at once in such a complex area risks losing sight of your original objectives. What the energy sector needs now is simplicity and clarity; policy that puts the customer and Britain's economy at the heart of every decision we make. 12.24pm: And here are the thoughts (via Terry Macalister) of WWF UK's Nick Molho: Given the increasing concerns around the economic viability of new nuclear and the repeated delays to the CCS [carbon capture and storage] demonstration programme, renewable energy and energy efficiency are our best bets to deliver a secure, cost-effective and low-carbon power sector by 2030. But renewable energy investors need clear, unequivocal, long-term support from ministers, who must face down sniping from the backbenches and certain sections of the media. The government must also recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach just doesn't work in the energy sector and that we need targeted financial support mechanisms for renewables. 12.27pm: As you might expect, Terry Macalister, the Guardian's energy editor, has his own thoughts on the draft energy bill: This is a clear intervention by the government to influence the market place, turning its back on two decades of liberalisation which have brought high energy costs but not enough investment. It is an acknowledgement - finally - that the private sector cannot make the kind of longterm commitments needed to modernise UK energy infrastructure and make it fit for a low carbon world. You might ask whether it should really make an even bolder move back to the future and recreate some kind of national energy company. It is French state-owned EDF that is pretty much the only one driving a new UK nuclear programme and it is state-owned Statkraft (Norwegian) and Vattenfall (Sweden) that are among the leaders building massive new wind farms in the UK North Sea. Energy security - and an element of self-sufficiency - for Britain should be treated in the same way as defence. There is no point in having aircraft carriers to wage war across the world if we cannot keep our own lights on. The state-owned British National Oil Corporation helped build up the North Sea oil sector. Maybe we need an equivalent to develop the major new \"Round 3\" wind farms that produce no carbon pollution and enable us to control at least part of our destiny. 12.40pm: Reaction coming in thick and fast now. Here's a flavour... From Veolia, the waste management company: The most important outcome from today's draft energy paper should be to ensure Britain keeps the lights on with a secure energy supply. Energy recovery from waste has become more than just a viable alternative to landfill. It stands to play an important role in filling the nation's energy gap with the potential to provide 9% of renewable electricity supplies and 3% of our total electricity demand. To support the growth of this sustainable energy source, Veolia calls on government to consider extending renewable energy incentives to energy produced from waste. From the CBI, the \"the UK's top business lobbying organisation\": While it is reassuring to see some progress on the Energy Bill, it's now important that Parliament not only gets it right, but does so as a matter of urgency. With over a fifth of the UK's generating capacity coming off stream before 2020, we face a real risk of electricity shortages in the second half of the decade. \"The clock is ticking to create the market certainty that will unlock billions of pounds of private sector investment, generating many new jobs across the UK, and securing an affordable supply of energy. \"We are still some way from having a detailed picture of how the electricity market will look in the future, on which the success of these reforms depends. With major investors waiting in the wings, these details are needed as soon as possible. From Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus: The government has a difficult and complicated challenge ahead of it in getting the energy bill right. It must walk a fine line between balancing the need to make our energy supply more secure and meet our green targets, while ensuring energy remains affordable for customers today and tomorrow. With a hefty price tag attached to the changes to be made, consumers need to be assured that not a penny of the funding that comes out of their bills will be wasted. That means the government must guarantee that any subsidies for new power generation and any rate of return to suppliers are fair, and not overly generous at consumers' expense. Any bi-lateral agreement or letters of comfort given to large developers in the meantime should be made public for scrutiny, helping ensure consumers get the best deal. The government is also making these changes at a time when we have seen fuel poverty figures increase significantly. So it has an obligation to make sure that those households who will be hardest hit by rising bills get the help they need. Recycling some of the extra revenue the government will receive from carbon taxes could go a very long way to ensure help is there for those who need it most. And from Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?: The government is right to address the complex issue of future electricity generation and how best to invest in low carbon power. However, there are many unknowns and whilst it is encouraging to hear the energy secretary promising that these plans will be good news for consumers we want to see more evidence and the small print before we can judge whether this will work for all of us who are expected to foot the bill. The government must be transparent and allow full scrutiny of these reforms, particularly on the contract negotiations for new low carbon generation. Contracts for Difference could see potential savings for consumers but the government must be honest about the cost that this investment will involve. Alongside the measures in the draft energy bill, we also want to see comprehensive reform of the retail market to ensure it works for consumers and an effective energy efficiency strategy to help many more people save money. Ministers must have consumers and the affordability of household bills foremost in their minds as they develop these proposals further. 12.43pm: David Porter, chief executive of Energy UK, which launched last month and describes itself as \"the new trade association for the gas and electricity sector\", has issued this reaction: The investment challenge we're facing is huge. Around £200 billion is required to give us the secure and reliable low-carbon energy supplies we need for the future. The market we have now simply won't bring forward that investment. Publication of the energy bill is an important step forward. These are wide-ranging reforms, and we will be working closely with the government in the months ahead to ensure that the final outcome provides clarity for investors and brings forward the low-carbon investment needed. 12.53pm: My colleague Fiona Harvey, the Guardian's environment correspondent, has spotted something intriguing in Davey's statement: In his quotes, he says we will \"decarbonise the energy sector during the 2030s\". This is not what the CCC has demanded. Indeed. The Committee for Climate Change has recommended that \"the power sector be almost entirely decarbonised by 2030\". So, what's it to be? \"During the 2030s\", or \"by 2030\"? 12.58pm: Will Straw, associate director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, the \"the UK's leading progressive thinktank\", believes that the energy bill will not help to reduce carbon emissions: While the ambition to meet CO2 targets and ensure security of supply is correct, the energy bill has been beset by delays while specific measures within the package could raise voters' concerns about their number one issue, rising energy costs. The carbon price floor risks giving energy and climate change policy a bad name because it will do nothing to reduce carbon emissions while piling more cost on to the shoulders of already hard-pressed consumers in the UK. Because a floor price for carbon in the UK will depress the carbon price elsewhere in Europe, the UK will effectively hand over billions to European polluters. At a time of austerity and efficiency, wasting £1 billion is inexcusable. Instead, we should be pushing for an EU-wide carbon price floor. Modelling, published by IPPR last year, suggested that unilaterally introducing a floor price for carbon in Britain will undermine the economic efficiency of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and could waste up to £1 billion. Because the market is Europe-wide, a higher price in the UK due to the carbon price floor will lead to a lower price elsewhere and to the same amount of carbon being emitted. The scheme will be open to annual scrutiny and potential change through the annual budget, in the same way as fuel duty. This means the government's claim that the scheme will help provide certainty for investors who want to build nuclear power stations or install renewable energy technology is undermined. 1.05pm: Here are the thoughts of Caroline Lucas, Brighton Pavilion MP and leader of the Green party: While I welcome efforts to address the UK's dependence on fossil fuels, reduce our exposure to volatile energy prices and boost long term investment in renewables, this draft energy bill is deeply flawed and looks likely to benefit only the industry's most powerful players. The government has made a big noise about being 'technology neutral' and not putting all of its eggs in one energy basket, but the electricity market reform proposals expose a clear bias towards nuclear and gas. You can read her full statement here. 1.18pm: Gordon Edge, director of policy at RenewableUK, the \"trade and professional body for the UK wind and marine renewables industries\", says: The timeline DECC has laid out looks very challenging to bring in wholesale change to the electricity market. As this is coming at a time when traditional energy sources are coming to the end of their lifespan, DECC needs to ensure that they continue to consult in order that an energy gap does not appear. A gap means fewer options for the UK, which means we risk missing carbon reduction targets, continuing our dependence on imported fossil fuels and energy bills not being insulated from the rising costs of fuel. Furthermore, the wind and marine renewables supply chain needs to be sure that there will be sufficient orders if they're to base operations in the UK, bringing the jobs and cost savings that we and the government are keen to see. We're pleased that DECC has engaged and listened on areas like the power purchase agreements and will be asking for evidence on these and that they are willing to look at the role a counterparty can play on the contract for difference. We urge them to work with us on the overall timetable so that developers can be given the surety they need to fully commit to proceeding with their next generation of projects, providing the supply chain with the final spur to invest in the UK and create badly needed jobs. 1.30pm: In light of Fiona Harvey's observation earlier, Greenpeace's Joss Garman has just emailed to say he, too, has noticed something of interest: In this Emissions Performance Standard statement (pdf), they appear to be saying that they're working towards \"an indicative average carbon emission intensity target of 100g/co2/kwh in 2030\" as opposed to what the Committee on Climate Change have recommended, which is 50g/CO2/Kwh being essential to hit carbon targets. He adds: The CCC say that carbon targets set out under the Climate Change Act are \"only be achievable if electricity generation is almost completely decarbonised by 2030.\" (Page 197: http://www.theccc.org.uk/pdf/7980-TSO%20Book%20Chap%205.pdf) So the Electricity Market Reform package presented today is clearly not consistent with this goal - and therefore, it casts doubt over whether ministers are even attempting to stay within the carbon budgets they say they are committed to. Worth noting too that Lord Turner of CCC wrote to Davey calling for explicit 2030 decarb goal in EMR. 1.33pm: Paul Steedman, senior energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, has just sent me this: Britain's energy system is broken. Those hoping today's energy bill would provide a solution have been left sorely disappointed. After 18 months of dithering, this bill doesn't even set out a clear purpose, when it should make a simple commitment to decarbonise our electricity supply by 2030. The UK government has promised to slash carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. Their independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, have said this means cutting emissions from electricity as an urgent priority - decarbonising almost entirely by 2030, not \"largely decarbonising during the 2030s\" as the government talks of doing. The bill is likely to maintain our dependence on gas and will ensure we miss these targets. It also lays consumers bare to the volatile price spikes of the gas market. Equally worrying are proposals to rely on nuclear as a low-carbon alternative. Nuclear takes so long to build that it would be many years before it contributes towards our carbon targets. Furthermore, it is a risky technology that has never delivered on time or on budget. And recent analysis from both academia and the City suggests that it will need more subsidy than offshore wind. The government should listen to 85% of people and support clean British energy from our wind, sun and water, as well as cutting energy waste to make an instant impression on our carbon targets. This would kick start our struggling economy by creating thousands of jobs, give much-needed relief to customers struggling with fuel bills, and boost the government's green credentials. 2.41pm: Reaction from Juliet Davenport, CEO and founder of Good Energy, the \"UK's only 100% renewable electricity supplier\": The government's persistence with contracts for difference is playing with fire. These overly complex instruments risk skewing the market towards nuclear and the \"Big 6\", at the expense of renewable energy and smaller suppliers. They will restrict competition in the market, rather than attracting the new investment the industry needs, and the result is that consumers will be the losers in the long run because they will end up having to pay higher prices. There is an alternative initially proposed by the government - a straightforward premium feed-in tariff would address these problems. Renewable energy sourced in the UK is better for our energy security and will lead to lower and more stable prices in the long run, and mean that money spent on our energy bills is re-invested here in the UK. We've got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get this right; if the government blows it we'll be tied into gas and expensive nuclear and prices will continue to spiral higher. 3.17pm: Here are some thoughts on how the energy bill will impact the UK's electricity grid by Mark England, CEO of Sentec, \"the world leading supplier of smart grid and metering technology\": It's great to see the government looking for ways to encourage renewable generation and reduced energy consumption. However, all these technological changes will put an immense strain on our national grid. For the network to cope with the strain, careful investment is needed. Priority areas that need to be considered include successful management of the extra stresses on the grid, and a focus on \"measure, analyse, manage\" as the principle we need to follow. Some areas of the network such as the LV [low voltage] section are currently not monitored continuously which needs to be addressed if a truly smart grid is to be realised. Intelligent systems will also need to be deployed to get the important information and alerts out of the data produced when the DECC smart meter rollout is complete. 3.40pm: I've just received this reaction from Prof Jim Skea, research director at the UK Energy Research Centre: The draft energy bill brings more clarity about the framework for electricity market reform, but precisely how nuclear, renewables and CCS [carbon capture and storage] will be encouraged is still not clear, and will only become clear when secondary legislation is published. Nevertheless, some very clever people have put heavy duty thinking into this. The headlines for me are that \"contracts for differences\" turn out not be \"contracts\" at all, but legislative instruments, and the capacity mechanism intended to guarantee security of supply is simply an option that would be exercised if there appeared to be a real risk of the lights going out. The draft Bill doesn't bring either the waiting or the debating to an end. 3.54pm: Fiona Harvey's news story about the draft energy bill is now live. It includes a quote from Maria Wardrobe, director of external affairs at the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action: \"The government can do little to disguise that these proposals will add substantially to already soaring energy bills and place much more risk on domestic energy consumers.\" She called for VAT revenues from fuel to be recycled into energy-efficiency programmes to lift vulnerable people out of fuel poverty. 4.52pm: James Murray, editor of BusinessGreen, has posted a blog summing up his own thoughts on the draft energy bill: In short, it remains a genuinely historic package of proposals that should lay the foundations for over £110bn of investment in low carbon infrastructure over the decade...[But] today's announcement boils down to yet another promise that clarity and stability is just around the corner, overshadowed by the ominous prospect of an unreconstructed Treasury getting final say on the crucial numbers that will determine which low carbon projects proceed and which stall. The real scandal for me is not over renewables vs nuclear, but over the pace of these reforms. The energy market is devilishly complex, but 10 months on from the publication of the initial white paper we really do not seem to be much further forward. Yes, the government does not want to rush such important decisions, but billions of pounds of investment are waiting to be made at a time when, for economic and environmental reasons, the UK desperately needs it. Ministers cannot keep kicking the crucial decisions a few months down the line at the same time as calling for greater urgency from businesses. 5.50pm: My verdict Today's draft energy bill is clearly a significant milestone on the UK's vertiginous road to decarbonisation. But we are still at least a year away - with all the lobbying and politicking that will involve - from knowing whether it will mark a genuine stride forward or a depressing step backwards. For example, we must wait until the autumn before we have the all-important fine print about the coalition government's policy on gas. And it appears the nuclear component of the bill will continue to be in flux for many months yet. It also unnerves me that City speculators understand the concept of \"contracts for difference\" to be little more than a form of spread betting. Many seem to be interpreting these contracts as state subsidies by another name, despite the government's continued promise that any new nuclear plants will not benefit from the public purse. Do we really need such complicated structures and mechanisms to deliver a low-carbon future? And then we have the apparent moving of goal posts with Davey now talking about decarbonising the power grid \"during the 2030s\" as opposed to \"by 2030\", as recommended by the Committee for Climate Change. Two decades out and we are already seeing signs of slippage on the government's carbon ambitions. Is it any wonder that many people see such goals as hollow words spoken by politicians who live or die by short-term political cycles?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/may/19/nuclear-newbuild-government-policy-huhne","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-19T18:35:14Z","webTitle":"Nuclear industry presses sceptical Huhne over backing new reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/19/nuclear-newbuild-government-policy-huhne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/may/19/nuclear-newbuild-government-policy-huhne","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear industry presses sceptical Huhne over backing new reactors","bodyText":"Leaders of the nuclear industry have sought urgent meetings with the new energy secretary, Chris Huhne, amid concern that he will not provide the support needed for their £30bn investment programme in a new generation of reactors. Sam Laidlaw, Centrica's chief executive, and Paul Golby, head of E.ON UK, have scheduled talks in the coming days with Huhne, who has strongly indicated that his primary focus is renewable power. Ian Marchant, boss of Scottish and Southern Energy, said today he had spoken by phone to Huhne this week when the minister outlined his views on the commercial viability of atomic plants. \"He was sceptical on the economics of nuclear but made it clear he would allow people to make their own decisions on this and would not stand in their way if they can do it without subsidies,\" said Marchant, whose company is considering a new reactor in Cumbria but is far less committed to nuclear than either Centrica or E.ON. \"I think being sceptical is no bad thing. The worst thing you can have is a situation where the state bends over backwards to [financially] support nuclear. Look where that got us,\" he added. The SSE chief executive also confirmed the enthusiasm of Huhne for green energy, saying the minister was very well-informed and supportive of projects, such as the huge Greater Gabbard windfarm off the coast of Suffolk, which will be one of the largest offshore windfarms in the world. \"He [Huhne] was well aware of SSE's credentials and he was keen to see us continuing with what we are doing and to ensure there is continuing inward investment in this sector,\" said Marchant. Huhne's party, the Liberal Democrats, said in their manifesto that they opposed new nuclear plants but the coalition agreement with the Conservatives involved a new pledge to allow nuclear stations to be built with a proviso that they do not involve public subsidies. Huhne has already followed this up with a commitment to make companies pay for all their clean-up costs after a nuclear accident. Currently, the industry only pays the first £140m, with the government picking up the rest of the bill, which Huhne believes amounts to a public subsidy. Other energy bosses are meeting Charles Hendry next week. The Tory energy minister has been tasked with the nuclear brief and is considered pro-nuclear. The industry is still claiming publicly that its plans remain on track but one of the Big Six energy suppliers involved in nuclear newbuild admitted: \"We need more clarity about what is going to be their [government] approach.\" Another senior executive of a nuclear company said all \"plans are all on hold\", while a spokesman for the nuclear joint venture between E.ON and RWE admitted that there were \"meaty issues to be discussed\" with the government. The economics of nuclear power have already been hit by low gas prices and a weak pound, which makes it more expensive for UK-based companies such as Centrica to import reactor parts. The government has also promised to introduce a minimum carbon price to help make nuclear economic, which the Liberal Democrats support. But the industry will want it to be at least €50 a tonne, compared with current prices of about €15. Firms are also concerned that Whitehall cost-cutting could result in the programme to decommission existing reactors, which is funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), being slashed. Clare Spottiswoode, chair of EnergySolutions in the EU, said: \"Many potential investors in the UK's nuclear newbuild programme will view how the decommissioning budget is dealt with as an early signal of how committed the new government is to nuclear power.\" A DECC spokesman said: \"The government's policy and next steps on new nuclear are absolutely clear and explicitly set down in the coalition agreement.\" The DECC, which was set up only two years ago, and employs about 1,000 staff, also faces big cuts. Greg Clarke, then shadow energy secretary, is said to have told one industry executive that he planned to axe 500 jobs from the department."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2012/feb/03/hiroshima-peace-memorial-park-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-03T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"Peace offering: Hiroshima's Memorial Park","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/03/hiroshima-peace-memorial-park-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2012/feb/03/hiroshima-peace-memorial-park-japan","fields":{"headline":"Peace offering: Hiroshima's Memorial Park","bodyText":"It's a credit to Hiroshima's recovery that if the city were to change its name, you'd never guess its harrowing past. A few miles from Miyajima, one of Japan's most beautiful destinations, the city is lined with shopping malls, its inhabitants play baseball and football, it hosts festivals throughout the year and is famed for its oysters and okonomiyaki (Japanese omelette). In some ways, it's a very normal place. But however much the city has moved on, Hiroshimans are determined no one should ever forget what happened here. A visit to the city's Peace Memorial Park tells the story, in excruciating detail, of the day the bomb fell, devastating the city and killing 140,000 people. A Unesco world heritage site, the park is as distressing as it is informative – a strange mix for one of the country's leading tourist attractions. And with tickets costing ¥50 (42p), it is also one of the cheapest. It's not an easy place to be. Little is left to the imagination: over 90% of the buildings in Hiroshima – many of them wooden – were damaged when the bomb was dropped on 6 August 1945. Little survived the blast, or the subsequent fires, but what is now called the A-Bomb Dome held its shape. Originally an exhibition hall, this now stands in a corner of the park like a charred scarecrow, a small example of how the city looked immediately after the explosion. Code-named Little Boy, the Hiroshima bomb (three days later, Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki) was only the second nuclear device ever detonated. When its creator, J Robert Oppenheimer, stood in the desert watching the infamous Trinity Test he was reminded of the Hindu verse: \"I am become death, destroyer of worlds.\" His colleague, test director Kenneth Bainbridge less poetically but no less accurately remarked: \"Now we are all sons of bitches.\" So unknown was the bomb's potential to kill and maim, that Hiroshima had been deliberately spared by the extensive allied fire-bombing campaign for several months. They wanted an accurate measure of how their device could devastate an urban setting. The exhibits go well beyond recounting the devastation of that August day, going into terrifying detail about bombs that the former Soviet Union and the US have since tested in Siberia and the Pacific. Many of those devices were several thousand times stronger than the Little Boy. The numbers involved and the potential future devastation are difficult to comprehend. To put it in context, the museum warns of a \"nuclear winter\", an apocalyptic state in which the effects of an atomic war block out the sun and slowly kill the planet. Disneyland, this is not. Naturally, by far the most distressing section of the museum depicts Little Boy's arrival – a child's scorched tricycle, a series of grizzly photographs showing what happens to human bodies when they face weaponised nuclear power, a step onto which the shadow of a man has been scorched. He was sitting waiting for a bank to open when the sky exploded. Meanwhile, downstairs there is a collection of letters. Each mayor of Hiroshima has written a letter of protest every time a world leader carries out a nuclear test. Hundreds of these ignored appeals line the walls of the museum. The most recent was written to Barack Obama last June highlighting the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Back outside the museum in the centre of the park is an eternal flame in memory of the thousands of people who died on that day, and months later through radiation poisoning. The light will be extinguished when the last nuclear missile is decommissioned, but for now, the mayor of Hiroshima keeps writing. Elsewhere, perhaps the saddest section of the park is dedicated to the children who died such as Sadako Sasaki, a schoolgirl who survived the blast only to be eaten away by leukaemia a decade later. While in hospital, she started folding paper cranes, trying to reach 1,000, a number said to grant a wish from the gods. However, the illness claimed her when she had completed 644 (other sources say she actually made it to 1,000). When she had passed away, Sasaki's family and classmates completed the chain and buried it with her. This practice continues for anyone afflicted, and Sasaki's statue at Children's Peace Monument is often besieged with origami. More than a million people visit the Memorial Park a year, and it is impossible to come away without being deeply affected. Most are teenagers on school trips. Watching them shuffle around the museum, it struck me that perhaps the reason Japanese people often make the peace sign when posing for a photo is that they know its value more than most. • Hiroshima Peace Memorial website • Jamie Lafferty is a travel writer who ordinarily blogs at idoneaholiday.blogspot.com and tweets at @megaheid.

Its head of nuclear production security in 2006, Pascal Durieux, was given a three-year sentence with two years suspended, and a €10,000 fine for commissioning the spying. The Nanterre court also sentenced the security No 2 in 2006, Pierre-Paul François, to three years, 30 months suspended. EDF has also been ordered to pay €500,000 in damages to Greenpeace. The judge further handed down a guilty verdict on Thierry Lorho, head of Kargus, a firm employed by EDF to hack into Greenpeace's computers. He got three years in jail, two suspended, and a €4,000 fine. EDF is the world's biggest nuclear energy supplier; it owns the UK nuclear power operator, British Energy, and is a major sponsor of the London Olympics. It was charged with complicity in concealing stolen documents and complicity to intrude on a computer network. EDF and Greenpeace have fought for years over France's power production, more than three-quarters of it nuclear. According to confidential court testimony released by a French website, Mediapart, two years ago, EDF had organised surveillance not only of Greenpeace in France, but broadly across Europe since 2004. In 2006, EDF hired a detective agency, Kargus Consultants, run by a former member of France's secret services, to find out about Greenpeace France's intentions and its plan to block new nuclear plants in the UK. The agency hacked the computer of Yannick Jadot, Greenpeace's then campaigns director, taking 1,400 documents. An EDF official had no immediate comment. In the trial, EDF said it had victim of overzealous efforts, and had been unaware anyone would hack a computer. \"The fine and the damages awarded send a strong signal to the nuclear industry that nobody is above the law,\" said Adélaïde Colin for Greenpeace France. \"In the runup to the next presidential elections … voters should keep this scandal in mind.\" The outrage among anti-nuclear campaigners echoes that which emerged when it was revealed that France's secret services were behind the bombing of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior 26 years ago. Moreover, safety is a very live issue since Japan's Fukushima disaster. In March, only weeks later, EDF boss Vincent de Rivaz said its plan to build four reactors in the UK would be unaffected, starting at Hinkley Point in Somerset. At present, the four EPR are being built in Finland, France and China are well behind schedule, hampered by construction problems and billions over budget, in the case of EDF's reactors in Finland, and France. Speaking from alongside the new Rainbow Warrior, currently on its maiden voyage and docked in London, Greenpeace UK's executive director, John Sauven, said: \"The evidence presented at the trial showed that the espionage undertaken by EDF in its efforts to discredit Greenpeace was both extensive and totally illegal. The company should now give a full account of the spying operation it mounted against its critics. As one of the six companies with a monopoly over electricity supply in this country and a major sponsor of the Olympics, EDF has a duty to come clean. The length of the sentences handed down shows just how seriously the judge views what the French state owned company did.\" Yesterday, EDF raised its target for nuclear generation in France and reported a 3.2% rise in sales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/17/fukushima-japan-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-18T01:13:59Z","webTitle":"Quiet voices must be heeded to avert a future Fukushima | Alister Scott and Jim Watson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/17/fukushima-japan-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/17/fukushima-japan-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Quiet voices must be heeded to avert a future Fukushima","bodyText":"Japan's part-natural, part-human disaster is an extraordinary event. As well as dealing with the consequences of an earthquake and tsunami, rescuers are having to evacuate thousands of people from the danger zone around Fukushima. In addition, the country is blighted by blackouts from the shutting of 10 or more nuclear plants. It is a textbook case of how technology can increase our vulnerability through unintended side-effects. Yet there had been early warnings from analysts. In 2006, the Japanese professor Katsuhiko Ishibashi resigned from a nuclear power advisory panel, saying that the policy of building in earthquake zones could lead to catastrophe, and that design standards for proofing them against damage were too lax. Further back, the seminal study of accidents in complex technologies was Charles Perrow's Normal Accidents, published in 1984. Perrow, a Yale professor, analysed accidents in chemical plants, air traffic control, shipping and dams, as well as his main focus: the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Things can go wrong with design, equipment, procedures, operators, supplies and the environment. Occasionally two or more will have problems simultaneously; in a complex technology such as a nuclear plant, the potential for this is ever-present. Perrow took five pages to sketch what went wrong in the first 13 seconds of the incident. He concluded that in complex systems, \"no matter how effective conventional safety devices are, there is a form of accident that is inevitable\" – hence \"normal accidents\". Unusually for a social scientist, Perrow also made a prediction – that there would be future disasters at nuclear plants. It happened two years later, when the Chernobyl plant melted down, causing several thousand deaths and economic damage estimated to be as high as $100bn (£62bn). Such system accidents occur with many technologies: take the example of a motorway blow-out leading to a pile-up. This may have disastrous consequences for those involved, but cannot be described as a disaster. The latter only happens when the technologies involved have the potential to affect many innocent bystanders. This \"dread factor\" is why the nuclear aspect of Japan's ordeal has come to dominate the headlines, despite the fact that the tsunami has had much greater immediate impact on lives. Unfortunately, such events are often made worse by the way the nuclear industry and governments handle the early stages of disasters, as they reassure us that all is fine. Some statements are well intentioned. But as things get worse, people wonder why early reassurances were issued when it is apparent that there was no basis for them. It is simply too early to say what precisely went wrong at Fukushima, and it has been surprising to see commentators speak with such speed and certainty. Most people accept that they will only ever have a rough understanding of the facts. But they instinctively ask if they can trust those in charge and wonder why governments support particular technologies so strongly. Industry and governments need to be more straightforward with the public. The pretence of knowledge is deeply unscientific; a more humble approach where officials are frank about the unknowns would paradoxically engender greater trust. Likewise, nuclear's opponents need to adopt a measured approach. We need a fuller democratic debate about the choices we are making. Catastrophic potential needs to be a central criterion in decisions about technology. Advice from experts is useful, but the most significant questions are ethical in character. If technologies can potentially have disastrous effects on large numbers of innocent bystanders, someone needs to represent their interests. We might expect this to be the role of governments, yet they have generally become advocates of nuclear power because it is a relatively low-carbon technology that reduces reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately, this commitment seems to have reduced their ability to be seen to act as honest brokers, something acutely felt at times like these, especially since there have been repeated scandals in Japan over the covering up of information relating to faults and accidents at reactors. With respect to the UK, our research has highlighted how political debate on energy security in recent years has often been simplistic, narrow and closed. Senior politicians and policymakers have rushed to embrace nuclear power, often ignoring the fact that it brings security problems of its own. This was perhaps most famously the case when the then prime minister Tony Blair pre-empted the conclusions of a consultation about energy options by publicly telling the nation that nuclear power was back \"with a vengeance\". These words now contain a certain irony. Post Fukushima, governments in Germany, Switzerland and Austria already appear to be shifting their policies. Rational voices, such as the UK's chief scientific adviser, John Beddington, are saying quite logically that we should not compare the events in Japan with the situation in the UK, since we do not have the same earthquake risk. Unfortunately, such arguments are unlikely to prevail in the politics of risky technologies. Similarly, firms and investors involved in nuclear power have often failed to take regulatory and political risk into account; history shows that nuclear accidents can lead to tighter regulations, which in turn can increase nuclear costs. Further ahead, the proponents of hazardous technologies need to bear the full costs of their products, including insurance liabilities and the cost of independent monitoring of environmental and health effects. As it currently stands, taxpayers would pay for any future nuclear incident. Critics of technology are often dubbed in policy circles as anti-science. Yet critical thinking is central to any rational decision-making process – it is less scientific to support a technology uncritically. Accidents happen with all technologies, and are regrettable but not disastrous so long as the technology does not have catastrophic potential; this raises significant questions about whether we want to adopt technologies that do have such potential. If we are to continue to embrace nuclear power, such debate is now more important than ever – debate that respectfully embraces the full range of views. Quiet voices sometimes bring wisdom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/11/nuclear-apologists-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-11T11:10:09Z","webTitle":"How nuclear apologists mislead the world over radiation | Helen Caldicott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/11/nuclear-apologists-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/11/nuclear-apologists-radiation","fields":{"headline":"How nuclear apologists mislead the world over radiation","bodyText":"Soon after the Fukushima accident last month, I stated publicly that a nuclear event of this size and catastrophic potential could present a medical problem of very large dimensions. Events have proven this observation to be true despite the nuclear industry's campaign about the \"minimal\" health effects of so-called low-level radiation. That billions of its dollars are at stake if the Fukushima event causes the \"nuclear renaissance\" to slow down appears to be evident from the industry's attacks on its critics, even in the face of an unresolved and escalating disaster at the reactor complex at Fukushima. Proponents of nuclear power – including George Monbiot, who has had a mysterious road-to-Damascus conversion to its supposedly benign effects – accuse me and others who call attention to the potential serious medical consequences of the accident of \"cherry-picking\" data and overstating the health effects of radiation from the radioactive fuel in the destroyed reactors and their cooling pools. Yet by reassuring the public that things aren't too bad, Monbiot and others at best misinform, and at worst misrepresent or distort, the scientific evidence of the harmful effects of radiation exposure – and they play a predictable shoot-the-messenger game in the process. To wit: 1) Mr Monbiot, who is a journalist not a scientist, appears unaware of the difference between external and internal radiation Let me educate him. The former is what populations were exposed to when the atomic bombs were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945; their profound and on-going medical effects are well documented. [1] Internal radiation, on the other hand, emanates from radioactive elements which enter the body by inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Hazardous radionuclides such as iodine-131, caesium 137, and other isotopes currently being released in the sea and air around Fukushima bio-concentrate at each step of various food chains (for example into algae, crustaceans, small fish, bigger fish, then humans; or soil, grass, cow's meat and milk, then humans). [2] After they enter the body, these elements – called internal emitters – migrate to specific organs such as the thyroid, liver, bone, and brain, where they continuously irradiate small volumes of cells with high doses of alpha, beta and/or gamma radiation, and over many years, can induce uncontrolled cell replication – that is, cancer. Further, many of the nuclides remain radioactive in the environment for generations, and ultimately will cause increased incidences of cancer and genetic diseases over time. The grave effects of internal emitters are of the most profound concern at Fukushima. It is inaccurate and misleading to use the term \"acceptable levels of external radiation\" in assessing internal radiation exposures. To do so, as Monbiot has done, is to propagate inaccuracies and to mislead the public worldwide (not to mention other journalists) who are seeking the truth about radiation's hazards. 2) Nuclear industry proponents often assert that low doses of radiation (eg below 100mSV) produce no ill effects and are therefore safe. But , as the US National Academy of Sciences BEIR VII report has concluded, no dose of radiation is safe, however small, including background radiation; exposure is cumulative and adds to an individual's risk of developing cancer. 3) Now let's turn to Chernobyl. Various seemingly reputable groups have issued differing reports on the morbidity and mortalities resulting from the 1986 radiation catastrophe. The World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2005 issued a report attributing only 43 human deaths directly to the Chernobyl disaster and estimating an additional 4,000 fatal cancers. In contrast, the 2009 report, \"Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment\", published by the New York Academy of Sciences, comes to a very different conclusion. The three scientist authors – Alexey V Yablokov, Vassily B. Nesterenko, and Alexey V Nesterenko – provide in its pages a translated synthesis and compilation of hundreds of scientific articles on the effects of the Chernobyl disaster that have appeared in Slavic language publications over the past 20 years. They estimate the number of deaths attributable to the Chernobyl meltdown at about 980,000. Monbiot dismisses the report as worthless, but to do so – to ignore and denigrate an entire body of literature, collectively hundreds of studies that provide evidence of large and significant impacts on human health and the environment – is arrogant and irresponsible. Scientists can and should argue over such things, for example, as confidence intervals around individual estimates (which signal the reliability of estimates), but to consign out of hand the entire report into a metaphorical dustbin is shameful. Further, as Prof Dimitro Godzinsky, of the Ukranian National Academy of Sciences, states in his introduction to the report: \"Against this background of such persuasive data some defenders of atomic energy look specious as they deny the obvious negative effects of radiation upon populations. In fact, their reactions include almost complete refusal to fund medical and biological studies, even liquidating government bodies that were in charge of the 'affairs of Chernobyl'. Under pressure from the nuclear lobby, officials have also diverted scientific personnel away from studying the problems caused by Chernobyl.\" 4) Monbiot expresses surprise that a UN-affiliated body such as WHOmight be under the influence of the nuclear power industry, causing its reporting on nuclear power matters to be biased. And yet that is precisely the case. In the early days of nuclear power, WHO issued forthright statements on radiation risks such as its 1956 warning: \"Genetic heritage is the most precious property for human beings. It determines the lives of our progeny, health and harmonious development of future generations. As experts, we affirm that the health of future generations is threatened by increasing development of the atomic industry and sources of radiation … We also believe that new mutations that occur in humans are harmful to them and their offspring.\" After 1959, WHO made no more statements on health and radioactivity. What happened? On 28 May 1959, at the 12th World Health Assembly, WHO drew up an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); clause 12.40 of this agreement says: \"Whenever either organisation [the WHO or the IAEA] proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organisation has or may have a substantial interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement.\" In other words, the WHO grants the right of prior approval over any research it might undertake or report on to the IAEA – a group that many people, including journalists, think is a neutral watchdog, but which is, in fact, an advocate for the nuclear power industry. The IAEA's founding papers state: \"The agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity through the world.\" Monbiot appears ignorant about the WHO's subjugation to the IAEA, yet this is widely known within the scientific radiation community. But it is clearly not the only matter on which he is ignorant after his apparent three-day perusal of the vast body of scientific information on radiation and radioactivity. As we have seen, he and other nuclear industry apologists sow confusion about radiation risks, and, in my view, in much the same way that the tobacco industry did in previous decades about the risks of smoking. Despite their claims, it is they, not the \"anti-nuclear movement\" who are \"misleading the world about the impacts of radiation on human health.\" • Helen Caldicott is president of the Helen Caldicott Foundation for a Nuclear-Free Planet and the author of Nuclear Power is Not the Answer [1] See, for example, WJ Schull, Effects of Atomic Radiation: A Half-Century of Studies from Hiroshima and Nagasaki (New York: Wiley-Lis, 1995) and DE Thompson, K Mabuchi, E Ron, M Soda, M Tokunaga, S Ochikubo, S Sugimoto, T Ikeda, M Terasaki, S Izumi et al. \"Cancer incidence in atomic bomb survivors, Part I: Solid tumors, 1958-1987\" in Radiat Res 137:S17-S67 (1994).

Hugo Swire, a Foreign Office minister, had to make a statement about the summit instead today in response to an urgent question. • A court has been told that a Conservative council broke the law by trying to push through a £320m outsourcing contract to a private company without properly consulting the public. As Robert Booth reports, the London Borough of Barnet is being challenged by a local resident in a case that will determine the fate of a radical reform of public services that has been compared to the creation of a no-frills \"easyCouncil\". That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. At the culture committee hearing this morning, the Labour MP Jim Sheridan said he could not understand why some journalists were allowed into parliament. What concerns me is the parasitical elements within the press who abuse their position in here [parliament] in terms of hiding behind their pen and calling people names. That's the so-called brave people. I don't understand why they are allowed to come into this place and behave in the way that they do. He seemed to be referring to parliamentary sketch writers. Here's an afternoon reading list. • Damian McBride on his blog says George Osborne should follow Gordon Brown and use his budget to announce some measures that would be cheap but popular. Look through Gordon’s Budgets and you will see a pattern of small but populist measures sprinkled through every one aimed at core lower and middle income households, from freezes in beer duty to reduced rates of VAT on everything from children’s car seats to tampons. Never enough to affect the bottom line; never a headline measure; but enough to affect public perceptions ... And if George thinks Gordon has already picked off all the low-hanging fruit, I’d only recommend he should go back to the tree and see if it’s growing again, for example: • Gordon abolished TV licences for pensioners; George could abolish the surcharge for poorer households who pay by direct debit; • Gordon expanded the sizes of clothes and shoes that qualified for the children’s zero rate; George could do so again (it’s 12 years since Gordon made his change - kids have grown since then); and • As Robert Halfon MP has observed, there’s an easy change that (I believe) can still be made to the specification of Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel to bring pump prices down, without costing a penny (except through VAT). • Medhi Hasan at Huffington Post says three former members of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee have launched a scatching attack on George Osborne’s economic strategy. • Paul Bernal at Liberal Conspiracy says it is too early for bloggers to worry about the impact of the new media regulator. The Charter actually says the body should have “…the power to impose appropriate and proportionate sanctions (including but not limited to financial sanctions up to 1% of turnover attributable to the publication concerned with a maximum of £1,000,000)…” Appropriate and proportionate sanctions for a non-profit blogger would therefore be likely to be qualitative – remedies like proper and prominent apologies come to mind. The fining capability – the £1,000,000 that has made its way into press headlines – may mean something to big newspapers, but it’s effectively irrelevant to bloggers. We don’t have ‘turnovers’ of any significance – and big fines would (in general) be inappropriate and disproportionate. This is a key point that many seem to miss. This regulatory framework isn’t acting in a vacuum. Bloggers and tweeters are already subject to the law – to defamation law, to privacy law, to copyright law, to public order law, to laws concerning hate speech, to obscenity law. This framework would do nothing to change that. Those laws are complex and variably effective – and variably enforced. Personally that’s what I’d be concerned about, much more than Leveson. The illiberality of the use of public order and related law on tweeters and bloggers is something that, for me, is far more dangerous a trend than anything this Royal Charter could bring about. Lionel Barber, the editor of the Financial Times, was on the World at One t at lunchtime talking about the royal charter on press regulation. He said the FT had not decided yet whether to join the new regulatory body being set up. This has not been a satisfactory process. We have not decided at the Financial Times whether we are going to join up with the new regulator. We will be looking at the practical implications and, above all, what has been completely lost in this process, the cost. I am worried about the practical costs of, for example, allowing free access to arbitration, I am worried about claims-farming, vexatious complaints from readers and others who will tie us up in knots. This is a real problem. David Cameron visited HMS Belfast today with three Arctic Convoy veterans. According to the Press Association, they gave him a tour around the vessel, showing him where ice was cleared from the deck in perilous circumstances. This is what Cameron said: They are heroes and I think it's just so right that we are honouring them today for their incredible service 70 years ago, and I'm really proud as prime minister to have set up that review, to make that decision and to get them that medal they so richly deserve. When you hear their stories, it's truly humbling and I think it's absolutely right they get their medal. It shouldn't have taken 70 years for this to be recognised. They were very brave people and were struggling against appalling odds on those Arctic Convoys. They were performing vital duties as well, resupplying our allies in the battle against Hitler, so it's right that they should get this medal and I'm pleased the government has taken the right step. • Labour has said that new childcare support announced by the government, worth up to £1,200 per child, will not compensate for the money families have already lost in cuts to childcare support. Other groups have reacted to the plans more positively. There is a full round-up of reaction at 12.45pm. And my colleague James Ball has been looking at the winners and losers. • Downing Street has revealed that George Osborne will use tomorrow's budget to impose a further £2.5bn of cuts on Whitehall, with the proceeds to be invested in capital projects designed to kick-start growth. As the Press Association reports, health, schools, overseas aid and HM Revenue and Customs will be shielded from the cuts, and local government and police budgets will be protected for the first year, but other Whitehall departments will be told to deliver 1% savings on their day-to-day budgets for each of the two years 2013/14 and 2014/15, on top of cuts from previous budgets and autumn statements, the prime minister's official spokesman said. Osborne told Cabinet colleagues at this morning's weekly meeting in 10 Downing Street that the savings were made possible because departments have under-spent their budgets this year by more than the historical average. The chancellor has decided to take account of this under-spending when setting departmental budgets for the next two years, Cabinet was told. The Ministry of Defence will be given special flexibility to roll over unspent money, which the chancellor believes will more than compensate for the cumulative savings demanded from the department in December's autumn statement and tomorrow's budget. And capital spending plans across Whitehall will not be affected. But departments such as environment, energy, transport and justice will have to find the 1% annual savings to day-to-day \"resource\" budgets in full. In total, Osborne expects the change in spending plans to save the Treasury £2.5bn over two years. It is understood that the savings will be taken into account in Mr Osborne's spending review for 2015/16, to be unveiled in June, delivering around £1.2bn of the £10bn spending cuts which he is looking for in that year. • Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has announced that planning permission has been given for a new nuclear power station at Hinckley Point in Somerset. It will be the first new power plant in the UK for almost a generation. As my colleague Juliette Jowit reports, Davey told MPs in a statement that the French energy giant Electricite de France would be allowed to build two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point on the site of an existing power station which is due to close in 2023. The new 1.6 gigawatt reactors the first in a series of new nuclear power plants proposed by the coalition as part of its plans to replace ageing coal and nuclear plants which are due to be closed over the next few years. However the symbolic decision on planning permission still leaves Davey’s department for energy and climate change and EdF locked in tense negotiations over how much subsidy the company will get during the life of the plant. • Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has described the government's decision to use a royal charter to bring in a new system of press regulation as \"a huge mistake\" and \"laughable in the age of the Internet\". (See 12.18pm.) The Newspaper Society has also put out a statement saying the plans could place \"a crippling burden on the UK’s 1,100 local newspapers inhibiting freedom of speech and the freedom to publish\". • The Office for National Statistics has said that the annual rate of inflation rose for the first time in five months in February as dearer energy bills added to the cost of living. As Larry Elliott reports, the ONS said inflation as measured by the consumer prices index stood at 2.8% last month, up from 2.7% and the highest for nine months. Officials blamed the increase on the latest hikes in domestic energy tariffs from the UK's major suppliers and a rise in petrol prices. • Max Mosley, the former Formula One boss and a prominent campaigner for press reform, has told the Commons culture committee that he thinks newspapers will join the new press regulation body because doing so will \"save them a fortune in legal fees”. He went on: “It would be much more economic, much better commercially, for them to be part of the regulator than to be outside.” • The Green MP Caroline Lucas has said she is disappointed that Labour is not planning to join her this afternoon in voting against emergency legislation to stop the government having to pay £130m in benefit rebates to about a quarter of a million jobseekers who lost money because they refused to take part in work experience programmes. • The government has said that more than 41,000 parents were issued with a penalty notice in the last academic year because their children missed school without permission, up more than a quarter on the year before. As the Press Association reports, rising numbers are also facing prosecution for failing to pay their fines, with more than 6,300 taken to court in the 2011/12 school year. • Gary Walker, the NHS whistleblower and former manager, has told MPs that he was put under increasing pressure to hit health targets. • General Sir Nicholas Houghton has been named as the next chief of the defence staff. • Cameron has hailed the first recipients of the Arctic Star medal as a \"group of heroes\". As the Press Assocation reports, hosting a special ceremony at Number 10 Downing Street, Cameron told the group of Second World War veterans: \"I can't think of a prouder day that I have had in this job or a group of people I am more honoured to share it with.\" The creation of the Arctic Star medal, for seamen who served on the Arctic Convoys, along with the new Bomber Command Clasp, were announced by Cameron in December, 67 years after the war, following a long-running campaign. There has been plenty of reaction to today's childcare announcement, mostly along the lines of \"fine in principle, but it could happen sooner, families have already lost out and the poor could get more\". Here are the comments I've received. From Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary. Parents will be disappointed that three years into this Government they will not get any help with childcare costs for another two and a half years. While working parents won’t get any help before the next election, David Cameron is happy to help millionaires with a tax cut now. This announcement will not make up for the up to £1,500 that families on middle and low incomes have lost in cuts to childcare support – part of the £15 billion of cuts to support for children which will have been implemented before this announcement takes effect. Those who have seen their incomes cut because tax credits have been cut will not get any help, while families earning up to £300,000 will benefit. That is deeply unfair. From Sarah Jackson, chief executive of Working Families, a work-life balance organisation It is good news that the government have recognised the need to address the high cost of childcare and we’re particularly pleased to see new money has been found to support parents in work. However, we are concerned that three groups of parents, all of whom need support, do not miss out. 1. Employer Supported Vouchers filled a gap in childcare support by helping families when one parent was studying or retraining. They also provided vital support if one parent was made redundant – they enabled a family to keep a childcare place open while the out of work parent looked for work. We are concerned that help with the new childcare vouchers will be limited to families with all parents in work. It is important that families in these situations don’t lose out, and that support is available to those trying to get back into work. 2. It seems strange that low income families remain in a means-tested scheme, while higher income families get a non-means-tested system. We’re pleased to see more help for those on Universal Credit, but would also like to see 85% costs paid for those in low paid, part time work: the announcement today doesn’t appear to provide extra help to those on the lowest incomes. Parents find it difficult to work out whether to claim help with childcare costs through tax credits or vouchers now. It isn’t clear how the two schemes will work together in future – will parents be able to choose which support to claim? 3. We’re also keen to see childcare costs covered for parents of older children. The cost of after school care has risen fast, and holiday childcare is a real problem for low income parents which may force parents – particularly those with disabled children - out of the labour market. The current Employer Supported Voucher scheme is available to children up to 15 years old (or 16 if disabled) but the new scheme will only be rolled out to 12 year olds at some distant point in the future. From William Higham, director of UK policy at Save The Children Any investment in childcare is welcome and something we have repeatedly called for. As the costs of childcare soar, making work pay for parents is absolutely essential. But crucially this won't prioritise those families on the very lowest incomes and help them back into work immediately. A policy that doesn't benefit struggling families until 2016 will mean another three years of juggling costs amidst a deep recession. Some parents will be unable to work until that comes into force. Parents tell us that they are desperate to take jobs, but the costs of childcare are crippling. Prioritising those families on lower incomes to find work would be a win-win situation - for both the economy and our country's children. From John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses The proposals should increase flexibility in the workforce and encourage more women back into work. Importantly the vouchers will also be available for the first time to the self-employed. This is great news, as it starts to recognise that, due to their economic status, the self-employed often miss out on welfare provision. From Fiona Weir, chief executive of Gingerbread, the single parents charity All families have been feeling the strain of childcare fees and we are very pleased to see policies that should help those on both low and middle incomes – although substantially more of the investment should be weighted towards helping those on the lowest incomes. One in five single parents working part-time and one in four working full-time is still below the poverty line and childcare costs are one of the biggest barriers to making work pay. From Harriet Waldegrave, education research fellow at Policy Exchange Low income working families will see their childcare costs halved thanks to today’s announcement. This will be a huge help to those on the tightest budgets, and may free them up to choose care based on what they think is best for their child rather than what is cheapest. Additionally the very sensible move to per child funding means that single parents will stand to gain a great deal. Even if they currently claim employer vouchers, they will be better off by around £300 even if they only have one child. Parents with two or more children will also benefit from this change, as support increases per child rather than at a flat rate regardless of the number of children you have. There will, however, be some losers. A family with two working parents and one child will be worse off. If only one parent works, the family will not be able to get any support (unlike at present where the working parent can get vouchers), so it will be important to consider what this means for those families, for example, where one parent is in further education or training. From Anand Shukla, chief executive of Daycare Trust and the Family and Parenting Institute We warmly welcome the government’s recognition that childcare is a national priority. The government deserves praise for committing new resources to childcare during a difficult economic period. Without affordable childcare, child development suffers and parents find it difficult to work, which is bad for children and bad for the economy. From Anastasia de Waal, deputy director of Civitas As money has become increasingly tight for families, greater flexibility for how they handle their work and childcare arrangements is more important than ever ... But at least in the longer term the government should consider a more straightforward system of tax breaks which can be shared between the two parents, enabling them to better juggle the demands of work and family. The main problem with the government's support at the moment is that it gives a tax break to couples so long as they pay someone else to look after their children. It would be better - for both children and the economy - if the government let parents keep more of the money they have earned so that they can decide whether to care for their own children or pay someone else. All the main parties are supposed to be behind the new royal charter for press regulation. But it depends how you define a main party. By most counts, Ukip, with no MPs, are a fringe party. But they've been level-pegging with the Lib Dems for several months now and Nigel Farage, their leader, has claimed that they are now the third party in British politics. Does he support the royal charter? Not at all., Today he's put out this statement. For this government, or any bunch of so-called politicians to support the legislative underpinning of a voluntary agreement to oversee the press is a huge mistake, and the first step on a very slippery slope ... My own phone was hacked, but that is neither here nor there. Things go wrong in the press, as they do in every walk of life and business, but we already have legal redress. Criminal actions are criminal actions, and are already covered by the law. Those of us in my position already have recourse to the law. We must not create anything that restricts freedom. The fact that in the proposed regulation all things and all people are covered, is very disturbing, in Schedule 4 it says that it covers any printed document that includes “ containing news-related material” or any “website containing news-related material (whether or not related to a newspaper or magazine). That is your blog, your forum, your twitter feed, your Facebook page, in fact almost the whole of contemporary discourse. The only place left to speak out will be in the pub … and they are closing at 10 a week due to a series of ill thought out government measures”. The code is required to deal with “preventing the public from being seriously misled”. One man’s misleading information is another man’s factual account. It will be used to suppress proper investigative journalism that informs the public.” And then, when this all goes terribly wrong, as it will, it will require at least two-thirds of the members of each House to vote through a motion to amend or dissolve the Charter. Our Constitution has always set itself against the entrenching of laws, yet here is the Political Class trying to set this thing in stone. One must ask why a simple majority no longer suffices. Control of the media should not now, or ever, be in any way the responsibility of self-interested politicians. Any Government intervention almost always fails: this will fail. It is about politicians creating a cozy world of silence where they can live and act in peace and behave without public accountability. It is a huge mistake and is laughable in the age of the Internet. It is just completely the wrong thing to do. This is a Charter for the Suppression of the Press, not for its regulation. UKIP will fight these proposals as hard as we can, particularly through the leadership of Lord Stevens of Ludgate in the House of Lords. Farage is probably wrong about schedule 4, as I explained yesterday, but never mind. What's interesting is that Farage is now four-square behind much of Fleet Street on an issue which may not matter much to voters, but does matter enormously to the newspaper industry. For years people have talked about the \"Tory press\". Perhaps the real significance of yesterday is that that beast is now morphing into something else. There has been more reaction to the press regulation royal charter this morning. Here are some of the comments. From Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of Guardian News &amp; Media We welcome the fact that there has been cross-party agreement. The regulatory settlement is by and large a fair one, with compromises on all sides. We retain grave reservations about the proposed legislation on exemplary damages. The agreed terms are not ideal, but after two years of inquiry and debate we finally have the prospect of a robust regulator that is independent of both press and politicians. It's a big improvement on what went before. From Benedict Brogan, the Daily Telegraph's deputy editor, on his morning email The Royal Charter deal gets a near-universal raspberry this morning from those it is supposed to regulate. The biggest newspaper groups put their heads together and agreed to think about it, but you don't need to be Mystic Meg to work out that the drift is towards rejection. For my part - and this is a personal view - I've concluded that we should note the outcome, thank the politicians for their engagement, and quietly but firmly decline to take part. The glee with which most MPs voted in favour of this cockamamie scheme last night tells me this is the right course. That and the detailed accounts in some papers of Sunday night's talks: quite why Oliver Letwin thought it was a good idea to share a table with representatives of Hacked Off is a mystery. It should be remembered that David Cameron was always clear in private: if the press failed to get its skates on, or if the politics proved insurmountable, he was ready to stand aside and allow statute to be introduced. I suspect time will be allowed to let the dust settle, but it is far from certain that this scheme will fly. As for relations between press and politicians, I reckon something quite fundamental changed last night. The world will still turn, but we'll all remember who was on which side. From Adrian Jeakings, president of the Newspaper Society A free press cannot be free if it is dependent on and accountable to a regulatory body recognised by the state. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories published yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories and here's the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles. I've already posted links to two round-ups of articles relating to the press regulation royal charter. (See 10.54am.) Here are three other articles I found particularly interesting. • Benedict Brogan in the Daily Telegraph says Lynton Crosby is encouraging the Conservatives to focus on a narrow range of issues. A recent political summit at Chequers agreed the first details of the strategy Mr Crosby will be asked to deliver. He rightly always points out that a strategy is no good if you talk about it, but the outlines are emerging, and will be reinforced by the Budget. From now until polling day in 2015, the Tories will focus their efforts on a handful of issues that matter to the electorate, and will drop everything else. The field of vision has been deliberately narrowed. Take Mr Cameron’s idea to introduce minimum alcohol pricing: much was made of who in Cabinet might or might not have backed the policy, when the simplest thing to say is that it meant booze would be more expensive at a time when voters have had enough of prices going up. So the policy was dropped. Mr Cameron wants to rule out measures that will cost the voters unnecessarily. The same goes for any more social engineering: a lesson has been learnt from the reaction to gay marriage. There will be no more nods to fashion that leave voters on the Right mystified or angry. Or take immigration: every week Mr Cameron’s pollster Andrew Cooper tests what single issue voters would choose to raise with the Prime Minister if they met him in a pub. And every week for the past year, save once, the answer has been the same: immigration. Expect it to be raised at every turn by the Tories. The Chequers Group – Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne, Mr Crosby, party chairman Grant Shapps and key advisers – is in effect defining not a lurch to the Right but a new common ground for Tory campaigning centred on the concerns of the electorate, which will also include welfare, Europe and restoring the public finances to health. • Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says Cameron is being pushed around by his backbenchers. The Prime Minister knows that he must assert himself — hence the recent drama over the Leveson report — but he finds it increasingly difficult to do so with his own party. Although he has stood firm on gay marriage, almost all the other symbols of change have been dropped. The Conservatives fought the Eastleigh by-election on a campaign about immigration, welfare and Europe that was eerily reminiscent of its ill-fated 2005 general election campaign. “It was as if modernisation had never happened,” according to Nick Boles, the Planning Minister. Some wonder whether it is a coincidence that Lynton Crosby, who blew the dog whistle for Michael Howard, is back in charge of Tory strategy. In the early days of his leadership, Mr Cameron described himself as the “heir to Blair” and promised to transform the Conservatives’ reputation just as the former Labour leader had changed his party’s image. But he has never been willing to define himself against traditional Tories in the way that Mr Blair positioned new Labour in contrast to old Labour. Indeed, he rejected calls from his former adviser Steve Hilton and others to create a new “Tebbit test” and pick a high-profile fight with the Right to demonstrate his modernising credentials. • David Cameron in the Daily Mail nominates two of his “health heroes” as part of a new campaign run by the paper. Actually, I don't need to do a round-up of what the papers are saying about the press regulation royal charter - because Roy Greenslade has done a very thorough one already. Here's how it starts. Several national newspapers didn't try to conceal their hostility towards the press regulation deal today - but they refused to commit themselves to open rebellion. They held back from saying that they would not be following prime minister David Cameron across the Rubicon. Instead, with their rifles primed and levelled, they kept their powder dry. Their fury was obvious; their actions impossible to gauge. Caution was the watchword from editors who clearly loathe what has come to pass. \"Wait and free\", said The Sun's leader. It \"deserves careful consideration\", said the Daily Telegraph. Even the Daily Mail, harsh critic of the MPs' \"orgy of self-congratulation\" for reining in press freedom, said: \"It will be for the newspaper and magazine industry to decide whether it can cooperate.\" The Times, upset about the setting of a dangerous precedent, did not signal how it will respond. And neither did the Daily Express, which pulled out of the current system of regulation a couple of years ago. LabourList has also got a partial round-up of what the papers are saying about the royal charter. David Cameron and Nick Clegg were both visiting a nursery in south London together to publicise the childcare announcement. But they were asked about the press regulation royal charter. Cameron said he thought the government had set up a system that would \"endure\". I'm confident that we've set up a system that is practical, that is workable, it protects the freedom of the press, but it's a good, strong self-regulatory system for victims, and I'm convinced it will work and it will endure. And Clegg said that he hoped newspapers would agree to join the new regulator. I hope that when they examine the fine print, they will see that the incentives are strong and that it's worthwhile, not least in order to restore public trust in the conduct of newspapers, for them to join in with the system, and I very much hope they will. I'll post a round-up of what the newspapers are saying about the royal charter plan soon. In the agenda today I forgot to mention that the Commons will debate the emergency bill ensuring that the Department for Work and Pensions does not have to pay compensation to people who lost money because they refused to take part in government workfare schemes. As Shiv Malik reports, Labour is not expected to vote against the bill. Some MPs are reportedly unhappy about this. Last night MPs voted to allow the courts to impose exemplary damages on newspapers that do not join the new press regulator being set up by the royal charter announced yesterday. The measure was passed by 530 votes to 13 - a majority 517. But there were 15 Tory rebels. The 12 MPs who just voted against were: Richard Bacon (S Norfolk), Christopher Chope (Christchurch), Tracey Crouch (Chatham and Aylesford), Philip Davies (Shipley), Nick de Bois (Enfield N), Andrew Percy (Brigg and Goole), Mark Reckless (Rochester and Strood), John Redwood (Wokingham), Andrew Turner (Isle of Wight), Martin Vickers (Cleethorpes), Charles Walker (Broxbourne), and Sarah Wollaston (Totnes). Another Tory MP, Nigel Mills (Amber Valley), voted both for and against, the traditional way of registering an abstention. The two Tory MPs who acted as tellers for the rebels were: Jacob Rees-Mogg (NE Somerset) and Richard Drax (S Dorset). Inflation is up. Here's the top of the Press Association story. The squeeze on household budgets tightened further last month as official figures revealed hikes in energy bills and fuel costs sent inflation to its highest level since last May. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rose to 2.8% in February, ending a four-month run at 2.7% as the last of the major energy providers pushed through gas and electricity price rises. Higher petrol costs were also behind the increase in inflation, which puts further pressure on chancellor George Osborne ahead of tomorrow's budget as CPI edges even higher above his 2% target. Higher energy bills saw housing costs rise 0.5% between January and February, while transport prices rose 1.2% due to a 4p-a-litre surge in the cost of petrol and 9% increase in air fares. CPI continues to outstrip wage growth in the UK and the gap is expected to widen as experts predict inflation will hit 3% by the summer, with the weak pound adding to inflationary woes as it pushes up import costs. But there is mounting speculation that the government's 2% target could be shifted, with Osborne said to be preparing to overhaul the Bank of England's remit in the budget. Facing calls to do more to help the economy, Osborne is expected to launch a review paving the way for a change in the Bank's mandate. It is thought he may give policymakers a dual mandate not just to target inflation, but also include a measure of economic stability, or offer more room to hit the existing inflation target over a longer period. The Bank has already said it will tolerate above-target inflation to support recovery efforts, warning last month that inflation will rise higher and is not set to return to target for three years. Here's the news release from the ONS. And here's the statistical bulletin, with all the details (pdf). Sorry I’m late getting going this morning. I haven’t been closed down by the new press regulator; it just that a spot of illness at home upset the domestic routine. Compared to yesterday, it should be quite quiet. The government’s childcare announcement is the top political news this morning. Here’s the Guardian’s story. Here’s the Treasury’s news release with full details. And here’s what Elizabeth Truss, the childcare minister, said about it on ITV’s Daybreak this morning. We’ve got to get this system right, because this will be a system that’s much easier for parents – you can go online, log on, sign up, and you don’t have to go through your employer, it’s open to much more people, it’s open to 2.5m people, and it’s much simpler to operate, you don’t have to go through your employer. So it will take time to get the systems in place to get the voucher companies set up, but once it’s working, it’s going to be working really well, be open to lots of people. I just want to point out one thing from that report: it’s £1,200 per child; the existing scheme is just per household. So if you’ve got two kids, you’ll get £2,400, it will go all the way up to age 12 as well. So it’s going to help people with school-age children too. I’ll cover reaction to the announcement as it comes in during the day. Here's the full agenda for the day. 9.30am: The cabinet meets. 9.30am: Inflation figures for February are published by the Office for National Statistics. 9.30am: Gary Walker, the NHS whistleblower, gives evidence to the Commons heath committee. 10.30am: Max Mosley and the NUJ give evidence to the Commons culture committee about press regulation. 10.45am: David Cameron and Mark Francois, the defence minister, present the first Arctic Star medals and Bomber Command clasps at 10 Downing Street. 2.15pm: David Anderson, the independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, gives evidence to the joint committee on human rights. 3pm: David Heath, the farming minister, gives evidence to the Commons environment committee about bovine TB and the proposed badger cull. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary at around 1pm and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/06/china-carbon-emission-forecasts-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-06T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"China set to exceed carbon emission forecasts, figures show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/06/china-carbon-emission-forecasts-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/06/china-carbon-emission-forecasts-economy","fields":{"headline":"China set to exceed carbon emission forecasts, figures show","bodyText":"China is on course to exceed forecasts for greenhouse gas emissions because its economy is growing faster than expected and becoming \"locked in\" to carbon-intensive activities, two studies warn this week. The reports cast new light on the enormity of the challenge faced by the world's biggest emitter, despite its impressive investments in renewable energy, clean technology and the efficiency of its power plants. Researchers from Climate Action Tracker praised China for a \"major effort\" to meet and possibly surpass its Cancún pledge to reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 40-45% by 2020. But they said the gains were being outweighed by a faster-than-expected surge of the country's economy. By 2020, they predicted the net outcome of this \"China emissions paradox\" would be one gigatonne (GT) more carbon dioxide per year than the researchers' previous estimate of 12.5GT. The report compared China's actions favourably with those of the US, which was criticised for a \"lack of significant effort\", but the authors said their new data showed the weakness of previous estimates and the need for urgent action. \"The sooner the switch is made to cleaner energy sources, the better, in order to avoid locking in climate-damaging energy,\" said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics. A separate study suggested this may already be happening due to structural changes in the Chinese economy, which are creating new sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the world's focus on China's coal-fired power plants, a bigger threat may be the construction industry, warn the authors of Carbonising the Dragon, which was published on Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. The paper notes that China has been building the equivalent of 2bn square metres of floor space every year, which increases the country's carbon footprint enormously. Calculated at the point of consumption, cement is said to account for 46% of China emissions, and iron and steel 20% in total. In contrast, it says electricity generation – which is usually cited as the primary problem – is about 30%. Despite the surge in demand for extra power, the authors say the Chinese government's investments in renewables and nuclear power have not greatly changed the energy mix. Based on their study of data from 1992 to 2007, the paper concludes that China moved at the end of the period on to a more carbon intensive track. \"With the recent shift of China's economic growth away from export demand and towards capital investments, production is shifting towards energy and pollution intensive industries,\" it says. Since 2007, China has attempted to reverse this trend, but the paper suggests more needs to be done to ensure buildings and infrastructure are designed with sustainability and low-carbon priorities in mind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/apr/13/nuclear-power-sustainable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-13T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"Who to trust on nuclear? | Paul Dorfman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/13/nuclear-power-sustainable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/13/nuclear-power-sustainable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Who to trust on nuclear?","bodyText":"In the continuing disaster at Fukushima, Japan's nuclear safety agency has now raised the crisis level to seven: the highest category of nuclear accident. The government is widening the evacuation zone. The unpalatable truth is that the legacy of Fukushima will be with us for a long time to come. The numbers are staggering. Latest information from nuclear consulting engineer John Large tells us the six reactor cores held 487 tonnes of uranium (of which 95 tonnes includes 230kg of plutonium, an even nastier substance, from the Mox assemblies), with a further 1,838 tonnes of stored spent fuel, including 1,097 tonnes in the central pool store. There is no question there have been very significant and \"ongoing\" releases of this radioactive inventory. But even away from this disaster, facts about the industry's cost and scope to meet Europe's energy needs should be enough to give nuclear supporters pause. For instance, government figures state that a very ambitious new nuclear-build programme will give us only 4% of the energy we need. Electricity provides only 20% of our energy, and at its peak nuclear only provided 20% of electricity. Energy policy professor Steve Thomas points out that the scale of problems at newbuild reactors in Finland and France has taken even sceptics by surprise. Originally priced at €3bn, the Finnish reactor's cost is estimated to be at least €5.7bn, and the French reactor is doing just as badly. Britain's nuclear waste bill is still growing too: liability estimates have grown from £50bn in the mid-2000s to as much as £80bn at present. In stark contrast to the \"measured exit\" from nuclear power of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, the chief executive of EDF insists that new UK reactors \"will have to go ahead\" – maybe something to do with the £12.4bn they've already spent on buying UK nuclear sites. And when Nick Clegg suggested that the next generation of nuclear power stations may never be built because the recommended higher and more costly safety standards would make them too expensive, Chris Huhne launched an astonishing attack on his party leader, accusing him of behaving like a \"headless chicken\" on the issue. Huhne's more considered move was to call on the Health and Safety Executive's chief nuclear inspector, Mike Weightman, to do a \"thorough report on the implications of the situation in Japan and the lessons to be learned\". Sadly, compared to other countries, the HSE review is looking increasingly narrow, with fact-finding and weighing of evidence limited to the usual suspects, excluding involvement from energy experts who are not nuclear power proponents. It almost goes without saying that this has important consequences for public confidence in nuclear regulation and public trust in government. All this points to a key difference between the rhetoric and reality of nuclear risk management. Despite an unending round of nuclear consultations there remain fundamental questions about \"what if\" issues such as fuel supply and manufacture, vulnerability to attack, radioactive waste management, radiation risk, decommissioning, reactor coastal siting, flooding, nuclear costs and accident liabilities. However, as the E3G director Tom Burke points out, implications for the future of energy and climate policy cannot be simply reduced to the calculus of technological causation and human casualties. There is now a growing debate around the world about whether nuclear power has any role in resolving energy security and climate dilemmas. Since the challenge of achieving a transition to sustainable energy will involve a series of different options, Sussex University's Andy Stirling has suggested a range of technically and economically viable alternatives, including new European-scale networks for energy distribution (\"big grids\"); small-scale distributed energy (\"smart grids\"); large-scale infrastructures for carbon sequestration; energy market innovations from supply to services; restructuring the built and transport environment to provide for more distributed and integrated energy services; and the generation of increasingly evolving forms of renewable energy. Again Germany seems to be leading the way with viable renewable technology. The Imperial College physicist Keith Barnham notes that Germany has installed more windpower capacity than the entire UK nuclear capacity, and is adding to it at a rate equivalent to more than one reactor a year. In 2009 alone Germany installed solar photovoltaic systems with capacity equivalent to approximately four nuclear reactors. The UK is obliged under EU directives to reduce its energy intensity through efficiency and to increase its proportion of renewables to 15% by 2020, providing the foundation on which a non-nuclear, demand-side management, low carbon future can be constructed. Since we're not all energy technology and policy practitioners, it may come down to who you trust. As Andrew Warren, the director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, asks: given Germany has the confidence to go down a non-nuclear route with the same carbon objective as the UK, have EDF and Huhne really got it so right, and has Europe's most successful economy really got it so wrong?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/20/radioactive-spills-breakdown-british-nuclear-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-20T16:30:00Z","webTitle":"Radioactive spills and breakdown revealed at British nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/20/radioactive-spills-breakdown-british-nuclear-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/20/radioactive-spills-breakdown-british-nuclear-plants","fields":{"headline":"Radioactive spills and breakdown revealed at British nuclear plants","bodyText":"There have been two spillages of radioactive waste and a breakdown in an emergency cooling system at Britain's nuclear plants in the last three months, according to a report to ministers leaked to the Guardian. A brown puddle containing plutonium five times the legal threshold at which the site must notify the Health and Safety Executive leaked from an old ventilation duct at the Sellafield nuclear complex in Cumbria. This exposed \"a number of shortfalls in the design\", says the report. Groundwater at the Torness nuclear power station near Edinburgh was contaminated with radioactive tritium (an isotope of hydrogen) leaking from two pipelines. At Hartlepool nuclear station on the north-east coast of England, the backup cooling system was put out of action by a faulty valve. All three incidents occurred in February and are still under investigation by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), the government's new nuclear safety watchdog. They were sufficiently serious to be reported to ministers under safety guidelines agreed after the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine 25 years ago. Disclosure of the incidents could further delay the government's plans for a programme of nuclear power station building, already being held up by a safety review prompted by the Fukushima accident in Japan. Critics will press for the incidents to be included in the review, being led by the executive head of the ONR, Mike Weightman. The Guardian has been passed a copy of a report on the incidents sent to ministers on 18 April by Weightman. It was circulated to energy secretary Chris Huhne; business secretary Vince Cable; environment secretary Caroline Spelman; employment minister Chris Grayling; Scottish secretary Michael Moore; and Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond. In a covering letter, Weightman says that a fourth incident involving contaminated ground at Sellafield is still under investigation. The criteria for reporting nuclear incidents, which are compiled every three months, include leakages, breaches of safety limits and events where \"safe operation may be significantly affected\". According to the ONR, the response to the incidents from the companies that run the three plants was \"appropriate\". The plutonium spillage at Sellafield has been cleaned up, use of the leaking pipelines at Torness was suspended and the faulty valve at Hartlepool was fixed. But the ONR is continuing to question operators and monitor plants, to try to ensure similar mishaps do not recur. A spokesman for the ONR told the Guardian that the report to ministers on the incidents is due to be posted online. Sellafield, which is run by a group of US, French and British companies, said only a very small amount of radioactive water had leaked and that it had been discovered by its own inspectors in a redundant 60-year-old facility on the site. It said that a small amount — \"half an eggcup\" — of radioactive water was discovered but radiation limits for workers were not breached. \"Safety is our priority at Sellafield and as soon as the water was discovered, access to the area was restricted in order to protect our workforce,\" said a site spokesman. \"There was no release to the environment and no threat to anyone outside the building.\" He said: \"This is not a legal safety limit in the sense that most people would understand it (ie, a 'target' figure that if exceeded means we've broken the law, like a speed limit for example). The statutory reference made by the ONR refers to our statutory responsibility to notify the HSE if a certain level is exceeded.\" The French company, EDF Energy, which operates Britain's nuclear power stations, said that there had never been any danger to staff or the public and it always reported \"low-scale events\" to the regulator. The levels of radioactivity that leaked at Torness were \"extremely low\", according to a company spokeswoman. \"One would have to drink one tonne of the fluid found to receive a dose equal to thirty minutes flying time in an aeroplane,\" she said. The control room at Hartlepool had not shown the true position of a valve for some cooling pumps, she said. \"It is believed the valve misalignment occurred following earlier maintenance. This plant configuration is outside of our station operating procedures, however it was corrected as soon as it was identified.\" George Regan, chair of the Nuclear Free Local Authorities group, said that it was unusual for three incidents to be reported to ministers in one three-month period. There was only one incident in each quarter of 2010, three at Sellafield and one at Dungeness nuclear power station in Kent. \"With Fukushima very much in the public's mind, we are particularly concerned to hear of a coolant incident at Hartlepool,\" Regan said. \"We will be urgently seeking clarification from the ONR on why these incidents occurred and whether they are of any relevance to the current safety review.\" • This article was amended on 20-21 April. On the day of publication, it was updated to include excerpts of responses from Sellafield and EDF. On 21 April a further clarification was inserted in the story text from Sellafield, explaining the legal aspect referred to in the article, whose opening paragraph originally said leaked plutonium at the site was \"five times the legal limit\". Corresponding with that point, the photo caption was also amended: it originally referred to \"a puddle containing plutonium five times the legal safety limit\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2011/oct/19/stuxnet-worm-europe-duqu","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-19T12:31:42Z","webTitle":"'New Stuxnet' worm targets companies in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/19/stuxnet-worm-europe-duqu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2011/oct/19/stuxnet-worm-europe-duqu","fields":{"headline":"'New Stuxnet' worm targets companies in Europe","bodyText":"A highly sophisticated computer worm which has many of the same characteristics of the virus used to attack Iran's nuclear programme has been discovered targeting companies in Europe. Although the virus appears to have been spying on the systems it infiltrates - rather than attempting to vandalise them - experts say its code is so similar to the Stuxnet worm that attacked Iran, that it may have been engineered by the same people. The US and Israel were widely thought to be behind Stuxnet, which sent many of the centrifigues at Tehran's nuclear facilities spinning out of control. It took this kind of cyberwarfare to a new level. The new virus was discovered by Symantec, a leading cybersecurity firm, and has been called Duqu. Symantec would not disclose which firms had been targeted, but the company said one of its customers raised the alarm on Friday. An internal system at the firm \"raised a number of red flags\" and an investigation was launched. \"The majority of the code is consistent with the Stuxnet code,\" said a spokesman for Symantec. \"So this new worm either came from the authors of Stuxnet, or someone was given access to the Stuxnet source codes.\" Symantec said that the information Duqu gathers is sent to a server in India, but that this doesn't give any likely indication of who launched it, or who is accessing the material it finds. It believes Duqu has been targeting a specific number of organisations in Europe and was designed to automatically remove itself from systems after 36 days. Symantec suspects that Duqu may have been the first in a wave of new Stuxnet-style viruses, and that further sophisticated versions of it with a more aggressive purpose may emerge in the coming months. Its experts suspect Duqu was looking for information such as design documents, which could help it mount a future attack on an industrial control facility. \"Stuxnet really laid new territory in terms of being able to get into and being able to control these nuclear power facilities [in Iran],\" said the spokesman. \"The significance here is that since Stuxnet we have not seen anything else of that level of complexity. It has gone a little quiet since then. The question we are now asking is: 'Do they have a new goal or purpose?'\" The fear would be that Stuxnet-style viruses become mainstream, he added. According to the New York Times, Symantec launched its inquiry after being contacted by a \"research lab with strong international connections\". . A Symantec's analyst, Vikram Thakur, told the newspaper: \"This is extremely sophisticated, this is cutting edge.\" Stuxnet showed that cyberwarfare is developing fast, and is increasingly being thought of by states as a means of inflicting maximum damage with minimum risk. Earlier this year the Guardian revealed that the UK is developing its own \"first strike\" capability, and is investing millions in beefing up security around key services such as energy, and government departments such as the Ministry of Defence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/apr/02/north-korea-us-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-02T15:34:00Z","webTitle":"John Kerry: North Korean rhetoric 'provocative, dangerous, reckless' - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/north-korea-us-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/apr/02/north-korea-us-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"John Kerry: North Korean rhetoric 'provocative, dangerous, reckless' - as it happened","bodyText":"We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage with a summary of secretary of state John Kerry's meeting with South Korean foreign minister Yun Byung-se. Kerry applied stern adjectives to the recent rhetoric out of North Korea, saying \"it's provocative, it's dangerous, it's reckless.\" Kerry said the US \"will not accept\" a nuclear North Korea and it stands ready to protect itself and its allies including South Korea and Japan. Kerry and Yun agreed upon the importance of deterrence in confronting North Korean threats, Kerry said. They discussed South Korea's revised rules for engagement, which allow it to unleash an immediate counterattack in the event of a strike from the north. Kerry said he will make a trip to South Korea next week. The news conference also contained an interesting detour on Egypt, in which Kerry said the US is asking the Morsi government to talk to the opposition and the IMF and show restraint in the streets. \"This is a key moment for Egypt, it's really a tipping point for Egypt,\" he said. He dismissed the suggestion that the Obama administration had supported the Morsi candidacy specifically and now might be disappointed in Morsi's leadership. \"The US went there not to support one person or one party, but to help the Egyptian people realize the dreams they expressed there in Tahrir Square,\" Kerry said. A question from a Korean reporter for Yun. What are the paths to dialogue with the North? And for Kerry: will you send a special envoy to North Korea? Yun replies: Tension is getting higher on the Korean peninsula. We will address in case of North Korean provocation. But if N Korea decides to give up its provocations we are prepared to enter talks, including a peace process. Now Kerry: \"North Korea needs to make it clear that they are prepared to have a serious discussion about de-nuclearization. We are prepared, if they are serious. \"We have always said that we would like to try to solve the problems of the entire peninsula. That means making peace. But making peace does not mean having a nuclear North. \"We have an envoy. Ambassador Davies is appointed already, he's there. I mean he's here. He's ready to go.\" Then Kerry switches gears to talk about nuclear proliferation in general. \"We face this danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And we face it with respect to Iran. President Obama could not have been more clear with respect to both. His policy is de-nuclearization of the DPRK. The last thing the world needs is more nuclear nations. \"Secondly we face the question of Iran. Iran knows very well it faces an opportunity this weekend. The Iranian people are a great people. They have a long, long, history. Much longer than the United States. Thousands of years. \"They have a simple way of rejoining the community of nations [by accepting inspections].\" Kerry takes a question on Egypt. \"We share a very real concern about the direction that Egypt is apparently moving in,\" Kerry says. \"And this is a key moment for Egypt, it's really a tipping point for Egypt. We've been working hard to try to get the government to reach out to the opposition, to deal with the IMF. \"We share concerns about the political and economic challenges, and I communicated those concerns.\" It is our hope that there is still time to turn the corner. But the recent arrests, the violence in the streets, the lack of inclusivity of the the opposition, are all of concern today. \"The US went there not to support one person or one party, but to help the Egyptian people realize the dreams they expressed there in Tahrir square.\" Kerry echoes Carney in saying the US isn't evaluating Kim Jong Un's reasonableness or lack thereof, but is focused on the potential threat. \"I'm not going to speculate on what the intent is, or whether there's a strategy or not a strategy. \"It's provocative; it's dangerous; it's reckless. The US will not accept the DPRK as a nuclear state. The US will do what it takes to protect ourselves and our allies, Korea and Japan. And we are fully prepared to do that. This is \"why the president made the decision to redeploy missile defense as well as to take other preparations in the region, to send a very clear signal that the US will defend our allies and we will not be subject to irrational and reckless provocation. \"The US believes there is a very simple way for North Korea to rejoin the community of nations. 'They have an option: enter into negotiations on de-nuclearization and focus on the needs of their people... which we are willing to help them with. \"If they restart [the Yongbyon facility], that is in direct violation of their international obligations... it would be a breach of standard, it would be a provocative act, it would be a complete contradiction of the road we've traveled all these years. It would be a very serious step. Question 1 for Kerry: Is North Korean threat to restart nuclear facility just bluster? Is there a danger in not taking threat seriously enough? for Yun: 6-party talks have relied on China to rein in the north. Now it seems North Korea isn't listening to China. Is China's influence all used up? Yun answers on China's roll: China is now very cooperative. He cites support for the new UN sanctions. As for 6-party talks, he says, the UN resolution is supportive of this \"very useful tool\" toward de-nuclearization of North Korea. This is a very difficult test, he says, but efforts should continue. Yun is speaking. \"We had an excellent meeting today,\" he says. \"This year marks the 60-year anniversary in the US-Korea alliance.\" It's \"one of the strongest alliances in history,\" he says. \"We share the view that President Park's visit to the United States in May... will elevate our 60-year-old alliance to a new height.\" \"I discussed the serious nature of the security situation on the Korean peninsula, including North Korea's nuclear testing, as well as a series of threats from the north... Yun says the two discussed the importance of credible deterrence. \"The secretary and I expressed satisfaction made in the deterrence and counter-provocation plan. \"[We] agreed that North Korea should abandon its nuclear ambitions and bellicose rhetoric.\" Kerry runs through a series of other issues for collaboration with South Korea. At the top of the list is enforcing sanctions against Iran. At the end of the list is work on climate change. \"This is a very productive meeting,\" Kerry says. Kerry and Yun are side-by-side at the state department. That's what Kerry says, \"for decades we've worked side-by-side as allies.\" Kerry is paying tribute to the US -South Korean alliance. He's coughing something up as he speaks, sounds like he needs a water. Kerry announces he will visit Seoul next week as the South Korean president visits Washington in early May. \"We've heard an extraordinary amount of unacceptable rhetoric form the North Korean government,\" Kerry says. \"So let me be clear. The US will defend and protect ourselves and our treaty ally, the Republic of Korea.\" Kerry says the US and South Korea have a shared goal of a peaceful Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons\" We're waiting now for Secretary of State John Kerry and his South Korean counterpart, Yun Byung-se, to speak to reporters at the state department. CSPAN feed to be found here. The AP reports on Singaporean prime minister Lee Hsien Loong's visit this afternoon with President Barack Obama at the White House. Neither leader mentioned North Korea in a brief post-meeting appearance: President Barack Obama says he appreciates an outstanding partnership between the United States and Singapore on military, economic and other matters in Asia. Obama ignored questions from reporters about an alarming development in the Pacific region with North Korea announcing plans to restart its nuclear facilities. Neither Obama nor Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (lee haz-ee-en lahng) mentioned it in their brief remarks. Instead, they focused on touting their bilateral cooperation. Lee says Singapore is looking forward to hosting Navy warships as the U.S. shifts its military presence to the Asia-Pacific. ... Next week, the U.S. will begin rotational deployments of Navy vessels in Singapore, part of its efforts to shift American military presence toward the Asia-Pacific as the U.S. disentangles itself from a decade of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. The BBC has some vital stats on the Yongbyon facility: Yongbyon nuclear complex North Korea's main nuclear facility; thought to have produced the material for 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests Reactor shut down in July 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal; Cooling tower dismantled in 2008 IAEA inspectors banned in April 2009 when North Korea pulled out of disarmament talks Experts believe that, if re-started, reactor could make one bomb's worth of plutonium per year A uranium enrichment facility was revealed in 2010. An American nuclear scientist said centrifuges appeared to be primarily for civilian nuclear power, but could be converted to produce highly enriched uranium bomb fuel Nuclear test based on uranium device would be harder to monitor than plutonium Carney's briefing is done. The White House was again at pains to frame the aggressive rhetoric out of North Korea as the same old saber-rattling. Washington's public strategy in the crisis so far continues to be to diagnose basic calm and call for more calm. \"There is a pattern of behavior here,\" the White House spokesman said repeatedly. Carney gently dismissed Ban ki-Moon's warning that the situation had gone too far, saying \"We have worked with our allies. ... We will continue to do that.\" Carney was not asked about and did not address joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea currently being conducted. His description of the US response highlighted diplomatic channels between Washington and Moscow and Beijing. Secretary of State John Kerry is meeting this afternoon with South Korean foreign minister Yun Byung-se. The two are expected to address reporters shortly after 4pm ET. President Obama, meanwhile, is meeting with Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong. Carney is asked whether US intelligence has seen any signs of renewed activity at the Yongbyon nuclear complex – and if the White House does observe action, would President Obama move to prevent the facility from being taken back online? Would he accept its reopening? \"We do not accept the violation of international obligations by the North Koreans and we have taken action through the UN and elsewhere,\" Carney says. As for activity at Yongbyon, \"I believe it was an announcement that North Korea just made. I don't have any other information for you about that facility.\" Carney is asked whether the administration been in touch with outside experts from previous administrations with experience dealing with North Korea. \"I don't have any specific conversations to read out to you,\" Carney says. \"I'm confident [Obama] has had conversations with experts outside of government on this issue. \"North Korea's actions has been something successive administrations have had to deal with, especially the last several.\" A question on Kim Jong Un: People say his father, Kim Jong Il, knew where the \"line\" is, but he doesn't? Carney says speculations about Kim Jong Un, North Korea's 30-year-old leader, are not central to how the US forms its policy. \"I would say that we are judging the regime by its actions- mostly its actions but also by its rhetoric,\" Carney says. \"It's not personality based. \"The pattern we have seen long predates the current leader of North Korea. Assessments about the current leader are obviously things that outside experts make and inside experts make... [but] the policy is based on actions.\" Carney is asked what, exactly, he means when he says the United States is working with its allies. \"We are in close contact... with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo. We are regularly reaching out to Beijing and Moscow to encourage them to do more to restrain the North Koreans,\" he says. Then Carney reminds everyone that North Korea went nuclear under President George W. Bush, not President Obama. \"North Korea acquired a nuclear weapon and tested it under the previous administration and we have seen a pattern of behavior that is counterproductive to say the least\" to the presumed goal of improving the lot of the North Korean people, Carney says. Carney returns again and again to a favored line: \"There is a pattern of behavior here. A pattern that is familiar.\" Carney says China and Russia are shown a willingness to intervene in Pyongyang. \"I think it's not a mystery to anyone that China potentially has influence on North Korea. We have urged China to use that influence... we have also urged the same with the Russians. \"I think North Korea understands fully what steps it needs to take to move down the path toward ending its isolation. Those steps have to be concrete, towards abiding by its international obligations.\" The whole discussion is studiously general. White House spokesman Jay Carney is behind the podium. First question is on North Korea, on vow to reopen the Yongbyon complex. Q: \"Are you reconsidering the view that this is a familiar pattern?\" A: \"N Korea's announcement is another indication of its pattern of contradicting its own commitments and its pattern of violating its international commitments... There is a path open to North Korea... but this is surely not the path.\" Carney said it appears that Pyongyang intends to break international commitments. Follow-up Q on Ban ki-Moon's warning at the United Nations that the current conflict on the Korean peninsula has already gone too far: \"The president has expressed his concerns about the action and behavior of the regime,\" Carney says. \"We have worked with our allies. ... We will continue to do that. The steps we take... put more pressure on North Korea, further isolate North Korea. \"Meanwhile we obviously take the steps necessary to ensure the capacity to assist our allies and defend the United States.\" Carney's answer is nebulous. No mention of any new concern on the part of the Obama administration. Justin McCurry in Seoul reports on South Korea's warning that it will retaliate against any attack: South Korea has said it will strike back with immediate and overwhelming force if North Korea launches an attack on its territory, days after Pyongyang said it had entered a \"state of war\" with its neighbour. \"If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat, regardless of the political considerations,\" the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, told senior military officials on Monday. A White House briefing likely to include discussion of the Korean situation is scheduled to begin in about a half hour. The White House has sought to lower the temperature of the crisis, Ed Pilkington and Justin McCurry report: [Washington] point[ed] out that despite Pyongyang's verbal threats to retaliate with force against the imposition of UN sanctions, there were no signs of any troop movements that would suggest imminent military action. The Obama administration adopted a note of muted concern, in contrast to the increasingly shrill language emanating from both North and South Korea in recent days. At a White House press conference, President Obama's spokesman Jay Carney stressed that though the US was continuing to monitor the situation diligently, \"we are not seeing large-scale military mobilisation and repositioning of [North Korean] forces\". Pyongyang's aggressive stance was nothing new, Carney said. \"This pattern of bellicose rhetoric is not new. It is familiar, we take it very seriously and we take prudent measures in response to it, but it is consistent with past behaviour.\" Justin McCurry reports from Seoul on North Korea's declared intention to restart its Yongbyon reactor: The regime said on Tuesday that it would restart all facilities at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to ease its electricity shortage and strengthen its nuclear capability. The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of international nuclear disarmament talks that have since stalled. The move came a day after Pyongyang announced a \"new strategic line\" focusing on its nuclear programme and economy. Responding to the growing crisis, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said on Tuesday he feared North Korea was on a collision course with the rest of the world that could lead to war. Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, said the current crisis had \"gone too far\" and called for dialogue to ease tensions on the peninsula. \"Nuclear threats are not a game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counter-actions, and fuel fear and instability,\" he said during a visit to Andorra. \"Things must calm down as this situation, made worse by the lack of communication, could lead down a path that nobody should want to follow. \"I am convinced that nobody intends to attack [North Korea] … however, I am afraid that others will respond firmly to any direct military provocation.\" China, the North's only major ally and aid provider, described the possible nuclear restart as \"regrettable\", while Japan said it was a cause for \"grave concern\". Read the full report here. Welcome to our live blog coverage of diplomatic maneuvering to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula. A new round of high-level meetings is scheduled today after North Korea vowed to restart a nuclear reactor taken offline in 2007, and South Korea promised quick retaliation to any attack. President Barack Obama is meeting in the Oval Office with the Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong and secretary of state John Kerry is hosting the South Korean foreign minister. White House spokesman Jay Carney is expected to address the situation in a briefing scheduled for 12.30pm. Last week North Korea threatened to attack the South and the US in retaliation for UN sanctions introduced after the regime conducted a nuclear weapons test in February. Pyongyang is also angered by joint US-South Korea military drills, which are continuing until the end of the month. South Korea condemned on Tuesday North Korea's announcement that it plans to restart all mothballed facilities at its Yongbyon nuclear complex. The reactor in North Korea was shut down in 2007 as part of international nuclear disarmament talks that have since stalled. The facility is capable of churning out one atomic bomb's worth of plutonium – the most common fuel in nuclear weapons – every year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/feb/08/sweden-nuclear-accident-simulation-truc","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-08T13:59:02Z","webTitle":"Swedish authorities test nuclear strategy through accident simulations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/08/sweden-nuclear-accident-simulation-truc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/feb/08/sweden-nuclear-accident-simulation-truc","fields":{"headline":"Swedish authorities test nuclear strategy through accident simulations","bodyText":"Some 70 local and national, public and private organisations, involving about 6,000 people, are taking part in an exercise to test the response to a nuclear accident in Sweden. The simulation centres on the south-eastern Kalmar area and is divided into three stages. The first two were held last week. The context for the scenario is a cold winter with extra demands on the electricity supply. This causes anxiety in the community well before things go wrong at the Oskarshamn nuclear power station. The exercise is designed to assess the handling of the short- and long-term consequences of a possible accident. At 6.19am last Wednesday, the Västervik Tidningen daily explains, Pierre Stridh, the head of civil defence at Västervik, received a call warning him that the cooling system on one of the reactors had failed and that there was an impending risk of a nuclear incident. Stridh opened a special file and started making phone calls. In Enköping, a town north-west of Stockholm, officials playing the part of local people fired questions at participants in the exercise, setting in motion new tasks. By midday the situation had deteriorated, a fire having broken out at the plant. The project leader, Daniel Geisler, praised the professionalism displayed by participants. \"We were asked whether Västervik could take senior citizens in the event of an evacuation. Rather than just answering yes, officials started phoning old people's homes in the town to check.\" On the second day of stage one it was cold, there were heating problems and people were increasingly worried, casting doubt on the news provided by the media. One of the challenges facing participants was to try to keep control of the situation using social networks. Many meetings were held to co-ordinate these efforts. \"We want to see whether the warning system works, how it stands the test of time, how much the response team can put up with and what problems occur when the crisis lasts 48 hours non-stop,\" says Nina Åkermark, the exercise's spokesperson. The second stage of the simulation takes place this week and aims to gauge the impact of the accident on the community. The final stage, in April, takes the form of a seminar to report the results. At the end of January, Sweden's Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) published a report severely criticising security in nuclear power plants, after Greenpeace campaigners entered the power station at Forsmark last summer and climbed a reactor.

The US team will be aiming to beat their medal haul from 2008, when they finished third overall by winning 99 medals. Will they achieve their goal after the Games begin on 29 August? Here is a look at some of the likeliest medal contenders and some of the more extraordinary stories among those taking part. Jessica Long (swimming) The golden girl of the US swim team won three gold medals in Athens in 2004 – as a 12-year-old – then promptly won four more plus a silver and a bronze in Beijing, collecting numerous world records on the way. Now coming into her prime, she is a strong favorite for more medals in London, having won seven events at the Paralympic trials earlier this year. Long has had a remarkable journey. Born in Siberia and adopted from a Russian orphanage at just 13 months old, she suffered from fibular hemimelia, meaning she was born without fibulas, ankles, heels and most of the other bones in her feet. At 18 months her legs were amputated below the knees, so she could be fitted with prosthetics in order to walk. Long learned to swim in her grandparent's swimming pool and joined her first swim team at the age of 10. An obvious star, she is a two-time ESPY winner for Best Female Athlete with a Disability, including this year's award. Here she is winning gold in 2008: Bradley Snyder (swimming) Snyder is one of 20 US military veterans and active-duty service members taking part in these games. Having lost his vision in an IED attack in Afghanistan in September 2011, Snyder is scheduled to compete on the first anniversary of his injury. Snyder comes from a sporting family – his brother Mitchell was an NCAA Division II swimming champion. Mitchell also served as Bradley's \"tapper\" at the Paralympic trials, touching his shoulder with a stick to warn him of impending turns. Snyder's performance in those trials was extraordinary. In his top event, the 400m freestyle, he needed to exceed his personal best by 41sec to qualify for the Games – an extraordinary margin in competitive swimming of any stripe. In the event he went 54sec faster, in world-record time for fully blind swimmers and only 1.5sec behind his time over the distance at the naval academy seven years earlier. Oksana Masters (rowing) Oksana Masters may now be best known for baring all in ESPN's Body Issue this summer, but the 2012 World Cup winner hopes to change that in London – rowing with her mixed doubles partner, Rob Jones (who rows with two prosthetic legs – like Bradley Snyder, he was injured in an IED attack in Afghanistan). The pair won the World Cup in Serbia to qualify for these games, beating the fancied Brazilians. Masters has been rowing since the age of 13, having been adopted by a US family from an orphanage in the Ukraine at the age of 7. Her home village had been close to a nuclear power plant and she is a bilateral above-knee amputee, as the result of in utero radiation poisoning. Masters has achieved several firsts an adaptive rowing – often competing in and winning open singles races against slide-seat rowers at events around the US. Blake Leeper (100m) If you've been following the build-up to these games, Leeper may be a familiar face – he was the International Paralympic Committee's athlete of the month for July. Leeper burst on to the scene in 2009, when he won the 100m, 200m and 400m at the Endeavour Games. This was all despite still learning how to position his new prosthetics in the starting blocks – a 2008 Challenged Athlete Foundation had bought him the same Ossur Cheetahs that are famously used by Oscar Pistorius. The South African star is the 22-year-old Leeper's target in London – as well as his US teammate Jerome Singleton, who beat Pistorius at the 2011 World Championships. That was the first time the \"Blade Runner\" had been beaten in the event for seven years. Monica Bascio (handcycling) A 15-time US handcycling champion, Bascio comes into these games off a less than ideal preparation, having tested positive for tuaminoheptane after a World Cup event in Rome in May. A three-month retroactive ban for the infraction expires just in time for her to compete in London. The relatively light nature of the punishment related to the fact that Bascio took the substance in over-the-counter medication; the US Anti-Doping Agency applied the discretionary reduced sanction which becomes available in cases when the agency can \"establish the source of the substance and prove there was no intent to enhance sport performance or mask the use of a performance-enhancing substance\". Bascio has been a formidable handcyclist over the last decade, including winning the toughest race in the world, the 267-mile Sadler's Alaska Challenge, an astonishing five times. She has also competed at the 2006 and 2010 Paralympic Winter Games as a skier – it was a skiing accident that set her on the path to becoming a Paralympian. Bascio will now try to focus on an injury-free shot at a handcycling medal. When women's handcycling was finally included in the summer Games, in Beijing, she was hampered by a recovery from injury and could not add to the US team's total of 14 cycling medals, five of them gold. Josh Olson (shooting) Paralympic history will be made in the London shooting competition. Sgt. 1st Class Josh Olson, a member of the US Army Marksmanship Unit at Fort Benning in Columbus, will become the first active serviceman to take part. He will participate in two events – the mixed 10m air rifle and the mixed 50m prone rifle. After a rocket-propelled grenade attack in Iraq in October 2003, Olson lost his right leg. He spent 18 months in rehab, but a near-perfect clay target score during an occupational therapy session inspired him to try to stay in the army, with the Marksmanship Unit. Established in 1956, the 120-strong unit shoots competitively around the world – as a member, Olson became the first athlete with a disability to be nominated for the Army's World Class Athlete program. This year he has been training with other members of the unit, including competitive Olympians who have just returned from London. Olson's success has also contributed to the fact that the Marksmanship Unit now plans to add 24 wounded soldiers as instructors and competitive shooters from this October. Tatyana McFadden, (wheelchair racing) Known by her teammates as \"Beast\", McFadden will compete over an extraordinary range of wheelchair racing events – from the 100m to the marathon. At the age of 23 she is a veteran Paralympian, having won four silvers and two bronzes over the course of the last two Games, but of late she has come in to her own, winning the New York marathon in 2010 and the Chicago Marathon last year. In 2011, she also won four world championship golds. Like Masters, McFadden came from an orphanage in a country that had been part of the former Soviet Union. She was adopted at the age of 6 by the then commissioner of disabilities for the US health department, Debbie McFadden. Tatyana was born with spina bifida and was paralysed as the result of the impairment on spinal development caused by the condition. Her St Petersburg orphanage did not have a wheelchair for her to use, but after her adoption she was encouraged to become more active in order to build her strength. She then gravitated towards competitive sports and, ultimately, wheelchair racing. Joe Delagrave (wheelchair rugby) Joe Delagrave may not have been part of the US team that took gold in 2008, but as the 2012 national player of the year he may have a significant say in whether the US can repeat their feat. In the most bruising event in the games, the 6ft 5in former college football tight end will go into the tournament using his fifth wheelchair in as many years – the previous four having been wrecked beyond the expertise of the team's resident welder by the one game that allows – indeed seems to actively encourage – contact between wheelchairs. Despite the surface brutality that has earned the sport its nickname of \"murderball\", there is a strong tactical element to wheelchair rugby. The sport operates a classification system according to degree and nature of disability, with scores ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 – the latter is awarded to competitors with complete arm use, full trunk and ability in both hands. The combined points total for the four players on a team cannot exceed 8.0. Where the US is strong is in the number of fast competitors they have whose classification is 2.0 – they will be one of the teams to beat in London. Jen Armbruster (goalball) This will be an extraordinary sixth Paralympics for Armbruster, as she seeks to help the USA defend the gold medal they won in Beijing and tries to add to a medal tally that includes silver in Athens and bronze in Atlanta. Since losing her sight at the age of 14, Armbruster has been playing goalball, often under the guidance of her father, Ken, the US team coach. The game is played on a volleyball court with goals at each end, with players taking turns to hurl a 3-pound ball filled with bells towards the opponents' goal – or defending their goal with lateral dives across court. . As well as being a staple of the US team for two decades, Armbruster has been an emblematic athlete for the US Paralympics team. She was the flag bearer for the 2008 games. Myles Porter (Judo) Having finished fifth in Beijing, despite being a relative latecomer to judo after taking it up at the University of Toledo, Myles Porter has been making up for lost time, reaching high national standings in both the Paralympic and sighted versions of the sport, despite the differences in rules and moves between the two codes. He has reached as high as No3 in the men's 100kg sighted division. The most notable breakthrough for Porter, though, was his defeat of the current Paralympic champion, the four-time gold medalist Antônio Tenório da Silva of Brazil, at the 2011 Parapan American Games. That victory was widely seen as a marker of Porter's progress in advance of London and a real confidence boost in advance of the Games. ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/11/vestas-jobs-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-11T14:40:15Z","webTitle":"Vestas says offer of 2,000 new UK jobs depends on energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/11/vestas-jobs-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/11/vestas-jobs-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Vestas says offer of 2,000 new UK jobs depends on energy policy","bodyText":"The world's biggest wind turbine manufacturer is offering to create over 2,000 jobs at the Kent port of Sheerness but warned the green energy project could be killed off by any uncertainty over government policies. Vestas has obtained exclusive rights to land – the equivalent to 93 football pitches – that would enable it to construct a huge new production facility to build a generation of mega-turbines to be used in the North Sea. \"Before our customers can provide us with the needed order pipeline, they need stability in the market and a long-term political and regulatory certainty that ensures their business case,\" said Anders Soe-Jensen, president of Vestas Offshore. \"Making that happen lies in the hands of policy makers, so we are looking forward to seeing the UK government providing the best possible terms for the offshore wind market to truly take off and the potential jobs becoming a reality,\" he added. The Vestas executive said the timing of a report from the government-established climate change committee on Monday which raised questions about the high cost of offshore wind \"could not be worse for us.\" Soe-Jensen warned it would be a \"shame\" if a great new job opportunity at Sheerness was lost. But he remained optimistic that Vestas could obtain the orders from the deep sea \"Round 3\" projects that would allow the Danish-based company to build vast new turbines that would be as tall as the \"Gherkin\" office block in the City of London. Vestas has also built a new research and development centre on the Isle of Wight but created controversy when it closed a facility for building smaller turbines in the summer of 2009. The renewable energy sector worldwide has been facing tougher times as politicians worry about wider budget cutbacks and seek to reduce subsidies to wind and solar despite a continuing desire to cut carbon emissions and tackle global warming. But there was a boost on Tuesday from Japan where the prime minister promised to scrap a plan to obtain half of its electricity from nuclear power and said it would promote renewable energy as a result of its nuclear crisis. Naoto Kan said Japan needed to \"start from scratch\" on its long-term energy policy after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by a 11 March earthquake and began leaking radiation. A United Nations report out earlier this week predicted that if the regulatory and other conditions were right renewables could provide 80% of all the world's energy needs after 2050."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/may/14/letter-nuclear-power-carbon-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-13T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Letter: Carbon cost of nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/14/letter-nuclear-power-carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/may/14/letter-nuclear-power-carbon-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Carbon cost of nuclear power","bodyText":"Your account of the part buyout of British Energy assets (Centrica to buy 20% stake ion British Energy from EDF,\" 11 May) asserts that nuclear power is \"carbon free\". It is not, and this sloppy statement demonstrates the democratic dangers of the nuclear industry repeating this falsehood to gain support for its planned UK expansion, as unquestioning journalists repeat it as if it is fact. Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from uranium mining, milling, enrichment and nuclear fuel fabrication, all prior to fuel irradiation, and spent fuel management, radioactive waste storage and/or disposal, post irradiation, and ultimately reactor decommissioning. In 1999 the Department of Trade &amp; Industry published a study that calculated that for each kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity generated, nuclear produces 4g of CO2, while wind produces 8g, and hydro-power 8-9g. Additionally, nowhere in the 3,352-word statement issued by Centrica to explain its intended purchase of a 20% share in British Energy (BE) does it explain whether this shareholding will include the gas company taking a pro-rata 20% share in BE's plutonium stockpile, of at least 15,000kg. In a written parliamentary answer on 30 October last year to independent MP Dai Davies, energy minister Mike O'Brien revealed: \"British Energy owns a relatively small quantity of plutonium that has arisen from reprocessing ...

An annual ball thrown by the Queen for staff at her Balmoral residence – which was expected to take place on Thursday as usual – has been shifted back until the day after Scots vote in their referendum on independence. The question is, however, will Friday’s ball be a celebration ... or a wake? “It’s might just be the most exclusive ball in the world because you cannot go there unless you are staff or, of course, a member of the royal family,” said one worker. “You might even find yourself dancing with the Queen.” “It’s quite a big ceilidh, with pipers and plenty of music, like something out of the movies and usually on this Thursday.” While no public announcement has been made about the event, some believe that the date was changed from the traditional Thursday in order to allow staff and those involved with working on the Balmoral estate to vote in the referendum. Compared to many other parts of Scotland, there was little evidence of the referendum campaign on display this week in the nearest villages to Balmoral Castle, Braemar and Battaler. The Queen will have seen the occasional ‘No’ banner in fields on the roads leading to her estate and, if she squinted, may even have seen the odd ‘Yes’ sign in a window of a premises in Ballater. “Some shops will also put up union flags as well as no signs in their window,” said Campbell Parker, a young Edinburgh native now working in a bookshop in Ballater. Ed Miliband has been forced to abandon a walkabout in Edinburgh after he became caught in a crush of media and pro-independence protesters, who drowned out his interviews with shouts of “fucking liar” and “serial murderer”. Here’s Severin Carrell’s audioBoo of the event. Tory MP Brian Binley has protested about David Cameron’s decision to continue the Barnett formula. A poll has shown that 30% of voters think David Cameron should resign if there’s a yes vote. Another poll has found that 63% of people in England and Wales want Scotland to stay in the UK. Some 18% in favour of independence and 19% unsure. As the Press Association reports, the TNS poll found 40% of English and Welsh adults believed Scottish independence would leave the rest of the UK worse off, with 18% believing a Yes vote would make the rest of the UK better off. Despite the potential implications for the union, the poll found a high level of disengagement in England and Wales, with only 55% saying they cared about the outcome of Thursday’s vote and more than a quarter (28%) saying they did not care. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Ed Miliband said he say the “ugly” side of the yes campaign today. He told the BBC: I think we have seen in parts of this campaign an ugly side to it from the Yes campaign. I think debates should be conducted in a civilised way, I think that’s very, very important, but I understand that passions run high. What I’ve enjoyed about this campaign, including today when I get the chance, is meeting people who are genuinely undecided. Here’s the ITV video of Ed Miliband’s encounter with the yes protesters. (Some readers think the “disrupted” headline is unfair, but I’ve spoken to my colleague Severin Carrell, who was there, who says it is accurate. The loud shouting by the yes campaigners disrupted the event, he says.) Yes Scotland has issued a fresh response to the “vow” about more powers for Scotland issued by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. (See here.) This is from Blair Jenkins, its chief executive. People across Scotland will find it very hard to swallow promises of “fairness” from David Cameron – a Tory Prime Minister who has imposed unwanted and punitive policies such as the Bedroom Tax, nuclear weapons based here in Scotland and tax cuts for the very richest in society. It is the policies of David Cameron’s government that have seen rocketing use of food banks, policies that threaten to push an additional 100,000 Scottish children into poverty by 2020, according to the Child Poverty Action Group. These are policies which Scotland has rejected, but which we have to put up with anyway under the present system. There’s nothing fair about that. The truth is that without independence, Scotland’s future remains in the hands of Westminster politicians like David Cameron, who carry very little support here and were not elected by the people of Scotland. That seems to guarantee more of the same, which is certainly not a fairer Scotland. Independence will not magic up a fairer Scotland overnight, but most of us can accept that Labour or SNP led governments in Scotland are more likely to pursue an agenda of social justice than interchanging Labour or Tory led governments at Westminster. Vincent de Rivaz, the EDF Energy chief executive, has sent a letter to staff saying independence would create uncertainty for the energy sector, the BBC reports. EDF operates two nuclear power stations in Scotland. Will David Cameron have to resign if there is a yes vote? Almost a third of people think so, a new poll suggests. My colleague Frances Perraudin has the details. The latest poll conducted by ComRes for ITV News has shown that nearly one third (30%) of Britons think that David Cameron should resign if Scotland becomes independent, compared to nearly half (48%) who think he shouldn’t. Even if Scottish voters reject independence, 25% of those surveyed thought Cameron should resign if the vote is close. The poll suggested that Ed Miliband would be held slightly less to blame, with one in four (24%) saying they think he should resign as leader of the Labour Party if Scotland becomes independent. ComRes collected information from 2,052 British adults through an online survey between 12th and 14th September. Nearly half those polled (48%) would support more decision-making powers – on issues like tax, policing and education – for English and Welsh regions, although another 47% also opposed Wales having an independence referendum. 63% of those asked said they thought it would be a good thing is Scotland remained part of Britain, though more than half (54%) thought that Scottish MPs in Westminster shouldn’t be allowed to vote on issues that don’t affect Scotland. 40% were in favour of setting up an English parliament for only English MPs and only 9% thought London should become independent from the rest of the UK. Here’s a Scottish referendum reading list. Tom Bradby on his blog says he is not enjoying covering the Scottish referendum campaign for ITN. Pretty much all reporters I chatted to yesterday agreed that the level of abuse and even intimidation being meted out by some in the ‘Yes’ campaign was making this referendum a rather unpleasant experience. And whilst I am sure both sides have been guilty, the truth - uncomfortable as it is to say it – is that most of the heckling and abuse does seem to be coming from the Nationalists. I have been with ITN for 25 years and have covered events all over the world in that time. I’m not going to suggest that this bears comparison with really bad places, but it is certainly highly unusual in the democratic world. For example, my first major job as a correspondent was in Ireland in the early nineties and, despite the fact that there was a bitter war going on all round me that took many lives, I experienced virtually no personal hostility at all from anyone. They didn’t lob accusations of bias around every time you asked a question either. Robert Peston on his blog looks at the economic case for independence. All that said, what Ireland demonstrates is that a small English-speaking independent country, in the European time zone, with a highly educated population, a culture of hard work and a strong sense of patriotism is likely to prosper in the long term. What Ireland cannot prove one way or another is whether the immediate economic tariff or price for that putative long term prosperity is worth paying. John Curtice at the Conversation assesses how the campaign has run. Arguably that still meant that last week was a better one for No than for Yes. Stopping the Yes bandwagon while it still appeared to fall short of the 50% mark could be regarded as a damage limitation exercise well done. On the other hand, the apparent failure of the independence warnings from banks and business (not after all the most popular of institutions) to make any significant dent in Yes support means the No side can still hardly afford to rest on its laurels. Thomas Raines at Chatham House says Scots are more likely than English voters to want an ethical foreign policy, and less likely to want the UK to be a great power. On moral and ethical questions, the regions seem to have divergent views. A majority of Scots polled (52%) think that British foreign policy should be based at least in part on ethical considerations, rather than simply pursuing the national interest at all times (33%). Londoners tend to agree (47% to 35%). But this is in marked contrast to the rest of the South, the Midlands and Wales and the North, in which national interest trumps ethics (most clearly in the North; 38% to 47%). Scots are less likely than others to think the UK should seek to be a ‘Great Power’, although even in Scotland a majority (53%) still support this view. In the South, that figure is 66%. Rosamund Taylor on her EasterlyEU blog examines why a large majority of Poles in Scotland are planning to vote no. The late surge to Yes may have changed minds. But these migrants were notably pessimistic about an independent Scotland, with a 31/69 Yes/No split among those declaring for either side. (I’ve extrapolated these figures as the authors didn’t make it a top-line finding in their briefing.) Yet, as the SNP makes clear, an independent Scotland would seek to join the EU and welcome new migrants regardless of whether it succeeded. So why the hesitation? Why did the pro-Yes case made by a Poznan academic attract the comment (also in Polish): “I haven’t read this much bullshit in a long time”? Here is some Twitter reaction to the Cameron/Miliband/Clegg “vow”. Some of the tweets are from commentators I recognise, and some aren’t. If they’re all sceptical (or worse), that’s because I could not find any positive ones. From the FT’s John McDermott From Blair Jenkins, the Yes Scotland chief executive From the author Irvine Welsh Here’s more on Ed Miliband receiving what, in another context (Jim Murphy), was described as “a warm yes welcome”. It’s from my colleague Severin Carrell. Ed Miliband was forced to abandon a walk-about in Edinburgh after he became caught in a crush of media and pro-independence protesters, who drowned out his interviews with shouts of “fucking liar” and “serial murder”. The Labour leader became the latest pro-politician to be abused and harangued as news of his unannounced visit to meet shop workers and voters at the St James Centre in central Edinburgh leaked in advance. A small group of yes activists ran after reporters and TV crews who had gathered outside the centre as they were ushered inside the shopping centre to watch Miliband’s walkabout, leading to chaotic scenes in the mall. The activists began shouting loudly, drowning him out, adding to the crush of photographers, reporters and Labour activists who had gathered around the Labour leader, the Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont and Margaret Curran, Labour’s shadow Scottish secretary. During one snatched interview audible over the shouts and chants, Miliband said he was in Edinburgh to argue for “more powers for a stronger Scotland as well as NHS funding guaranteed, and that’s got to be weighed up against the big risks of voting yes. And that’s the choice people are facing in the last couple of days of this referendum campaign.” “I’m here to meet some voters,” he added. Several attempts to meet shopworkers had to be cut short amid the noise and crush, before Miliband was ushered out through a side exit onto a footbridge leading over Leith Street, chased by a throng of news media and protesters. Sir Sean Connery, the SNP’s most famous ex-pat supporter, won’t be returning to Scotland for Thursday’s vote, the Edinburgh Evening News reports. Not that anyone was expecting him back, I believe .... Here’s an extract from its story. [Connery’s brother] Neil Connery, himself a retired actor, said: “I really don’t believe he will be making an appearance this week in Scotland.” Asked about the whereabouts of his brother so close to the vote, he replied: “There’s only a certain amount of days Sean can be in the country for tax reasons, so I know that he intends to use them wisely.” Yes Scotland is highlighting a report from Capital Economics saying independence could be good for the oil industry. “An independent Scottish government would have a greater incentive to create a favourable policy environment for the sector,” it says. Here are some more tweets from the disrupted Ed Miliband visit. They’re from journalists. Ed Miliband is campaigning in Edinburgh. Yes campaigners were on hand to welcome him, and it all got a bit chaotic. Gordon Brown was right about libraries only allowing children to take out a certain number of fiction books, and making them take out non-fiction too, in his youth. See here. But it was not just in Scotland; readers tell me this was the practice in English libraries too. Adam Fletcher sent me this. That Gordon Brown point about Libraries rationing fiction - I can’t speak for Scotland, but it was true in Hampshire in the late 1970s and 1980s when I was growing up. Rather than one swipe card, you were given, I think four fiction and four non fiction tickets, and had to stick to the different sections of the library with them. I suspect it was a common practice before computerisation of the catalogue and stock control in the late ‘80s. And here are some tweets. Frances Perraudin sends this vine of yes signs around Edinburgh. Brian Binley, the Conservative MP for Northampton South, has used a post on his blog to protest about the commitment from David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg (or quasi-commitment – quite what it means is not clear – see here) to protect the Barnett formula. Binely wrote: I resent that parliament has been ignored and subordinated in this debate: not that long ago, changes in government policy were explained first to parliament. And to top it all we are now told that the three leaders have promised to maintain a charitable situation wherein each Scottish citizen is rewarded with £1,300 per year more than their English counterpart for public expenditure, and that without a by-your-leave from parliament. On this and many other issues parliamentarians haven’t been able to question those making ever more elaborate announcements as party leaders and not as ministers. Many residents of Northampton thought that they had voted Gordon Brown out of office four years ago, only to find him swanning around making promises left, right and centre apparently with the authority of a government minister. Binley said he also agreed with John Redwood on the need for an English parliament. My support is for an arrangement similar to that explained by John Redwood, whereby English MPs spend some time at Westminster each week considering business that affects only those of us in England (much in the same way that the Scottish grand committee used to debate Scottish affairs). Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs would not be able to participate in these proceedings, but would concentrate on their own affairs. The United Kingdom parliament, meeting at Westminster, would consider matters of import to all parts of our country, at other times. And here is Redwood making that argument. In support of the no campaign, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, the Italian-born mayor of Camden in London, has the Scottish flag flying atop his town hall. In Dundee, Steven Morris has been speaking to Tony Cox, a yes campaigner who says the working class are winning it for his side in that city and across Scotland. Meanwhile, Dundee resident Albert Mitchell explains why for the first time he is interested and engaged in politics. And Joan Chalmers, a Tory party member and leading light in the “no thanks” campaign, explains the reaction she gets on the streets of Dundee. Much of what Gordon Brown said in his speech earlier he has said before, but there was one passage, on the “distinctiveness of Scotland” that I had not heard before. It is worth flagging up because it’s not just funny, but also rather revealing. I know the distinctiveness of Scotland. We’re sometimes too pessimistic. You know that minister who said: “In the beginning there was nothing. And then things got worse.” And you know it’s a good day, and people say, well, my mother used to say, “it’s going to be rain tomorrow”. And you know when I was a kid, going to my local library in Kirkcaldy, you were allowed to take out four books. But you could only take out two fiction books. You could not be allowed to have the fun of reading fiction. You had to take non-fiction books as well. Is it really true that Scottish children in the 1950s and 1960s were forced to read non-fiction? Anyone know? On Newsnight last night Inigo Mendez de Vigo, the Spanish minister for European affairs, said that it would take an independent Scotland about five years to join the EU and that it would have to apply from outside, not from inside. It is crystal clear that any partner member state that leaves the member state is out of the European Union. If they want to apply again, they would have to follow the procedure of article 49 of the treaties. That means the status of candidates should be granted to the new candidates. This decision has to be taken unanimously. Then it has to go into a negotiation of the 35 chapters. At the end of this negotiation there is also a vote, by unanimity. Then, if again this is granted, it has to go to the European parliament, where a vote is taken by the absolute majority of its members. If at the end of the process, a new vote is granted, it has to go through ratification process of the 28 member states ... It is a process that takes more or less five years. Better Together have released the quote, alongside a comment from Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary. He says this is “yet another expert contradicting what Alex Salmond has said about the EU membership of a separate Scotland.” My colleague Severin Carrell has obtained a copy of the leaked NHS document that has triggered the row between Labour and the SNP over the impact of a £450m shortfall in health spending (pdf). Frances Perraudin has been out talking to people on Princes Street, Edinburgh’s main shopping street, about the “vow” on the front page of today’s Daily Record that the three main parties will “deliver change to Scotland” in the event of a no vote. From the people she spoke to the general view seemed to be that the move was too little, too late. Cat Thomson, a 20-year-old student, said that she was definitely voting no, so the vow made no difference to her. “Maybe the undecided voters will be swayed by it though. I hope so.” Amie Robertson, another 20-year-old student, who is campaigning for the Radical Independence movement, a leftwing, green branch of the independence campaign, said that she would vote for independence because Britain worked on an elitist system and a vow from “three rich, white men” would not change people’s minds. Rod Fleming, a 36-year-old IT worker, said he thought the three party leaders should have clarified their position from the start. “It feels a bit panicked in light of the polls, which gives you more reason to distrust the Westminster government.” He said that he had already sent his postal vote and voted no, but was beginning to regret his decision. His colleague Scott Suttie, 32, was less cynical about the effect the vow might have on the voting public, saying that it solidified the arguments being made by the Better Together campaign. “The levels of political engagement are so high here at the moment that they [Westminster politicians] wouldn’t get away with not delivering.” Gordon Brown has accused the SNP of lying about the threat to the NHS in Scotland. In a speech in Clydebank, the Labour former prime minister highlighted figures in a leaked paper that appear to show a £450m shortfall in SNP health spending plans and insisted that the joint “vow” signed by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg yesterday (at Brown’s instigation) showed that the Scottish NHS could be fully protected without Scotland having to leave the UK It is the SNP who are perpetrating a lie about what the NHS can and cannot do in Scotland. Over these next few hours, you must remind the people in Scotland the NHS has the powers and the Scottish Parliament has the powers to fund the health service, to protect the health service, to stop any privatisation, and to keep the health service in public hands. The speech was essentially just a beefed-up version of the standard stump speech that Brown has been giving in Scotland for at least a week, but the leaked NHS material has put the SNP on the defensive. More significantly, the vow, and the declaration from Cameron, Miliband and Clegg that “we can state categorically that the final say on how much is spent on the NHS will be a matter for the Scottish parliament”, may neutralise an issue that has worked well for the yes campaign in recent weeks. Alex Salmond, Scotland’s first minister, has said that the claim that the leaked document proves that the Scottish NHS faces cuts of £450m is “completely untrue”. Efficiency savings would protect frontline services, he said. Salmond has dismissed the Cameron/Miliband/Clegg vow as a “desperate offer of nothing”. Angus Robertson, the SNP leader in Westminster, said the offer was dishonest because there are signs that Tory MPs will refuse to back more powers for Scotland. Robertson cited this article in the Daily Telegraph. Here’s an extract: One female Tory MP said Mr Cameron’s promise, issued just two days before the polls open, was “desperate”. “There will be a bloodbath. Last night as I was listening to Cameron saying we are going to be providing all these additional benefits to Scotland, when we are struggling in so many areas of the UK. “It’s all happening on the hoof, in cliquey conversations on telephones in Downing Street. It isn’t happening, and there are a number of us who are incensed who will make sure it isn’t going to happen. But let’s see what the results are first.” Robertson also said that Christopher Chope, a Tory MP, said at the weekend that Tory MPs could block the plans. Robertson said: The Westminster revolt against any more powers for Scotland is up and running, and exposes the utter deceit at the heart of the No campaign that additional powers would follow a No. Tory MPs are promising a ‘bloodbath’, and are itching to slash Scottish spending - which would do huge damage to our National Health Service. On the World at One an hour ago Chope repeated his warning about MPs voting down further devolution for Scotland. We don’t yet have government by decree in this country, we have a parliamentary democracy, so anything that’s been said by the party leaders is obviously subject to the will of parliament. [What the party leaders wanted] didn’t happen when the three party leaders agreed we had to reform the House of Lords: parliament spoke up. My constituents are saying ‘hang on a minute, you can’t have a devo max settlement for Scotland which we’re paying for without having a look at the balance of competences and powers within the United Kingdom as a whole’. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has said that Scotland would face “unprecedented austerity” if it used sterling without a currency union and defaulted on its debt - an option floated by Salmond. Stewart Hosie, an SNP Treasury spokesman, has told the World at One an independent Scotland would have thrive economically. Standard and Poor’s said that even without oil and gas, just the onshore economy, Scotland would qualify for their highest economic assessment. Moody has said that looking at all the possible outcomes, Scotland would be among the wealthiest sovereigns in the world. If you’re a serious investor, and whether you are investing in business in Scotland or are looking to buy sovereign debt, you would see Scotland as an extremely attractive proposition indeed, precisely because of the underlying strength of the economy. He also confirmed that the SNP wanted a currency union. If that did not happen, Scotland would not be defaulting on its debt, he claimed, because “the UK government have confirmed ... it’s their debt.” Among the negative predictions of the impact of Scottish independence, this must be one of the most extreme: a former Italian prime minister raising the spectre of the events that led to the first world war. My colleague John Hooper has sent me the details. Italy’s former prime minister, Enrico Letta, a member of the centre-left Democratic party, on Tuesday likened the possible exit of Scotland from the UK to the event that sparked the first world war a hundred years ago. In a letter to the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, Letta wrote that to compare the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo with “the possible consequences of Scottish independence as a result of Thursday’s referendum may not be too far-fetched”. He said it would strengthen the hand of populist leaders and reinforce the likelihood of a British exit from the EU, which would be left “smaller and poorer”. Whole forests will have died to produce the leaflets that are about to fall through Scottish letterboxes. My colleague Severin Carrell has sent some details. Scottish voters will be deluged with leaflets and contact from yes and no activists in the closing 48 hours of the campaign, with Yes Scotland out in front with the sheer scale of their offensive. The pro-independence campaign is promising to deliver 2.6m leaflets, a direct mail-out to 1.2 million pensioners, newspaper adverts and 300 billboard sites around the country. The pro-UK Better Together campaign, which insists its effort is more precision-guided, has a more modest 200 billboards, and 1.5m leaflets going out this week. It also has 30,000 volunteers primed for their “get out the vote” operation on Thursday. This is what Charles Kennedy, the former Lib Dem leader, said at a Better Together event in Glasgow. Together, our family of nations has achieved great things. In so many ways we have built the best. In the NHS we have the best health service in the world. We are the world’s second-largest aid donor, helping the planet’s poorest. And in the BBC we have the world’s best broadcaster, too. We’ve built these things together. And I don’t believe that we should walk away from them. And this from Ben Quinn: I’m here today in Aberdeen talking to some of the referendum’s switherers – a Scottish term meaning someone who is hesitating or vacillating from one position to another. At this late stage, there seem to be plenty in Scotland’s third most populous city, which is known as the “granite city” or, more recently on account of the economic boom emanating from beneath the seas to its east, “Europe’s oil capital”. Among the people I met were … Lorraine Clark, 53, transportation worker “I have yet to make up my mind. Financially it worries me a lot, and then what happens with the army. How can they split all that up?” asked Clark, the mother of former members of the armed forces. “If I looked at it not from a selfish point of view and not worrying about my own circumstances at the moment in financial terms then I would definitely vote yes for the generations coming after us. If they answered some of those questions and I was happy then I would be a yes voter, but at the moment I’m scared. I’m not sure.” Callum Hogg, 20, IT worker “At the moment I’m undecided because I just haven’t seen enough of the facts to push me one way or another to be honest,” said Hogg, a first-time voter waiting beside a statue of Robert the Bruce before a job interview at Aberdeen’s council offices. “I have had some things through the mail but there has not been anything that has caught my eye. The currency issue probably worries me most. I think we would probably keep the pound but I don’t know if we would have control over our own destiny even then. “[For] most of my friends who are leaning towards yes it’s not about nationalism. They just see it as an opportunity to create a better society. It will probably be some time tomorrow when I make up my mind. I’ll go on to Google and see if I can look it up from both sides and try to avoid any bias.” Stephen Thompson, the Dundee United chairman, is backing yes, according to the BBC. He says: A yes vote will allow Scotland to maximise its potential on the world stage. One of our biggest exports and assets has been our people from all walks of life, social and political background – and one of the greatest challenges we face is to grow job opportunities so more of our brightest youngsters stay and work here in Scotland. There is no one better placed to make the best of Scotland than the people of Scotland and no amount of negativity from the no campaign or media can change that. Following are some brief interviews Steven Morris carried out with key people from the yes campaign at their hub in Dundee. Mike Strachan, manager of the yes campaign hub in Dundee “We get a little bit more time to speak to people in here. They want to engage with us so it’s a different feeling to on the doorstep. We’ve just had an undecided [voter] come in and talk to us and they bought a yes T-shirt on the way out. “We’re doing best in the traditional working-class areas, on the housing schemes, where people are affected most by poverty and policies like the bedroom tax. In some places our canvassing shows that 80% or more would be voting yes. “If it was just about winning Dundee we’d be celebrating now, but every vote counts. We can win Dundee and help other places where the yes vote isn’t so strong. It’s all about getting the vote out now.” Jimmy Black, SNP councillor and spokesperson for the yes campaign in Dundee “I don’t think any of the traditional polls can really be relied on. The electorate has expanded so much and there will be such a high turnout. “We’re getting support from all sides of the political spectrum, including old Labour and even Tories. We went and did a registration drive at a mosque and got support there. “I think after the referendum, when Scotland is independent, we may have a different way of working together. It’s harder to fall out with someone you’ve worked with and have got to like.” Alex Salmond has said if the rest of the UK refused to agree to a currency union, an independent Scotland could refuse to pay its share of UK debt. He says he does not favour that, but he has floated it as a last-resort option. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has been looking at the idea. It concludes that continuing to use sterling without a currency union, and defaulting on debt in the way Salmond has suggested, would be a disaster. It has set out its thinking in this paper, Is this Plan B? (pdf) Here is the conclusion. If the Scottish government combines ‘Sterlingisation’ with reneging on its fair share of UK debt, which judging from the first minister’s comments may be Plan B, this would increase rather than reduce the fragility of the currency arrangement. The ‘appeal’ of this option might be that it reduces the internal and external funding requirements. However, this would be a false economy. International investors are likely to see walking away from debt as ‘opportunistic’ and either charge very high borrowing premiums or exclude Scotland from international markets. This would imply an immediate return to a fiscal surplus and therefore unprecedented austerity. Entry into the EU would be out of the UK’s hands, even if it supported Scotland’s case. This would raise doubts about the outlook for exports, particularly for financial services. Whether the citizens of Scotland would accept this policy simply to hold on to sterling would become a source of speculation with a low level of reserves as defence. We would expect the currency arrangement to fail and Scotland would be forced to introduce its own new currency within one year. Introducing a new Scottish currency has always been the most sensible option. We would recommend this is carried out before losing £7bn of foreign exchange reserves rather than after. Political editor Patrick Wintour reports: After Gordon Brown’s speech my colleague Libby Brooks spoke to two people in the audience, Labour councillor Kath Ryan and Duntocher tenants’ rep Phyllis Gillan. Gillan said that parts had her in tears. Better Together and the SNP are going at it hammer and tongs over health. Alistair Darling, the Better Together leader, renewed his attack on the Scottish government over the reported £450m black hole in its health budget. In a statement he said: Today we learn that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon have been deceiving us. We find they are planning on cutting £450 million from Scotland’s health budget, something over which they have total control yet they were going to keep this under wraps until after the referendum. I find that quite appalling after all the things they’ve been saying about the health service. All these scare stories, all the time they’ve known that the cuts are coming along but we weren’t going to be told about it until after the polls close. Alex Neil, the health minister in the Scottish government, responded to the Better Together claims in his own statement. And he challenged Labour to say what taxes Labour would raise if they wanted to spend more on health. He said: This is a spectacular own goal from Gordon Brown, who has inadvertently made the case for independence. If Westminster parties say that there should be an increase in taxes, they must say now which taxes and by how much ... The NHS budget planning paper makes the point that even with those real terms increases, the NHS still have to rise to challenges – which makes the point that only with a yes vote and full control of Scotland’s finances will we be able to properly protect Scotland’s NHS. The main budget challenge identified in the paper is as a direct result of Westminster decision-making on pensions. With independence we can stop wasting money on Trident and the Westminster system, including the House of Lords, and instead focus on Scotland’s needs. We’ve fully protected Scotland’s NHS within our fixed budget, despite the Tories’ cuts to Scotland. With a yes vote and independence we can make sure it is never again under threat from Tory-led Westminster austerity. And here’s a SoundCloud with an extract from Gordon Brown’s speech. It’s Brown talking about the SNP’s “Dad’s Army” defence policy. My colleague Libby Brooks has sent me this from Gordon Brown’s speech. Speaking to an audience of Labour supporters at Clydebank town hall, Gordon Brown is hammering home his message that the greatest threat to the NHS in Scotland is the SNP. In a direct assault on the yes campaign’s most popular message on the doorstep, that independence is the only way to protect the health service from Westminster cuts and privatisation, he said that the SNP’s lies had been laid bare and that the Scottish government already had the necessary powers to improve the NHS. The Labour party in Scotland was ready to take power and make those improvements if the SNP were not, he said. This is a line aimed squarely at swithering Labour voters whose disillusionment with the party is pushing them to yes. He made great play of the history of the area, saying that it was in the history of Clydebank that the case for staying within the UK is made, talking about the campaigns led from Clydeside for a UK-wide welfare state, later a nationalised healthcare system and a national minimum wage. Brown is very much on home territory here, receiving a boisterous ovation just now as he concluded. A yes vote was not about creating a nation, a parliament or even about getting more powers. “The real proposition is, do you wish to end every constitutional link you have with the rest of the UK,” he said. Against a range of experts all Salmond can call on is Kim Jong-il and Rupert Murdoch, he said. Prudential is the UK’s largest insurance company. It is not based in Scotland, but it employs 1,275 people in Stirling and its group chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, has just released this statement opposing independence. The decision in this week’s referendum is absolutely one for the people of Scotland and whatever the outcome, Prudential will continue to honour its obligations to its customers and staff in Scotland, where we have a long and proud tradition. From a business and economic perspective I believe it is in the long-term interests of Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Like many foreigners who have chosen to live and work here, I have seen how the diverse strands that make up the UK render the whole more than the sum of its parts. The UK is a G7 nation and one of the largest and most influential member states in the European Union. As the CEO of a company with significant interests in Asia, in the USA and in the UK, I can see first-hand every day how pooling of common interests is preferable to separation in an uncertain world rapidly coalescing into large, powerful trading and economic blocs. Gordon Brown is speaking in Clydebank now. I will post key extracts shortly. You can read all the Guardian’s Scottish independence referendum coverage here. As for the rest of the papers, I’ve already mentioned the Daily Record’s key front page. Here are some other articles I found interesting. The Herald in its editorial backs a no vote, but also backs a federal UK, and says this is Westminster’s last chance to offer full devolution. Better Together’s proposed timetable for change, with legislation being brought forward by January, is desirable, but a superficial exercise in public consultation will only undermine the process. It will be the Herald’s mission to harry the pro-UK parties every step of the way, to ensure they deliver the devolution Scotland wants and expects. To them, we say this: the Herald backs Scotland staying within the UK at this stage. But fudge this process, stitch it up and fail to deliver far-reaching further devolution, and make no mistake: you will be guaranteeing another referendum – one that you will lose, and deserve to lose. Greater autonomy for Scotland would be best achieved within a federal United Kingdom. A federal structure would create less antagonistic relationships between all the constituent parts of the UK. Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says the mishandling of the Scottish independence referendum shows flaws in the No 10 operation. Complacency, cockiness and cliquiness: senior Tories fear that the Scottish referendum campaign has exposed the underlying flaws in the Downing Street operation that will become ever more pronounced as the general election nears. They point to a trademark tendency to put tactics before strategy that will also be a huge issue for the country and the Conservative party if a renegotiation and referendum on Europe ever go ahead … Only in the past two weeks has Mr Cameron focused on Scotland after a poll showing the yes camp ahead made him realise that he might be about to become the prime minister who presided over the breakup of the United Kingdom. Once he understood quite how high the stakes had become, he panicked, cancelling prime minister’s questions to rush north and talk about how heartbroken he would be by separation, while promising new powers if the Scots agreed to stay. None of this had been properly thought through. Tory MPs predict a huge rebellion if legislation is introduced to give greater powers to Scotland without also devolving rights to England. “Even if there’s a ‘no’ vote, Cameron has ended up giving away the keys to the kingdom on the basis of one opinion poll,” says a senior backbencher. “That is just wrong. The whole attitude has been ‘let’s get through today and worry about the details later’.” Janan Ganesh in the Financial Times (subscription) says even a no vote will undermine the union. Not only has the union been tugged loose by this referendum, it will keep loosening the day after. All the main parties in Westminster have promised to divest more powers to Edinburgh, starting almost immediately. With all the authority of a man who scraped 29 per cent of the vote at the last general election, Gordon Brown, Mr Cameron’s predecessor, has promised “nothing less than a modern form of Scottish home rule”. The fact that he is in no official position to offer anything of the sort, and that neither the English nor the Welsh nor the Northern Irish nor parliament itself have been consulted, seems just a rumple to be ironed out in good time. We chuckle at the French for their five attempts at a republic but this is constitutional improvisation at its most heedless. Irreversible promises to do with the governing arrangements of the UK are being thrown around as campaign bait by desperate men in the last ditch ... In short, Scottish home rule means English home rule, which in turn means a separate constitutional wrangle about what shape this should take. There may be a federal UK, as Mr Brown suggests, but England’s preponderance would leave it looking freakishly askew. The alternative is to break up England itself into self-governing regions, an old idea that usually runs into a wall of local intransigence. The north-east voted against the creation of its own assembly 10 years ago by a crushing margin. City mayors were rejected in most of the big cities outside London in 2011. Isabel Oakeshott in the Evening Standard (yesterday, but I’ve only just seen it) says, if Scotland votes yes, David Cameron will have to resign. Moderate backbenchers inclined to loyalty towards the PM are usually a good bellwether. Among those I spoke to last night, the verdict was unanimous: if Scotland breaks away next week, the PM’s number is up. “The whole thing has been a catastrophe,” said one with a particularly apocalyptic view of the likely consequences of a yes vote. Another pondered whether the PM had been too busy “watching DVD boxed sets” to pay sufficient attention during negotiations with Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond over the detail of the referendum in October 2012. Angry Tory MPs have come up with a new term for the unedifying spectacle of the party leadership scrambling to prevent the United Kingdom falling apart: “indy shambles”. Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and a leading figure in the Better Together campaign, was on BBC Breakfast this morning. He said it was wrong to think that independence would mean the Scots would always get the government they wanted. First of all I have got two governments that I didn’t voted for and didn’t support. I have got a Scottish National party government in Edinburgh and I’ve got a Conservative-Liberal government in Westminster. The only way that you ever get the government that you always vote for is in a one-party state and I don’t think anybody is recommending that. A 16-year-old voting on Thursday for the first time here in Scotland will have lived her life, three-quarters of it under a UK Labour government so it’s simply nonsense to suggest that somehow everybody south of the Tweed is an austerity-loving Tory. The fact is the Conservatives haven’t won a majority in Westminster for 20 years. The latest opinion polls suggest that prospects of a Labour government are increasing by the day. We have only got eight months left of this coalition government’s mandate. Change is coming to Scotland, both constitutional change with the commitment that we gave this morning from the three party leaders, and I believe also the prospect of a Labour government in a few months’ time. That for my mind is the change that most of us here in Scotland want to see, rather that the breakup of the country. I’ve taken the quote from PoliticsHome. The CBI is a long-standing supporter of the union. Today it has issued a statement reaffirming that. This is from John Cridland, its director general. While the referendum is a matter for Scottish voters, the message from our members, which employ half a million people in Scotland alone, is that we want Scotland to continue to play a strong role as part of this successful union. We believe that Scotland staying within the UK is the best guarantee for creating jobs, driving growth and for raising living standards. We hope the people of Scotland vote to stay with us. We have more reporters joining our team around Scotland today and tomorrow, ahead of Thursday’s vote. Steven Morris has sent this: Dundee – home of Desperate Dan and Minnie the Minx (or at least of Dandy and Beano publishers DC Thomson). The cartoon characters’ statues have been plastered with yes stickers, which have been half-heartedly ripped off. Crimson Hexagon, a social media analysis company, has been looking at the social media traffic relating to Scottish independence. It found 23,399 UK tweets on the subject of independence from the 15 August 2014 to date. According to a note it sent out, it also found that: The yes vote dominates with 88% of the social media conversation as opposed to 12% on voting no #Voteyes has been the most used hashtag, at over 16,000 times @NicolaSturgeon’s tweet: “should Scotland be an independent country? RT if you intend to #VoteYES” was most retweeted – more than 840 times Famous Twitter authors to join the conversation were JK Rowling for the no vote and Billy Bragg for the yes vote 68% of authors were male and 32% female Ed Miliband is campaigning in Edinburgh later today. Overnight, Labour released some extracts from his speech. Here’s one passage. The will of the people of Scotland for economic and political change has been heard and we will deliver. Change is coming with more powers on tax and welfare for the Scottish parliament. We will change the British state too, the House of Lords and the way we work together across our nations. I ask the people of Scotland to lead that change of our whole British constitution. And I also ask them to help deliver economic change too with a Labour government in May 2015 – a government that is within our reach and just months away.‎ It is interesting that he commits himself to House of Lords reform. Labour helped to kill off Nick Clegg’s plans for Lords reform, and since then the party has said little on the subject. Scottish businesses are already moving their money into English bank accounts, my colleague Helen Pidd reports. Here’s an extract from her story. “Eyebrow-raising” numbers of Scottish businesses are moving their money across the border and into English bank accounts, according to the Cumbria Chamber of Commerce. Rob Johnson, the chief executive, said he knew of significant numbers of firms transferring funds from banks registered in Scotland to those headquartered in England. “We know it’s happening, but we can’t give names,” he said on Monday. “It’s inevitable that people would start to do this because uncertainty is something businesses can’t handle … It’s not about businesses being pro or against independence, it’s businesses saying: ‘There are some real issues here and we don’t know what’s happening.’” He said he would not reveal the volume of money transfers but said he had heard of “enough to raise an eyebrow” in the past two weeks and that the net losers were banks known to be registered in Scotland. “It’s as if everybody has suddenly woken up,” he said. My colleague Ben Quinn went along to hear the political theorist Tom Nairn speak last night in Edinburgh. He has sent me this. While his name has not been as prominent as Alex Salmond and David Cameron’s during the debate about Scotland and the UK’s future, the odds are that Tom Nairn will be familiar to anyone who has engaged in even the most cursory study of nationalism in Britain as a result of his highly influential (some would say prophetic) book – the Break Up of Britain. Decades later, many of the few hundred who crammed into a hall at New College in Edinburgh University on Monday for a rare public appearance by him were not even born when Nairn’s 1977 work was published – but it is clear that his Marxist analysis has made him something of an icon for many young Scottish leftwingers placing their hopes in independence. Nairn made a brief address at the launch of a collection of his work – Old Nations, Auld Enemies, New Times – where, to applause, he began by saying that “all this is about yes”. He went on to say that the time was right “for Scotland to be rid of something”. It was not the English, or Englishness. Rather, he added, it was something he had come to call “Eton, Oxbridge, Home Counties etc”. If not this Thursday, he predicted, then Scottish independence was sure to come in a few years. The Daily Record has splashed on the Cameron/Miliband/Clegg “vow”. The Sun’s splash in Scotland is rather more eccentric. Here is one more line from Nicola Sturgeon’s BBC Breakfast interview this morning. (See earlier.) Independence is not a magic wand, we don’t wake up the morning after we become independent to find the streets paved with gold. But it is a matter of opportunity, to take control of our own resources and put our hands on the levers of decision making, allow us to make the decisions that shape the kind of country we are. I’ve taken the quote from PoliticsHome. Here are the key points from Scottish first minister Alex Salmond’s BBC Radio Scotland interview. Salmond said Alistair Darling’s claim that today’s leaked document showed that the NHS in Scotland faced cuts of £450m was “absolutely untrue”. The Scottish parliament has passed a budget for an increase in health spending, he said. The leaked document referred to the need to make efficiencies worth 3.5%. But over the last six years the NHS in Scotland had achieved efficiencies of 3%, and those had been ploughed back into health, he argued. (This is much the same argument David Cameron employed when asked about a reported £2bn funding in the NHS earlier this year.) Salmond went on: This cut Alistair Darling is talking about is totally mythical, totally made up. Salmond said the “vow” signed by the three UK party leaders amounted to a “mythical power of nothing”. He went on: This last-minute, desperate offer of nothing is not going to dissuade people of Scotland from the huge opportunity of taking Scotland’s future into Scotland’s hands this coming Thursday. He dismissed claims from Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, that independence would be bad for Scotland economically. Greenspan told the Financial Times (subscription) that the economic consequences of independence would be “surprisingly negative for Scotland, more so than the Nationalist party is in any way communicating”, Greenspan said: Their [nationalist] forecasts are so implausible they really should be dismissed out of hand. Asked about this, Salmond replied: Many economic experts take the contrary view. Two examples: one would be Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate, the most famous economist in the world, who wrote on Sunday that Scotland could look forward to a prosperous future, and it was ridiculous for anyone to argue that the land of Adam Smith could not run its own finances. So there are many international experts [who] take a different view. Here is today’s engraving from the wall of the Scottish parliament. I thought it might be appropriate on a day when political promises are in the headlines. Salmond says the three party leaders have called this a “vow” because they cannot call it a pledge, in case that reminds voters of Nick Clegg’s tuition fee promise. It is an empty promise, he says. Q: Isn’t there a danger Scottish mortgages could go up because of over-heating in the south east of England? Salmond says the days when governments could control interest rates are long gone. What would make a difference would be Scotland having the power over its own finances. No one seriously thinks that the land of Adam Smith cannot control its own finances, he says. And that’s it. I’ll post a summary soon. Q: Aviva has criticised your plans for independence. And Alan Greenspan, the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, has now come out and criticised your plans too. Salmond says other economists, like Joseph Stiglitz, take a different view. Q: The Aviva chief executive has concerns about the cost of borrowing. Wouldn’t your borrowing be constrained by the Bank of England? Salmond says there would be sensible arrangements. And Scotland would borrow at Bank of England rates. This is better than this mythical proposal of nothing. Q: What happens if rates have to go up because house prices are overheating in the south east of Scotland? Salmond says the government does not set interest rates anyway. They are controlled by the Bank of England. It would be a shared bank, he says. Q: So why does the paper talk about a funding gap? Salmond says there are 3.5% efficiencies that need to be achieved, just as 3% efficiencies have been achieve in recent years. Gary Robertson is interviewing Alex Salmond. Q: What about the paper showing a £450 funding gap in the NHS? Salmond says Alistair Darling claimed five times in his interview there would be cuts. That is untrue. The Scottish parliament has passed plans to increase NHS spending. So this cut is “totally mythical, it is totally made up”. Q: But the paper says there is a funding gap. It says new obligations are not fully funded. Salmond says he has told Robertson of the plans. There is no cut. Q: But it’s not Darling saying this. It’s a paper passed to health board chief executives. Salmond says the paper says efficiencies will need to be achieved. In the past there have been efficiencies. They have been ploughed back. In Scotland nurses got a full pay rise. They didn’t in England. That created a funding pressure. That is why Scotland must control the finances, he says. He says it would be better not to spent £500m on Trident, or £50m on MPs, Scotland’s contributions to keeping Darling in London. Scotland’s first minister, Alex Salmond, is about to be interviewed on BBC Radio Scotland. I’ll be covering it in detail. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signed a joint “vow” to Scotland. You can read the text here. The three leaders have also each written an individual piece for the Daily Record setting out what they are promising. And the Record has published its own interpetation of the “vow”, which goes into slightly more detail than the text. Although it has not been signed by Gordon Brown, the whole thing is clearly inspired by him – he first proposed these ideas in his book, My Scotland, Our Britain – and he effectively announced them last night. (Brown is also a past master at using leaked documents to unsettle opponents, and the BBC/Herald leak has all the hallmarks of a Brown operation.) Here are the three main points, and a snap analysis. New powers for the Scottish parliament This is what the Record says about this. Holyrood will be strengthened with extensive new powers, on a timetable beginning on 19 September, with legislation in 2015. The Scottish parliament will be a permanent and irreversible part of the British constitution. The three party leaders have already promised new powers for the Scottish parliament, and the “vow” does not give any new detail about what they are. All it does say is that they will be “extensive”. The new ingredient is the declaration that the Scottish parliament will be made permanent. This is something Brown suggested in his book. But, given that no parliament can bind its successor, it is hard to see how this can be achieved without a move towards a written constitution (which Brown favours). And the value of this is doubtful. Although in theory Westminster could abolish the Scottish parliament, in practice this in unthinkable. A fairness guarantee for Scotland This is what the Record says about this. The guarantee that the modern purpose of the union is to ensure opportunity and security by pooling and sharing our resources equitably for our defence, prosperity and the social and economic welfare of every citizen, including through UK pensions and UK funding of healthcare. This is very vague. That actual “vow” itself says that the leaders “hope” that the people of Scotland will be “engaged directly” as the three main parties work to improve the way Scotland is governed, and they all agree that the UK exists to pool resources fairly. The notion of the UK being all about “pooling” resources is a vision that Brown has promoted. But it is not clear from the actual “vow” whether the three leaders envisage a move towards some kind of new, quasi-federal constitution (as Brown would like), or whether they just see this as a description of the status quo. New guarantees over spending This is what the Record says about this. The power to spend more on the NHS if that is Scottish people’s will. The guarantee that with the continued Barnett allocation, based on need and with the power to raise its own funds, the final decisions on spending on public services in Scotland, including on the NHS, will be made by the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament will have the last word on how much is spent on health. It will have the power to keep the NHS in public hands and the capacity to protect it. This is designed to counter SNP claims that the NHS could be dismantled if the union continues. But it is not clear whether this really goes further than what the three parties were already offering. Last night’s briefing suggested Brown wanted a guarantee that the Barnett formula would be permanent. But the “vow” itself just says “because of the continuation of the Barnett allocation for resources, and the powers of the Scottish parliament to raise revenue, we can state categorically that the final say on how much is spent on the NHS will be a matter for the Scottish parliament”. That does not mean it will continue forever. On BBC Breakfast Jim Murphy, the Labour former Scottish secretary, says the SNP’s plans are “shrouded in doubt”. Q: But Christopher Chope, a Conservative MP, said on Saturday that Tory MPs could block this plan. Murphy says he is in the House of Commons every week. He has never heard of Chope. The promise of new powers for Scotland has been backed by all party leaders, Murphy says. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s deputy first minister, is speaking for the yes campaign. She says the three UK parties still won’t say what new powers they will give to Scotland. They fought “tooth and nail” to keep the devo max option off the ballot paper, she says. Alistair Darling, the leader of Better Together, says new evidence has emerged today showing that the SNP government is planning to cut £450m from the health service. He is referring to this story from the BBC and the Herald, which is based on the leak of confidential papers presented to a meeting of Scottish health board chief executives last month. Here’s an extract from the BBC story. The papers were passed to the BBC and the Herald by a senior NHS whistleblower, who said they had become frustrated by the argument of the yes campaign that the biggest threat to the NHS comes from the UK government. The documents state: “The status quo and preservation of existing models of care are no longer an option given the pressing challenges we face.” ... The papers outline a funding gap of £400-£450m in the next financial year, 2015/16, which is described as “a level significantly in excess of that previously required”. The documents suggest that health boards will have to consider centralising hospitals and closing services – a measure which the SNP vowed to stop when it was elected in 2007. The story includes this quote from Alex Neil, the Scottish health secretary. Despite Scotland’s budget being slashed by 7.2% by George Osborne between 2010/11 and 2015/16, our increases in health spending means that the NHS is receiving record high funding, with a budget increase of over £1bn between 2010/11 and 2015/16. To ensure we can continue to develop the NHS, it’s important that NHS boards regularly discuss their future plans to inform budget discussions with Scottish government officials, and to identify how we will continue to deliver quality care and treatment. We continue to develop our health service to meet the changing demands of the people of Scotland, and that’s why we’ve already legislated to integrate health and social care from April next year. It was a ploy that students of Northern Ireland politics will recognise: the signed pledge. In 1998, when Tony Blair needed to win more support ahead of the referendum on the Good Friday agreement, he produced one. And last night, only hours after David Cameron’s speech in Aberdeen, the Daily Record produced a signed pledge from Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg promising, well, various things, but specifically that “the final say on how much is spent on the NHS in Scotland will be a matter for the Scottish parliament”. Will it make any difference? That’s the key question for today. I will be reporting the reaction as it comes in. Here’s what Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s deputy first minister, is saying. Here’s the agenda for the day. 10am: Sturgeon and John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, campaign with apprentices in Renfrew. 10.10am: Charles Kennedy, the former Lib Dem leader, campaigns in Glasgow. 11.15am: Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech in Clydebank. 11.30am: Sturgeon campaigns with carers in Renfrew. Afternoon: Ed Miliband campaigns in Edinburgh.

The dust-enveloped towns lie on the outskirts of uranium mines clawed into the vast Sahara desert, one of which is the world's largest underground pit. Last week, residents cautiously welcomed the news that French nuclear group Areva will begin monitoring the health of thousands of workers at its uranium plants next year, bowing to years of campaigning from advocacy groups. The company, which is controlled by the French government, will carry out medical examinations on residents and its 1,600 employees in Niger, which ranked second bottom of 187 countries in the 2011 UN development index. \"If cases of illness attributable to occupational factors are identified, the cost of the corresponding healthcare would be borne by Areva in the same way as for French medical coverage,\" said the company, which recorded first half profits of 351m euros (around $467m) in 2011. Companies from France, the former colonial power, have had a monopoly on operations in Niger's uranium-rich northern belt since mining began in the 1960s. Today, Areva ships around 3,000 tons of uranium from Niger to France, where two-thirds of electricity is generated from nuclear power. But the pits in the arid Agadez region, operated in conjunction with the Nigerien government, have fuelled criticism from local and international rights groups, who say mining practices have endangered the health of some 80,000 people living in Arlit and Akokan. \"There are no roads here, it's just dust everywhere and this dust is radioactive. It's apocalyptic. It's a reality that has to be seen to be believed,\" said Mahamal Azawa, an Arlit-based activist. \"This is a small step in the right direction, but why has it taken all these years of people dying, people being ill, for this scheme to come about?\" Deaths from respiratory infections occur at almost twice the national average in Arlit, according to Greenpeace. In a 2010 report, the organisation found water wells in Akokan contaminated with radiation levels up to 500 times higher than normal, and radioactive scrap metal for sale at local markets. Meanwhile, mining activity has drained almost 300bn litres of water from aquifers, key water sources in the desert. Areva denies a link between its mining activities and health problems among locals, straining a complicated relationship with impoverished communities who see mining as a rare employment prospect. The new health scheme is modelled on one launched in Gabon last year after 1,000 Areva workers fell ill there. Meanwhile, the group has scrapped or delayed a number of proposed uranium enrichment plants following decreased demand in the wake of the Fukushima accident in March. The fallout has also contributed to nuclear companies tightening safety. Areva plans to unroll similar health-monitoring clinics across all its mines, which span Asia, Europe and North America. Still, for some miners it is too little, too late. One former worker, who quit after 10 years working more than 200 metres deep in Arlit's tunnel, said he wouldn't return even with the scheme. \"The water is polluted, the air polluted, you don't have to have a medical degree to see that. As soon as you get to Arlit, the sensation of illness starts; your body feels heavier and more tired each day.\" Others voiced suspicion at the plan, showing the extent of tensions between the poor, traditionally nomadic locals and foreign workers who live in purpose-built complexes. \"We notice the foreign engineers here only drink bottled water, they don't touch tap water like the rest of us. So why tell us the [tap] water is fine?\" said one mine worker, who refused to give his name for fear of losing his job. Niger's government has also faced criticism from advocacy groups. The country is the world's third largest uranium producer, but 60% of its population lives in extreme poverty. Northern Tuareg tribesmen have waged a low-level insurgency for decades, saying the government doesn't share the proceeds of the country's mineral wealth. In 2008, they briefly kidnapped four French workers in Arlit. A government spokesperson declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/oct/30/pmqs-nick-clegg-press-conference-politics-live-cameron-milliband","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-30T16:19:40Z","webTitle":"PMQs and Nick Clegg press conference – politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/30/pmqs-nick-clegg-press-conference-politics-live-cameron-milliband","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/oct/30/pmqs-nick-clegg-press-conference-politics-live-cameron-milliband","fields":{"headline":"PMQs and Nick Clegg press conference – politics live blog","bodyText":"I’m going to wrap it up there. Thanks for having me. Here are this evening’s headlines: • At an angry prime minister’s questions, David Cameron said he wanted an immediate inquiry into competition in the energy industry. PMQs again focused on the issue of energy prices and Labour’s promised freeze, with Ed Miliband accusing the prime minister of being a spokesman for the energy companies and David Cameron calling Labour’s policy a “price con”. • At a combative press conference, Nick Clegg attacked Labour over its indecision on HS2 and its energy price freeze, his Tory colleague Grant Shapps over his threat to the BBC, and said the government would continue to discuss what to do about the green levies on energy. He said support for HS2 would be a red line for his party in any future coalition negotiations and ruled out a further rise in tuition fees. • Boris Johnson issued a staunch defence of the Guardian's \"salient and interesting\" revelations about the activities of US and UK intelligence agencies based on secret documents leaked by Edward Snowden. • Newspaper publishers (not including the Guardian) lost their high court battle to stop government ministers going to the Privy Council later today to seek the Queen's approval for a new royal charter to regulate the press. They will now take their case to the court of appeal. • Jeremy Hunt revealed that two accident and emergency departments in London will not close, hours after his attempts to downgrade services in nearby Lewisham suffered a blow. • The government's \"back to work\" schemes at the centre of the high-profile Poundland case were legally flawed, the UK's highest court ruled. • The government's education reforms mean that people who flip burgers require more qualifications than people who choose to teach, Labour’s Tristram Hunt claimed in an attack on the government’s free schools programme, which allows non-qualified teachers to teach in schools. Thanks for all your comments. See you again some time. Here's a two-minute greatest hits from today's PMQs. While I was trying to keep track of Nick Clegg, education secretary Michael Gove and his Labour shadow Tristram Hunt were going head to head in the Commons. Twitter seemed divided over whether Hunt did well or badly. Here is a taste of it from PA: The government's education reforms mean that people who flip burgers require more qualifications than people who choose to teach, a senior Labour MP claimed today. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said that while the Labour party supported innovation, it was also important that schools were set \"basic standards\". Mr Hunt said: \"This side of the house calls on the government to uphold the highest standards in our schools.\" Speaking during an opposition day debate on the need for qualified teachers, he said: \"The secretary of state used to praise teaching standards in Finland, in South Korea, in Singapore, saying in all those countries teaching is a high-esteem profession. \"And how did they ensure they remain so? I quote, by making 'it difficult to become a teacher'. But what has the secretary of state done in office? Everything possible to make it as easy as possible to assume control of a classroom.\" Turning to education secretary Michael Gove, he said: \"You have undermined the profession, sought to remove teacher training from universities, adopted a policy of wholesale deregulation, leading to a 141% increase in the number of qualified teachers in free schools and academies. \"The surprising truth is that under this government, you need more qualifications to get a job in a burger bar than you do to teach in an English school. \"And while I salute the efforts of restaurant chains to improve the skills of their workforce, I would also like history teachers as well as hamburger managers to have some basic qualifications.\" Here's Patrick Wintour's story on PMQs. He points out that Cameron told MPs he wanted an immediate inquiry into competition in the energy industry. He made his proposal in Commons exchanges with Ed Miliband that were dominated again by the issue of rising energy prices and ahead of a statement by the energy secretary, Ed Davey, on Thursday on an annual competition review in the energy industry. This annual review is likely to be conducted by the energy regulator Ofgem, the Office of Fair Trading and the new Competition and Markets Authority, the body that will follow the current competition commission, but it is still unlikely that it will lead to a swift break up of the big six energy firms. It had been throught the tripartite energy review could not begin until next year, but Cameron's remarks suggest the timetable will be swifter. Here's some news. (That's a reference to these remarks by his colleague Jeremy Browne.) (OK ... that works.) This sounds like an interesting press conference. I wish it was being broadcast. I know, I know, I should have actually got up and left the office and gone to it ... Clegg's mixed metaphors can be legendary to behold. More from Clegg's press conference: (Cameron's pushed that idea, too, hasn't he?) Here is a video of today's PMQs. Back to Clegg: If you're not a Clegg fan ... Nick Clegg's press conference seems to have begun, but unfortunately the 24-hour news channels are showing no signs of covering it. I'll try to piece something together from Twitter. Here's some comment from the Department for Culture on the court ruling rejecting the newspaper groups' application to seek judicial review: Both the industry and the government agree self-regulation of the press is the way forward and we both agree that a royal charter is the best framework for that. We are clear the process for considering the industry royal charter was robust and fair and the courts have agreed. We can now get on with implementing the cross-party charter. A royal charter will protect freedom of the press whilst offering real redress when mistakes are made. Importantly, it is the best way of resisting full statutory regulation. We will continue to work with the industry, as we always have, and recent changes to arbitration, the standards code and the parliamentary lock will ensure the system is workable. At PMQs, David Cameron was asked about the security services and the Snowden revelations. Lib Dem Julian Huppert, who has defended the Guardian’s publication of leaks from Edward Snowden, asked: Does the prime minister agree with President Obama that there need to be additional constraints on how we gather and use intelligence, that we need to more effectively weigh the risks and rewards of our activities? Will the prime minister follow the president’s lead? Cameron replied: What I’ve said in the house before, and I’ll repeat again, obviously we’ll always listen to what other countries have to say about the issues, but I believe that in Britain we have a good way of having intelligence and security services, having them overseen by a parliamentary committee, having their work examined by an intelligence commissioner, and ensuring that they act under a proper legal basis. I take these responsibilities very, very seriously, but I believe we have a good system in this country and we can be proud of the people that work in it and proud of the people that oversee it. Boris Johnson has issued a staunch defence of the Guardian's \"salient and interesting\" revelations about the activities of US and UK intelligence agencies based on secret documents leaked by Edward Snowden, as Matthew Taylor reports. The mayor of London said: I think the public deserves to know. The world is better for government being kept under the beady-eyed scrutiny of the media and for salient and interesting facts about public espionage being brought into the public domain. I personally defend the Guardian's right to publish interesting information such as that Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by Barack Obama. I think that is an interesting fact. I don't believe that the fact that Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by the NSA does anything to jeopardise anybody's security; it's merely colossally embarrassing and it should come out. Asked whether his own phone had ever been bugged, Johnson said: \"I'm sure my mobile has been bugged by everybody, and good luck to them!\" \"Weak, weak, weak\" ... Cameron and Miliband reminded me a little of my guinea pigs towards the end of PMQs. Labour MP John Woodcock tweets this: In the comments, JKhardie responds to the charge that Miliband is weak by noting: I'm interested in what you think. I broadly agree with JKhardie's list, but my own feeling is still that the public is only actually aware of two things about Ed Miliband: that he knifed his brother and that he defended his dad. Neither one them suggests weakness, but knifing David was the wrong kind of strength, if you'll forgive me putting it so inelegantly. It was an essentially dislikeable thing to do, so I don't think it mattered whether it projected weakness or strength. But defending his father against the Daily Mail - that did project strength, and it was also something that almost everyone could sympathise with, as evidenced by the fact David Cameron and Nick Clegg both felt they had to come out and back him. But in my opinion there is still something about Miliband's public persona that does suggest weakness. In person he is tall, reasonably physically imposing, and can be charismatic – none of this comes across on TV, but what does come across frequently is his lack of gravitas. If this does result in a perception of weakness, perhaps that helps explain why Labour does not seem to have received any bump in the polls from an extremely popular policy (the energy price freeze) that has cut through and actually been noticed by the public (a rare event). If people do perceive Miliband as weak, they may not believe he would actually be able to enforce such a price freeze. But what do you think? The newspapers will now take their case to the court of appeal - this afternoon. Newspaper publishers have lost their high court battle to stop government ministers going to the Privy Council later today to seek the Queen's approval for a new royal charter to regulate the press. More details soon ... Sorry for the delay on this - it was concentrate on Hunt or do the PMQs verdict, and I know you were clamouring for the verdict. As the Press Association reports: Jeremy Hunt revealed today that two accident and emergency departments in London will not close, hours after his attempts to downgrade services in nearby Lewisham suffered a blow. The health secretary said Ealing and Charing Cross hospitals should continue to have an A&amp;E service \"even if it is in a different shape or size\" from that currently on offer. He told MPs that further work was needed but he wanted to end the uncertainty surrounding the future of the sites, which have been examined during a review into health services in north west London since 2009. My colleague James Meikle is covering this story, and I'll post his full coverage shortly. Louise Mensch, the former Tory MP, was also watching PMQs (presumably from afar?). She feels that if Labour turns against HS2, that will open the way for the Tories to become the party of the north and the Midlands. I can't speak for the Midlands, but if the Tories become the party of the north I'll be very surprised, to put it mildly. That was an angry performance from David Cameron at PMQs, and I felt Ed Miliband had the best of it – until the unedifying final exchanges, which degenerated into he and Cameron telling each other they were weak over and over again and reflected well on neither of them. As I thought he might, Miliband attempted to paint Cameron as “the unofficial spokesman for the energy companies\", an effective line, and I don’t think Cameron’s repeated dismissal of Labour’s policy as “not a price freeze, it’s a price con” will cut much ice with those voters who would love their gas and electricity bills to drop - ie all of them. Cameron’s comeback that Miliband was a hypocrite because he had attacked a policy calling for consumers to switch suppliers, but had switched himself, was inane. Miliband’s quip that people needed to switch the prime minister instead was neat – although his comment that Cameron had gone “from Rambo to Bambi” was baffling and to some eyes might have been considered a compliment. (Can we please retire this unfunny “from x to y” formula for parliamentary insults now?) Cameron’s line that Miliband was a one-trick pony that had run out of road was nearly as bad. Cameron rightly noted that Labour MPs were avoiding talking about the economy, but that only served to remind viewers that Labour was managing to set the agenda for this PMQs and the PM was merely reacting to what was thrown at him (despite the wearying number of planted questions from Tories). On HS2, Cameron may well be able to paint Miliband as weak eventually, if Labour does end up withdrawing support for the scheme - but since that decision seems to be up in the air right now the accusation doesn’t quite stick. Winner: Ed Miliband. But please don’t make that Rambo joke again. I'll wrap up Jeremy Hunt's statement next. I'll deliver my all-important verdict in a second, but first we have Jeremy Hunt's statement on budget cuts at Lewisham hospital. Labour's David Anderson asks if the PM has regrets about \"cack-handed\" privatisations under the former Tory government. Cameron says Anderson backed a government that never built a single nuclear power station. Lib Dem Julian Huppert asks Cameron if he agrees with Barack Obama about restraining the security services. In Britain we have a good system of oversight, he says. He takes those responsibilities very seriously. Labour's Lucy Powell says she has a question on the economy. Does he agree with his own advisers that the government's youth contract is failing to tackle the appallingly high levels of youth unemployment. The scheme has got thousands of young people into work experience, the PM says. That's why we see the youth claimant count coming down so rapidly, although there is still much to do, he says. To another question about HS2, Cameron says Labour is letting down the north and the Midlands. Labour's Sian James asks about the changes to the probation service - is he prepared to gamble with the safety of the public? The PM says he wants a service more focused on results and stopping reoffending. Not one question from Labour on the economy, he points out. Labour's Peter Hain says two thirds of the green levies were introduced under this government \"so why has the prime minister been attacking himself?\" Cameron says Labour introduced lots of them. Labour's Jim Sheridan asks about jobs, but Cameron says he is the leader of the Unite group of MPs and criticises the union over the Grangemouth dispute. Labour's Katy Clark asks if Royal Mail was undervalued. Cameron says it was losing a lot of money in the past and the whole country is glad it is in private hands. It was Peter Mandelson's idea in the first place, he crows. Labour's Emily Thornberry talks about a £720,000 two-bedroom flat in her Islington constituency. The PM says we need to build more houses, so the government is going to reform the planning system and has introduced Help to Buy - both opposed by Labour, he says. Tory Andrew Jones asks about railways. Cameron says HS2 needs cross party support and he's seen a \"pathetic spectacle\" from Labour and its \"weak\" leader on this issue. Cameron is asked about an interview in which the PM said he had to stop by his office to switch the heating on just so it's a bit nicer in there later - how many of his constituents can afford to do that? Cameron says the price freeze is a price con. Labour's Yvonne Fovargue asks whether more people will switch the heating off this year. Fuel poverty went up under Labour, Cameron says. The government has taken action. Tory Caroline Nokes asks essentially the same question as her two colleagues. Cameron reels off a lots of positive economic statistics and says Labour would have made them all worse. Exhausting... Tory Michael Ellis asks essentially the same question as Sheryll Murray did earlier. Cameron says there are 1m more people employed but Labour is too weak to admit it got it wrong. Gavin Shuker asks about the cuts to nurses. Cameron says he believes in the NHS and has invested in it. Miliband says a former Tory climate change secretary says Cameron's figures are false. He could institute a price freeze now - why doesn't he act? \"Because it's not a price freeze, it's a price con,\" Cameron says. He is hiding behind this economically illiterate policy because he can't talk about the economy because it's growing, Cameron. He's weak and has no ideas. No, the PM is weak, Miliband says. It's time he started acting like a PM standing up for consumers and not a PR man for the energy companies. I'll tell you what is weak, says Cameron - not standing up Len McCluskey, Ed Balls, and others. On HS2 Miliband has cowered in his office, too weak to make a decision. Cameron says a former energy spokesman in the Lords is troubled by the party's decarbonisation target. The whole country can see he's a one trick pony and he's run out of road, Cameron says. How will a review next summer help people pay their bills this winter, he asks. Miliband says it's hard to keep up with the PM on green levies, because in January he was boasting about how big they were. Earlier he said Cameron had gone from Rambo to Bambi in four short years. Who gave us the big six, asks Cameron? Labour, he says. Labour is voting for a price rise, through its decarbonisation target, he says. He is so on the side of the energy companies we should call them the big seven, says Miliband - the PM and the energy companies. The companies are against a price freeze, but the public are for it. Less competition, higher prices - same old Labour, says Cameron. \"As the unofficial spokesman for the energy companies\", can he explain why when wholesale prices have stayed still why have retail prices gone up, asks Miliband. We need competition and cuts to charges, Cameron says. Miliband says people need to switch the prime minister instead. Miliband stands up to a roar of support. Referring to the energy select committee hearing yesterday, he asks: what's the difference between Cameron's policy on energy and that of the energy companies? Not a word of apology about predicting a million jobs lost, Cameron replies. The energy market needs more competition to drive profits and prices down, he says. Competition should include switching, Cameron says. Miliband has said switching is a con, but he has switched his own supplier, the PM says. \"He adopts Tory policy to help his own family!\" Tory Sheryll Murray says Labour should apologise for saying the government's policies would lead to job losses. David Cameron says she's absolutely right and the British economy is on the mend. Labour and Ed Miliband were wrong and should apologise. The Commons chamber seems packed and rowdy as MPs take their seats for PMQs. Just before PMQs starts, you might want to take a look at this new party political broadcast from Labour, focusing on energy bills. Filmed in fuzzy soft focus over rolling piano arpeggios, sympathetic ordinary women talk about their fears about not being able to afford to heat the home or about having to buy worse food because they can't afford to pay energy bills. \"People are turning off their heating and unscrewing their lightbulbs.\" \"The system is broken, and we're going to fix it,\" a disembodied Ed Miliband says firmly. \"The blame lies with government, for not having had the strength to take this on.\" It ends with a clip of Miliband, hands together in a statesmanlike fashion, telling the Labour conference he will freeze energy prices. I've always thought this policy was a winner for Labour, but I have to say that the party has also done a great job projecting the policy and keeping it on the agenda, and I thought this PPB was pretty effective. Here is Shiv Malik's story on the back to work schemes. He's pretty clear it's a defeat for the government. The government's \"back to work\" schemes at the centre of the high-profile Poundland case were legally flawed, the UK's highest court has ruled. Cait Reilly won her long-running case against the Department for Work and Pensions in the supreme court after she first disputed the legality of the government's employment schemes in January 2012. The work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, failed in his attempt to overturn an earlier ruling, in the court of appeal, that regulations from 2011 that supposedly gave the schemes their legal footing were invalid. Five supreme court justices upheld a decision by the court of appeal that went against the government in February. While the supreme court stopped short of ruling that the regulations constituted forced or compulsory labour, it decided that it was unlawful for the government to fail to supply parliament and hundreds of thousands of jobseekers with proper information about the so-called \"workfare\" schemes they were forced to undertake at pain of losing jobseeker's allowance. Shiv adds that \"the judgment would have resulted in the government's having to refund £130m to about 250,000 unemployed people for unlawful sanctioning, had it not been for emergency retroactive legislation introduced by Duncan Smith in the spring.\" After the introduction of that emergency law, the solicitors Public Interest Lawyers (PIL), who represent Reilly and Wilson, lodged a judicial review accusing Duncan Smith of conspiring to undermine basic human rights by enacting the retroactive legislation. They say they will continue to pursue that judicial review after their success in the supreme court. The Laws session has wrapped up. Incidentally, Jeremy Hunt is to make an oral statement to the Commons on changes to health services in London this afternoon. The health secretary suffered an embarrassing legal defeat on Tuesday when appeal court judges ruled he had acted illegally in cutting A&amp;E and maternity services at Lewisham hospital in south-east London. I don't know if you have been following this row over how much sugar should be in jam ... Nice day in Westminster today ... Laws suggests that the other parties might have to introduce mechanisms so it is not just their leadership agreeing to coalition. He says the Lib Dems had some leverage because they could - just about - have gone with the Tories or Labour. So that sped the process up, he says. It may not happen so quickly next time. Laws suggests that in future the junior party's access to information and adviser support should be codified. Lord Hart (Labour) asks what steps the Lib Dems are taking to prepare for the possibility of another coalition in 2015. It's too early to start that, Laws says, but they will probably start earlier this time. His party has hoped for a hung parliament for decades, and they don't always come along that often, he says. Back in the Lords constitution committee, David Laws is reassuring the peers that the government takes collective cabinet responsibility very seriously. Lib Dem Lady Falkner asks how ministerial appointments were divided up in 2010. Did they want to scatter Lib Dems widely or concentrate them in a few departments? Laws says the Lib Dems felt you shouldn't talk about jobs while talking about policy, so negotiations weren't tainted by negotiators feeling they could get a better job from a certain party, so this question came up later. It was decided by Nick Clegg and \"possibly\" Danny Alexander in the last 24 hours before the coalition was formed, he says. Laws says it is \"risky to only colonise bits of a government\" and to be \"detached from other areas\". Back to the back to work ruling for a second - I agree it's a bit confusing that both sides are claiming victory. Here's what Cait Reilly, whose challenge led to the ruling, had to say: I am really pleased with today's judgment, which I hope will serve to improve the current system and assist jobseekers who have been unfairly stripped of their benefits. I brought these proceedings because I knew that there was something wrong when I was stopped from doing voluntary work in a local museum and instead forced to work for Poundland for free. I have been fortunate enough to find work in a supermarket but I know how difficult it can be. It must be time for the government to rethink its strategy and actually do something constructive to help lift people out of unemployment and poverty. We'll have a full report from my colleague Shiv Malik, who has been following the case closely, shorly. Tory Lord Lexden asks why five years rather than four, and why was this done through legislation rather than a binding motion. A \"huge amount of time\" was taken to pass the bill through both houses, the peer says. Laws says on the timespan \"that was simply what came out of the talks\". \"If you ask any politician right after a general election whether they want a longer or shorter parliament\" that's the answer you'll get, he says with a sly smile. Lib Dem Lord Lester says other countries in their written constitutions have fixed-term parliaments as a \"way of achieving legal certainty\". Laws is asked about the introduction of five-year fixed-term parliaments. This was the least controversial proposal for political reform in both sets of 2010 negotiations, Laws says. Laws says the Lib Dems were in favour, and he thinks Labour was, and the Tories didn't regard it as \"objectionable\". He says it helps give both sides in a coalition a sense of reassurance that the coalition would last. It is put to Laws that it undermines the principle that a government should stay in power only while it commands the support of the Commons, and thus disenfranchises the electorate. Laws says the electorate wanted a stable government, particularly at the time of economic crisis. The public would not have welcomed a second general election, he says. David Laws, who was a member of the Lib Dem negotiation team after the 2010 election, is speaking to the Lords constitution committee at the moment. He says his fellow Lib Dems wanted the leadership to go into coalition (with whichever party) rather than merely provide a \"confidence and supply\" arrangement. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's papers, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's politics stories in the papers and here's the New Statesman's list of top 10 comment articles. Here are the latest YouGov poll results, for the Sun: Lab: 39% Con: 33% Ukip: 11% Lib Dem: 10% Government approval was -27. That's a Labour lead of 6%, but, because of the vagaries of the electoral system, it would result in a Labour majority of 78 seats, according to UK Polling Report's \"swing calculator\". Electoral Calculus gives a Labour majority of 74. The government has lost in the supreme court in its attempt to overturn a ruling over its controversial back to work schemes. The UK's highest court has upheld a previous court of appeal decision ruling that 2011 regulations underpinning the scheme were invalid. The schemes were criticised as \"slave labour\" because they involved work without pay and cuts in jobseeker's allowance for those who failed to comply. But the supreme court ruled that they did not constitute forced labour. Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, said: We are very pleased that the supreme court today unanimously upheld our right to require those claiming jobseeker's allowance to take part in programmes which will help get them into work. We have always said that it was ridiculous to say that our schemes amounted to forced labour, and yet again we have won this argument. Ultimately this judgment confirms that it is right that we expect people to take getting into work seriously if they want to claim benefits. Despite his comments, the ruling was a victory for university graduate Cait Reilly, 24, from Birmingham, who challenged having to work for free at a local Poundland discount store, and HGV driver Jamieson Wilson, from Nottingham, who objected to doing unpaid work cleaning furniture and as a result was stripped of his jobseeker's allowance for six months. Lawyers for the pair said the immediate effect of the ruling was that all applicants who had their jobseeker's allowance withdrawn for non-compliance with the schemes were entitled to reclaim their allowance. Hi all. As you know Andrew Sparrow is off all this week, but politics goes on without him, just about, so I'm afraid that for today you're stuck with me as we head for another bruising round of PMQs. Ed Miliband’s energy price freeze policy has dominated the last few sessions, to the seeming frustration of David Cameron, who thinks it’s Marxist and it impossible to enforce. With energy bosses coming under fire again yesterday for their high price rises at the energy select committee, it seems likely that the issue will rear its head again today, with Miliband, as ever, keen to force Cameron into the role of de facto spokesman for the big six. It’s possible the our own dear Guardian and its publication of leaks about US and UK surveillance from Edward Snowden might come up again too, with Cameron having seemingly hardened his position slightly on Monday. Also today Nick Clegg will hold a press conference rescheduled from Monday when a crane fell on the Cabinet Office in the St Jude’s storm; this will take place at 2pm, and I’ll be covering that too. Here’s today’s schedule: 9am: Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, addresses the World Islamic Economic Forum in London. 9.45am: The supreme court rules on back to work schemes. 10.30am: Influential Lib Dem David Laws gives evidence on the constitutional implications of coalition government to the Lords constitution committee. 10.30am: Newspaper publishers ask the high court for permission to mount a legal challenge to the government’s decision to reject their proposals for a press regulating royal charter (more here). Midday: Prime minister’s questions. 2pm: Nick Clegg’s press conference. 2.15pm: Michael Fallon, the Tory energy minister, gives evidence on energy subsidies to the Commons environmental audit committee. Before I start, maybe I'd better just clear the air a bit. Now, I know the last time I was on here I got Danny Alexander and Douglas Alexander mixed up – so I'm sorry, all right? But look … their surnames are both Alexander and their first names both begin with D. And they're both Scottish... It’s easily done. I got two Scottish guys called D Alexander mixed up... I mean, come on, give me a break ... I tell you what, though, I didn’t receive any complaints whatsoever from Danny and/or Douglas Alexander. They found the whole thing completely understandable. It's been happening to them since school. Anyway, if it happens again, I’m sure you’ll let me know. On a legal note, there are some extremely tight publishing restrictions around the News of the World phone-hacking trial, so if you mention the case and you find your comment has been deleted, that is probably why.

To be sure, the danger from this outbreak is real. It has killed 18 people so far and infected more than 2,000, hundreds of whom may suffer lifelong kidney damage. Cases have been recorded in 10 countries, but all were infected in northern Germany. In addition, this appears to be a new and more dangerous strain, a reminder of the constant battle medicine and public health must wage against the phenomenal ability of germs to mutate to resist our controls. Certainly this risk is far more real than, say, the hypothesised human health risks from GM foods, or the disproved risk that vaccines can cause autism – other threats that demonstrate how our response to risk is more emotional than evidence-based. The number of dead and ill from this foodborne disease outbreak is already higher than the likely long-term mortality and morbidity caused by the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident in Japan, based on what we know so far about the dosages of radiation released (though that event is still unfolding). But the actual danger for any vegetable-eating European, even in Hamburg or other places where the cases have been concentrated, is low. Statistically. Scientifically. But then, we don't just use scientific evidence or statistical probabilities to figure out what's dangerous. Risk perception is a mix of facts and feelings, intellect and instinct, reason and gut reaction. And in many cases, the feelings/instinct/gut have the greater influence. This is neither right nor wrong, smart or stupid, rational or irrational. It's simply the reality of how we go about protecting ourselves, using the few facts we have, and applying a set of instinctive risk perception \"fear factors\" that help us gauge, quickly and subconsciously, how scary those few hints and clues feel. The problem is, as good a job as this instinctive system has done during human evolution, it can make mistakes. Dangerous mistakes. We can fear too much (vaccines), or too little (particulate pollution from coal-burning power plants), despite the available evidence, and our perceptions can create risks all by themselves. Excessive fear of vaccines is allowing diseases that had almost been eradicated to spread once more. Conversely, inadequate concern about coal-burning power stations has meant coal has been favoured over scarier nuclear power, risking sickness and death for thousands of people from particulate air pollution. Fukushima is now playing a powerful part in this retreat from nuclear power. So watching this foodborne E coli outbreak unfold has been instructive. Why, if the actual risk for any given person is so low, does it feel so scary to so many? The study of risk perception has found that uncertainty raises fear. We are uncertain about this risk for two reasons. First, science doesn't have all the answers, about which foods are risky, where they came from and so on. Second, any invisible/odourless/tasteless risk like this that we can't detect with our own senses is scary because we don't know all we need to know to protect ourselves. And in this case there is great uncertainty because of the unknown nature of the organism, and the difficulty in tracking down where it originated. That's a lot of unknowns, which make the risk scarier. If you think a risk can happen to you, it doesn't matter what the numbers say. Many risk communication experts work hard to find clearer ways to help people understand risk numbers, as though that will make us think about those numbers more rationally, but if a risk is only, say, one in a million, but you think you could be the one, you are likely to worry at least a little, because your job is to keep yourself alive, not the other 999,999. High awareness also increases fear. Subconsciously, the danger-detection systems in the brain give extra weight to information that's coming in all the time, or that can be readily recalled. This \"availability heuristic\" then feeds on itself in a positive feedback loop. We pay more attention to information that could mean we are at risk, and the media, in fierce competition with each other to bring us the information we want, feed this appetite, and feed our fears. These are just three among many specific components of our instinctive risk perception system that can lead to the \"perception gap\": the gap between our fears and the facts. This gap presents its own, very real risks. In this case there are a lot of people who aren't eating vegetables – any vegetables. That's not good for their health. Hundreds of thousands of people are more worried than necessary, and more worried than normal, and chronic worry produces the myriad damaging health effects of stress (including a weakened immune system, which makes us more vulnerable to the very bacterial infections about which people are worried in the first place). In addition, this outbreak will cost a huge amount of money, and damage the livelihoods and lives of thousands of people engaged in the produce and food industries across Europe. I am not criticising people for being irrational about risk. Science has taught us just how inescapably instinctive and emotional the system is. But it is valuable to observe that the way we perceive and respond to risk can itself put us at risk. Understanding that, and understanding the specific elements that make a given risk more or less frightening than the facts alone suggest, is the first step toward avoiding the dangers of the \"perception gap\", and making healthier choices for ourselves and for society.

Authorities have drafted in extra workers and turned to ever more radical tactics as fears grow that pools used to cool down spent fuel rods have leaked, leaving the rods exposed and in danger of catching fire, which could release huge amounts of radiation into the air. Tepco, the company that operates the plant, has increased its workforce at the power station from 180 to 322 and replaced those who have reached – or in some cases surpassed – the maximum allowed dose of radiation. The emergency workers focused their efforts on the storage pool at reactor 3, the only unit at the site that runs on mixed oxide fuel, which contains reclaimed plutonium. The strategy appeared to conflict with the priority identified by US nuclear officials and Sir John Beddington, the UK government's chief science adviser, who are most concerned about the storage pool at reactor 4, which they say is now completely empty. \"The water is pretty much gone,\" Beddington said, adding that storage pools at reactors 5 and 6 were leaking. \"We are extremely worried about that. The reason we are worried is that there is a substantial volume of material there and this, once it's open to the air and starting to heat up, can start to emit significant amounts of radiation.\" The storage pools are supposed to be kept below 25C to keep the spent fuel rods from heating up, but temperature readings at the ponds in reactor buildings 4, 5 and 6 show temperatures have been rising this week, to around 60C in pools 5 and 6 and at least 84C at reactor 4. The government has urged British citizens to move at least 50 miles from the Fukushima 1 plant, in line with an exclusion zone declared by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Britain's Met Office said it had begun sophisticated modelling of the radiation plume and was passing that information to the Cobra emergency committee but not making it public. The Japanese authorities maintained that their 20km (12 mile) exclusion zone was sufficient, with those within 30km advised to seal their homes and stay indoors. The concern with reactor 3 appears to stem from an explosion on Monday that is understood to have damaged the primary containment facility around the reactor's core. If the storage pool at the reactor runs dry radiation levels could soar so high that engineers cannot approach the reactor to try to bring it under control. Nuclear physicist David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety instructor, said the level of radiation beside the exposed rods would deliver a fatal dose in 16 seconds. The frantic attempts to refill the leaking storage pool came as engineers installed a kilometre-long power cable to replace those destroyed in last Friday's earthquake and reconnect the power plant to the grid. Engineers said the power supply would first provide electricity to reactor 2. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (Nisa) said three of the plant's six reactors – numbers 1, 5 and 6 – were relatively stable. However this morning an official at plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co told a news briefing: \"Preparatory work has so far not progressed as fast as we had hoped,\" adding that engineers had to be constantly checked for radiation levels. The fresh power supply will be used to drive pumps that are needed at three of the reactors to circulate seawater and prevent their nuclear cores from going into meltdown. The water levels in all three reactors are dangerously low, exposing between 1.4 and 2.3 metres of the fuel rods, according to Nisa. The fuel rods should be covered with water at all times to prevent meltdown. The UN nuclear watchdog said engineers were able to lay an external grid power cable to reactor 2 and would reconnect it \"once the spraying of water on the unit 3 reactor building is completed\". It said water cannons temporarily stopped spraying reactor 2 at 11.09 GMT. Five teams of police officers in water cannon truckshave tried to get close enough to reactor 3 to douse the storage ponds but were forced back after an hour when radiation rose to a dangerous level. Minutes later military helicopters flew overhead and dropped 30 tonnes of water, but from such a height much of it appeared to miss the target. The storage pools are located in the top level of the reactor buildings and are exposed at reactors 1 and 3 because hydrogen explosions have torn their roofs off. Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director general of Nisa, said it was unclear whether the strategy had succeeded in topping up the ponds. Nishiyama added that radiation levels of 250 millisieverts an hour had been detected 30 metres above the plant. On Tuesday Japan's health ministry raised the cumulative maximum level for nuclear workers from 100mSv to 250mSv. The US said it was using U-2 spy planes, a Global Hawk drone and infrared cameras to assess the temperatures of reactors and storage pools. \"One of the problems with the ponds is that the water, as well as providing cooling, also provides shielding so workers can come up to the edge of the pool and see what state the fuel is in,\" said Richard Wakeford, an expert in epidemiology and radiation at Manchester University's Dalton nuclear institute. \"If the water goes you've got no shielding and it's like having a great gamma-ray searchlight shining into the sky and that is presumably what the helicopters are seeing. That makes life extremely difficult for those trying to deal with this. \"Even though they are in Chinooks they haven't got much in the way of shielding. They would need lead on the bottom to protect people who are operating it.\" The intense gamma rays released by the exposed fuel rods are likely to hamper efforts to cool the storage pools by air, but the radiation is a problem for workers on the ground, too, because it reflects off the atmosphere and causes \"skyshine\", which can irradiate large areas of land. More than 20 Tepco workers, subcontractors, police and firefighters have been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency as having radiation contamination, according to Yukio Edano, the government's chief spokesman. Seventeen people had radioactive material on their faces but were not taken to hospital because the level was low. Two policemen were decontaminated after being exposed and one worker was taken offsite after receiving a dose of radiation while venting radioactive steam from one of the reactors. An undisclosed number of firefighters are said to be under observation after being exposed. At least 25 Tepco workers and subcontractors are being treated for injuries sustained in explosions at the plant and other accidents. There are fears the site might soon become too radioactive for engineers to work there. \"You can arrive at the stage where unless you want to receive a very serious dose of radiation, you are in such an intense field that by the time you've run to wherever you need to do the work, you have to run back again. And they may very well be getting to that stage,\" said Wakeford. At that point any hope of cooling the reactors or the storage pools would rest on being able to bring heavy lead shielding into the area or cooling the plant from the air. Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF in Britain, said the energy company was making arrangements to ship 100 tonnes of boric acid to Japan. The chemical helps slow down nuclear reactions by absorbing neutrons.On Wednesday people in towns and villages yet to evacuate the 12-mile exclusion zone around the plant were advised to take potassium iodide pills as a precaution against thyroid cancer, which is caused by radioactive iodine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2011/jul/09/good-to-meet-you-rashid-karapiet","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-08T23:04:02Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you: Rashid Karapiet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/09/good-to-meet-you-rashid-karapiet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2011/jul/09/good-to-meet-you-rashid-karapiet","fields":{"headline":"Good to meet you: Rashid Karapiet","bodyText":"I first came across the Manchester Guardian in 1955 when I first arrived in England from Pakistan.

She is my constituency MP, and an excellent one at that – she has real clout. Some years ago I submitted a piece I'd written about a visit to my original home in India but it was turned down. I thought it deserved better, since it explained bits of my personal journey from insecure young Anglo-Indian in denial of his roots to acceptance of those roots and reconciliation with his origins. I continue to write general letters to the editor and others on specific points to the readers' editor, with a disappointing non-acceptance rate!

Civil servants in the energy and business departments were apparently trying to minimise the impact of the disaster on public support for nuclear power. Andy Myles, the party's former chief executive in Scotland, said: \"This deliberate and (sadly) very effective attempt to 'calm' the reporting of the true story of Fukushima is a terrible betrayal of liberal values. In my view it is not acceptable that a Liberal Democrat cabinet minister presides over a department deeply involved in a blatant conspiracy designed to manipulate the truth in order to protect corporate interests\". The leader of the Lib Dems in the European parliament, Fiona Hall, said nuclear plans should be put on hold. \"These emails corroborate my own impression that there has been a strange silence in the UK following the Fukushima disaster ... in the UK, new nuclear sites have been announced before the results of the Europe-wide review of nuclear safety has been completed.

That's what happened in the Italian referendum on nuclear power on Monday, where voters overwhelmingly backed anti-nuclear campaigners' demands to block any new atomic power in Italy. Referendums are not a good way to set energy policy, nor many other aspects of national policy either – if a referendum were held on capital punishment in Britain, a hefty majority would support bringing back hanging. The Italian result needs to be seen in the context of a wider European political debate where anti-nuclear campaigners – led by the greens – have been successful in discrediting nuclear power. No doubt a referendum in Austria would have the same result, while the governments of Switzerland and Germany have already decided to phase out their nuclear plants altogether in response to the Fukushima accident in Japan. As a lifelong environmentalist, and author of a 2009 book which laid out the terrifying prospects of uncontrolled global warming, I cannot help but feel that the decisions of the German and Swiss governments rank among the worst climate-related policies of recent years. Carbon emissions cannot do anything other than rise as a result of phasing out the continent's largest source of zero-carbon power – and doing this just a week after the International Energy Agency reported that 2010 carbon emissions rose to the highest levels ever is little short of criminal. There is perhaps a certain discomfort about the fact that one of the best options for tackling global warming just so happens to be a technology that greens had spent decades opposing before climate change even hit the agenda. I have lost count of the number of times I have heard green groups insisting that climate change is the \"greatest challenge ever to face humanity\". Yet their refusal to reassess their inherited positions against nuclear power suggest that none of them actually believe what they are saying – or that most environmentalists are prepared to take refuge in ideologically motivated wishful thinking even when the future of the planet is at stake. If the German greens really took climate change seriously, they would instead be pushing for a phase-out of coal – which generates by far the largest proportion of the country's power and consequent carbon emissions – from Germany's electricity grid. Instead, the new nuclear phase-out plan will see a hefty 11GW of new coal plants built in years to come, with an additional 5GW of new gas. The only way emissions from these plants could be controlled would be through \"carbon capture and storage\" (CCS) – yet Greenpeace in Germany has already mounted a successful scaremongering campaign against this new technology, helping to ensure that future fossil emissions will go into the atmosphere unabated. Unfortunately, the new coal plants will spew out more radioactivity into surrounding areas than any of the German nuclear plants would have done if they stayed open, thanks to the fact that trace isotopes in coal escape up power station chimneys. That all of this has come about in response to Fukushima – a non-fatal accident which has so far injured no one, not even the workers who have bravely battled to stabilise the tsunami-stricken reactors – elevates irrationality to a guiding principle of political policy in countries which supposedly pride themselves in taking scientific rationality seriously. Indeed, it would be far more rational on a risk-precautionary basis to phase out Germany's organic farming sector, given that the recent E coli outbreak – now traced to organic sprouts produced on a farm in Lower Saxony – has killed nearly as many people as Chernobyl (36 at the time of writing, with 700 or more suffering permanent kidney damage). I have not of course heard any suggestions to this end from the German greens. And just imagine the hullaballoo had the sprouts been genetically modified instead of the \"healthy\" organic option. The German government insists that the nuclear phase-out plan is entirely compatible with its emission-reduction goals. Yet this is the same government which recently extended subsidies for loss-making coal mines until 2018. It also flies in the face of mathematical logic: in 2008 Germany relied on nuclear for 23 percent of its electricity. Renewable generation in Germany has increased substantially in recent years (to 17% in 2010) – yet to ask renewables to replace nuclear as well as fossil fuels will make the achievement of Germany's climate goals doubly difficult, and therefore twice as unlikely to actually happen. The silliness does not stop there. Much of Germany's renewables investment has been in solar photovoltaics in recent years, thanks to extraordinarily generous feed-in-tariffs. Yet these solar roofs are so expensive that they cost more than €700 per tonne of carbon abated, compared to a carbon price in Europe of €15 or less. One expert study suggests that the whole solar experiment up until this year has already landed German energy consumers with a €120bn liability for the next two decades – this in order to generate a mere 2% of the country's electricity, or less than a single large nuclear plant. In contrast, the UK's energy policy actually looks quite sensible these days. There is a broad ambition – articulated by the excellent Climate Change Committee – to decarbonise the entire electricity sector by 2030, by deploying nuclear and renewables in roughly equal proportions of 40% or so. There is a lot of sense also in Britain's policy of ramping down feed-in-tariffs for solar PV, which cost the Earth while doing little to reduce emissions in this cloudy northern country. Unlike the UK, however, Germany has gone around trumpeting its new policy as worthy of emulation by other nations – let us hope for the sake of the climate that no-one follows down the blind alley led by the German greens. • Discuss the future of the green movement with Mark Lynas in London on 6 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/12/durban-climate-change-conference-2011-southafrica","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-12T20:04:06Z","webTitle":"Durban climate conference agrees deal to do a deal – now comes the hard part","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/12/durban-climate-change-conference-2011-southafrica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/12/durban-climate-change-conference-2011-southafrica","fields":{"headline":"Durban climate conference agrees deal to do a deal – now comes the hard part","bodyText":"The Durban climate conference may have agreed a deal – or at least a deal to agree a deal – but the scale of the work that still needs to be done became plain today. Although talks are supposed to start immediately, America's special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, infuriated the EU by warning that much preparatory work had to be done before the negotiators could sit down to haggle. \"[In drawing up] the Kyoto protocol, there was a period of a year to year and a half of scoping out so I expect that will go on … for a year or two,\" Stern said. \"Then you still have two to two and a half years to negotiate, and finish in 2015.\" EU officials are acutely aware that the time to forge a deal is short, and the issues to be resolved vastly complex. The Durban conference ended on Sunday with a last-ditch deal whereby developed and developing countries will for the first time work on an agreement that should be legally binding on all parties, to be written by 2015 and to come into force after 2020. But while the UN and most of the countries present hailed the deal as a breakthrough, getting an agreement that all countries sign up to will be intensely complicated. \"Many political agreements put off the difficult actions for the next regime and that appears to be the reality for the Durban platform,\" said David Symons, director of environmental consultancy WSP. \"No one should underestimate the difficulty of arriving at a legal agreement between the developed and developing countries, let alone one that for the first time includes China, India, Europe and America. \"The Durban platform provides an anodyne set of words, with much of the detail yet to be agreed and the teeth not really coming for eight years. The real challenge will be in agreeing the fine print.\" Jonathan Grant of consultancy PwC said the scale of the task was daunting, as G20 countries would need to cut their carbon intensity (the amount of CO2 released as a proportion of energy produced) by 5% a year to 2050. France's vast nuclear power programme of the 1980s delivered a 4% per year cut for 10 years, he said, while the closure of dirty East German factories after reunification delivered 3% a year, and the UK's \"dash for gas\" to replace coal-fired power stations in the 1990s only produced cuts of 3% a year for a decade. The timetable is significant, particularly in relation to the US electoral cycle. Striking a deal at Durban was crucial, because by next year's conference there could be another president, and none of the Republican candidates would have signed up to the Durban platform. An incoming Republican would have to make a public renunciation of the climate talks in order to get out of the 2015 deadline. If Barack Obama wins another term, however, in 2015 he will be facing the final year of his presidency. That may spur him to try to ensure a global climate agreement is part of his legacy. Any new agreement will come down to targets – how far each country will have to cut its emissions. The motivation to increase ambitions could come from several sources, said Michael Jacobs of the London School of Economics, including people power. \"By 2015 the world's young people in particular can be expected to demand greater action as the evidence of future damage becomes clear. I think this will be bigger than Copenhagen.\" He also cites the ambition of China's next five-year plan, due in 2015, and demands from investors for stronger, clearer policies as important. Grant suggests Britons will have a simpler motivation: \"It will be people's wallets. If energy bills continue to rise as they have, people will eventually start to manage their demand much more efficiently than now. People are left a bit cold by the climate negotiations but energy bills impact them directly.\" The magic number is two – a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels is estimated to be the limit beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible. In order to have even a 50:50 chance of staying within that limit, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calculates that emissions must peak by 2020 at the latest and fall rapidly thereafter. Carbon output must be roughly halved by mid-century, compared with 1990. In 2014 the IPCC will produce its fifth assessment report. The overwhelming majority of climate research shows the situation is growing more serious, with increasing evidence that human activity is harming the climate and a clearer picture of what the consequences will be. This may mean the IPCC strengthens its advice on cutting greenhouse gases, which would mean governments could have to raise their targets even further. If life were simple, it might be possible to work out a formula for dividing up the cuts needed among the countries, according to emissions per head of population, perhaps also taking into account emissions per unit of economic output. That sort of thinking will not work in these talks, which have been running for 20 years. One key issue is historic emissions – industrialised countries started burning fossil fuels earlier and so bear responsibility for most of the CO2 already in the atmosphere. Balancing that, some countries have worked harder to reduce emissions than others – the EU, for instance, has, while China has invested heavily in renewables in recent years, and Japan has one of the most energy-efficient economies on the planet – so they will all want credit for these actions. Then there are the differing capabilities of each country – for instance, those with large forests provide a valuable service in absorbing carbon and want this to be taken into account, while others' geographical or economic circumstances afford less opportunity to use low-carbon power. Japan is a case in point: having pledged to phase out nuclear power, it will be hard-pressed to find enough renewable alternatives. Just how difficult it will be to resolve these issues was apparent in Durban. India's environment minister made an impassioned speech in the final hours in which she insisted that equity – taking into account developing countries' economic capabilities, large populations still to be lifted out of poverty, and low responsibility for historic emissions – must be the foundation of the negotiations. She said: \"Equity is the centrepiece, it cannot be shifted. This is not about India. Does fighting climate change mean we have to give up on equity?\" China's minister Xie Zhenhua backed her up strongly. The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2020 China's emissions per head will be equal to or higher than the EU's. That will make it difficult for China to base its argument for easier targets on its large population. The vast quantities of carbon being poured into the atmosphere also mean historic emissions are less relevant – by the 2030s total emissions from developing countries in the past century could be greater than the total emissions from developed countries, apart from the US. Fatih Birol, chief economist of the IEA, said: \"These are big changes for China – these figures make a very significant difference.\" To further complicate matters, Stern told the conference that \"there are other ways of getting to two degrees\". He did not elaborate, but there are scientifically backed means of slowing global warming by tackling other forms of pollution, such as black carbon and HFCs, both of which have warming effects. If these actions are brought into the talks it would imply that the overall emissions cuts required are less. Money will also be a factor. Developing countries have been promised $100bn a year by 2020, from rich countries and the private sector, in order to help them move to a green economy and cope with the effects of climate change. But it is unclear where these massive sums would come from. In the aftermath of the talks some officials were jubilant that the UN process had been vindicated. For years, the question of whether countries needed to sign a legally binding international treaty or could simply make national commitments that could later be changed – so-called \"pledge and review\" – has been one of the most contentious issues. At Durban, those arguing for a legally binding outcome won. \"This is the end of pledge and review,\" said one senior diplomat from a developed nation. The problem is the UN process continues to be fragile. The debates in the next few years will be stormy, and there is no guarantee that there will be an outcome that will produce the emissions reductions needed. But at least in Durban countries showed they can, sometimes, amid high emotions and frayed tempers, still work together. Stumbling blocks Equity Governments must agree country-by-country targets on emissions cuts, taking into consideration the historic emissions each is responsible for, the efforts on emissions each have made, their populations and how countries can continue to develop. Money Developing countries are demanding financial assistance to cut emissions and cope with the effects of climate change, but it is not clear where this will come from. US elections If a Republican becomes president next year, it may be impossible to negotiate a deal. The legal form The form of words settled on – \"an agreed outcome with legal force\" – means a legally binding commitment, say European Union EU's lawyers, but it is vague enough for countries to dispute."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/mar/11/japan-earthquake-disaster-tsunami-anniversary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-11T12:52:53Z","webTitle":"Japan marks first anniversary of earthquake and tsunami","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/11/japan-earthquake-disaster-tsunami-anniversary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/mar/11/japan-earthquake-disaster-tsunami-anniversary","fields":{"headline":"Japan marks first anniversary of earthquake and tsunami","bodyText":"Millions of people in Japan have paid tribute to the thousands of victims of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country's north-east coast one year ago and sparked the world's worst nuclear crisis for 25 years. At 2.46pm local time (5.46am GMT), a year on from the moment the magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck, people across Japan bowed their heads and observed a minute's silence, while sirens sounded in the dozens of coastal communities still in mourning for the 15,800 people confirmed dead and 3,300 others still missing. In Tokyo, some train services came to a standstill, and the emperor, empress, prime minister, foreign dignitaries and hundreds of survivors attended a ceremony at the capital's national theatre. In Ishinomaki, where the tsunami left more than 5,700 people dead or missing, hundreds attended a service at Minato primary school, where some had taken refuge after the disaster. Many remained silent after the official silence, hands clasped in prayer as Buddhist monks chanted sutras before an altar laden with white chrysanthemums. As darkness fell, children lit paper lanterns bearing simple messages that resonate across the region: togetherness, hope and strength. The people of the city, almost half of which was submerged beneath waves of up to 10 metres in height, are torn between two overwhelming emotions: deep sadness at the loss of life, and a determination to look forward. Masaru Sasaki, a 71-year-old taxi driver, came to remember his wife, daughter and grandson, all swept away by the waves. \"In some ways, the last 12 months have passed quickly,\" he said. \"But when I think of my family, it seems like a lifetime. \"I am lucky enough to be able to work, and I gain strength each day from my passengers. If I didn't have that, I don't think I could go on living.\" The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, vowed that Japan would be \"reborn as en even better place\". \"Our predecessors who brought prosperity to have repeatedly risen up from crises, every time becoming stronger,\" he said. \"We will stand by the people from the disaster-hit areas and join hands to achieve the historic task of rebuilding.\" It is impossible to overstate the size of that task. Exactly a year after they were sent fleeing by waves of up to 20 metres in height, more than 320,000 displaced people are still living in temporary housing along the north-east coast. An estimated 23m tonnes of rubble has been removed and placed in piles, but only a fraction has been buried or incinerated. The cost of rebuilding dozens of cities, towns and villages on higher ground is expected to cost Japanese taxpayers $230bn (£145bn) over the next 10 years. Some of that will come from an expected doubling of the sales tax; rather less palatable, for many, are the tens of billions the government will spend to prop up the company at the centre of the nuclear crisis, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). The sense of loss was tinged with bitterness at the slow pace of reconstruction and the government's handling of the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. On Friday, newly released government documents revealed that Japan's cabinet was aware of the imminent risk of a meltdown, but elected to suppress the information for weeks unless it sparked panic among the public. Tepco did not publicly acknowledge a partial meltdown in three reactors until May. \"I no longer trust the government,\" Ayumi Sato said as she left a memorial service in Ishinomaki cradling her baby daughter. \"This disaster has made me realise that the only people capable of looking after our daughter's future are me and my husband.\" Amid the solemnity came protest. In Fukushima prefecture and Tokyo, thousands turned out to demand the permanent closure of all of Japan's nuclear reactors. An estimated 12,000 protesters in the capital formed a human chain around the parliament building. All but two of the country's 54 reactors are currently closed for maintenance checks, and will not be permitted to restart unless they pass tests of their ability to withstand catastrophic events and win approval from host communities spooked by the Fukushima accident. The triple meltdown at Fukushima forced the immediate evacuation of 80,000 people living within 20km; a similar number have left other towns and villages outside the evacuation zone where high levels of radiation have been found. The operation to decontaminate the area is expected to last years, and neighbourhoods closest to the plant could remain uninhabitable for decades. In Tokyo, Emperor Akihito acknowledged the difficulties facing Fukushima's displaced residents. \"In order to make the area inhabitable again, we face the difficult problem of removing radiation,\" the 78-year-old, who has recently undergone heart surgery, said in a brief address. \"We shall not let our memory of the disasters fade, pay attention to disaster prevention and continue our effort to make this land an even safer place to live.\" After workers at Fukushima Daiichi observed a minute's silence, Tepco's president, Toshio Nishizawa, expressed his \"heartfelt sympathy\" to the victims of the disaster and apologised to residents living near the stricken plant. \"While always keeping in mind the tremendous responsibility we have to maintain stable conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, we will continue to safely work toward the mid- to long-term decommissioning of the reactors. \"The day of 11 March is forever etched on the hearts and minds of every Tepco employee.\" Many survivors chose to mark the day in private. Yuko Sugimoto, who became a symbol of the tsunami when she was photographed, draped in a blanket amid the wreckage, searching for her son, Raito, whose nursery was partly submerged. Sugimoto and Raito, who had been rescued by the military from the nursery roof, were reunited two days later. A year on, life was beginning to return to normal, she said, but for her son, the mental scars had yet to heal. \"He won't let me leave him, even for a minute,\" she said at her new home outside Ishinomaki. \"When we had tsunami warnings after 11 March he was physically sick. He's doing his best to appear normal, but I know that on the inside he is still in a great deal of pain.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/jul/13/jairam-ramesh-india-environment-ministry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-13T15:50:17Z","webTitle":"Jairam Ramesh's legacy is an Indian environment ministry with an identity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/13/jairam-ramesh-india-environment-ministry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/13/jairam-ramesh-india-environment-ministry","fields":{"headline":"Jairam Ramesh's legacy is an Indian environment ministry with an identity","bodyText":"In March, during the release of India's tiger census, some friendly banter between the then environment minister Jairam Ramesh and corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed saw the latter observe that Ramesh was acquiring a tiger's features. \"Run foul of him, and he will turn into a man-eater,\" Khursheed joked. Khursheed hoped Ramesh would not \"land in the endangered\" list like the tigers, words that have this week proved prophetic. On Tuesday, India's prime minister Manmohan Singh elevated Ramesh to a senior minister's rank, but also shifted him out of the environment and forests ministry to rural development where, Singh said, Ramesh's talents would be \"better utilised\". It had been coming. The bullish Ramesh, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology had upset many a government and business lobby's applecart. Until he took reins of his ministry in 2009, most Indians could not place who their environment minister was or what s/he said or did. The ministers collaborated with all mega projects such as dams and power plants, reducing the ministry to a rubber stamp. When development becomes paramount in a country like India, green concerns, however justified, are ignored. When Ramesh took over, India was one half of \"ChinIndia\"; growing at a 8-9% and courted as a future economic powerhouse. Sections of the Indian establishment took it so seriously that they seemed to forget that vast stretches of India are lagging behind, and are closer to sub-Saharan Africa than China in development indicators such as literacy, maternal and child mortality. Some of India's more controversial projects were coming up in such areas, home to tribes and biodiversity-rich forests. Examples include a $12bn steel project awarded to South Korean firm Posco, Vedanta Resources' bauxite mining project in eastern India and a controversial mega nuclear power plant, the world's largest and with French reactors, in Jaitapur. Others, such as a high-rise housing complex in Mumbai, violated Indian laws that prohibit buildings along the coast. As Ramesh observed in a \"hedgehog versus fox\" debate in May: \"India needs to be liberated both from the 'high GDP growth hedgehogs' and the 'conservation at all costs hedgehogs'. What India needs, he said, is a smooth, cunning and crafty fox that balances high growth and conservation. \"The hedgehog view (sticking to one big idea) is unresponsive and inattentive to the untidiness and complexity of real life,\" he observed. Ramesh held public consultations, raised environment-related objections, and cancelled some projects. He set up a national green tribunal, and worked on forest dwellers' rights. In 2010 he imposed a two-year moratorium on India's genetically engineered aubergine, and rebuked Indian science academies for their disappointing report on the subject. He backed a until-then unknown retired Indian scientist who wanted to point out that the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report's prediction that Himalayan glaciers would vanish by 2035 was wrong, which set the ball rolling about the need for stricter verification in IPCC reports. Ramesh lashed out against what he saw as \"politicisation of climate science\". He insisted India should not depend on western scientists' studies on climate change, and initiated a series of Indian studies on greenhouse gas emissions and black carbon. All decisions were made public on his ministry's websites, some running at more than 100 pages, with scores of appendices. But raising the green ante meant raising the hackles of powerful industrialists and cabinet colleagues. In April, Ramesh told a meeting chaired by Singh that India's target of adding 100,000MW power from 2012-17 was ecologically impossible. Ramesh could also be outspoken, on one occasion declaring: \"If there is a Nobel prize for dirt and filth, India will win it, no doubt.\" But Ramesh eventually compromised, clearing the steel, coal and nuclear power plant projects and even a new airport for Mumbai. So why did he go? Most analysts agree that Ramesh's demarcation of forests into a \"go\" and \"no-go\" zone for coal plants was his undoing. An estimated 660m tonnes of coal fell within the no-go zones. The most recent tussle was over a coal project in a forested area in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, with the coal minister and powerful industrialists pressuring Singh for a speedy clearance. His successor is Jayanti Natarajan, is an articulate lawyer, a spokesperson for Congress party and a former junior minister in the civil aviation ministry. Ramesh raised the bar for the environment ministry's performance and if Natarajan raises it further, or at least maintains it, it will be good for India. • TV Padma is a Delhi-based science journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/25/save-earth-cut-consumption","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-25T06:59:01Z","webTitle":"Response: Of course we need industrial goods, but to save Earth we must cut consumption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/25/save-earth-cut-consumption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/may/25/save-earth-cut-consumption","fields":{"headline":"Of course we need industrial goods, but to save Earth we must cut consumption","bodyText":"George Monbiot asks whether I and other advocates of a more land-based economy are \"really proposing that we do without [industrial goods] altogether\" (Let's face it: none of our environmental fixes break the planet-wrecking project, 3 May). The short answer is no. There are a few primitivists who do advocate this, but I am not one of them. \"Most of those who advocate an off-grid, land-based economy have made no provision for manufactures,\" says Monbiot. That is a fair point, but it doesn't negate the fact that we could drastically reduce industrial production in wealthy countries without undermining human wellbeing; indeed people might lead more fulfilling lives if they consumed less. The most obvious way of cutting production is to make things to higher standards. If everything were made to last twice as long then we would only need to make half as much of it. This requires us to slow down the rate of technological progress so that goods (and humans) do not become functionally obsolescent so quickly. Monbiot asks how we would find \"the energy required to make bricks, glass, metal tools and utensils, textiles … ceramics and soap\". Take bricks: for several years I lived in a cob house – built in 1911 from rammed unbaked earth – which was warm and delightful. I have also made unfired bricks with a device called a block ram, and 30 years later they are weathering fine. Half of Britain sits on a limitless supply of building stone, which was formerly extracted from harmless village quarries without any assistance from fossil fuels, but which now is inaccessible because of planning restrictions. The use of cob and local stone would mean building slower and hence less – that would be a good thing. In any case, if we cut industrial production by half there would be plenty of bricks and other material to recycle from redundant factories. As for textiles, it is plain from the charity shops that grace every high street that we suffer from a glut of clothing, while the wool from 15 million sheep is almost valueless. Reducing consumption of goods is not a recipe for abject poverty. Half the world still lives without superabundance, but where there is misery it is because of lack of food, water, simple medicines and adequate shelter – not because of a shortage of cheap T-shirts, factory-fired bricks, or 17 varieties of cleaning product. If we consumed less in the wealthy countries there would be resources and energy available for people who really are suffering. Monbiot's question was posed within the context of his recent conversion to nuclear power. Though I could probably be persuaded to accept a small amount of it if we significantly reduced our consumption of global resources at the same time, Monbiot's stance in these articles sends the wrong message. By advocating nuclear power without making clear that the overarching requirement is for people in industrialised countries to reduce consumption, Monbiot suggests that there are techno-fixes that will allow us to go on extracting the world's resources at an ever accelerating rate – and that is both unsustainable and undesirable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2011/may/05/green-problem-environmentalism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-05T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"The green problem: how do we fight without losing what we're fighting for? | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/may/05/green-problem-environmentalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/may/05/green-problem-environmentalism","fields":{"headline":"The green problem: how do we fight without losing what we're fighting for?","bodyText":"In my column this week, I discussed the crisis the environment movement is now confronting. I'm using this essay to expand on the problems I mentioned there, and in particular to consider the most interesting of the responses to the crisis proposed so far, by writer and environmentalist Paul Kingsnorth. Let me begin by spelling out, at greater length, the problems we face. 1. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions means increasing electricity production. It is hard to see a way around this. Because low-carbon electricity is the best means of replacing the fossil fuels used for heating and transport, electricity generation will rise, even if we manage to engineer a massive reduction in overall energy consumption. The Zero Carbon Britain report published by the Centre for Alternative Technology envisages a 55% cut in overall energy demand by 2030 – and a near-doubling of electricity production. 2. Low carbon electricity means, to most greens, renewable sources of energy. They were never well-loved, but now, in the places in which major deployment is taking place, they are provoking something approaching a full-scale revolt. Here in mid-Wales, for example, and in the highlands of Scotland, public anger towards wind farms and the power lines and hubs required to serve them is coming to dominate local politics. While there are plenty of stupid myths circulating about the inability of wind turbines to produce electricity and about the greenhouse gases released in constructing them, in other respects the opposition to them is not irrational. People love their landscapes, and so they should. Those of us who support renewables find ourselves in a difficult position: demanding the industrialisation of the countryside, supporting new power stations, new power lines and (for the electricity storage required) new reservoirs. Even offshore power, whose landscape impacts are much smaller, means more grid connections and more storage. 3. The only viable low-carbon alternative we have at the moment is nuclear power. This has the advantage of being confined to compact industrial sites, rather than sprawling over the countryside, and of requiring fewer new grid connections (especially if new plants are built next to the old ones). It has the following disadvantages: a. The current generation of power stations require uranium mining, which destroys habitats and pollutes land and water. Though its global impacts are much smaller than the global impacts of coal, the damage it causes cannot be overlooked. b. The waste it produces must be stored for long enough to be rendered safe. It is not technically difficult to do this, with vitrification, encasement and deep burial, but governments keep delaying their decisions as a result of public opposition. Both these issues (as well as concerns about proliferation and security) could be addressed through the replacement of conventional nuclear power with thorium or integral fast reactors but, partly as a result of public resistance to atomic energy, neither technology has yet been developed. (I'll explore the potential of both approaches in a later column). c. Nuclear power divides our movements. Some of the most effective environmental organisations – Greenpeace for example – could not drop their opposition without falling apart. 4. Whichever low-carbon technology we embrace, we help to provide the means by which the industrial economy can keep expanding, even if it does so without a major release of greenhouse gases. This threatens to exacerbate all the other issues that concern us. To prevent this from happening, the replacement of fossil fuels should be accompanied by a transition to a steady-state economy. Professor Herman Daly and author Tim Jackson have shown us how this can be done technically. How it can be done politically is, at present, quite another matter. 5. Those who, on the other hand, advocate a return to a land-based economy and the abandonment of industrial society find themselves in conflict with the desires of most of humanity, in both rich and poor nations. They have produced no convincing account of how people could be persuaded to turn their backs on manufactured products, advanced infrastructure and public services. 6. Our reliance on the mineral crunch, which was supposed to have brought the economic engine of destruction to a grinding halt, appears to have been misplaced. The collapse of accessible mineral reserves has not occurred, and shows little sign of occurring within our lifetimes. Capitalism has proved adept at finding new reserves or (in the case of fossil fuels) substitutes for those that are depleting. This takes place at a massive cost to the environment, as exploitation intrudes into an ever wider range of habitats and involves ever more destructive processes. New mineral reserves allow us to continue waging war against biodiversity, habitats, soil, fresh water supplies and the climate. 7. We have no idea what to do next. 8. Partly as a result, we have started tearing each other apart. This is an understandable but unnecessary reaction. Those seeking to protect the landscape are not our enemies; nor are those advocating that renewables should replace fossil fuel; nor are those promoting nuclear power as the answer; nor are those opposing nuclear power. We are all struggling with the same problem, all bumping up against atmospheric chemistry and physical constraints. The enmity arises when people go into denial. Denial is everywhere. Those opposing windfarms find it convenient to deny that climate change is happening, or that turbines produce much electricity. Those promoting windfarms downplay the landscape impacts. Nuclear enthusiasts ignore the impacts of uranium mining. Opponents of nuclear power dismiss the solid science on the impacts of radiation and embrace wildly-inflated junk numbers instead. Primitivists decry all manufacturing industry, but fail to explain how their medicines and spectacles, scythes and billhooks will be produced. Localists rely on technologies – such as microwind and high-latitude solar power – that cannot deliver. Technocratic greens refuse to see that if economic growth is not addressed, a series of escalating catastrophes is inevitable. Romantic greens insist that the problem can be solved without even engaging in these dilemmas, yet fail to explain how else it can be done. We're all responding to the same impulses, but we're all being tripped up by denial. Denial, and a failure to see the whole picture, are our enemies. Or perhaps, as doctors say about alcohol, our false friends. I'm by no means the first to recognise that environmentalism is stuck. Paul Kingsnorth co-founded the Dark Mountain project as a means of exploring this problem. His latest essay The Quants and the Poets is a compelling and beautifully-written account of the way in which \"the green movement has torpedoed itself with numbers\" and is now trying to save the world \"one emission at a time\". Trying to accommodate a narrative of other people's making, greens \"feel obliged to act like speak-your-weight machines just to be heard.\" This approach, he argues, \"has left environmentalism in a position where its advocates now find themselves unable to do anything but argue about which machines they would prefer to use to power an ever-growing industrial economy.\" He explains his prescription as follows: What is missing here is stories, and an understanding of the importance of stories in getting to the bottom of what is really going on. Because at root, this whole squabble between worldviews is not about numbers at all – it is about narratives. … How to reassert the importance of stories, then, is perhaps a key question now. Green poets might perhaps start by observing that worlds are not 'saved' by the same stories that are killing them. They might want to observe that saving worlds is an impossible business in the first place, and that attempting to do so is likely to lead to some very dark places. Or they might try and explore what it is about how we see ourselves which reduces us to this, time and time again – arguing about machines rather than wondering what those machines give us and what they take away. In his magnificent book Landscape and Memory, Simon Schama argues in support of a poetic narrative of the kind Kingsnorth promotes. Of one thing at least I am certain: that not to take myth seriously in the life of an ostensibly \"disenchanted\" culture like our own is actually to impoverish our understanding of our shared world. I'm sure that's right, as is Schama's warning that, in embracing narratives, we do not become morally blinded by their poetic power. (He was thinking, in particular, about the old German stories of the redemptive power of the Urwald – the ancient Hercynian forest - and the national myth of the German forest character, arising from Arminius's victory over the Romans in the forbidding Teutoburger Wald. Poetic narratives, even initially harmless ones, have a nasty habit of backfiring spectacularly.) But here too there is a problem. Green narratives have collapsed precisely because they were unable to withstand the steely quantification demanded by an attempt to get to grips with problems like climate change. Or they have been struck down by circumstance: such as the inconvenient non-appearance of the commodities crunch they predicted. If a new poetic narrative is no better able to answer questions such as how a steady-state economy can be achieved, how low-carbon electricity will be produced, how the common fisheries policy can be reformed or how, in a land-based economy, bricks and glass will be made, it too will collapse. In fact, it will never get off the ground as these questions, once formulated, won't go away. Perhaps we are less tolerant of myth than we used to be. Perhaps we should be. Is creating new, opposing myths the best way of confronting the founding myths of neoliberal capitalism? I don't think so. Is it not better to fight them with withering analysis, quantification and exposure? But can we do this without becoming insensible to beauty, and to the impulse – a love for the world and its people, its places and its living creatures – which turned us green in the first place? I don't know. I do know that it's a discussion in which we have to engage. www.monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/24/kim-jong-il-son-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-24T11:30:29Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-il puts son and sun on agenda during China mission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/24/kim-jong-il-son-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/24/kim-jong-il-son-china","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-il puts son and sun on agenda during China mission","bodyText":"The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, is exploring the potential of solar energy amid a debilitating dispute over his country's nuclear power programme. On a visit this week to China, North Korea's main ally and aid donor, Kim requested a tour of a solar photovoltaic manufacturing plant in Yangzhou between meetings with senior Communist officials and a trip to a shopping mall. Workers at JA Solar Holdings were told to stay at home while Kim looked around their factory. \"Apart from those involved in the visit, everyone was given the day off,\" an employee said. \"I can't tell you any more about it due to company regulations.\" The trip is shrouded in semi-secrecy. Kim's arrival in China at the weekend was reported around the world, but the two governments are unlikely to reveal details of the schedule until he returns to Pyongyang. This is his third visit in a year, prompting speculation that Kim is either lobbying for more food aid or trying to cement the succession of his son Kim Jong-un. His hosts, however, insist this is a study tour aimed at teaching the benefits of economic development. For much of the past two decades, North Korea has been a reluctant low-carbon economy due to a shortage of coal, oil and gas. China – the world's leading manufacturer of solar panels and solar water heaters – claims to set a more positive example and it is keen to persuade its neighbour to give up its ambitions for nuclear power. Kim's 40-vehicle cavalcade was seen at the photovoltaic plant in Yangzhou on Monday morning. South Korean media said this is a sign of his growing interest in solar power, but Chinese academics remain sceptical. \"North Korea is short of energy resources so Kim wants to learn from China and develop everything,\" said Liu Bo, an international relations expert at Peking University. \"But it will be difficult. Solar power requires high technology and great expense.\" Kim is also said to have visited a car plant, a lighting factory and a shopping mall, where he reportedly asked a clerk, \"Where can I find salad oil?'' Along with such titbits, regional media have focused on the weightier political and humanitarian implications of the trip. It is believed that Kim met the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin and the favourite to be the next leader Xi Jingping to try to secure their support for his chosen heir. Security and food concerns are also likely to be high on the agenda. Six-party talks aimed at easing nuclear tensions on the peninsula have been gridlocked for two years and North Korea has sunk a South Korean naval vessel and fired rockets across the disputed border. The humanitarian situation is also deteriorating, according to the World Food Programme, which has recently warned of food shortages. A US delegation was due to arrive in Pyongyang on Tuesday to assess the country's needs. The visit of Robert King – special envoy for North Korean human rights - and the deputy assistant administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, Jon Brause – comes ahead of a meeting later this month of officials from the US, Japan and South Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/dec/09/climate-change-impacts-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Global warming will boost solar power in Europe but cause losses elsewhere | Duncan Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/09/climate-change-impacts-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/09/climate-change-impacts-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Global warming will boost solar power in Europe but cause losses elsewhere","bodyText":"Amid all the discussion about how energy sources may impact on climate change, we often overlook the fact that climate change will in turn impact on energy sources. As the world warms, this will become an increasingly important issue, affecting everything from nuclear power stations needing cold water for cooling through to melting ice opening up new fossil fuel reserves in the Arctic. Given the current row about how much the UK should subsidise solar power, it was interesting to come across a scientific paper looking at how solar technologies will be affected by global warming in the coming century. The paper – published earlier this year but as far as I can see not covered anywhere in the mainstream media – predicts that Europe's potential for solar will increase. Perhaps more surprisingly, many other regions will see losses. The research, carried out by academics at the University of Leeds, examined the implications of a medium global warming scenario for temperatures and sunlight in different regions. Sunlight will be affected by changing cloud cover. The researchers then calculated what those changes would mean for the two main solar energy technologies: photovoltaic (PV) panels, which use semiconductors to convert sunlight directly into electricity; and concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, which use mirrors to focus sunlight onto a small area, generating heat that can then be converted into power. Of the specific areas assessed, Germany comes out best. According to the paper, the country – Europe's solar leader – can expect to see PV systems in 2080 producing around 3% more power than the same systems would today. Germany's potential for CSP will increase even more – by 10% – though from a very low baseline. The UK will see a small increase in the potential for both technologies. By contrast, Saudi Arabia and the south-west US face losses of 4–6% for both PV and CSP. The map below provides a fuller picture. It shows PV outputs in 2080, relative to the late 20th-century. Blue is a decrease; red is an increase. For PV, it seems, the losers outweigh the winners. Here's the same map for CSP. In this scenario, the increases and decreases are more evenly shared out, with large areas of Eurasia and the Americas looking likely to see increases. The reason for the different impact on the two technologies, the paper explains, is that while both of them respond well to rising solar insolation, only CSP also responds well to rising temperatures. Indeed, PV actually works better in cooler conditions. It's important to note that the changes listed above are relative. In absolute terms, it will still be far more efficient to put up a solar panel and plant in Marrakech than in Manchester. As the paper makes clear: \"Solar power plants are and will continue to be located close to centres of population within the Earth's sun belt of 40N to 40S.\" Nonetheless, the findings will impact on the economics of solar going forward and may affect the optimal technology mix in different areas. For example, according to the study, North Africa – the proposed home of the giant Desertec solar project – looks set to become better for CSP and less good for PV. Rolf Crook, one of the researchers behind the paper, believes the findings lend weight to the case for solar subsidies in Europe. He said: \"We have shown, perhaps surprisingly, that climate change will have a positive impact on the output of solar power plants in many parts of the world. This further strengthens the case for research and investment in solar power today. Subsidies play a vital role in driving down the cost of solar technology. Cutting subsidies would only have a negative effect.\" Download the data • DATA: download the spreadsheet More open data Data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian World government data • Search the world's government data with our gateway Development and aid data • Search the world's global development data with our gateway Can you do something with this data? • Flickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group • Contact us at data@guardian.co.uk • Get the A-Z of data • More at the Datastore directory • Follow us on Twitter • Like us on Facebook"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/14/fukushima-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T16:12:58Z","webTitle":"What will spark the next Fukushima? | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/fukushima-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/fukushima-nuclear-industry","fields":{"headline":"What will spark the next Fukushima?","bodyText":"The gung-ho nuclear industry is in deep shock. Just as it and its cheerleader, the International Atomic Energy Agency, were preparing to mark next month's 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident with a series of self-congratulatory statements about the dawning of a safe age of clean atomic power, a series of catastrophic but entirely avoidable accidents take place in not one but three reactors in one of the richest countries of the world. Fukushima is not a rotting old power plant in a failed state manned by half-trained kids, but supposedly one of the safest stations in one of the most safety-conscious countries with the best engineers and technologists in the world. Chernobyl blew up not because the reactor malfunctioned but because an ill-judged experiment to see how long safety equipment would function during shutdown went too far. So, too, in Japan, it was not the nuclear bits of the station that went wrong but the conventional technology. The pumps did not work because the power supply went down and the back-up support was not there because no one had thought what happened was possible. Even though Japan had been warned many times that possibly the most dangerous place in the world to site a nuclear power station was on its coast, no one had taken into account the double-whammy effect of a tsunami and an earthquake on conventional technology. It's easy to be wise after the event, but the inquest will surely show that the accident was not caused by an unpredictable natural disaster, but by a series of highly predictable bad calls by human regulators. The question now is whether the industry can be trusted anywhere. If this industry were a company, its shareholders would have deserted it years ago. In just one generation it has killed, wounded or blighted the lives of many millions of people and laid waste to millions of square miles of land. In that time it has been subsidised to the tune of trillions of dollars and it will cost hundreds of billions more to clean up and store the messes it has caused and the waste it has created. It has had three catastrophic failures now in 25 years and dozens more close shaves. Its workings have been marked around the world by mendacity, cover-ups, secrecy and financial incompetence. Sadly, the future looks worse. The world has a generation of reactors coming to the end of their days and politicians putting intense pressure on regulators to extend their use well beyond their design lives. We are planning to double worldwide electricity supply from nuclear power in the next 20 years, but we have nowhere near enough experienced engineers to run the ever-bigger stations. We have private companies peddling new designs that are said to be safer but which are still not proven, and we have 10 new countries planning to move into civil nuclear power in the next five years. It gets worse. More than 100 of the world's reactors are already sited in areas of high seismic activity and many of 350 new stations planned for the highly volatile Pacific rim where earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural hazards are certain to happen. We still have not worked out how to store waste and, we now know that we cannot protect stations from all eventualities. What the industry and governments cannot accept are the two immutable laws of life – Murphy's law and the law of unintended consequences. If something is possible to go wrong then it will, eventually. It may be possible to design out the technological weaknesses but it is impossible to allow for the unknown unknowns. Next time the disaster may have nothing to do with an earthquake or a tsunami, but be because of terrorism, climate change, a fatal error in an anonymous engineering works, proliferation of plutonium or a deranged plant manager. If there were no alternatives than employing nuclear power to light up a bulb or to reduce carbon emissions then the industry and governments might be forgiven. But when the stakes are so high, the scale is so big and there are 100 other safer ways, it seems sheer folly to go on in this way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/09/nuclear-sites-ed-miliband","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-09T09:46:00Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband to unveil plans to fast-track new nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/09/nuclear-sites-ed-miliband","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/09/nuclear-sites-ed-miliband","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband to unveil plans to fast-track new nuclear power stations","bodyText":"Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, insisted today that nuclear power had a \"relatively good\" safety record in this country as he prepared to unveil plans to fast-track a new generation of nuclear power stations. The government will later identify further sites around Britain that could be suitable for building a nuclear plant amid Tory cries that the plans lack \"democratic legitimacy\". Miliband will unveil a series of national policy statements setting out the need for new energy infrastructure including renewables, fossil fuels and gas, as well as an overarching energy statement that will include climate change policy. A separate strategy statement on the nation's ports will also be published. \"The basic message here is: we can't say no to all of the nuclear or all of the low-carbon fuels that are out there,\" the energy secretary told GMTV. \"We need nuclear, we need renewables, we need clean coal, we need all of those things if we are going to make that transition to cleaner energy.\" Miliband said it would not be his decision about whether a new nuclear power station is built in a particular area. \"It is going to be a decision for an independent commission that will take a view about what the local feeling is,\" he said. The minister insisted that there would be consultation with local people both before the planning application was submitted by the commission and afterwards and said that there was \"public enthusiasm\" in most areas being considered. The policy statements, which run to 3,000 pages, will be open for consultation until early next year and will act as guidelines for the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC), a new central authority that will start accepting planning applications in March. The aim is to speed up planning decisions and give answers to developers within one year, to end what one official described as the current \"long and tortuous\" process of winning approval for schemes. It took six years to steer the Sizewell B power station through the planning process, and officials believe red tape is discouraging investment. Under changes to the planning laws, the IPC will be able to speed through the proposals for new schemes if it decided they fitted in with the policy statements. But the shadow energy secretary, Greg Clark, said that a simple ministerial statement on the issue was inadequate and called for a Commons vote to give the process \"democratic legitimacy\". \"It is a national emergency and it's been left far too late – we've known for the last 10 years that most of our nuclear power fleet would come to the end of its planned life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"So whatever happens with these statements we've got a black hole, but actually we do need a different planning system, we need a fast track for major items of infrastructure. \"The trouble with the way the government's doing it is, it has no democratic component. The statements will just be read out to MPs without a vote and the decisions will be taken by an unelected, unaccountable official. \"We think it should be a minister taking that decision, accountable to parliament, with the necessary time limit, about three months, so it doesn't delay the process. But it does need to have democratic legitimacy otherwise people will find this an imposition that they will rail against.\" But the energy secretary said the government had made the \"right distinction\" on what politicians and the planning commission should be concentrating on. He told Today: \"Under the planning reforms, we separate the question of need and the question of specific developments, so we are in a sense making the right distinction between what politicians should make a judgment on, which is the question of need, and specific weighing of a particular development, which the IPC will do.\" He rejected Clark's claims that the government should have addressed the matter earlier. \"We are making the decision in a timely way,\" he said. \"The lights aren't going to go out. We do have security of supply in this country but as we move towards low-carbon alternatives we need to go down the nuclear route.\" Miliband will later today stress what the government believes to be the importance of a diverse energy supply. But the most detail will given in the nuclear policy statement, which will include a forensic assessment of the 11 sites already nominated by energy firms as well as identifying alternatives. \"Because nuclear is controversial, we wanted to make it quite clear where the sites we consider suitable are,\" said one official. The policy statements are expected to be a drawing together of already stated policy. As well as the public consultation, which ends in February, a Commons select committee has been formed to scrutinise the statements. Other government departments are set to produce similar policy statements on subjects including the water supply and airports. The IPC will be kept away from the government in an attempt to remove politics from the planning decision. The official said it was not about \"concreting over the countryside\" but making the system \"less labyrinthine\". The IPC would, he added, be \"inquisitorial rather than adversarial\". Utility firms keen to build plants in Britain, including EDF and E.ON, have long argued for a more certain planning regime. Energy firms and industry experts have warned of an impending energy gap in Britain unless more large scale projects are hurriedly built. But green groups expressed dismay at the prospect of new nuclear power and warned that the government could be open to legal challenge if the statements do not properly consider climate change. They have also raised concerns that people will not be able to influence decisions on major projects because schemes covered by the statements will not be subject to public inquiry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/16/japan-nuclear-emergency-timeline","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T20:01:58Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear emergency: a timeline of the crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/16/japan-nuclear-emergency-timeline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/16/japan-nuclear-emergency-timeline","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear emergency: a timeline of the crisis","bodyText":"Thursday 17 March 1.13am: The US will send a high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (so-called spy plane) equipped with infrared sensors, which detect heat, over the plant to help determine what is happening inside, Kyodo news agency reports. 8.48am: Two military CH-47 Chinook helicopters begin dumping seawater over No 3 reactor. At least four loads of 7.5 tonnes are dropped in the first 10 minutes, but TV footage shows much of it dispersing in the wind. Tepco says the spent fuel pool at No 3 reactor is nearly drained of it 2,000 tonnes of water. 10.15am: The IAEA issues a summary of injuries at the Fukushima complex: two people are missing, 23 are injured and more than 20 people have been exposed to significant radiation. 11.24am: Tepco says pressure is rising again at reactor No 3. Officials hope a new power line can provide electrcity to help pump water again. 5.37pm: Three of the six reactors are now relatively stable, officials say; the other three are not. 8.01pm: A truck-mounted water cannon has been dousing the overheating No 3 reactor, Reuters reports. An earlier attempt was defeated by high radiation levels – this subsequently dropped. Some reports say 11 trucks have been deployed.

Earlier media images showed white smoke drifting from the plant. 11.30am: It is not realistic to think the No 4 reactor at the plant will \"reach criticality\", the chief government spokesman says. 1.27pm: Japan's nuclear safety agency says operators of the damaged nuclear plant plan to bulldoze an emergency route to the facility to allow access for fire trucks. 4.55pm: Tepco (Tokyo Electric Power company) says it has recorded the highest levels of radiation yet at Fukushima Daiichi plant's troubled No 3 reactor. 5.26pm: Tepco says soaring radiation levels mean personnel have been withdrawn from work to cool reactors. 6.14pm: First attempt to use a Japanese air force helicopter to drop water into the No 3 reactor fails as the craft is unable to get close enough due to the high radiation levels, says Kyodo news agency, quoting the defense minister. 7.53pm: Japanese police announce plan to try to cool the spent nuclear fuel pool at the No 4 reactor using water cannon. American specialists says the spent fuel pool has lost all its water, which would cause the rods to overheat and emit even more radiation. Tuesday 15 March 6.10am: Explosion at unit 2 damages the roof of the reactor building of unit 4. This may have damaged the containment vessel at unit 2. 9.01am: Radiation surrounding the plant has risen fourfold since the explosion, Tepco says. 9:38am: A fire was discovered on the third floor of the secondary containment building of unit 4. 11.08am: Risk of nuclear leakage is rising, Prime Minister Naoto Kan says, and warns people within a 30km radius to stay indoors.

However, the status of the plant and the impact of radioactive materials to the outside environment are presently under investigation.\" 12pm: Tepco says six workers have been injured in the explosion. 12.43pm: Edano says a large-scale radiation leakage is unlikely from the Fukushima Daiichi plant's No. 3 reactor hit by an explosion after cooling problems. 1.30pm: Tepco updates the number of injured workers to seven. 3.17pm: Jiji news agency reports there has been an explosion at a fuel oil tank at a thermal power plant in Fukushima and that the tank is on fire. It is not immediately clear which company the thermal power plant belonged to. 4.17pm: Edano confirms water levels at the Fukushima Daiichi plant No 2 reactor are falling and its cooling functions have stopped. 7.52pm: Jiji news agency quotes Tepco as saying nuclear fuel rods at the Fukushima Daiichi complex's No 2 reactor are now fully exposed. Jiji says a meltdown of the fuel rods cannot be ruled out. 8.10pm: Water levels inside the Fukushima Daiichi complex's No 2 reactor are almost empty, Tepco says. Jiji news agency says the operator of the plant has started injecting sea water to the reactor in the hope of cooling it down. Sunday 13 March 3am: The IAEA director general, Yukiya Amano, offers his condolences to the people of Japan. \"Japan has many nuclear power plants and most of these are either unaffected or have shut down safety showing the effectiveness of the safety measures.\" 5.41am: In a 20km radius around the Fukushima Daiichi complex, an estimated 110,000 people have been evacuated, the IAEA says. In a 10km radius around the nearby Fukushima Daini complex, about 30,000 people have been evacuated. 6.20am: The number of individuals exposed to radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi complex could reach as high as 160, an official of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency warns. 11.37pm: Jiji news agency quotes Tepco as saying it is preparing to put sea water into the No.2 reactor at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The company is injecting sea water into units 1 and 3. Saturday 12 March 1.46am: Jiji news agency quotes Tepco as saying pressure inside the No 1 reactor at the plant has been rising, with the risk of a radiation leak. It plans to take measures to release the pressure, the report says. 3am: Tepco says the company has decided to vent steam in order to release pressure. \"We have decided to implement measures to reduce the pressure of the reactor containment vessel for those units that cannot confirm certain level of water injection by the reactor core isolation cooling system, in order to fully secure safety.\" 6am: Tepco indicates for the first time that radiation levels at the Fukushima Daiichi plant are rising. 7am: Tepco says evacuation has been ordered: \"Evacuation has been instructed by the national government to the local residents within 10 km radius of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station and Fukushima Daini nuclear power station.\" 7.19am: Tepco says it has lost its ability to control pressure in some reactors of a second nuclear power plant at its Fukushima facility. 3pm: Tepco indicates that one of its workers has received a radiation dose higher than the recommended limit. 3.36pm: Large explosion at unit 1 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. 5pm: Tepco indicates that radiation levels at the plant are rising. 5.47pm: Edano confirms an explosion and radiation leak at Fukushima Daiichi. \"We are looking into the cause and the situation and we'll make that public when we have further information,\" he says. \"At present, we think 10 km evacuation is appropriate.\" 8.43pm: Edano says: \"We've confirmed that the reactor container was not damaged. The explosion didn't occur inside the reactor container. As such there was no large amount of radiation leakage outside. We'd like everyone to respond calmly.\" 10.21am: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) quotes Japanese authorities as saying they are preparing to distribute iodine to people living near the stricken nuclear power complex. Iodine can be used to help protect the body from radioactive poisoning. Friday 11 March 2.46pm (5.46am GMT): 8.9 magnitude earthquake hits at 2.46pm (5.45am GMT), about six miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast. Minutes later, a tsunami wave of up to 10m reached the north-east coast of Japan. 4.30pm: The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) announces that 4.04 million households are without power because of the quake. It says units 1, 2 and 3 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and units 1 to 4 at Fukushima Daini stopped automatically because of the quake. 7.46pm: The government reveals a cooling problem at Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi plant on the north-east coast, which bore the brunt of the quake and tsunami. The chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, says the government has declared an emergency as a precaution but insists there is no radioactive leak. 11pm: Tepco press release: \"Survey data on radiation by exhaust stack monitors and monitoring cars has indicated no departure from normal level for all nuclear power stations.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2011/sep/12/curbs-non-eu-skilled-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-12T15:06:00Z","webTitle":"Further curbs on non-EU migrants to UK proposed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/12/curbs-non-eu-skilled-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/sep/12/curbs-non-eu-skilled-migrants","fields":{"headline":"Further curbs on non-EU migrants to UK proposed","bodyText":"Skilled migrants from outside Europe are to be banned from having a further 70,000 jobs, including as vets and orchestral musicians, under the latest revision of Britain's shortage occupation list, published on Monday. The proposal from the migration advisory committee, which is likely to be endorsed by the home secretary, Theresa May, will reduce the number of jobs open to highly skilled migrants from outside Europe from 260,000 currently to 190,000. More than 1m jobs were originally open to skilled migrants from outside Europe under tier two of the points-based immigration system, introduced three years ago. The actual number of tier-two skilled migrants coming to work in shortage occupations is limited to 20,700 a year, and applications are running at just over half of the limit. The proposal to cut the number of skilled jobs open to migrant workers follows recent figures showing a 21% rise in net migration to the UK in 2010, to 239,000. Twenty-nine occupations are to be excluded from the latest shortage occupation list, including secondary school biology teachers, consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology, veterinary surgeons and \"tutti\" or rank and file orchestral musicians, which excludes the top level of performers. A further 33 occupations are to be added to the shortage list, including 2D/3D video games and film animators, consultants in emergency medicine, environmental scientists, geochemists and managers involved in decommissioning nuclear power stations. Prof David Metcalf, chairman of the migration advisory committee, said: \"Although the proportion of the labour market covered by our new recommended list is lower than before, our recommendation will have only a limited impact on migration volumes because overall migration through tier two is limited. However, the list is more selective than before: it is targeted specifically on those job titles where there is currently a clear evidence of shortage.\" The decision to exclude \"rank-and-file\" orchestral musicians from the shortage list followed evidence from the Association of British Orchestras and the Musicians' Union that the job market in UK orchestras has got worse in the wake of Arts Council and local authority cuts. The ABO said that only 44 out of 1,200 musicians employed by the 18 orchestras it surveyed in June were non-EU migrants. But the orchestras also had 91 vacancies for leading or principal musicians leading the MAC to conclude while there was no shortage among the rank and file, there was still a problem in recruiting skilled orchestral musicians at the highest level."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jun/18/sheffield-forgemasters-loan-new-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-18T09:35:23Z","webTitle":"No Sheffield Forgemasters loan, no new nuclear by 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/18/sheffield-forgemasters-loan-new-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jun/18/sheffield-forgemasters-loan-new-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"No Sheffield Forgemasters loan, no new nuclear by 2017","bodyText":"Yesterday's decision by the UK government to withdraw its proposed loan of £80m to Sheffield Forgemasters is extraordinary. No other move could have had quite so much effect on the plans for nuclear power. Forgemasters wanted the money to buy a 15,000 tonne press, a necessary piece of equipment to make the pressure vessel at the centre of a power plant. Without the money, it says it will not proceed with its expansion into the nuclear market. The only other company currently making forgings of sufficient size for an international market, Japan Steel Works, has recently tripled its capacity to make 10 pressure vessels a year. But last year 11 new nuclear power stations were begun around the world and the pace is accelerating. 55 reactors were in full planning at the end of 2009 and in the US over 30 licence applications are under active discussion. Without the new investment by Sheffield Forgemasters, the waiting list for pressure vessels means that EDF's plan to build at least one nuclear power plant in the UK by 2017 will be unattainable. The waiting list for pressure vessels is too long. Korean and other companies, including two in China, intend to enter the business of making large forgings. But the work necessary to ensure the steel is made to the right quality is bound to take several years. Any failure of the reactor core would be catastrophic and customers will be wary about buying from a company without sufficient experience. Sheffield Forgemasters was one of the small number of businesses around the world that might have increased the speed of rollout of new nuclear. Forgemasters might have been the central company in a nuclear renaissance in the UK. What is the new government's logic? Does it really believe that Labour's proposed Forgemasters loan was a crude attempt to buy votes in Sheffield constituencies at the May election and therefore was commercially unjustified? Or does it think that the loan was incompatible with its stated commitment to making nuclear stand on its financial feet? In either event, with one move it has delayed any UK nuclear construction by at least two or three years. On the other hand, it may just have hoped that Westinghouse, the maker of the competitor to the Areva EPR power plant, would step up to replace the state loan with private money. Westinghouse buys some of its components from Forgemasters and desperately needs an alternative supply of reactor forgings to reduce its dependence on Japan Steel Works. This looks a risky gamble. EDF is furthest ahead with UK plans for new nuclear reactors but is committed to the Areva design for the UK, not the slightly smaller Westinghouse equivalent. The idea that EDF will commit to buying its pressure vessels from Forgemasters looks unlikely. Whether one wants nuclear power or not, this decision looks like ill thought through and dangerously destructive to the already weakening confidence in the prospects for construction in the UK. £80m is not a tiny amount, but in the context of the need to spend over £10bn a year for the next generation on new power stations it is small change. • This article was amended on 18 June 2010. The original stated that Westinghouse owns a stake in Forgemasters. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/may/23/electricity-pylon-competition-design","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-23T09:47:31Z","webTitle":"Pylon competition seeks alternative to 'industrial soldiers'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/23/electricity-pylon-competition-design","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/may/23/electricity-pylon-competition-design","fields":{"headline":"Pylon competition seeks alternative to 'industrial soldiers'","bodyText":"They have been dubbed Britain's \"industrial soldiers\", marching across hill and valley since before the second world war to carry the national grid's 400,000-volt power lines. But the government is calling time on the 84-year-old design of the electricity pylon, with a competition to find a more attractive 21st-century alternative. The National Grid and the energy and climate change secretary, Chris Huhne, are calling for ideas for pylons to carry electricity from a new generation of nuclear power stations and windfarms across hundreds of miles of British countryside. Sir Reginald Blomfield's resolutely practical 1927 lattice-tower design is said to be unsuitable to carry higher loads from the new power stations and the government and the National Grid are also hoping a sleeker, more elegant design could head off public anger at new pylons and high-voltage cables planned to serve a 10-fold growth in electricity from wind power and up to 10 new nuclear plants. About 80 miles of high-voltage pylons are planned in the Lake District, 50 miles in Snowdonia and 30 miles in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, according to calculations by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE). Huhne's call to \"ignite creative excitement\" and \"seek the most acceptable ways of accommodating infrastructure in our natural and urban environments\" comes as more than 1,500 people from Montgomeryshire prepare to descend on the Welsh assembly on Tuesday to protest against a 30-mile, 400,000-volt link taking energy into Shropshire from up to 800 wind turbines on Welsh uplands. Glyn Davies, Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, claimed the proposal would \"completely dominate the area\" and endanger its tourist industry. In Lancashire, residents are fighting plans to link Irish Sea wind turbines to the urban areas of the north-west by putting pylons through beauty spots including the Trough of Bowland. A Ribble Valley councillor, Ken Hind, has said the scheme has \"a Day of the Triffids feel to it\" and scoffed when he heard about the design competition. \"How do you disguise a 50-metre pylon?\" he said. \"Paint it green, put camouflage on it? We don't want this to happen in areas of beautiful countryside. It is a form of environmental savagery. Yes, we have to keep the lights on, but we have to realise there is a price to pay for protecting the countryside and that is burying the cables.\" National Grid estimates that running the cables underground costs £15m to £20m a mile, 10 times more than using pylons, and require excavation of a strip of land as wide as a dual carriageway. A CPRE report says that experience in Denmark suggests it could cost £6m a mile to lay an underground cable. The National Grid's executive director, Nick Winser, says it is keen to support the development of the most visually acceptable overhead solutions. \"The pylon has served the nation well, but new technologies and materials mean there may now be opportunities for new designs.\" Coal-fired power stations that meet one fifth of Britain's peak demand will close by 2016 and nuclear power stations providing an eighth of peak demand will also go off-line. To replace them, the government plans to build onshore wind farms providing 20 gigawatts of power and enough off-shore turbines to provide 33 gigawatts by 2020. It has also identified 10 potential sites for new nuclear power stations. A spokesman for the CPRE, Jack Neill-Hall, said it accepted that new power lines would be needed, but believed it was economically viable to run the lines underground or under the sea, preventing disfigurement to the landscape. \"Although a less intrusive pylon design would be welcome, the real focus should be on how we can get pylons out of our national parks and other valued landscapes,\" he said. Attempts to redesign the pylon are already under way in Iceland and Italy. Iceland's national grid company ran a design competition last year in which entries included pylons reconfigured to look like giants striding across the landscape holding power cables in their hands. Another, whose designers were said to be inspired by a recent viewing of The War of the Worlds, had cross bracing like curved bones. A Paris-based British designer, Hugh Dutton, won a competition for the Italian energy company Terna with slender Y-shaped pylons inspired by the first tender shoots of a young plant. The first prototypes are set to go into production soon. He said creating a more positive image for pylons to try to head off local opposition was a key concern for clients, but added that his more elegant design was more expensive. \"Traditional pylons are the very symbol of insensitive intervention of mankind on the landscape,\" he said. \"These industrial soldiers that march across the countryside, galvanised steel trellis towers, are certainly optimal and efficient structures, but lack poetry.\" In 2000, Lord Foster designed a pylon for Italian utility Enel that looked like a gymnast standing with arms aloft. His practice explained that the design \"abandons the conventional and untidy 'Christmas tree' configuration in which cables are supported by arms sprouting at intervals from the pylon's main mast. Instead the cables are neatly grouped within an open V-form, created by the junction of two attenuated masts\". National Grid said the winner of its competition would be announced in October. It would try to make a \"system-compliant\" version of the winning design and offer it as an option for future power lines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/06/conservatives-green-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-06T17:22:33Z","webTitle":"Energy efficient homes and more nuclear power: Conservatives unveil 'green deal'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/06/conservatives-green-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/06/conservatives-green-deal","fields":{"headline":"Energy efficient homes and more nuclear power: Conservatives unveil 'green deal'","bodyText":"Every UK homeowners will benefit from an allowance of up to £6,500 to make their properties more energy efficient, under a \"green deal\" proposed by the Conservatives today. The idea is part of a wider energy and climate change package aimed at kick-starting a green economy in the UK. The shadow energy and climate change secretary, Greg Clark, said a Tory government would immediately approve construction of several nuclear and coal-fired power stations to help prevent electricity blackouts in the next decade, to strengthen the national grid and enable the harnessing of renewable energy sources at sea, and to boost the number of charging points for electric cars. Heating and powering homes accounts for 27% of the UK's overall carbon emissions and, speaking this afternoon, Clark set out how the green deal would aim to reduce this total. The money, to be sourced from the private sector, would not be given to householders directly; instead, energy companies or charities would insulate homes at no cost to residents and then recoup the money through energy bills. As the new insulation would reduce energy use, this should not result in extra costs for the homeowner. In his speech, Clark said a Conservative government would \"begin with a bound and with immediate action to keep Britain's lights on, to cut greenhouse gas emissions and give Britain leadership in a low-carbon world.\"He criticised Labour's inability to appoint a longstanding energy minister. \"[In] 12 years […] there have been no less than 15 energy ministers,\" he said. \"They had an average of nine months each. Enough to make a baby. But, apparently, not to make a decision.\" Tory proposals include: • approving 5GW's worth of coal-fired power stations, fitted with carbon capture and storage technology which has the potential to trap up to 90% of carbon emissions • securing planning permission for nuclear power stations by 2017 • upgrading the national electricity grid to allow it to respond intelligently to the peaks and troughs of demand throughout a day • extending the national grid out to sea to enable the development of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said that no political party had been able to deal with the challenge of coal. \"We need a step change in political thinking to get the UK on a genuinely low carbon path and to achieve the zero emission power sector required by the Committee on Climate Change by 2030.\" He added: \"The current government position is to capture only a small proportion of climate changing emissions from new coal plants. That's not going to be good enough. To get it right, the Conservatives need to be clear that they will set a tough emissions standard that rules out all emissions [from coal plants] from day one, and [that they will] commit to meeting Britain's ambitious renewable energy target.\" For individuals, the Tories' green deal will mean that an average household can expect savings of £360 per year on energy bills via simple home adjustments, including energy-efficient lighting and cavity and loft insulation. Based on an average spend of around £1500 per home, around £120 of the yearly saving, for 25 years, would go towards repayment of the loan and interest. Householders would be able to keep the remaining £240, with the loan tied to the property rather than the homeowner who initially took it out. The Conservatives said that a scheme for retrofitting homes could see the creation of a £2.5bn per year industry and up to 70,000 skilled jobs, including 3,500 apprenticeships. Paul King, chief executive of the UK Green Building Council said the building and home improvement industry needed political leadership to \"unlock a fantastic new market for refurbishment, with huge benefits for people, the economy and the environment. The upfront capital cost has been an understandably big barrier for most people, but this type of scheme allows householders to pay for the work from the savings they make on their energy bill – and still be better off as a result. The green deal is a big step in the right direction.\" But the energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \"The Tories fail to deliver on renewables, since Tory councils turn down 60% of windfarm applications; they can't tackle climate change through Europe because they hang around with climate change deniers; and they vote against the investment in the green manufacturing jobs of the future. Voters should beware: the Tories may talk green but they act blue.\" Ed Matthews, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, thought the figure of £6,500 was too low. \"The level of funding must be at least, on average, £20,000 per home to enable homes to cut at least half their carbon emissions.\" The Department for Energy and Climate Change announced plans earlier this year to provide green makeovers, to include cavity wall and loft insulation, for 40,000 homes a year by 2015. Financial incentives for householders will also be available for low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, biomass boilers and ground source heat pumps, paid for by a levy on utility companies. The government wants 7m homes to benefit from the schemes by 2020, extending to all UK households by 2030. If successful, the strategy would shave a third off household carbon emissions by 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/15/coal-uk-jobs-renewables-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-15T13:16:55Z","webTitle":"Coal's dirty secret: it's dying | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/15/coal-uk-jobs-renewables-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/15/coal-uk-jobs-renewables-clean-energy","fields":{"headline":"Coal's dirty secret: it's dying","bodyText":"I spent half my childhood in Fife, surrounded by villages where abandoned coal mines has left nothing behind but unemployment. Walking to school, I remember seeing houses with all the windows smashed in and \"scab\" daubed in giant letters across the walls. The destruction of an industry is a terrible and traumatic event. But the call from a right-wing think tank to exempt the UK coal industry from taxes on carbon could not be more wrong-headed. It is mounting a Canute-like stand against the tide, rather than swimming with it. Carbon emissions have to be curbed to prevent climate chaos and in the UK this is legally binding. For the 6,000 coal workers in the UK, the solution is not to subsidise their jobs in a hopeless attempt to compete with Poland, China and elsewhere. The answer is to re-skill them for the industries of the future: clean, sustainable energy. Tony Lodge, author of the Centre for Policy Studies report out next month, argues: This collapse in the market for coal could come as new cleaner coal power stations are possibly under construction by the mid-2020s – or in sight of opening – but by the time they are commissioned the UK coal industry would have effectively ceased to exist. UK mining still looks after a third of our coal demand, supplying 18.4m tonnes last year, and this is expected to hit 19m tonnes this year. This collapse would lead to Britain needing to import all of its coal demand ... It would also lead to the loss of up to 6,000 coal sector jobs. But the future of \"clean\" coal in the UK is far from clear. The proposal to build a carbon capture and storage demonstration plant at the coal-fired power station at Longannet has collapsed, due to cost. The smart money now appears to be on CCS partly cleaning up gas, not coal and not anytime soon. Lodge's second point - UK coal demand - is also moot. There are no respectable future energy scenarios in which coal use rises - none - and in any case British coal burns dirtier than most imports. We should also look at where special pleading leads us: to failure. The \"past masters\" of special pleading are the energy intensive industries - think steel, cement, paper. They lobbied intensely to weaken the European Union's emission's trading scheme, and succeeded. As a result they are now reaping billions of Euros in windfalls, but has that protected jobs? No, Tata Steel, which is sucking almost €400m out of the ETS, announced it was sacking 1,500 workers in May. There's an unpleasant irony in the Centre for Policy Studies trying to save the UK coal industry: the think tank was founded by Margaret Thatcher who so unflinchingly destroyed its core in the 1980s. Today, protecting uneconomic jobs in a dying industry - coal mining in the UK - is not acceptable, but neither is abandoning those workers to the dole. But the clean, sustainable energy industry is growing in the UK and will need new, skilled staff. The Chancellor George Osborne put £100m into Scottish renewable energy on 11 November. This was the first glimmer of hope for the green economy since Osborne did his best to trash it in his cynical party conference speech in October. If the government truly commits to the green economy - in word and deed - then the Green investment bank will be allowed to borrow and drive investment, the Green deal will be allowed to meet the vast need for better energy efficiency and electricity market reform will do more than support nuclear power. And if that happens, there will be many more than 6,000 new jobs in sustainable, growing industries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/oct/28/fukushima-released-double-radioactive-material","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-28T06:40:22Z","webTitle":"Fukushima released 'twice as much' radioactive material as first thought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/28/fukushima-released-double-radioactive-material","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/oct/28/fukushima-released-double-radioactive-material","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima released 'twice as much' radioactive material as first thought","bodyText":"The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant may have released twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as previously estimated, according to a study that contradicts official explanations of the accident. In a report published online by the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, experts from Europe and the US estimated that the quantity of the radioactive isotope caesium-137 released at the height of the crisis was equivalent to 42% of that from Chernobyl. Significantly, the report says the plant, 150 miles north of Tokyo, may have started releasing radiation between being hit by a magnitude-9 earthquake on 11 March and the arrival of a tsunami about 45 minutes later. \"This early onset of emissions is interesting and may indicate some structural damage to the reactor units during the earthquake,\" the report said. The operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power, and the Japanese government maintain that the facility withstood the quake but was damaged by waves that breached its protective seawall. The tsunami swamped Fukushima Daiichi's backup electricity supply, causing fuel in three reactors to go into meltdown and sparking Japan's worst nuclear accident. Andreas Stohl, of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, said measurements taken from a global network of sensors showed that the plant had released 36,000 terabecquerels of caesium-137 between 11 March and 20 April. That is more than twice the 15,000 terabecquerels reported in the summer by the Japanese government. (A becquerel is a widely used unit of measurement of radioactivity.) In a telephone interview with Associated Press, Stohl, who led the study, attributed the discrepancy to the failure of Japanese authorities to include emissions that were blown out to sea. The report, which has yet to undergo a formal peer review, does not mention the emissions' possible health implications. Caesium-137 has a half-life of 30 years, distributes uniformly throughout the body, and can cause leukaemia and other forms of cancer. Experts say it will be difficult to gauge the potential impact on public health because it is unclear how much radiation people were exposed to at the time. The study casts doubt on other official accounts of the accident. It found that caesium-137 emissions dropped dramatically after emergency workers started dousing a spent fuel pool at the No 4 reactor, contradicting earlier claims that the pool had not emitted the radioactive isotope. Official reassurances that radiation levels outside the 20km (12 miles) exclusion zone around the plant pose no risks to public health have been greeted with scepticism by some residents. Several civic groups are calling for the assisted evacuation of pregnant women and young children from places where radiation hotspots have been identified, including Fukushima city, 60km (37 miles) from the power plant. An estimated 100,000 people have been evacuated from in and around the exclusion zone. In August, the government conceded that towns closest to the plant could remain uninhabitable for decades. Japan's nuclear safety agency declined to comment on the new report, saying that it had yet to review its findings. The report said that about 20% of the caesium fell on land in Japan and about 2% on land outside the country. The remainder came down in the Pacific Ocean, it added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/25/japan-casinos-fund-earthquake-recovery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-25T17:38:01Z","webTitle":"Japan bets on casinos to fund earthquake recovery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/25/japan-casinos-fund-earthquake-recovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/25/japan-casinos-fund-earthquake-recovery","fields":{"headline":"Japan bets on casinos to fund earthquake recovery","bodyText":"Croupiers and poker players could fuel Japan's recovery from the March earthquake and tsunami as the country moves closer to legalising casinos. A cross-party group of MPs wants to resurrect a 2006 campaign to put casinos on the same legal footing as betting on horse, speedboat and bicycle racing. The cost of rebuilding the north-east coastline, estimated at $245bn (£157bn), has given fresh impetus to the campaign, which has the support of a growing number of influential politicians including four former prime ministers. Members of the 150-strong group have met senior police officials in an attempt to calm fears that casino resorts of the kind springing up elsewhere in Asia will fall under the influence of the yakuza – Japan's answer to the mafia. \"Some members of the Diet are now insisting that casino legislation be passed,\" according to Gaming Capital Management, a US-based group that funds casino construction. \"Casinos are a great taxation source and can contribute a lot under current financial difficulties related to the earthquake recovery process.\" Issei Koga, an MP from the governing Democratic party of Japan and leader of the group, said casino resorts would be \"enormously strong engines\" for generating international tourism. The 11 March disaster and the accident at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant sent visitor numbers spiralling earlier this year. Inbound tourism has recovered, but Japan could struggle to achieve its aim of attracting 25 million visitors a year by 2020. Las Vegas Sands, which opened a luxury casino resort in Singapore in 2010, has had its sights on the potentially lucrative Japanese market for several years. A 2009 study by Osaka University of Commerce found that casino resorts could be worth $44bn a year. The promise of bigger tax revenues in the midst of an economic crisis appears to be winning over politicians who had voiced moral objections to Macao-style casinos. Supporters point to the Singapore complex, which includes the world's most expensive hotel, as proof that casinos can operate without attracting organised crime or creating gambling addicts. Singapore Marina Bay Sands, which boasts 1,500 slot machines and 600 gaming tables, is expected to help generate about $1bn in gaming taxes this year, according to one estimate, while Macao's casinos could give the government $13bn. \"There is more momentum and greater optimism than there has ever been in the past,\" George Tanasijevich, the company's representative in Japan, told Bloomberg. The move has the support of Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara, and Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, who wants to use casino revenue to fund welfare programmes. Other forms of gambling in Japan, together with pachinko, a pinball derivative played by 18 million people, generated $322bn last year, according to the Japan Productivity Centre. Pachinko, in which prizes are exchanged off-premises for cash, generates 30 trillion yen a year – more than Japan's top five carmakers put together. Japan's parliament would have to pass a law to nullify the ban on casino gambling, and some commentators believe the pro-casino lobby could struggle to win over the public after two high-profile gambling scandals. The traditional sport of sumo was rocked by revelations last summer that dozens of wrestlers had gambled illegally on professional baseball matches, with members of the yakuza acting as bookmakers. Mototaka Ikawa, the former chairman of Daio, a leading paper maker, has been in the headlines amid allegations that he used more than 5.5bn yen borrowed from the firm's subsidiaries to fund trips to casinos around the world. \"The media has been running stories about how certain people become easily addicted to gambling, and in addition to wrecking their own lives in spectacular fashion, ruin the lives of others. That's great ammunition for the anti-casino crowd,\" says Mark Schreiber, a media commentator who writes about social trends. He is not convinced that casinos will aid tsunami reconstruction, even if MPs find time to debate a gambling bill. \"By the time the casino resorts are up and running – I reckon it would take three to five years – the recovery will be far enough along and Japan will have a completely new set of problems,\" he said. The move could fall victim to an ingrained cultural aversion to gambling among Japanese leaders stretching back to the 18th century, when authorities had run-ins with bakuto gamblers, the forerunners of the yakuza. Schreiber said: \"There is also an old Japanese expression – nomu, utsu, kau (booze, gambling and womanising) – to describe a samurai who had fallen into a dissolute life.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/mar/25/crude-whisky-wind-scotland-sixth-wealthiest","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-25T00:06:51Z","webTitle":"Could crude, whisky and wind make Scotland richer than England?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/25/crude-whisky-wind-scotland-sixth-wealthiest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/mar/25/crude-whisky-wind-scotland-sixth-wealthiest","fields":{"headline":"Could crude, whisky and wind make Scotland richer than England?","bodyText":"\"It's Scotland's oil\" is one of the most highly charged slogans in Scottish politics. First used by the Scottish National Party in 1974, the notion that Scotland \"owns\" up to 90% of the North Sea's reserves remains one of the strongest sources of grievance for nationalists. And in the next two years, as Alex Salmond leads the country into a referendum on independence, it is likely to become one of the central arguments for nationalists: they believe it will help decide the fate of the UK. Ever since it became clear that North Sea oil fields would generate immense riches, the SNP has insisted that that wealth has been squandered by successive governments at Westminster. They point out that Norway, a country with a similar population to Scotland at just under 5 million, has saved much of its oil income: surplus revenue is ploughed into the government pension fund, which is now Europe's largest owner of shares and is worth about 3.3 trillion kroner (£360bn). The SNP argues that if you extend a line east from where the Scotland-England border hits the coast north of Berwick, the division of the seabed would give Scotland control over nearly all North Sea oil and gas fields. The Scottish government, which is drawing up a detailed case to support that 90% claim as its civil servants prepare for the referendum, asserts the North Sea will generate about £54bn in revenues over the next five years, while its \"asset base\" is valued at roughly £1tn, including remaining reserves. Salmond claims that, combined with Scotland's significant offshore wind and marine energy resources, and other industries such as whisky, this would make Scotland the OECD's sixth wealthiest nation, leaving the rest of the UK trailing in 15th place. But Salmond will have to answer anxieties about whether Scotland can offer the industry the same international muscle and relatively stable tax and regulatory regime the UK provides. Experts believe the oil companies and the engineering firms that rely heavily on North Sea contracts will be weighing up the potential negatives of independence. They would have to juggle two regulatory and tax regimes: the UK has expert health and safety and environmental agencies, largely controlled from Whitehall. Scotland would have to build its own from scratch. Would an independent Scotland, notionally one of the smallest of the EU member states, be able to match the UK's political influence and power in Brussels or on a global stage? There also remains the problem of the long-term oil exploration and drilling licences the UK government has issued to oil firms: many last for 30 years. How would those be transferred? Think too of how Scotland might defend North Sea rigs: would an Edinburgh government be able to afford to maintain a navy capable of tackling a terrorist incident? But the oil industry may also decide that Scottish governments would be more amenable on taxation: North Sea oil wealth is of far greater significance to the Scottish economy than it is to the UK's. While the figures fluctuate year by year, oil and gas generates about 2% of the UK's GDP and tax, but the Scottish government's annual economic report estimates it would make up 12% of Scotland's overall revenues. These delicate questions explain why UK ministers are being very polite to the Scottish government. Charles Hendry, the UK energy minister, said his government had not begun to look at the territorial claim. \"We haven't even got into those discussions; at this stage that issue may never arise,\" he says. \"The nature of what we'll be arguing in the runup to the referendum is that it's best to keep the structure we've got; that it's the best way of getting investment coming into Scotland; the best way of keeping people's electricity bills down in Scotland and therefore that we have the right policy in place. \"Our view at the moment is that this is a UK-wide industry, people have invested based on an assumption of that,\" he said. \"We believe that is the best way forward, we have not got into detailed discussions and negotiations about how independence would affect that because the referendum hasn't even been established and we've got all of those issues to go through. \"But what we do think is that when people look at the broader issues – and I think energy is a very important part of that process – then the attractiveness of the UK overall and in Scotland is enhanced by being part of the United Kingdom; the security of supply is enhanced by looking at it on a broader UK-wide basis; we're more able to move to a low-carbon, sustainable and affordable UK energy policy if we do it on a broader basis.\" Hendry argues that the difficulties of operating two different taxation and regulatory regimes in what is essentially the same region – the North Sea – will be for the Scottish government to set out. So far it has failed to do so. \"Primarily I think it's the Scottish government which needs to explain how those difficulties can be overcome. And we don't have their sense of how best this can be handled at this stage,\" he said. Asked how the UK government would deal with the huge political weight attached to North Sea oil by nationalists, Hendry also implies that the question has been superseded by the far more complex issue of producing and supplying energy as a whole, including renewables and nuclear power, in the UK and western Europe. Oil ownership is just part of a larger picture, to do with energy security and the energy market. Salmond has set the renewables industry a target of being able to supply 100% of Scotland's electricity demand by 2020 when conditions are favourable, while maintaining a back-up of two nuclear stations and existing coal-fired plants. But Hendry points to problems: if Scotland is independent by 2014, it will not have UK subsidies for renewables to draw on; it will have to pay for the grid infrastructure to export and import power; and at the same time be competing against French, Irish and Norwegian suppliers. A spokesman for John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said: \"Scotland has a £1tn North Sea asset base – at the same time as the UK's national debt has broken through £1tn for the first time – with some 40% of reserves remaining and over half of the value still to be extracted. With the oil price forecast to rise over $200 a barrel, these figures absolutely underline the need for Scotland to gain control over our own resources with independence, for the long-term benefit of the country.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/18/us-tornadoes-shutdown-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-18T17:19:04Z","webTitle":"US tornadoes force shutdown of two nuclear reactors in Virginia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/18/us-tornadoes-shutdown-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/18/us-tornadoes-shutdown-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"US tornadoes force shutdown of two nuclear reactors in Virginia","bodyText":"A US nuclear power company has disclosed that one of the tornadoes that hit the US at the weekend, killing at least 45 people and causing widespread damage, forced the shutdown of two of its reactors. The series of tornadoes that began in Oklahoma late last week barrelled across the country, with North Carolina, where 22 people died, the worst-hit state. The US nuclear safety regulator said on Mondayit was monitoring the Surry nuclear power plant in Virginia. Dominion Virginia Power said the two reactors shut down automatically when a tornado cut off power to the plant. A backup diesel generator kicked in to cool the fuel. The regulator said no radiation was released and staff were working to restore electricity to the plant. The tornadoes were among the worst in the US in the past two decades. Last year, 10 people died in a tornado in Mississippi, while 57 were killed in North and South Carolina in 1984 and 330 across the south in 1974. Two of the survivors of this year's storms, Audrey McKoy and her husband Milton, who live near Raleigh, North Carolina, told the Associated Press they had seen the tornado bearing down on them over the tops of pine trees. At a nearby farm, winds were lifting pigs and other animals into the sky. \"It looked just like The Wizard of Oz,\" McKoy said. They took shelter in their laundry room. After they emerged, disorientated, they realised that the tornado had turned their mobile home around. The national weather centre in Raleigh issued detailed descriptions of the tornadoes and their paths of destruction. One of them, with winds greater than 100mph, destroyed trees, ripped off roofs and wrecked power lines. It hit Shaw University in Raleigh and then strengthened to 110mph. \"Snapped trees crashed on to and through numerous homes all along the path. It is in this area where three fatalities were reported when two mobile homes were thrown 30 to 50ft [nine to 15 metres]. Nearly all of the mobile homes in the park sustained some type of damage,\" the weather report said. Thousands of workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the national disaster organisation, are being deployed in North Carolina to assess the damage. The North Carolina governor, Bev Perdue, interviewed on the NBC Today programme, said the storms had ripped through homes as if they were made of paper."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2012/oct/19/the-hour-1950s-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-19T22:01:38Z","webTitle":"Cometh The Hour: the series that brings the 1950s BBC back to life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/19/the-hour-1950s-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/19/the-hour-1950s-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Cometh The Hour: the series that brings the 1950s BBC back to life","bodyText":"One Thursday morning not long ago, I caught a bus to 1957. Alighting at Crouch End Broadway, I walked into the old Hornsey Town Hall and found myself in the office of a television news producer on whose desk was a Remington Rand typewriter, and next to it a stack of typewritten articles from the wires, clamped together with a hefty metal bulldog clip, the top of which was a report about the marriage of Prince Rainier to Grace Kelly. On the bookshelves, a 1957 explanatory tome about nuclear power rested next to a contemporary Who's Who. On a smaller, secretary's desk in the anteroom, a 1950s seaside postcard was secured under a glass paperweight. The woman whose office this was strode along the corridor, dressed in an orange skirt suit with a teal blouse, her hair rollered, her face powdered and lipsticked. And then I walked through a doorway and the illusion was broken, for in the space of a yard I found myself transported from the 50s Beeb to a Soho nightclub, one where Martini bottles lined the bar and the velvet-swagged tables were sized for two cocktail glasses and a large ashtray. This is the set of The Hour, which arrived on our TV screens last year billed as the British Mad Men, but turned out to be something quite different. Both shows deal with sexual politics in a world on the brink of seismic change. But in some ways The Hour, set among the makers of a radical new TV news show, has less in common with Don Draper and co than it does with Rona Jaffe's The Best Of Everything, a 1958 novel about the first generation of career women in New York, which Draper is at one point seen reading in bed. As in Jaffe's book, the changing role of women is at the very centre of The Hour, which revolves around the character of Bel Rowley, a young producer based on the real-life BBC producer Grace Wyndham Goldie. Because it takes as its viewpoint the making of a BBC programme about contemporary events, The Hour is very much about Britain: about the British establishment attempting to adapt to or control a world on the edge of dramatic change. The first series was set against the backdrop of the Suez crisis; the second, which reaches screens later this month, a year later in 1957. Writer Abi Morgan is on set the day I visit, despite \"the most horrific hangover ever\". Morgan, whose other recent credits include The Iron Lady and Shame, is loud but tiny; the hangover comes with a long, funny story that involves being accidentally bought champagne by Danny DeVito. Finding the right backdrop for the new series, she tells me, is a process of \"chasing down history to find the story. Thematically, there are two threads – the nuclear threat and the start of the cold war, and the internal threat caused by immigration and a new clash of culture. The late 1950s is the moment when Britain breaks free from the old establishment, and signs up to a new world order that is all about money. There's so much going on. It's a ticking clock. To me, that's what The Hour symbolises.\" Fast forward a week, and Romola Garai – the wearer of the aforementioned orange skirt suit – strides into a Shoreditch photographic studio in an Isabel Marant cotton top (\"Horribly, horribly expensive, but it is literally my favourite top ever\") and high-waisted jeans, carrying a pack of cigarettes and a take-out coffee. It is the morning after the wrap party, and Garai and her co-stars, Dominic West and Ben Whishaw, are back in 2012. Today, they are to be shot in both 1950s and contemporary fashion. It is the modern clothes that Garai is more concerned about: she has what costume designers quaintly call \"an old-fashioned figure\", and that she refers to more colourfully as \"plenty of junk in the trunk\". \"What happened with The Hour,\" she tells me, \"was basically that I picked up the script and the first line I read was, 'Bel is sitting at her desk.' And I was like, well, this is fucking amazing. This part is mine. Because how often are you ever introduced to a young female character and she's sitting behind an actual desk? The main thing I'm interested in is that I don't want the women I play to be defined by their romantic involvement with the male lead. I want them to have a job. So the fact that Bel having a job is the first thing we know about her was a huge deal for me.\" Garai says she recognises a lot of Bel's character in herself. \"We are similar in being ambitious, young women who love our jobs and are truly passionate about them. And who are interested in the world around them, and in politics. But we are different in that Bel is a real diplomat with people, which I'm not at all. I say what I think, and then get into trouble.\" She tries to look sheepish about this, but it's not particularly convincing. \"Actually, I think it's OK to fight for what you care about. The best piece of advice I was given about work was by someone who told me that it's OK to have conflict. I think sometimes women need to be reminded of that.\" \"Hello, Romsey Poms!\" With this greeting to Garai, Dominic West, who plays Hector in The Hour, bursts into the makeup room. He positions himself in front of the mirror, which is the largest in the studio, to check his reflection in the outfit he has been dressed in. (As the shoot progresses, West is often to be found in front of this mirror; Whishaw, on the other hand, tends to slope off to a bathroom to inspect his reflection without an audience.) Garai, who missed the wrap party, asks West how it was. \"Marvellous! Just marvellous. There were dancing girls, Romsey Poms, and you know how I love dancing girls.\" Garai rolls her eyes at me in the makeup mirror, hugs West, and announces fondly that, \"Dominic is an idiot, obviously, but actually we all get on incredibly well. Not just us three [with Whishaw], but everyone. There is a lot of corpsing on the set of The Hour. One day, we got so hysterical they had to clear the set and send us all back to our rooms. Anna [Chancellor] had tears streaming down her face, they had to redo her makeup. We got into so much trouble.\" Later, Whishaw describes it as \"amazing, just a lovely, lovely set. It seems odd to talk about the three of us because the others, like Anna [Chancellor] and Oona [Chaplin], are such a vivid part of it. There is just a huge, huge amount of love and honesty and laughter.\" But while The Hour was lavished with praise for its 1950s style, Garai is notably less effusive when we discuss Bel's wardrobe. \"The clothes are the one element of the programme that I feel rather ambivalent about. My choice would have been for her to be dressed in a more realistic way, which would be much tweedier. But needless to say the producers were keen for her to look as glamorous as possible. I feel strongly that how Bel dresses is not how someone in that environment would really have dressed. She wouldn't have wanted to look glamorous, to make herself vulnerable to criticism in that way. If it was down to me, it would've been tweed suits and brogues.\" Many of the same tastes apply in real life, she says, despite today's ultrafashionable Marant. \"I wear a lot of navy and grey, and I do love woolly tights. My sister says I dress like a French teacher. The level of grooming that was involved for women in the 1950s is completely alien to me. I don't wax. I barely shave. If I do my own makeup, I look like I've been to a burns unit.\" The second series of The Hour sees Whishaw's character, Freddie, return older, wiser and better poised as a meaningful rival to Hector for the status of the show's alpha male. As interviewees, the two actors could scarcely be more different. Whishaw sits facing me, neatly cross-legged, hair falling over his eyes, elfin face resting on the points of long-fingered pianist's hands. When he answers a question, he closes his eyes and leans forward, to speak directly into my tape recorder. He talks very slowly, and after Garai's galloping gossip it takes me a few minutes to adjust, so I find myself asking the next question only to realise he is still pondering the last. When West's turn comes, he sprawls on the sofa with one arm thrown across the back, claiming maximum space like a tiger prowling the boundaries of his cage, angling what I suspect he knows is his best side towards me. It is a measure of his charm that he is, despite all this, impossible to dislike. Whishaw, like Garai, was drawn to the character as written by Morgan. \"Freddie is one of those characters you'd like to be more like, in real life. We're similar in that we're both a bit obsessive, but he's braver, bolder. He has absolute courage in his convictions. He's not a saint, but at the centre of him is something very admirable. I think it would be lovely to have that conviction, that very clear belief structure. I guess I wish I had that.\" Whishaw has a whimsical, meandering way of talking, and a tendency to start stories that don't go anywhere. (On clothes: \"I once had a pair of jeans I really liked. I loved them, they were perfect! And then they fell apart and, um, well I didn't buy another pair.\") His ideal day off, he says, would be wandering around the markets and flower markets in east London, where he lives. \"I like to sort of drift about.\" West swears a great deal, loudly and with immaculate enunciation, in the manner of Hugh Grant in Four Weddings. Eton educated, he shook off the posh actor label when he scored his role in The Wire; having done that, he is free to play posh again. \"Hector is old-school. He was at D-day. But his ambition means that he has to try to leave that behind, to straddle the old establishment and the new.\" A bit like you then? He starts to laugh. \"Well, I think we both enjoy a party. Wine, women and song, you know.\" He smiles at me, longing for the woman from the Guardian to get wound up, so I ignore him and ask about something else, at which point he cuts in to announce, \"I do quite like winding people up. I enjoy winding Romola up, especially. Probably because I just adore her. The thing about Romola is\" – he calls her \"Romsey Poms\" only when she's there to be teased, I notice – \"that she doesn't seem to have the slightest idea how sexy and beautiful she is. Oh, fuck, fuck, don't quote me on that. She'll fucking kill me.\" He actually looks quite scared. The Hour's art director is Eve Stewart, whose CV ranges from Mike Leigh films to The King's Speech. \"I've never known anyone like her,\" Garai says. \"In one meeting scene, I had a piece of paper in my hand, which you couldn't see on camera, and I looked down and it was a precis of a story that had been mentioned in passing in the script as a story The Hour might have covered that week – the first African American air hostess, I think it was. And it was a proper printed two-page report, on the original 1950s paper typed on an authentic period typewriter. Factually accurate. I mean, is she mad? But there's something about a show in which every department completely commits to making the show real, which somehow transmits itself to the audience.\" Similarly, the on-set office of Suzanne Cave, the costume designer, is plastered with moodboards building a visual backstory for the characters, textured with both contemporary references and those that either layer in other references or add a modern element, helping the clothes read easily to a 21st-century eye. So for Bel's character there are tearsheets from a shoot of Rachel Weisz in AnOther Magazine, which Cave loved for the saturated block-colour outfits (a true-to-1957 trend that looks right and glamorous for today); for Chancellor's character, Lix Storm, there are photos of Katharine Hepburn and Susan Sontag; for Freddie, there is Jack Kerouac and James Dean, all turned-up collars and shy swagger. The Hour's costumes are a labour of love. The showgirls' stagewear was created by layering strings of pearls, yards of lace and pieces of jet fringing on to old-fashioned corsetted underwear from John Lewis. But the biggest visual challenge, Stewart says, is \"boring offices. They are quite difficult to get right, because no one takes photographs of their boring offices, so it's hard to get the information. And it's the detail that matters.\" So she was thrilled, when first seeing the Hornsey Town Hall building, to find that the door handles were from the correct period (\"You wouldn't believe how long it can take to source the right door handles\"). \"My job is to create a bubble of belief where the story can become real. I do think that if I can help the actors believe, that transmits itself to the audience, almost in a subliminal way. But on the other hand, I know that this all sounds mad.\" • The new series of The Hour begins on BBC2 in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2011/jun/26/power-shortages-force-japanese-car-firms-into-weekly-shutdowns","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-25T23:07:00Z","webTitle":"Power shortages force Japanese car firms into weekly shutdowns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/26/power-shortages-force-japanese-car-firms-into-weekly-shutdowns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/jun/26/power-shortages-force-japanese-car-firms-into-weekly-shutdowns","fields":{"headline":"Power shortages force Japanese car firms into weekly shutdowns","bodyText":"Japanese car companies will stop working on Thursdays and Fridays next month and transfer shifts to weekends in a move that industry executives hope will relieve the pressure on Japan's faltering electricity supply. The move comes as the UK outposts of major manufacturers, which between them employ more than 10,000 workers, target a return to 100% production following disruption due to component shortages from earthquake-hit Japan. Nissan said it had \"stabilised\" the situation at its Sunderland plant, while Toyota has promised to claw back UK production losses by the end of the year. Honda has cut its production target at Swindon from 122,000 vehicles in 2011 to about 102,000 and will not return to pre-tsunami production levels until after its summer break. \"It has been tough and it will present a challenge for the back end of the year,\" said a Honda spokesman. Japan's key role in the UK car industry was underlined by production figures for May, which saw a 14.9% fall. Nonetheless, analysts at IHS Automotive expect British manufacturing to be bolstered by booming sales in emerging countries such as China, with total car production rising by 10% to 1.4m units. Nissan said 5,000 employees would work over the weekend in Japan to take the strain off the Japanese grid, which has suffered a severe loss of supply after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. A cut in peak demand during the week is expected to help Japanese electricity suppliers as they wrestle with the loss of power from Fukushima and several other power stations affected by the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. Electricity use across Japan is at its lowest at the weekend. Toshiyuki Shiga, the company's chief operating officer, said the entire industry would make the shift to weekend working to prevent the electricity system from failing during peak periods. He said: \"It is something we must do if there is to be a 15% saving on electricity consumption on top of the savings that have already been made, which is what the government is seeking.\" He added: \"It is a problem because we face a backlog of orders from the US and Europe following the disruption to the supply chain. So a new Saturday-to-Wednesday regime needs to produce more cars than usual while satisfying the need to cut electricity.\" The fallout from the earthquake and the sharp reduction in electricity supply has made many Japanese companies gloomy about the economy this year. A twice-yearly survey by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper found that close to half of the executives polled at 100 companies believed the economy was heading downhill. Masami Yamamoto, president of the electronics multinational Fujitsu, told the paper: \"The disasters threw cold water on the entire economy.\" Businesses have complained to the administration of prime minister Naoto Kan that it needs to act quickly to rebuild the worst-affected areas along the eastern seaboard and resolve the country's electricity supply issues. Only 17 of the country's 56 nuclear plants are working, with many offline for repairs after the tsunami or for regular maintenance. Businesses fear many will be prevented from coming back into use by local authorities, which have jurisdiction over local power plants. A further 12 new plants are expected to be scrapped following pressure from local groups. As in Germany, the crisis at the Fukushima plant has sparked a public backlash against nuclear power. The Kan government has demanded a major shift to renewable energy, with a plan for solar panels on 10m homes over 10 years. But businesses are concerned this is too ambitious and will not satisfy industry's immediate energy demands. One industry source said: \"It is fine for Germany to say it no longer wants to build nuclear power plants because it can buy electricity from France, but who can we buy from? There is no one. The only answer will be to import more oil, and where does that leave our plans to cut C02 emissions?\" Office buildings across the country have turned down the settings on air conditioning, reduced the number of lifts in service and switched off lights in corridors to cut demand for power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/feb/05/edf-disturbing-news-hinkley-point-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-05T00:05:46Z","webTitle":"Letter: Disturbing news from Hinkley Point","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/05/edf-disturbing-news-hinkley-point-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/feb/05/edf-disturbing-news-hinkley-point-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Disturbing news from Hinkley Point","bodyText":"We are disturbed to discover that the energy company Electricité de France (EDF) is already proposing to start major preparation work at Hinkley Point in Somerset even before it has permission to build a new nuclear power station. The work, covering more than 400 acres, will involve the removal of most hedges and trees, rerouting underground streams, closure of all rights of way, and the excavation of more than 2.3m cubic metres of soil and rocks. This would be enough to fill Wembley stadium twice over. It will effectively mean preparing the foundations for the proposed twin reactors. Nuclear power has many downsides, not least the fact that radioactive waste will be stored at Hinkley Point for up to 100 years after these new reactors have stopped operating. But EDF should not be allowed to justify this precipitate action by saying that \"national need for nuclear\" demands it move forward with its plans as fast as possible. There is no reason why we cannot keep the lights on in Britain by a stronger commitment to energy saving, by a continuing (but decreasing) use of cleaner fossil fuels, and through a major expansion of renewable energy sources. If Spain can already meet 35% of its electricity demand from renewables (Spain helps out France in green power surge, 29 December), then Britain, with abundant wind and water resources, could do even better.

In an intriguing insight into the stated aim of Australian \"middle power diplomacy\" by the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, the tranche of cables show a country pulled in different directions by the US, China and Japan on environmental issues. The cables from the US embassy in Canberra, released by WikiLeaks, show that Rudd was keen to stress his pro-American credentials, given his background as a Mandarin-speaking former Beijing diplomat. At a December 2007 meeting, Rudd told the US ambassador he was not \"starry-eyed towards China\" and that his government would not give the US \"any grief\" over reducing its carbon emissions. This was followed by another cable sent a month later, in which the US embassy noted Rudd's efforts to act as an \"intermediary\" between China and the west on climate change, adding that the prime minister wasn't a \"panda hugger\". However, the cable also highlights areas of division, citing Rudd's immediate signing of the Kyoto protocol, unlike the US, after taking power. The prime minister, the cable states, will take a more \"independent\" stance on US-Australia relations, pulling back from predecessor John Howard's \"unquestioning cheer squad\" approach. Australia has also had a complicated relationship with China when it comes to environmental matters, the leaked cables suggest. A March 2005 cable describes talks between Chinese officials and John Carlson, director general of the Australian Safeguards and Nonproliferation Office. Carlson said there was an \"agreement for co-operation\" for uranium sales to China, with Australia sending 80% of its annual 10,000 tonne export cargo to the country. China said it needed the uranium to boost its production of nuclear power from 2% of overall energy production to 4% by 2020. However, Carlsson pointed out that the Chinese officials were a \"bit coy\" when asked whether they were using enriched uranium to make missiles. Carlsson ruminated that Howard-era Australia \"might some day\" import nuclear reactors from China, although the cable stresses that this would require the \"Australian Labor party, Greens and the general Australian public drop their opposition to nuclear energy in the meantime.\" This revelation may cause disquiet in Australia, which has consistently vocalised bipartisan opposition to nuclear power, despite having the largest deposits of uranium in the world. By January 2010, with Rudd in power, Australia's relationship with China appeared to be on rockier ground. In the wake of the disastrous Copenhagen climate change talks, Martin Parkinson, secretary of Australia's Department of Climate Change, \"expressed concern to Chinese diplomats over the lack of ambition\" in China's stated goal of a 40-45% reduction in carbon intensity by 2020. Parkinson said that Rudd had a \"concrete action plan\" to address the deficiencies of the Danish summit, but that \"China would only do what it saw in its own interest, so demonstrating that early action would be in China's own best interest is critical.\" Parkinson warned that Chinese failure to include its carbon pledge in the Copenhagen accord would \"seriously jeopardise\" Australia's own emissions trading scheme (ETS). Ultimately, China did commit to the goal, but the ETS didn't materialise anyway. The failure to pass the legislation was a significant factor in the downfall of Rudd, who was replaced as prime minister by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in June last year. He has since returned to the government front benches as foreign minister. It is perhaps surprising that Australia attacked China for a lack of ambition over emissions targets when it has itself committed to a mere 5% cut on 2000 levels by 2020. Doubts have been raised that even this modest goal will be achieved. Caught between the competing interests of traditional ally, the US, and regional superpower, China, Australia has also managed to clash with its second largest trading partner – Japan. A leaked cable from May 2008 shows the frantic attempts made by the then foreign minister Stephen Smith to smooth the relationship with Tokyo over Japan's whaling activities in the Southern Ocean. Whaling is highly controversial in Australia, although Japan maintains its activities are legal due to the \"scientific\" nature of the hunts. Smith, anxious over the potential damage to trade agreements, backed down from a previous threat to refer Japan's continued whaling to the International Court of Justice, according to the cable. A separate October 2008 cable highlights the Australian government's concern over the issue, with the cabinet divided over whether legal action was preferable or even likely to succeed. The repeated harassment of Japanese whaling boats by the conservationist Sea Shepherd vessel saw the Australian government take a \"low key\" approach to \" prevent a diplomatic escalation to match that taking place at sea\", a cable from February 2009 reveals. However, a harder line was adopted by Australia following the sinking of the Ady Gil, a speedboat used by Sea Shepherd. The Ady Gil was sliced in half after a collision with a Japanese whaling vessel in January 2010, with both sides blaming each other for the incident. A US diplomatic cable correctly predicted that Japan would \"come away clean\" from the resulting inquiry, although Japanese officials told the US embassy that they considered legal action over whaling \"inevitable\" after Rudd demanded an end to the practice. Japan subsequently suspended its Antarctic whaling activities, although Australia is still pushing for a permanent end to the hunts. The leaked cables also shine a light on a domestic environmental controversy that is currently dogging the beleaguered Labor government. Two companies involved in the construction of a contentious A$35bn liquefied natural gas hub in an untouched area of Western Australia claim that the government gave them no option but to use the site. A December 2009 cable reveals complaints by Chevron and BHP that \"unprecedented interference\" by government officials meant that they had to go along with project leader Woodside and develop on the Kimberley coastline. Environmental groups claim the LNG plant will ruin an area that contains one of the world's longest trails of dinosaur footprints, as well as pollute the Kimberley coast, endangering rare communities of humpback whales, snubnosed dolphins and sea turtles. Last week, federal resources minister Tony Burke announced that he will add 20m hectares of the Kimberley to the national heritage list, with the caveat that development such as the LNG plant will be allowed to continue, a position that has enraged conservationists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/jan/11/frank-cook","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-11T18:35:00Z","webTitle":"Frank Cook obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/11/frank-cook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/jan/11/frank-cook","fields":{"headline":"Frank Cook obituary","bodyText":"Though the former Labour MP Frank Cook, who has died aged 76 after suffering from lung cancer, always insisted that he was a simple leftwinger, as strong on defence as he was against nuclear war, there was nothing predictable about this veteran maverick. During the 27 years that he represented Stockton North, on Teesside, his views on his specialist subject were well defined, but also changeable. In the March 2003 Commons debate on the imminent invasion of Iraq, having voted for the anti-invasion amendment that he had co-authored with Chris Smith, he then backed the pro-invasion motion so important to Tony Blair's government. As he emerged from the voting lobby, he felt a blow on his left shoulder. He wheeled around, only to find that the prime minister had forcefully patted him on the back to thank him for having yielded to his 25 minutes of one-to-one persuasion. A unilateralist on nuclear disarmament, Cook had nonetheless in 1998 urged the use of \"laser-guided, bunker-penetrating bombs of a low-yield tactical thermo-nuclear character\" against Saddam Hussein's Iraq. From 1999 to 2010 Cook was a deputy speaker of the Commons for its Westminster Hall debates. He had no wish to leave the house, but deselection by his constituency party in 2008 was followed in 2009 by an appearance in the Daily Telegraph's exposure of expenses claims. In the 2010 general election, he stood as an independent, gaining just 4% of the vote. Cook was born in Hartlepool, the son of a gardener, James Cook, and his wife, Elizabeth, and was educated by Jesuits at Corby school, Sunderland. At 18 he volunteered for the Parachute Regiment, but secured an early discharge when he was not allowed to jump because of a tendon shortened by earlier meningitis. Following training at De La Salle College, Manchester, and the Institute of Education in Leeds, he taught for nine years in Catholic and state schools. Two years after marrying Patricia Lundrigan in 1959, he switched jobs, becoming a project manager and senior construction planner for the engineering company Capper-Neill International, and joining the leftwing union AUEW-TASS, now part of Unite. Although he had been a leftwing member of the Labour party from the age of 15, he emerged into the political spotlight only when William Rodgers, the Social Democrat MP for Stockton-on-Tees, mentioned him as a local menace in an article in the Financial Times. This provoked Cook into seeking selection as the Labour candidate, and he narrowly won the seat, by then known as Stockton North, in the 1983 election, forcing Rodgers into third place. A member of the hard-left Campaign group as well as the soft-left Tribune group, he co-sponsored Liverpool's Militant-tolerating Eric Heffer in Labour's leadership election, against Neil Kinnock. The issue that Cook made very much his own was the danger of the civil use of nuclear power. In October 1983 he campaigned against the dumping of intermediate-level radioactive waste in a disused mine under his Billingham home, and for an independent commission to promote alternative souces of energy. Regarding himself as \"an MP who is a Catholic, and not as a Roman Catholic who is an MP\", he became aware of reports of sex abuse, particularly in the Catholic church in America. With Mo Mowlam, he urged a judicial inquiry into such abuses in the UK. In May 1989, with others, he rejected Kinnock's conversion to multilateralism. His rejection of nuclear weapons for Britain was of a piece with his continuing crusade against civil nuclear energy. A hard worker, Cook collapsed in 1990 from low blood pressure and exhaustion, and had a bowel cancer operation. While recuperating in hospital, he helped constituency wives visit their husbands serving in the Gulf. After retaining his seat with an enhanced majority in 1992, he joined the defence select committee and opposed defence cuts, especially the closure of his constituency's Eaglescliffe naval depot. He spoke about the events of March 2003 in a Commons debate on Iraq five years later, detailing Blair's determination to win the government's motion with Labour votes: \"I have regretted it to the bottom of my heart and I am deeply ashamed that I allowed myself to do it.\" He was also compelled to express regret when humiliated by the Telegraph in its serial exposure of the abuse by MPs of their allowances, splashing across the front page his request to be reimbursed for £5 contributed to a church memorial for fallen servicemen. He immediately admitted that the fees office was correct in refusing it. He is survived by his second wife, Somsangouane, along with his son, Andrew, and his daughters, Christine, Maxine and Nichola, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. • Francis Cook, politician, born 3 November 1935; died 11 January 2012 Andrew Roth died in 2010"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/blog/2011/mar/16/nikkei-stock-markets","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T07:15:00Z","webTitle":"Nikkei rallies 5.68% as Japanese stocks rebound","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2011/mar/16/nikkei-stock-markets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/blog/2011/mar/16/nikkei-stock-markets","fields":{"headline":"Nikkei rallies 5.68% as Japanese stocks rebound","bodyText":"The Japanese stock market staged a rally on Wednesday, closing higher as the emergency operation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant continued.

However the index has still fallen around 12% since Friday morning. Josh Raymond of City Index warned that today's gains could be a classic \"dead cat bounce\" rather than a genuine revival in confidence. Many of Japan's manufacturers rallied strongly, on hopes that production will be less badly affected than feared. Toyota rose 9.1%, while Sony gained 8.8%. But shares in Tokyo Electric Power, which runs the Fukushima plant, fell by 25% - the maximum daily fall permitted on the Nikkei - for the third day running.

Gone are the days when budgets were conceived and brought to term in purdah, when anyone who revealed a dot or comma was clapped in irons. Today's budget is the result of the most promiscuous political orgy of the year. We have seen cabinet ministers openly quarrelling, Tories with Liberal Democrats, left with right, and all prancing the streets waving tycoon taxes, 50p rates, regional pay, stamp duty and Sunday trading. We shall miss them when they are gone. On any showing George Osborne has survived a tough two years. He has presided over a credit crisis followed by prolonged recession, with a worse growth record than any comparable economy. Back in 2010 he nailed his colours to the mast of credit rectitude, and his virtue has been rewarded by the gods of economic policy, \"the markets\". His political achievement has been to silence anyone who claims the basis of his policy mistaken. Nick Clegg parrots his phraseology. His Labour opponent, Ed Balls, has been reduced to mumbling that he would do the same thing \"but slower\", which hardly sets the Thames on fire. Yet Osborne is primarily a politician. He knows he must deliver growth by 2015 or die. No opinion poll shows his party anywhere near comfortable. Hence the single word flashing over Downing Street, the lodestar of every policy, the obsession of every speech. For all the tribal howling that will greet today's changes, they are about one thing: growth. The problem is that Osborne has denied himself the one certain engine of that growth, a boost to short-term demand. He adheres rigidly to his budgetary balance, and any extra cash from \"quantitative easing\" is squirrelled away in bank vaults. A serious humiliation for the Treasury will be the announcement of yet another bank lending stream to \"small and medium-sized firms\". But where else was £250bn in bank subsidy over the past three years supposed to go? The banks are to today's economic policy what the unions were in the 1970s, a poison in the system. This leaves Osborne with no room for budgetary manoeuvre. He can tinker with tax. He can fuss and fume over deregulation. He can let David Cameron tramp the land promising huge sums for infrastructure on the never-never. But he has no real money to spend. For every gainer there must be a loser, or at least a gain postponed, nor dare he appear to favour left or right in this calculus. The fiercest argument, over income tax, seems to have led to just such a zero-sum game. A cut in the 50p top rate is to be balanced by a rise in tax from the rich through ending avoidance, with something in reserve for the Liberal Democrats at the bottom end of the income scale. Clegg and his colleagues have been remarkably tolerant on this, given wide public support for the 50p rate. The Lib Dem Simon Hughes went so far on Monday as to declare himself no friend of 50p, since \"our priority is to lift people out of tax at the bottom by ending loopholes at the top\". The chief tussle with the Liberal Democrats has been over the biggest such loophole, Britain's highly regressive property levy, local council tax. Here the Liberal Democrats appear to have lost. If the party's Vince Cable had advocated one or more upper council tax bands as in Wales, rather than a national \"mansion tax\" on capital value, he might have scored. But Cable is a centralist at heart. He thus deprived his party of the chance to claim one truly progressive tax victory. Osborne is left with a goulash of winners and losers, of lower taxes, higher thresholds, less avoidance and more child benefit, hoping that squeals of delight from the Tory right balance those of the Liberal Democrat left. Nor can this do much to aid growth. The same applies to the coalition's bull-in-a-china-shop approach to deregulation, welcome though progress on this front might be. There is talk of thousands of pages of rules being abolished, with 174 environmental protections alone to go. Yet every regulation is some mother's son. Deregulation is good in general but tends to be bad in particular. If the coalition can truly liberate \"gold-plated\" health and safety, loosen employment law, ease building regulations and free up planning without plunging it into corruption and eternal litigation, well and good. But it will do little for short-term growth. That leaves the cod-Keynesianism of \"public works\" as talisman of Osborne's expansionist zeal. A conceit of modern government holds that all infrastructure, however funded, is \"good growth\", whereas all cash injected into the economy through tax cuts or transfers is \"bad growth\". It is the old socialist view that government knows best how to slice and distribute the national cake. Cameron and Osborne are big government men to their cores. In the case of infrastructure projects they have become putty in the hands of the construction lobbies. They now promise high-speed railways, airport runways, pseudo-privatised motorways, wind turbines, nuclear power stations and ecotowns galore. Few of these cost money or generate employment in the short term, which is why the Treasury seems so relaxed about them. But all, if built, commit future governments to large expenditures and borrowings. The collapse of Whitehall financial discipline under infrastructure private finance initiative was the Treasury's most disastrous defeat at the turn of the 21st century. As the railways and London's hospitals have shown, a public project is no less a drain on the taxpayer for being laundered through the City. Yet no one dares to object to infrastructure spending or submit it to value for money. It is all \"good\". The Liberal Democrats revel in it and Gordon Brown was addicted to it. In this respect, Osborne-ism is Brown-ism on stilts. The coalition can claim credit for sustaining its radicalism through desperate times. It struggles to redress Labour's failure to reform swaths of the welfare state, from misallocated housing and social benefits through jobless relief to student finance and an over-engineered NHS. For all the catcalls from the political gallery, this has been a give-and-take coalition, as today's budget will show. But politics is all, and this may be the last great moment of Tory-Lib-Dem accord. Nick Clegg knows he must soon break loose from Cameron, or his party will evaporate at the next election. That is why Osborne must cram his radicalism into 2012, which means now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/jan/04/finnish-lesson-for-nuclear-advocates","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-04T00:05:03Z","webTitle":"Letters: Finnish lesson for advocates of a quick go-ahead for nuclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/04/finnish-lesson-for-nuclear-advocates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jan/04/finnish-lesson-for-nuclear-advocates","fields":{"headline":"Finnish lesson for advocates of a quick go-ahead for nuclear","bodyText":"Professor Kemp (Letters, 1 January) thinks we need nuclear power and should just get on with it. I wonder whether he has consulted the Finns, who in 2000 commissioned a nuclear power station at Olkiluoto from the same consortium set to start in the UK. In May 2009 the plant was at least three and a half years behind schedule and more than 50% over budget. The commissioning deadline has been postponed several times and as of June 2010 operation is set to start in 2013. Nuclear power is not emissions free. According to one report, low-grade uranium would increase CO2 emissions close to those of a gas-fired plant. Investment in renewables and co-generation declined when the existing four Finnish nuclear power stations were connected to the grid. If the Finns had voted against the nuclear option in 1993, it would have given a big boost to the renewables industry and created many jobs. One great difference between Finland and the UK is that the area of Finland is vast in relation to its population. Even so they have grave concerns for the danger that radioactive contaminates will leech out from their stores of nuclear waste into subterranean aquifers. Kate Macintosh Winchester • Roger Kemp argues that we need to give extra funds for more nuclear power to keep the lights on. Yet the government, in its national policy statement, plans to have no more than 50% of electricity supplied by non-fossil sources. Most of the rest, presumably, would come from gas. In fact, under the proposals we will be lucky to get more than 20% from renewables, with more from nuclear. There are plenty of technical options for balancing even a 50% renewable share of electricity supply, given recent advances in wind power predictive techniques. By contrast, as witnessed by the blackouts in May 2008 triggered by problems at Sizewell B nuclear power station, it is unexpected breakdowns at large centralised plants that threaten to plunge large numbers of people into the dark. Dr David Toke University of Birmingham • As Caroline Spelman (Letters, 1 January) and Professor Kemp comment, there is unfinished business in reducing carbon and achieving sustainability in UK energy policy. Modest investments, both public and private, in energy conservation and efficiency will pay immediate dividends and help reduce the current waste of half the energy we consume. Electricity only supplies about 10% of our energy demand, so bigger savings can be got in tackling the other 90%, of mostly gas, oil and coal used for transport, industrial processes and building heating. When we have reduced our energy consumption by wasting less, then investment in new \"fuels\" and electricity generation would be sensible.

It is true, as both Julian Borger and Saeed Kamali Dehghan pointed out, that whoever is doing this risks profound consequences for the region. What many people fail to recognise, though, is that a covert campaign, while rife with physical, diplomatic and legal risks, is the lesser of many evils. No one should doubt that the west (and Israel) desire a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear programme. The Stuxnet virus, mysterious explosions at military bases and the James Bond-esque antics of motorcycle assassins have taken up many column inches, while less has been written about the efforts of the E3+3 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and US) to reach a diplomatic solution. Since 2003, western powers, working closely with their often-resistant Russian and Chinese counterparts, have kept the door open to Iran to negotiate. This has been despite continual provocation, whether in the form of secret enrichment facilities such as the one outside Qom or in Iran's bellicose pronouncements regarding enrichment. The E3+3 continues to hold out a generous offer to Iran: give up your military programme that even the International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed concern about and receive economic investment and a properly safeguarded modern civil nuclear programme. That would be a good deal in most people's eyes. A military campaign is one alternative to a diplomatic solution. The debate around the pros and cons is unlikely to reduce any time soon. Meir Dagan, Israel's former spy chief, has been one notable voice sounding caution, with the US Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum at the opposite end of the spectrum, preparing to fuel US fighter jets if he becomes the US's next commander in chief. Many commentators argue that supporters of a covert campaign see it as an alternative to war. They warn that covert action will ruin chances of dialogue with Tehran while encouraging Iran to use its own covert operations. What this fails to recognise is that Iran has long been the master of covert operations. Through the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), Iran has been responsible for increasing the efficacy of insurgent improvised bombs in both Iraq and Afghanistan. It has helped to prop up Bashar al-Assad's murderous regime in Syria and has a track record of attempting to assassinate or imprison its enemies – both at home and abroad. Instead of damaging the chances of dialogue, covert action might actually do the opposite. All those who have been involved in negotiating with Iran understand the difficulties involved. Iran's leaders continue to see the Islamic Republic through its long and rich history as a regional and world power rather than through its modern reality as an isolated pariah state with a weak economy that oppresses its brave citizens while rigging \"democratic\" elections. As a result, the supreme leader has consistently refused to allow his negotiators to engage in a meaningful dialogue. Instead, Iran has held out the prospect of talks while more often than not refusing to even put the nuclear issue on the agenda. The E3+3, in their desire to keep the door open, have accepted these talks, but have never seen any fruits from their labour. The one notable exception to this was in October 2003, when, surrounded by hundreds of thousands of US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, and having seen its closest neighbour toppled, the supreme leader authorised the signing of the Tehran declaration. This agreement with the UK, France and Germany led to the temporary suspension of Iran's uranium enrichment and demonstrated that, when faced with an existential threat to the regime, Iran was willing to deal. What followed, however, was an uprising in Iraq (assisted by Tehran), stalemate in Afghanistan (assisted by Tehran) and a reduction in pressure as the international community focused on other issues, believing the problem was being solved. To deliver a negotiated settlement needs a comprehensive strategy. Covert action, increasingly robust sanctions, along with a credible threat of military action remain one half of the E3+3's dual-track strategy of pressure and engagement that was recently restated by the British foreign secretary. Covert action carries risks, but does not impact on the brave Iranian people that the Iranian authorities continually oppress. Covert action creates the time and space for pressure to build, while reducing the need for military action. Ultimately, covert action should be aimed at bringing enough pressure to bear on Iran's leaders so that they understand they will never reach their goal of being a nuclear power. It is only at that point diplomacy can have any hope of success."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/may/23/climate-change-interest-yougov-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-23T18:27:52Z","webTitle":"Climate change concern declines in poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/23/climate-change-interest-yougov-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/may/23/climate-change-interest-yougov-survey","fields":{"headline":"Climate change concern declines in poll","bodyText":"Popular concern about climate change has declined significantly, following this year's harsh winter and rows over statistics on global warming, a survey has found. The numbers of those interested in where Britain's electricity comes from have also slipped back, according to a survey commissioned by the energy company EDF, demonstrating what appears to be growing consumer complacency in an era of electric-powered gadgetry. At the same time resistance to building new nuclear power stations appears to be slackening. The results of the YouGov poll, based on a sample of 4,300 adults questioned during the week after the general election, show that interest in climate change fell from 80% of respondents in 2006, to 71% last year and now stands at only 62%. Only 80% say they are interested in where electrical power is made, down from 82% the previous year. Other recent polls have recorded a similar drop in public alarm about the imminence of climate-triggered disaster. The number of climate change agnostics – those unsure whether human activity is warming the planet – has risen from 25% in 2007 to 33% now. There may be many reasons for the change. Failure to reach agreement on fresh emissions targets at the Copenhagen climate summit, the furore over the leaking of global warming data from the University of East Anglia and the recent cold weather may all have contributed to confusion around the issue. The French-owned firm EDF, which commissioned the latest poll, owns British Energy, which runs eight nuclear power stations in the UK. EDF plans to build a new generation of nuclear plants, with the first in operation by 2017. The survey says the \"favourability rating\" of nuclear power stations rose from +4 to + 16 between 2007 and this year. Among Lib Dems – the coalition party explicitly opposed to new nuclear building – as many as 58% of supporters believe \"nuclear energy has disadvantages, but the country needs it to be part of the energy balance\", according to the survey. Slightly fewer, 47%, are in favour of the construction of new nuclear power stations; 32% are opposed. Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, said the poll \"recognises the scale of the energy challenges facing the UK and the need for a low-carbon, eco-friendly economy as outlined by the coalition government. \"We are pleased to see strong public support across voters from all three major political parties in favour of new nuclear build. We also note that opposition to new nuclear build has continued to fall. This strong public support is further reflected by the clear backing for planning reform to facilitate investment in low carbon technologies, including nuclear. \"We need urgent action if we are to meet the UK's carbon emissions targets and address the looming energy gap. We believe nuclear power is the lowest cost low-carbon solution and can be built in the UK without subsidy. Therefore, it must be part of an affordable, clean and secure generation mix.\" EDF, he said, \"remains resolute in its commitment to a truly sustainable economy\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/15/george-osborne-budget-bill-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-15T11:24:00Z","webTitle":"George Osborne's attacks on the environment are costing UK billions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/15/george-osborne-budget-bill-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/15/george-osborne-budget-bill-uk","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne's attacks on the environment are costing UK billions","bodyText":"\"Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it's enemy action.\" So said James Bond's arch-enemy, Goldfinger. In his forthcoming budget, George Osborne may bag the hattrick of environmental attacks that would put to bed to his pre-election statement that his Treasury would be \"a green ally, not a foe\". First he told his party conference in October that saving the planet risked \"putting our country out of business\", then his autumn statement lambasted burdening businesses \"with endless social and environmental goals\". The most extraordinary thing is not that Osborne and David Cameron have abandoned their pledge to be the \"greenest government ever\", but that Osborne's trash-talk delivers the precise opposite of what it intends: it imposes huge extra costs onto taxpayers and businesses under the mirage of freeing them red tape. How can the finance minister of the world's seventh biggest economy get it so wrong, you might well ask? The short answer is a corrosive cocktail of desperation for economic growth at any price blended with sheer ignorance and, apparently, relying on the Daily Mail. The long answer centres on how Osborne's contemptuous rhetoric drives up the political risk of rebuilding the UK's creaking energy infrastructure, which in turn drives up the cost of financing the £200bn investment needed. But let's start with the very example of environmental red tape raised by Osborne himself, which turns out to be a complete red herring. He railed against the EU wildlife habitats directive for placing \"ridiculous costs on British businesses\" in November and Cameron weighed in last week in cabinet, berating environment secretary Caroline Spelman for the lack of progress. In fact, an exhaustive analysis by Spelman's department showed that a mere 0.5% of projects affected by the habitats directive have had problems. These are now being remedied not through the shredding of any red tape at all, but by friendly negotiation. And, in a final magnificent irony, the projects that had been hampered were those green icons, offshore wind farms. It's gone from red tape to red herring to red face in barely four months. A more complex, but far greater problem caused by the chancellor's casual green malice is its effect on the cost of borrowing money for clean energy projects. The UK has no choice but to build a new energy system and it will be a clean and sustainable one sooner or later. Unlike polluting gas and coal plants, the investment in renewable energy projects (and nuclear power) is heavily front-loaded, followed by near-free energy for years. That front-loading means the price you pay for the capital is the key variable, and that is directly linked to political risk. After Osborne's autumn outburst, the man running one of the UK's biggest renewables portfolios told me: \"Within hours I got an email from the chief executive asking 'Does this mean we should not be investing in the UK?' We are competing internationally for capital, and his words sent shivers through the market.\" That executive is far from alone, with many energy industry leaders privately expressing their horror. So what Osborne says really matters, as does Cameron's telling silence. Ratcheting up the political risk of green projects by throwing red meat to his party's Tea Party fringe is quite conceivably adding billions to the cost of our energy future system, money that will be added to the bills paid by homeowners and businesses. Paradoxically, those soaring bills are a particular concern for Osborne, I'm told, as he has privately defended his green antagonism by saying he was more worried about the £200-a-year of \"green taxes\" borne by energy customers. That figure was made up by a climate change sceptic and printed in the Daily Mail, which then had to print a correction, noting the real figure was far lower. Again I ask, can Osborne really be so badly advised? It seems so. The London School of Economics say the economic models used by government can be \"highly misleading\" when applied to low-carbon energy. In the meetings he has declared to date, the chancellor has met only the following energy-related companies: Centrica, ExxonMobile, Total and trade body Oil and Gas UK. The one lobby he has heard loud and clear are the bloated carbon fat cats in the steel and cement industries, who blame green taxes for their laying off of thousands of workers while simultaneously banking billions of Euros in spare carbon pollution permits. Meanwhile, the environmental services industries in the UK employ more people than teaching, yet in Osborne's eyes appear to be mere do-gooders who can be tolerated only in financial good times. Osborne's trash-talk has other effects that cost you money too. Over 100 emboldened Tory MPs blasted fear into the wind industry recently, railing against onshore wind farms. Yet the obvious alternative – siting them offshore – will cost far more, another price hike borne by bill payers already reeling from the huge hikes in global gas prices. The one thing Osborne does like about green policies is the money they pour into the exchequer. The green fig leaf, behind which Osborne tries to hide his dignity is in fact a huge tax grab. The carbon floor price, which is good in principle, has significant flaws, but with the tax stream flowing straight into HMT, it's unlikely to be fixed. Worse, he turned revenue-neutral scheme to drive energy efficiency in businesses – called the carbon reduction commitment (CRC) – into a straight tax hike. And the big idea Osborne can lay claim to – the green investment bank – has been hamstrung by the Treasury, unable to borrow before 2015 at the earliest. Osborne need not look too far for advice on how to change his ways. \"In 2012. I hope we will see a greater articulation of the strong support there is for the big investments we are making in Britain's green transition, not least because it is a huge opportunity for UK plc and will be a significant driver of growth and recovery,\" said energy and climate change minister – and Tory moderniser – Greg Barker, in January. Yet the contortions of coalition politics means the issue appears relegated firmly to a source of spats with the junior partners, with LibDem leader Nick Clegg now openly challenging Osborne's green gaffes. This government has taken significant strides towards the sustainable, green economy that is the only long term source of prosperity for this nation. But Osborne's political games are a serious hindrance and, worse, are hitting us where it hurts most in these penurious times – in the wallet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/19/berlusconi-referendum-defeat-di-pietro","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-18T23:07:00Z","webTitle":"Old foe Di Pietro closes in on Berlusconi after 15-year feud","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/19/berlusconi-referendum-defeat-di-pietro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/19/berlusconi-referendum-defeat-di-pietro","fields":{"headline":"Old foe closes in on Silvio Berlusconi after 15-year feud","bodyText":"After one of the worst weeks of Silvio Berlusconi's political career, the former magistrate who has spent the 15 years denouncing the prime minister's behaviour is pretty pleased with himself. As a magistrate in the early 1990s, Antonio Di Pietro famously battled corruption in Italy's \"clean hands\" investigation, which led to the meltdown of the country's main political parties. It was also Di Pietro who called for the referendum which defeated Berlusconi's plans to build nuclear power plants and privatise the water supply. The setback, following disastrous local election results, prompted even close allies to wonder if the media mogul had reached the end of his political shelf life. Di Pietro is jubilant. \"Right now is the moment to rebuild Italy,\" he told the Observer, \"and we must find an alternative to Silvio Berlusconi, whether he likes it or not.\" Berlusconi's poll numbers have tumbled from 40% to 29% in the wake of his trials for bribery and alleged payment to a teenage runaway for sex. Two weeks before the Di Pietro-inspired referendum, Berlusconi's party, Il Popolo della Libertà (The People of Freedom), lost control of Milan – the prime minister's heartland – when a former Communist won the local mayoral election. The push for the referendum was buoyed by support from web campaigns and Facebook, which proliferated despite the limited coverage of the vote on Italy's state-controlled TV networks. Di Pietro senses belated vindication. The rough-and-ready former magistrate's run-ins with Berlusconi over the past 15 years are the stuff of legend. The magistrate emerged from the \"clean hands\" probe as one of Italy's most popular men, prompting Berlusconi to offer him a job as interior minister after the media mogul was first elected prime minister in 1994. According to Marco Travaglio, an Italian journalist who has documented Berlusconi's tangles with the law, Berlusconi took Di Pietro's rejection badly. \"Di Pietro turned him down then,\" he said, \"and again in 1995, prompting the entourage of Berlusconi to cook up a series of false dossiers revealing alleged corruption, which kept Di Pietro tied up in the courts during the mid-90s proving his innocence. The mud-slinging machine that Berlusconi has used against his ex-wife and others was honed on Di Pietro.\" \"Berlusconi discovered I wasn't for sale and henceforth tried to convince Italians that I was a criminal,\" said Di Pietro. The feud has never stopped. Di Pietro, who founded his own political party, Italy of Values, has described Berlusconi as the \"rapist of democracy\" and \"an arrogant little dictator\" who entered politics to escape justice. Berlusconi has in turn claimed the former magistrate \"put innocent people in prison, ruining their lives and their families\" during the \"clean hands\" campaign. According to Di Pietro, it is largely down to Berlusconi that Italy's fraud and corruption problems are almost as bad now as they were in the early 1990s. Tax evasion amounts to the equivalent of 16% of gross domestic product, while the country's mafia clans boast revenues of around €135bn (£120bn). \"Berlusconi introduced the idea that you can do what you want,\" Di Pietro said. \"Today the first thought of anyone with a title, from mayor down to parking attendant, is: who can I cheat?\" Asked if Italy is suffering from an honesty deficit, Di Pietro said: \"Yes, but this is because people see politicians paying less for their crimes and are encouraged to try to scam everyone else.\" The tide is finally turning, he argues. Apart from defeating the government's plans for nuclear power and water privatisation, the referendum also overturned Berlusconi's law allowing ministers to use official business as an excuse to delay trials they are involved in. \"Before, Berlusconi was saying 'I can do whatever I like'. Well, he can't say that any more,\" said Di Pietro. The stinging defeat, he said, would make Berlusconi think twice about his next reported measure – a law to shorten trials which would be likely to \"time out\" those he is already involved in: \"If he tries that, we could be looking at a real revolt in Italy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jul/13/spain-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-13T15:59:20Z","webTitle":"Spain overtakes US with world's biggest solar power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/13/spain-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jul/13/spain-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Spain overtakes US with world's biggest solar power station","bodyText":"Spain has opened the world's largest solar power station, meaning that it overtakes the US as the biggest solar generator in the world. The nation's total solar power production is now equivalent to the output of a nuclear power station. Spain is a world leader in renewable energies and has long been a producer of hydro-electricity (only China and the US have built more dams). It also has a highly developed wind power sector which, like solar power, has received generous government subsidies. The new La Florida solar plant takes Spain's solar output to 432MW, which compares with the US output of 422MW. The plant, at Alvarado, Badajoz, in the west of the country, is a parabolic trough. With this method of collecting solar energy, sunlight is reflected off a parabolic mirror on to a fluid-filled tube. The heated liquid is then used to heat steam to run the turbines. The mirror rotates during the day to follow the sun's movement. The solar farm covers 550,000 square metres (the size of around 77 football pitches) and produces 50MW of power. Protermosolar, the association that represents the solar energy sector, says that within a year another 600MW will have come on-stream and projects that by 2013 solar capacity will have reached 2,500MW. The northern, though thinly populated, region of Navarra is already producing 75% of its energy from a range of renewables, including wind, solar, hydro and biomass. Spain's windfarms now produce around 20,000MW of electricity and on one day in November they accounted for 53% of demand. Last year, solar energy met 2.8% of demand out a total of 12.9% for all renewables. In March, the government announced a plan to increase the renewable share to 22.7% by 2020, slightly ahead of EU targets. With an average of 340 days of sunshine a year in Spain, solar is more reliable than wind, and can go a long way towards weaning the country off gas-fired and ageing nuclear power stations. Spain is now the fourth largest manufacturer of solar power technology in the world and both solar and wind power technology exports have become valuable earners in a country with a weak manufacturing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/business-sustainability-future-trends-finance-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-09T17:47:52Z","webTitle":"The sustainability movement: five trends on this side of the Atlantic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-sustainability-future-trends-finance-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/business-sustainability-future-trends-finance-investment","fields":{"headline":"The sustainability movement: five trends on this side of the Atlantic","bodyText":"Sustainability professionals in the US like to keep an eye on what's happening in Europe. The cutting-edge work by some of our companies – such as M&amp;S and Unilever – defines corporate leadership on sustainability. The EU is still the global market maker in environmental standards and regulation. And, despite its current woes, Europe is still the biggest economic bloc in the world. I was asked to give a brief presentation in San Francisco on the latest trends for business sustainability in Europe. I picked five themes. The first is a root and branch questioning of capitalism. I'm not just talking about the tents of the Occupy/Indignados movement here, but also deep concerns amongst mainstream businesspeople. When the credit crunch hit first time round, there was a rush to get back to business as usual and a remarkable lack of questioning of the economic basics. As we slip back into recession, with the spectre of a Euro-meltdown, lots of senior business people I'm talking to have fundamental worries about the future of the economic system. It will be interesting to see if these privately expressed misgivings come out into the open. Second, there is lots of focus at the moment on changing consumers through brands. Pioneering companies such as Unilever are realising that they have to change behaviour if they want to reduce their overall footprint. And, after all the attention on supply chain in the last couple of years, there is a new willingness from the big brands to get proactive with customers. Lots of this is still at the discussion stage, but we'll definitely see more initiatives like B&amp;Q's One Planet Living and Sainsbury's Love Your Leftovers. The third theme is that ecosystems are the new climate change. As the population grows and the science gets scarier, there is increasing attention on the basic services the planet provides to us, from clean water to raw materials in the supply chain. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity work to put a value on these natural services, has been led by Europe. And lots more companies are now asking Forum for the Future how to integrate thinking on biodiversity into their sustainability strategies. Fourth, we see a trend of smart everything: from intelligent building and smart cities to smart grids, even a smarter planet. With money short, especially in the public sector, people are focusing on invest-to-save, efficient management, and making more out of what we've got. And given that we have already built most of what we are going to build in Europe, the emphasis is on retrofit, overlaying digital intelligence on existing infrastructure. Smart cities, in particular, seem to be having their moment, with new funding streams from the European Commission, companies such as Siemens and Phillips investing heavily, and a host of smart cities conferences taking place this autumn. Finally, we may be facing a two-speed Europe. Such a restructuring would bring a much sharper recession, which would certainly be bad for sustainability. It would undermine Europe's global leadership in environmental negotiations. However, for environmental standards and spending, I suspect that things might balance out overall in a two-speed Europe. Yes, there will be laggards. But we would also expect to see a small number of countries pushing further and faster on integration and joint action. Germany, Europe's largest economy, will be at the heart of this group. And given its recent decision to phase out nuclear power, it should become a more vocal proponent of low carbon energy. So, these were the five trends I picked, based on my recent interactions and Forum for the Future's work. Some are emergent, others are clearer. What did I miss?

The wholesale cost makes up 56% of home energy bills, says the regulator Ofgem, by far the biggest single factor. And it's not as though it's hard to find out more. The very first words in Ofgem's most recent and very widely covered report are: Wholesale energy costs have continued to rise, particularly for gas, where for example the price of this winter's gas is around 40% higher than last winter's. This increase has been driven by global rises in oil and gas prices. This has contributed significantly to recent increases in customers' bills. Instead Tom Heap, an experienced and respected reporter, put offshore wind at the centre of the prime time show. This form of renewable energy is relatively expensive and a fearsome array of talking heads lined up to out-do one another in superlatives: \"eye-wateringly expensive\" was the winner, in my view. So how much are customers paying for this supposed lunacy? The answer, nowhere to be found in the whole 30-minute programme is about £20 a year - for all renewables subsidies. Include all government levies - mainly for schemes increasing energy efficiency and alleviating fuel poverty - and the cost rises to £80 a year. The increase in the average gas bill alone since last year due to wholesale price rises, using the Ofgem numbers above, was about £170. Chris Huhne, energy and climate secretary, tried valiantly to explain how the coalition government's policies would keep bills lower, compared to doing nothing. But he was hopelessly outgunned by gas-fanatic Dieter Helm, free-marketeer Simon Less and more. For the sake of brevity, I'll summarise the programme's other main failings, before ending on the one good thing. • Banging on about renewables, new nuclear and the cost of grid upgrades is fine if you are debating the future of energy bills. But, compared to wholesale price rises, these have almost nothing to do with the rises already seen. And all but ignoring energy efficiency measures - no mention at all of the Green deal - was just risible. • Why energy bills are rising cannot be understood without realising how the last 20 years of ultra-liberalised energy markets in the UK led to woeful underinvestment in new plants. We are paying the price for that now. • Global warming is the reason we must cut carbon emissions. Unless I missed it, neither 'global warming' or 'climate change' were mentioned once. • A total absence of green NGO voices was shocking. My Guardian colleague George Monbiot did appear, to make his eloquent argument for new nuclear power. But no major environment group agrees with him. These groups think hard and deep on the energy issue and should have had their say. • When considering predictions of 2020 energy prices, the programme said the government was on its own in saying costs were likely to be similar to now. As evidence of this, it cited higher estimates from Citigroup, which was fair enough, and the insane Uswitch estimate, which was not fair. Furthermore, the independent Committee on Climate Change, whose job it is to set out the most secure, least cost path to a low carbon future, agrees with the government's approach. So what was the good bit? The statement, clearly made by a number of the contributors, that energy prices are going up whatever mix of technology is deployed, and that unless politicians set out the case for their actions in an honest and open way, public anger is likely to foil the urgent need to give the UK an energy system for the 21st century."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/cartoon/2009/apr/16/utilities","type":"picture","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-16T11:06:16Z","webTitle":"Possible nuclear power sites unveiled","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/cartoon/2009/apr/16/utilities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/cartoon/2009/apr/16/utilities","fields":{"headline":"Possible nuclear power sites unveiled","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/dec/14/british-public-support-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-14T15:42:00Z","webTitle":"British public strongly support renewable energy, survey says  | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/14/british-public-support-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/14/british-public-support-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"British public strongly support renewable energy, survey says","bodyText":"Does the UK have a \"silent majority\" in support of further investment in renewables? You wouldn't necessarily think so if you listen to the very vocal, media-driven opposition against, say, wind power, but a recent YouGov survey commissioned by the Sunday Times suggests the true picture might be a little different. The Sunday Times itself chose not to report the YouGov findings related to renewables (you can draw your own conclusions as to why), but if you look beyond the headline polling about the 1,696 respondents' political leanings you start to reach some rather intriguing environmentally themed results from page seven onwards (pdf). For example, asked (over the period 24-25 November) if they would support or oppose a high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, the response was 54% in support and 27% in opposition. For a new airport in the Thames Estuary, 30% were supportive and 48% opposed. (The split among respondents in London was 50% / 34%, respectively.) But the real point of interest can be found on page nine, which asks: \"Thinking about the country's future energy provision, do you think the government should be looking to use more or less of the following?\" Solar power More than at present - 74% Less than at present - 6% Maintain current levels - 12% Not sure - 9% Wind farms More than at present - 56% Less than at present - 19% Maintain current levels - 15% Not sure - 9% Nuclear power stations More than at present - 35% Less than at present - 27% Maintain current levels - 23% Not sure - 15% Oil power stations More than at present - 10% Less than at present - 47% Maintain current levels - 27% Not sure - 17% Coal power stations More than at present - 16% Less than at present - 43% Maintain current levels - 25% Not sure - 17% It then asks: \"Do you think the government is right or wrong to subsidise wind farms to encourage more use of wind power?\" Right 60% Wrong 26% Don't know 15% Do you think increased use of wind power is or is not a realistic way of combating climate change? Realistic 47% Not realistic 36% Don't know 16% Do you think increased use of solar power is or is not a realistic way of combating climate change? Realistic 67% Not realistic 18% Don't know 15% Over at BusinessGreen, James Murray describes the survey results as \"explosive\", especially given that they \"follow months during which the right-wing press has waged an increasingly virulent campaign against climate change, wind farms, renewable energy, and the green levies that pay for it\". (See Duncan Clark's assessment of how \"UK newspaper coverage is skewed against renewables\".) As Murray correctly points out, it is worth the time drilling down into the various demographic, political and regional breakdowns of the results. For example, you see a clear age bias when it comes to wind farms. As the age of the respondent increases, their support for wind falls, but not to the point where the majority of the \"60+\" grouping are against it. The older respondents tend to be more supportive of nuclear energy, too. But support for solar energy is near equal across all age groups. It is worth noting the political differences, too. For example, 43% of Conservative voters say they want more wind farms than at present, compared to 62% of Labour voters and 70% of Liberal Democrat voters. Equally, Conservative voters are noticeably more supportive of nuclear energy than Labour or Lib Dem voters. But, somewhat counter-intuitively, support for wind farms is lowest among London-based respondents (49%) compared to areas that might consider themselves more at risk of being \"blighted\" by wind farms, say, Midland/Wales (57%) and Scotland (59%). Sadly, the survey doesn't distinguish between urban, suburban and rural residents, as those results might have provided extra illumination. When it comes to subsidising wind farms (it doesn't distinguish between off- and on-shore wind), 18-24 voters are far more supportive (70%) than 60+ voters (48%). YouGov didn't ask the same question of solar power (or nuclear, for that matter). James Murray describes the survey's findings as the \"best kind of early Christmas present\" for the \"government's green agenda\". I'm not sure I would go that far – it is only one snapshot survey, after all – but it does provide grist to the theory that there is a danger that the vocal minority (and their powerful media allies) who oppose investment in renewable energy shouldn't be allowed to drown out the views of the silent majority who seemingly favour such an approach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2011/jul/24/the-god-species-planet-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-23T23:05:04Z","webTitle":"The God Species: How the Planet Can Survive the Age of Humans by Mark Lynas – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/24/the-god-species-planet-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2011/jul/24/the-god-species-planet-review","fields":{"headline":"The God Species: How the Planet Can Survive the Age of Humans by Mark Lynas – review","bodyText":"Across our planet, a range of ancient habitats provide eerie testimonies to the lives of creatures that once ruled the land. In Brazil, more than 100 tree species produce giant fruit that evolved to be dispersed by elephant-sized creatures called gomphotheres, while in Madagascar many plants grow thin zigzag branches to protect themselves from 10ft-high elephant birds, which used to populate the island. These animals, like the mammoth and mastodon, are now extinct – their disappearances having followed the relentless conquest of the globe by Homo sapiens. Few doubt there is a link. Environmentalist Mark Lynas is certainly convinced that humans slaughtered these huge animals, creatures whose only living legacy today are those specialised fruits and protective thorny bushes that still await their attention. And with no living animals to disperse their seeds properly, these trees and plants are now themselves endangered. Humans have a lot to answer for, in short. We have wiped out countless species and are now heating the planet, poisoning the oceans, and transforming the atmosphere. Having culled so many of the world's large beasts, we are now preparing to eradicate animals and plants of every size. As Lynas states: \"Nature no longer runs the Earth. We do.\" And you can see his point. Homo sapiens have acquired God-like powers to transform the world and destroy life. Hence the title of Lynas's book, in which he outlines the measures he believes that humans – as responsible, benign deities – should now adopt to save the planet. Many of these proposals are surprising, coming, as they do, from a former green activist who once trashed GM plant trials and railed against corporate greed. Consider nuclear power. An anathema to greenies but which turns out to be a particular favourite of Lynas: an energy source that should be seen as \"one of the strongest weapons in our armoury against global warming\". Those who protest against its introduction are dismissed as doing as much harm to the climate as big oil companies. Genetically engineered crops also get the thumbs up. Only they can provide the food for the billions of future inhabitants that will populate our planet, Lynas claims. As for those midnight raids he carried out against plant trials, they occurred because \"I was caught up more in an outbreak of mass hysteria than anything resembling a rational response to a new technology\". As Damascene conversions go, this is a belter. With luck, it might even start a trend – for as Lynas now admits, it is now \"time for a change of tack by the Green movement, for the benefit of farmers, consumers and the environment\". Amen, is all I can add. The core of The God Species relies heavily on the work of the \"planetary boundaries\" group, a collection of scientists who recently produced strict recommendations about levels of disturbance beyond which humanity should not push the planet. These propose specific limits on carbon dioxide emissions, farming land use, biodiversity loss, chemical pollution, and ocean acidification. Stick to these and earthly life should remain tolerable, Lynas states. Nor is there a need for an economic revolution to achieve these goals. Good old-fashioned capitalism is quite sufficient. As Lynas says: \"A successful environmental movement must work with people's aspirations for prosperity and comfort, not try to suppress these impulses.\" This is a fair point, though Lynas is vague, to say the least, about how unadulterated capitalism – which has so far failed utterly to halt the planet's current desecration – can achieve this goal. The God Species nevertheless offers up an intriguing thesis and Lynas outlines it with clarity and panache – though his basic argument is disfigured not just by vagueness about policy measures and specific goals but by a depressing number of silly errors. Industrial pioneer James Watt is said to have invented the steam engine in 1764. He didn't. He invented the secondary condenser, which transformed the efficiency of existing steam engines. And he did it in 1765, a date carved in stone on Glasgow Green where Watt first conceived his great idea. Similarly, an article I wrote is attributed to the wrong newspaper, while in the same chapter it is \"revealed\" that the Iberian lynx is hovering on the edge of extinction. In fact, its population numbers have trebled in the past few years, and continue to rise, thanks to a remarkable rescue programme that has saved the animal. I could go on. Suffice to say that these mistakes, while individually trivial, combine to undermine the reader's faith that Lynas fully understands his brief. The problem is haste, I suspect. Certainly, The God Species comes over as a hurriedly written book. On the plus side, this brings a sense of urgency to its pages – time is running out for our world, as Lynas makes clear – but on the other, its mistakes irritate. Overall, Lynas is to be commended for producing a work that challenges so many green movement taboos and for recognising the importance of hard science – such as nuclear power and genetic engineering – and sound economics as potential saviours of the planet. This is an insightful, honest book. I just wish Lynas had taken a little more care in preparing it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theguardian/2011/mar/14/europe-japan-and-energy-options","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T00:05:12Z","webTitle":"Letters: Europe, Japan and energy options","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/mar/14/europe-japan-and-energy-options","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2011/mar/14/europe-japan-and-energy-options","fields":{"headline":"Europe, Japan and energy options","bodyText":"The EU commission's 2050 low-carbon road map released last week needs to raise Europe's sights beyond its current 2020 emission reduction targets (Report, 7 March). While the EU has agreed that emissions must be reduced by at least 80% by the middle of the century, it has not so far set out how to do it. We believe it's vital such a plan starts now rather than in forty40 years' time, and is a plan that can stimulate the right investment in low-carbon infrastructure and technology, putting Europe on track for a low-carbon future. Now is the right time to discuss the most cost-effective route to achieving our 2050 goals, maximising growth, jobs and prosperity throughout Europe. We are not starting from scratch; the EU has already cut emissions by 17% from 1990 levels by 2009. The commission's road map demonstrates both that the current 20% target is not a cost-effective route to the 2050 goal, and that we already have the tools and policies to cut emissions by 25% domestically. The European Energy Efficiency Plan is welcome and shows the big impact reducing energy consumption can have. The case to move to a 30% target by 2020 is now stronger as a result. At a time when the price of oil is soaring, putting in place an ambitious plan for Europe's low-carbon future has wider benefits than tackling climate change. It will increase the continent's resilience against oil price spikes and reduce its dependence on imported energy. And it will help Europe compete with emerging economies in the fast-growing markets for green goods and services. We know that some industries are worried about how they will adapt, but solutions are available. In the best traditions of European co-operation, we can work together to overcome these challenges. We call on all member states to enter into this urgent debate on Europe's future and agree how the road map is put into action– ensuring that Europe gets to the front of this low-carbon race, rather than falling behind.

There are many reasons. But they all boil down to this: however good the engineers, the systems, the maintenance, there is one generic flaw that can never be remedied – catastrophic failure means a catastrophic outcome, in a way in which other electricity-generating systems cannot compete. So, with the news that there has just been an explosion at Fukushima nuclear plant after the earthquake (Report, 12 March), I am insulted to learn that Sue Ions, fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, heavily involved in nuclear decommissioning and a proponent of new nuclear build, believes that \"rather than undermining public faith in nuclear energy, this incident would highlight its safety … People should gain confidence that these plants have shut down as they should be.\" This country is on the brink of a mad escapade that will do little to solve the energy crisis. I beg government to reconsider how useful the contribution of nuclear power to our energy mix really is. Val Mainwood Wivenhoe, Colchester • In February 2007, as shadow minister of the environment, Chris Huhne said: \"The doubling of our electricity generation from wind in a little more than a year shows what renewables can do and gives the lie to the need for a new generation of nuclear power … On a windy island surrounded by waves and tides, we should never be short of environmentally friendly energy sources.\" By the autumn of 2010, however, he was telling the Lib Dems to back a new generation of nuclear power stations. Having seen the dangers to life and the environment that may be approaching from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant, it is high time Huhne turned full circle and swung round to his earlier sane and rational position. Rae Street Littleborough, Lancashire • Perhaps you should draw your article to the attention of the transport minister, Philip Hammond (Cut your speed, cut your petrol bill, 12 March). He is pressing for an increase in the motorway speed limit at the same time as his colleagues in the Department of Energy and Climate Change are looking to reduce the country's oil consumption in the face of fluctuations in oil prices, in addition to climate change pressures.

The wine, it flowed, and the repartee was cerebral, as one would expect at such a gathering. Lord Phillips, the supreme court president, sat at the top table and made a speech. A wise one is Lord Phillips, and hopefully he chose wisely on the evening in question. For it emerges that of the 54 guests, about half – judges among them – went down with food poisoning. We won't dwell on the effects, but they were pretty drastic. A smoked salmon and prawn starter appears to have been the likely culprit, as the starter of choice for everyone who fell ill. But with nothing definitive arising from an extensive environmental health investigation, the organisers fear there is little more the supreme court itself can do in terms of closure and redress for those who were wronged. They could always sue. • But maybe they'll conclude that life's full of hazards, and stuff happens. Life is full of hazards. Stuff does happen. Think of the Dounreay nuclear power plant on Scotland's north coast, nicknamed Doom-ray by detractors. We have reached a \"new high\" in terms of safety, the plant said the other day, announcing that it will stage an emergency exercise to simulate a road accident involving the carriage of nuclear materials. At around the same time, a lorry driver appeared in court having been stopped by the police without licence or insurance. And his mission, prior to police intervention? To pick up a consignment of radioactive waste from Dounreay. • To the Foreign Office, where Lord Howell held forth last week at a seminar about British high commissioners in New Delhi. One tip, he said; don't refer to India's as an \"emerging\" economy. Patronising, he said. They \"hate it\". So what's this? \"We are now running a distinctive British foreign policy designed to connect up Britain to the emerging economies of the world – to India, south-east Asia, Brazil and the Gulf states,\" said William Hague in February. Don't tell us, Lord Howell, tell the foreign secretary. • Meanwhile, the relationship between John Simpson and the Sunday Telegraph goes back many years and has benefited both, but one wonders how long the two august British institutions can remain friends. There he was, on the sofa with Andrew Marr at the weekend, when suddenly the great man announced with a sigh that he is sick of papers using private conversations (such as Prince Philip's emission on wind farms) to construct stories. \"The Sunday Telegraph are rather good at this,\" he said, going on to criticise them for once running the private thoughts of the late Queen Mother a little too prominently. Some transformation. Once the liberator of Kabul. Now the man who would stop us enjoying the idiocies of Prince Philip. • And as the nation comes to terms with the oh so painful separation of Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, a reflection from Ayesha Vardag, oft described by her publicists as \"Britain's top divorce lawyer\". This is, says Ayesha, \"a couple of beautiful people who clearly loved and were very attracted to each other\". Marriage \"is just hard, for all of us\" It worked for a long time, but hopefully they will \"now achieve an amicable settlement and part friends\" as Demi did with Bruce Willis. Wow, that's deep. If you really want to know, consult a specialist. • Finally, good luck to Abdul Rafiq, 41, a diehard football fan and the only Muslim member of the absurdly Islamophobic English Defence League. He was arrested for singing songs insulting of Catholics and the pope while watching his beloved Rangers play, er, Chelsea. As the only Muslim in the EDL, his lawyer said, \"he does stand out\"; even more so now that he has been convicted of sectarian offences, fined £600 and banned from the terraces for five years. A long five years, but time enough for Abdul to get his head straight, don't you think?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/oct/09/china-energy-resources-shale-uranium","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-09T16:21:38Z","webTitle":"China eyes gas from shale and uranium miner in resource grab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/09/china-energy-resources-shale-uranium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/oct/09/china-energy-resources-shale-uranium","fields":{"headline":"China eyes shale gas and uranium firms","bodyText":"China's growing attempts to seize global natural resources has reached Britain with a link to the recent shale discoveries near Blackpool and a bid for a London-listed uranium company. Close ties have emerged between China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and a backer of Cuadrilla Resources, the exploration group that claimed last month there were trillions of cubic metres of shale gas under Lancashire. The Beijing-to-Blackpool link was revealed after the Hong Kong-based Kerogen Capital came to the rescue of one of the largest shareholders in Cuadrilla. Kerogen and CNOOC are behind a new $1.5bn (£1bn) fund, which is looking at investing in new resource projects. Kerogen, set up by former JP Morgan bankers Ivor Orchard and Jason Cheng, has taken a 15% stake in AJ Lucas – an Australian engineering business that holds about 40% of Cuadrilla. Lucas has been struggling to raise new cash and needed to inject $10m in Cuadrilla to maintain its stake in a business that is also 40% owned by Riverstone – a private equity firm in which former BP boss, Lord Browne, is a key player. Chinese companies have already bought into shale gas companies in the US, where a welter of discoveries has sent the price of natural gas plummeting. Cuadrilla made headlines when it claimed that two exploratory wells in the Bowland shale of Lancashire indicated huge reserves of 5.6tn cubic metres of shale gas. Some academics have questioned the very high estimates, but Cuadrilla told the Guardian that it stands by those numbers, and made clear that Lord Browne, one of the most respected figures in the oil world, had endorsed them too in his capacity as a Cuadrilla board member. Objections to shale operations focus on potential water contamination, due to the chemicals pumped into the ground with water to hydraulically fracture, or \"frack\", the rock and release the hydrocarbons. Green groups also fear that cheap gas will undermine government carbon-reduction targets and inhibit the nascent renewable energy industry. The process has been banned in France and some US states but another company is also applying for drilling licences in Britain, this time in the Mendip Hills outside Bath. Meanwhile, the state-backed China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG) is expected to launch a £650m takeover of a London-listed uranium miner, Kalahari Minerals, as early as this week. Shares in Kalahari, which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market, rose 7% on Friday amid speculation about interests in the far east. Kalahari is of interest to nuclear operators because it owns a big stake in the Husab uranium mine in Namibia, one of the world's largest. Despite the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, China is still expected to proceed with its reactor construction programme – it already has 25 plants under construction, half of the world's new capacity. CGNPG offered 290p a share for Kalahari Minerals in March, valuing the mining group at £756m, but the deal fell apart after the Chinese company tried to cut the price after Fukushima. The tsunami led Japan, Germany and Austria to halt their new nuclear programmes or phase out reactors early, reducing uranium's value as a fuel. China's Minmetals launched a $1.2bn offer last month for Anvil Mining, a copper producer with assets in the Democratic Republic of Congo."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/01/drones-fight-japanese-whalers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-01T00:04:00Z","webTitle":"Whaling: campaigners use drones in the fight against Japanese whalers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/01/drones-fight-japanese-whalers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/01/drones-fight-japanese-whalers","fields":{"headline":"Whaling: campaigners use drones in the fight against Japanese whalers","bodyText":"Environmental activists in the rough Antarctic seas have launched a new tool in the fight to stop a Japanese operation to kill hundreds of whales – remote-controlled drones. Every morning for the past week, a battery-powered drone with a range of 300km (190 miles) has been launched from the MV Steve Irwin, which is attempting to disrupt the annual Japanese whale hunts in the waters off Antarctica. \"We first found the Japanese fleet when they were 28 nautical miles away,\" said Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an international marine wildlife protection group based in the United States. Subsequent attempts by Japanese whaling ships to block the anti-whaling flotilla and allow the whale factory ship Nisshin Maru to escape were foiled by the activists, who repeatedly launched the drone, which uses GPS co-ordinates and provides both video and still images to track the whaling ships. \"Our helicopter pilot, Chris Aultman, has been lobbying for this technology for the past two years and now that we have this 'eye in the sky' it makes it much harder for the whaling fleet to escape,\" said Watson in a telephone interview from the Steve Irwin. \"The other day they switched back from east to west and we detected this with the drone.\" Watson has 88 crew on three ships, two of which are equipped with drones. They act as spotters, finding the whalers in the vast expanse of ocean and allowing Watson's ships to home in on them. Watson has embarked on his annual expedition to stop the slaughter of thousands of whales – the Japanese consider this to be scientific research while critics call it cruel and archaic. \"Last year they had a quota of over 1,000 whales and only caught 16%. We saved at least 800 whales,\" said Watson, who has been known to ram the Japanese boats as part of his anything-goes tactics. The advent of new technologies such as drones may finally put an end to the Japanese hunt, said Watson, who is also bringing publicity to the cause in Whale Wars, the Discovery channel documentary series that tracks the hunts: \"Our goal is to bankrupt them and destroy them economically. Now that we can track them, it is getting easier.\" Once exclusive to Israeli spy forces and the US air force, drones and other types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being sent on civilian missions such as crop inspections or marine mammal surveys. In April, drones hovered inside highly radioactive areas at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and recorded data from areas too dangerous for humans to enter. Federal bodies in the US, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are scrambling to monitor the burgeoning industry. According to the Los Angeles Times, the FAA will issue proposals this month to clarify rules for the use of UAVs in civilian and commercial roles. While drones used to cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, some are now available for less than £500. The unit used by Sea Shepherd is a highly durable model known as the Osprey, which can run for hundreds of hours . It was given to Sea Shepherd by Bayshore Recycling, a New Jersey-based solid waste recycling company committed to environmental protection. In addition to paying for the drone at an estimated cost of £10,000, Bayshore also paid for pilot training to run the remote control equipment. \"Everyone here at Bayshore is thrilled with the Sea Shepherd's news of not only saving the lives of many whales, but knowing our drone will continue to track the Japanese whaling fleet in this chase,\" said Elena Bagarozza, marketing co-ordinator at Bayshore. Watson expects drones will be used to patrol environmentally sensitive areas ranging from the Galapagos Islands to other famed wildlife areas, including South Africa's Kruger National Park. \"There is huge potential and great value in this technology – for our expedition it is wonderful,\" said Eleanor Lister, 20, a Sea Shepherd crew member from Jersey, who spoke by satellite phone from aboard the Steve Irwin from a location that, she said, \"was about 1,000 miles south-west of Australia\". She described the daily routine that begins when the ship's first mate holds aloft the Osprey drone, then tosses it into the headwinds. After tracking the Japanese whalers, the drone ends its mission as it homes in on the Steve Irwin and is flown into a thick net, where crew members inspect it for damage and download the video and photographs from the latest mission. Despite severe weather in the Antarctic, the drone has flown dozens of flights and had no problems so far with ice buildup on the wings or trouble negotiating the gusty winds. \"The Osprey is comfortable in the wind and can handle 40 knots,\" said Jimmy Prouty, systems engineer at Hangar 18, the Kansas-based company that manufactures it. \"This unit is waterproofed and has multiple security backups so that if it has problems or low battery it automatically returns to base.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/mar/06/obama-iran-strategy-panetta-aipac","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-06T19:19:00Z","webTitle":"Obama's Iran strategy backed by US defence secretary amid GOP criticism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/06/obama-iran-strategy-panetta-aipac","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/mar/06/obama-iran-strategy-panetta-aipac","fields":{"headline":"Obama's Iran strategy backed by US defence secretary amid GOP criticism","bodyText":"The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, has warned critics of Barack Obama's Iran policy not to mistake a willingness to pursue diplomacy for weakness. Panetta, speaking to a largely sceptical audience at the annual conference of the powerful pro-Israel lobby in Washington, derided the aggressive posturing of some of the president's opponents and more hawkish supporters of Israel, who have pressed for an explicit commitment to the use of force against Iran by setting \"red lines\" that Tehran's nuclear programme must not cross. Panetta said the military option is on the table as a last resort if sanctions fail, and the president's record demonstrates he will use it if he believes there is no alternative. \"As the president made clear, the United States does not bluff. In this town it's easy to talk tough. Acting tough is a hell of a lot more important,\" he told the the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) conference. \"The president ordered 30,000 additional troops to battle in Afghanistan to confront a resurgent Taliban. He launched a comprehensive precision bombing campaign to protect the Libyans and ultimately toppled a brutal dictator. He has ordered US warships to pass through the straits of Hormuz – despite the threats that we have received from Iran. \"And he has been the driving force behind the most successful and lethal counter-terrorism campaign in US history, culminating in the bold decision to send US special operations forces hundreds of miles into Pakistan to take the risk to take down Bin Laden. And he did.\" Panetta's speech was a clear rebuke to other speakers at Aipac, including three of the four Republican presidential candidates who also addressed the conference on Tuesday. Ron Paul was not invited following his calls to cut off aid to Israel, along with every other country, and because of his criticism that sanctions on Iran are driving it toward developing a nuclear weapon. The other candidates also came out swinging against Obama's Iran strategy. Mitt Romney called Obama's policy of \"engagement\" with Tehran naive, and said it gave the Iranian leadership time to develop its nuclear programme. \"Hope is not a foreign policy. The only thing respected by thugs and tyrants is our resolve backed by our power and our readiness to use it,\" he said. \"In recent days and weeks we've heard a lot of words from the administration. Its clear message has been to warn Israel to consider the costs of military action against Iran. I don't believe we should be issuing public warnings that create distance between the United States and Israel.\" But in the end, Romney's position was not so far from Obama's. \"I will bring the current policy of procrastination toward Iran to an end. I will not delay in imposing further crippling sanctions,\" he said. \"As president I'll be ready to engage in diplomacy but I will be just as ready to engage our military might.\" Newt Gingrich, also speaking via video link, went furthest in saying that as president he would give Israel the means to attack Tehran's nuclear facilities and let it do so without question. \"I will initiate a strategy in the tradition of Reagan, Thatcher and Pope John Paul II to undermine and replace the Iranian dictatorship by every possible method short of war in order to achieve a government we could trust and could deal with,\" he said. \"At the same time I would provide all available intelligence to the Israeli government, ensure that they had the equipment necessary and reassure them that if an Israeli prime minister decides he has to avoid the threat of a second Holocaust through preemptive measures that I would require no advance notice to understand why I would support the right of Israel to survive in a dangerous world.\" Rick Santorum was the only candidate to appear in person at Aipac. \"As I've sat and watched this play out on the world stage I've seen a president who has been reticent. He says he has Israel's back. From everything I've seen from the conduct of this administration, he's turned his back on the people of Israel,\" Santorum said to applause. He accused Obama of appeasement over today's news that the US will join Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany in a fresh round of negotiations with Iran. \"Another appeasement, another delay. Another opportunity for them [Iran] to go forward while we talk,\" he said. Santorum – breaking with the tradition that the president's opponents do not generally side with other powers on the question of foreign policy – said there was a \"tragic disconnect\" between how Obama and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, viewed the urgency of the situation. \"We need to set forth a clear ultimatum to the Iranian government. We need to say to the Iranian government: the time is now – you will stop your nuclear production now, you will open up your facilities for inspectors from the United States ad other countries so we can certify that those efforts are stopping and being dismantled, now,\" he said to strong applause from the Aipac audience. \"We need to put that ultimatum in place and we need to be prepared if that ultimatum is not met … that if they don't tear down those facilities, we will tear down them ourselves.\" The Republican candidate also had stinging criticism for the US military chief, General Martin Dempsey, who called Iran a \"rational actor\". \"Rational actors don't call for the destruction of other states, call them cancers, preach radical theologies,\" he said. \"Rational actors do not develop nuclear capability, calling for nuclear power, when they have hundreds of years of oil and gas to provide for their power and their medical research.\" Romney broke with the focus on Iran to mention the Palestinians – who have been virtually invisible as an issue at this Aipac conference to the gratification of the Israeli government – although his comments will have brought them little comfort. \"The current administration has distanced itself from Israel and visibly warmed to the Palestinian cause. It's emboldened the Palestinians. They're convinced that they can do better with America directly than they can at the bargaining table with Israel,\" he said. Romney took a stab at Obama's assertion last year that a two-state solution will be based on the 1967 armistice lines with land swaps – a statement long accepted as the basis of a deal but which brought a torrent of accusations from the Republican right and some of Israel's more militant supporters that he was selling out the Jewish state. \"I've seen Israel by land and by air. I've seen its narrow waist and its vulnerability,\" said Romney. \"I would never call for a return to the indefensible '67 lines because I understand that, in Israel, geography is security.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/nov/22/britain-loses-jobs-as-nuclear-building-programme-contract-goes-to-america","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-22T15:19:00Z","webTitle":"Britain poised to lose jobs as £10bn nuclear power plant contract goes to US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/22/britain-loses-jobs-as-nuclear-building-programme-contract-goes-to-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/nov/22/britain-loses-jobs-as-nuclear-building-programme-contract-goes-to-america","fields":{"headline":"Britain poised to lose jobs as £10bn nuclear power plant contract goes to US","bodyText":"Thousands of jobs that were to have been created in Britain to build the next generation of nuclear power plants could be heading overseas instead, after Westinghouse, the nuclear company sold by the government three years ago to Toshiba, chose one of its largest shareholders as the lead contractor to build reactors. Westinghouse is expected to confirm this week that it has appointed US-based Shaw Group to head up its £10bn nuclear programme, passing over the favourite for the contract, rival engineering group Fluor. Industry sources said that Shaw is likely to source far more reactor components from overseas than Fluor, which has close relationships with British manufacturers. The Unite union claimed that 10,000 new jobs in the UK would not be created as a result of Shaw being selected. Shaw was one of the main contractors to build Total's controversial Lindsey refinery and made 51 workers there redundant this year, which sparked a series of wildcat walk-outs around the country over the use of foreign labour. British-based manufacturers such as BAE Systems and Rolls Royce are also understood to be concerned that lucrative contracts to make reactor modules could be lost to Shaw's manufacturing bases in the US and Belgium. A spokesman for Westinghouse in the US confirmed that Shaw had been appointed but claimed that \"up to 80%\" of the components would be sourced from the UK. He admitted that this was not finalised as none of the supplier contracts had been signed. He added that Shaw had teamed up with British construction firm Laing O'Rourke for the bid, but the firm will not be involved in providing any of the high specification reactor components. Japanese firm Toshiba owns 77% of Westinghouse, with 20% owned by Shaw Group. Westinghouse is hoping to secure contracts to build at least four of its AP1000 reactors with E.ON and RWE npower, who have formed a nuclear joint venture in the UK, soon after Christmas. Dougie Rooney, Unite's national energy officer, said: \"The implications are massive. With Fluor, there is a far greater opportunity to get UK companies involved. Shaw has no allegiance to the UK and it's wrong that a company with an equity share should be involved in the competition.\" It was also claimed by several industry sources that Westinghouse had initially recommended to Toshiba that Fluor be appointed, but that the parent company insisted that Shaw be chosen instead. A Westinghouse spokesman in the US said that Shaw and Westinghouse already had a partnership to build reactors in the Middle East and the US. \"It was a decision made in conjunction with a number of parties, including our parent company Toshiba,\" he said. \"It's our intention to use British labour as much as possible.\" Rival French reactor firm Areva is building the rest of the UK's reactors, on behalf of EDF Energy, and has only promised to allow British firms to bid for up to 70% of the supply contracts. Business secretary Lord Mandelson has drawn up a \"low-carbon industrial strategy\" to enable British manufacturers and workers to benefit from the country's huge construction programme of less polluting power plants such as wind farms and nuclear reactors. Mandelson has also repeatedly spoken of the need for the government to demonstrate \"industrial activism\", or a willingness to intervene on behalf of key sectors of the economy. But British manufacturers in the power sector have so far yet to benefit. The closure of the Vestas wind turbine plant in the Isle of Wight became totemic of the UK's inability to develop its own renewables industry. Unions are now anxious that manufacturers could similarly miss out on the opportunities from plans to build at least 10 new reactors in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/feb/17/iran-us-israel-west-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-17T19:18:36Z","webTitle":"Iran is in crisis – but it suits everyone to exaggerate its power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/17/iran-us-israel-west-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/feb/17/iran-us-israel-west-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Iran is in crisis – but it suits everyone to exaggerate its power","bodyText":"Iran-watchers have had their work cut out this week making sense of the attacks on Israeli diplomats in Asia, confusion over a ban on oil sales to EU countries, a vaunted advance in the country's nuclear programme and a cleverly formulated offer of a new round of talks on that hot and contentious issue. It all made for a slew of mixed messages that underlined just how hard it is to understand the opaque reality of one of the most important countries in the Middle East, and, some observers warn, to overcome politically loaded western preconceptions about its behaviour. Tehran flatly denied any part in the incidents in Thailand and India. But despite the Keystone Cops storyline of inept bombers and bungled plans, the attacks did look like retaliation for alleged Israeli killings of Iran's nuclear scientists – and provided a glimpse of a covert dirty war that risks spiralling out of hand as tensions rise. Publicly, though, there was one unambiguous signal when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unveiled new centrifuges he claimed were able to enrich uranium more quickly – to a resounding lack of interest either at home or abroad. Experts agreed that this did not constitute a significant advance towards a nuclear capability that Iran insists is purely peaceful. Iran's intention, argued Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, was to show it would not be impeded by sanctions, sabotage or assassinations. \"These announcements will further inflame talk of military options, which has reached feverish pitch in some quarters in Israel and the US,\" he said. \"But even in the highly unlikely event that everything Iran has announced is true, it would still take Iran a couple of years to produce a handful of weapons.\" Ahmadinejad's news, sniffed the US state department spokesman, was \"not terribly new, and not terribly impressive\". But in a year that has seen confirmation that Iran is producing 20% enriched uranium, stored in a bombproof mountain near Qom, US aircraft carriers sailing through the strait of Hormuz and the imposition of painful new western sanctions, this issue is not going away. Israel's warnings that it faces an \"existential threat\" from a nuclear-armed Iran have created an ominous sense that a decision is imminent – piling the pressure on Barack Obama in election year. Israel, an undeclared nuclear power, is said by those in the know to be recalculating its options every day. But bluff, rhetoric and deliberate misinformation are likely to be part of this story, too. So are internal divisions in Israel, where Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, insists that sanctions are not working, while Ehud Barak, his defence minister, says he thinks they are starting to be effective. Complicating it all is uncertainty over who calls the shots in Tehran, where Ahmadinejad is locked in a power struggle with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who controls the Revolutionary Guards and threatened in a recent Friday sermon to punish Israel. \"Everything suggests disarray,\" says Ali Ansari of St Andrews University. Wednesday's announcement of a ban on oil sales to six EU countries is a case in point. EU sanctions banning Iranian oil imports were agreed in January but were not due to be implemented until July. So the announcement – immediately denied – looked foolish and counter-productive. \"It's a symptom of a headless government,\" said Vahe Petrossian, an Iran energy expert. \"They are just making things up as they go along.\" Fears of a low turnout in next month's parliamentary election (being boycotted by an opposition that has never accepted the legitimacy of Ahmadinejad's \"stolen\" second term in 2009) is a factor. Another is the deteriorating economic situation, with sanctions imposed by many countries now biting hard. \"There is a real malaise about the whole system,\" says Ansari. \"Some of my friends think it is terminal. People either don't care any more or they are just too busy trying to make ends meet.\" Hardliners are said to find the sanctions a useful way of reinforcing their view of unremitting hostility from the west and Israel. \"Israel is a convenient bogeyman for Iran's own right-wing,\" argues the political scientist Arshin Adib-Moghaddam. \"Cyclical, confined confrontation with Israel is politically useful in order to foster support for the country's policies, both domestically and in the wider Arab and Islamic world.\" Yet the risks are obvious. \"Some of the things that have happened are signs of desperation and recklessness,\" said a western diplomat who follows Iran closely. \"They are feeling pretty beleaguered.\" Another Tehran-watcher sees an alarming combination of \"belligerence and schizophrenia\". Nor is all well in the region. True, Iran has been influential in Iraq since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and is a big player in Afghanistan as well. But it now risks losing Syria, its only Arab ally and link to Hezbollah, its partner in Lebanon. \"Iran's internal problems are far greater than they seem and beyond the region its external power is marginal,\" argues analyst Baqer Moin. Emile Hokayem, of the Institute of Strategic Studies, sees only bombast, risk-taking and incompetence in recent Tehran's latest moves: \"The Iranians may win something in terms of perception, but all in all they are on the losing side.\" On paper, Iran's conventional military capabilities are no match for its enemies. But its forces are tough, battle-hardened and highly motivated: the naval arm of the Revolutionary Guard corps has experience in \"assymetric warfare\" using swarm tactics that combine small fast boats, missiles and mines that could play havoc in the strait of Hormuz. \"The fundamental problem is that Iran's friends and enemies both overestimate its power and influence,\" says Hokayem. \"The west believes its own perceptions. Israel's officially endorsed existential concern about Iran makes Israelis feel more vulnerable and more nervous … than warranted, which is massively counterproductive. In Washington, the hawks exaggerate to create a sense of urgency. The Gulf states hype things, too. But if you look at the substance, Iran doesn't come across as a particularly powerful country. It's trying to find its place in the international system and it's failing. We need to rightsize the Iranian challenge.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/jul/06/mark-lynas-market-green-alternative","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-06T19:59:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: In the market for a green alternative","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/06/mark-lynas-market-green-alternative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/jul/06/mark-lynas-market-green-alternative","fields":{"headline":"In the market for a green alternative","bodyText":"One sign of a political movement's emergence from adolescence is its ability to produce apostates (Have the greens lost their way?, 2 July). Mark Lynas is to the green movement what countless rightwing ex-Marxists are to socialism. And as with socialism, we shouldn't conclude from a few individuals who have changed their minds that a whole movement has suddenly got it wrong. No, Susanna Rustin, we don't need a \"new environmentalism\", and especially not one defined by being \"happy with capitalism\". As the ideological attack on the idea of \"the public\" gathers pace – with the (historically small) deficit as the legitimating smokescreen – it is clear that Lynas and others are heading in completely the wrong direction. For any environmentalism worth fighting for must have equality, justice and the public good at its heart. These are values that \"market-friendly environmentalists\" like Lynas left behind some time ago in their search for technological solutions to what is fundamentally a political problem. Professor Andrew Dobson Keele University • I agree that we should critique the movements of which we are a part. However, I am concerned that Lynas has critiqued his position and then simply acquiesced in a shallow \"if you can't beat them, join them\" stance. His faith in growth, capitalism, markets and cold reductionist science is a delusion that will not solve any environmental problems. Having critiqued the green movement, he could have moved to a deeper and broader stance, explored by thinkers as diverse as Jay Griffiths, Alastair McIntosh and John Zerzan. Lynas ignores the interlinking of environmental degradation with an epidemic of mental illness, increasing inequality, social breakdown and a myriad other complex crises. We desperately need to look at not just counting and cutting carbon, but humbly acknowledging hierarchy, domestication, enclosure, division of labour, sexism, racism, the imposition of time and the ensuing alienation and destruction. Rather then turning to capitalists, markets, scientists and technology, let us seek wisdom from children, the elderly, the wild and indigenous cultures. Let us put wholeness in the place of brokenness. Ed Lord Llanidloes, Powys • There are many of us who, unlike Mark Lynas, can easily reconcile green politics with capitalism. We run small sustainable businesses in our communities, producing food, energy, transport and other services that people need locally. But we're continually stymied by a modern political and economic system favouring the pursuit of short-term profit at the expense of other social and environmental goals by large monopoly corporations that are not in the least bit capitalist. It would be easier to take Lynas seriously if he stopped striking his made-for-media renegade pose and put his money where his mouth is by actually running an environmental business. Chris Smaje Frome, Somerset • Susanna Rustin cites Mark Lynas as calling for a new environmentalism. In the same edition's letters page, prominent left Lib Dems bemoan possible subsidies for the nuclear power industries in an upcoming coalition government finance bill (Letters, 2 July). What is needed is not a new environmentalism, but a new movement on the left of British politics. After more than 40 years as a political activist for the Liberals and Lib Dems, I have left the movement because of issues of trust, and frustration at the watering down of environmental policies I fought for. I wish to remain politically active, but find I have no natural home to go to. The Greens have one MP but, as Mark Lynas points out, a muddled message and limited appeal to the electorate. The left needs to regroup, to encompass those on the left who wish to see a new movement of environmental progressives, in opposition to the coalition, which will give hope to those who do not share the Lynas vision of that oxymoron – \"environmentalist capitalism\". Steve Griffiths Witney, Oxford • Susanna Rustin quotes Mark Lynas (once a leading light in the British environmental movement) as describing himself as a \"recovering activist\" who is now market-friendly and favours nuclear power and genetic engineering. He says: \"I want an environmental movement that is happy with capitalism\", and adds that \"the green movement needs a clause IV moment\". It sounds like a classic left-right split and, of course, we've been here many times before. I hope the greens will continue to fight for both the environment and social justice, while \"Mark the market\" embraces big business. Don't forget, the man who gave the Labour party its clause IV moment later led Britain into invading Iraq. Glyn Roberts London • Susanna Rustin and Ian McEwan both seem unaware of the growing transition movement that is addressing a range of environmental issues. It's a common problem for those apparently confined to the metropolis. Many country towns and cities now have active transition groups. In Evesham we have just held our first local food festival, with jazz and juggling too, and in September, four Worcestershire transition groups are organising our first sustainable energy event. Ian McEwan needs to know that not everyone has \"fallen back to sleep\", and that citizens can do a lot more than vote.

The European Investment Bank (EIB), a bigger lender than the World Bank, also tripled the lending to renewable energy according to the campaign group behind the report, Bankwatch. But the group said that overall, the bank is failing in its responsibility to further the goals of the European Union, including cutting carbon emissions by at least 20% by 2020. \"Our study highlights once more the secret hypocrisy at the heart of EU climate action,\" said Piotr Trzaskowski, Bankwatch energy co-ordinator. \"While the EU appears to be the world's most progressive actor in the global struggle against climate change, the financial arm of the union is putting billions of euros of public money into energy infrastructure that will lock in countries into a fossil-fuel dependent path for four or five decades. Considering what we are hearing from [the UN climate talks in] Durban this week, if even the EU acts this way, we are tragically on a sure road to disaster.\" The EIB offers loans subsidised by government guarantees, but at the UN climate change negotiations in South Africa on Wednesday, Nicholas Stern told delegates that rich nations were wasting money and disadvantaging renewable energy by giving away tax breaks, loans and other subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. In November, the International Energy Agency warned that on current trends, the world will have built enough fossil fuel burning plants by 2016 to break the 2C limit deemed \"safe\" by scientists. A spokesman for the bank said: \"The EIB is committed to supporting key investment in projects that support the fight against climate change. This has been demonstrated this week in Durban with new funding for flagship renewable energy and water projects, as well as support for the South African renewables initiative.\" The Bankwatch report shows EIB fossil fuel lending rose from €2.8bn in 2007 to €5.0bn, while renewable energy loans rose from €1.7bn to €5.8bn. Funding for power transmission infrastructure rose over fourfold over the period, from €1.1bn to €4.6bn. Loans for nuclear power fell from €200m to zero in 2010. Bankwatch also criticised the EIB for allotting less than 5% of the €49bn over the four years to energy efficiency projects: fossil fuels got seven times more. \"It is imperative that the EIB revises its energy policy in line with climate science, as well as with EU 2050 climate objectives,\" said Anna Roggenbuck, Bankwatch EIB co-ordinator. \"The EIB should immediately stop lending to coal, the most carbon intensive type of energy generation, and develop and implement a plan to phase out lending to other fossil fuels and prioritise energy efficiency as the most important area of intervention.\" The EIB spokesman said: \"Energy efficiency is the greenest form of energy there is. The EIB is continuously looking for good projects, both with industry and public bodies, ideally at a large scale.\" He added: \"The EIB adopted a new energy lending policy in 2007 which is based on the two priority areas of climate action and energy security. This new approach ensures a selective approach to coal and lignite fuelled power stations.\" He said the Duisberg-Walsum coal power plant in Germany and the Sostanj lignite power plant in Slovenia had been approved under the old guidelines and that none of the €820m pledged to the German project and the €550m pledged to the Slovenian project had yet been disbursed. He noted the approval was only valid for a certain period of time but was unable to elaborate further. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), part owned by the EIB, has also significantly increased its loans to fossil fuels, between 2006 and 2010. Gas loans rose 10-fold to €929m between 2006 and 2009, before falling back to €435m. Lending for renewables rose from just €5.5m in 2006 to €232m in 2010, but over the five year period, fossil fuels got 35% of the €7.7bn total while renewables got 6%. The biggest sector was energy efficiency, which was awarded 43% of the funds. The EBRD was is the biggest investor in its area of operation, eastern Europe, the Balkans and central Asia. It was established to support \"the development of market economies\" following the widespread collapse of communist regimes. It is owned by 61 countries, the EU and the EIB."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2012/jul/02/rim-research-in-motion-playbook","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-02T16:24:00Z","webTitle":"How to save RIM: adopt Steve Jobs's 1996 playbook (and dump PlayBook) | Charles Arthur","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/jul/02/rim-research-in-motion-playbook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2012/jul/02/rim-research-in-motion-playbook","fields":{"headline":"How to save RIM: adopt Steve Jobs's 1996 playbook (and dump PlayBook)","bodyText":"RIM, as pretty much everyone - including RIM's management - knows, is in serious trouble. Analysts have cut their targets for its stock price to just $5, which given that it presently has total cash and equivalents of $4 per share, means that they see little prospect of improvement; Nomura even said that it could run out of cash. It has made losses for the past two quarters, and there's no sign of that changing suddenly. This all sounds like a business headed for hell in a handbasket, or a breakup, or simple sale. But RIM could survive on its own terms, and even become a challenger again. It won't be easy, but all it needs to do is to take a lesson from the company that blindsided it in the smartphone market - Apple. In September 1996, Apple had just lost $1.2bn for its financial year (which with inflation is equivalent to $1.76bn today). It was, as Steve Jobs said, about 90 days from bankruptcy. It had been promising a next-generation operating system, but had repeatedly canned it and/or put it back. (It had just acquired NeXT Computer, with Jobs at its head, in order to acquire that next-generation operating system; NeXT had won a face-off with Jean-Louis Gassée's BeOS.) It had too many staff. It had too many products. People weren't interested. They were so convinced it was going to die that they were abandoning it for the only real rival. So really RIM today is not too different from Apple then; except that RIM isn't anything like as near to death as Apple was. So how can RIM thrive? The following will be uncomfortable reading to some in RIM - because it will cost them their jobs - but Apple's example shows that there's a way forward. Slim down the number of products into a comprehensible set Four will do. I've long since given up trying to figure out the difference between a BlackBerry Bold. Curve, 9800, 9700 and the rest. Seriously, is there any? This US smartphone listing for RIM shows 22 products. That's absurd. How can anyone choose between them? That's worse than Apple's 1996 menagerie of 15 different computers - Quadra, Power Macintosh, and so on, each demanding its own products. When you're in trouble, reduce the complexity, because that cuts out production and stock costs too. Jobs cut a swathe through the bloated product range, reducing it to four. Don't think about selling Trying to think of selling the business, and maximising the individual value of each bit, distracts from actually running the business for the future. You'll have more of a going concern (if things come to that) by building a strong business. Apple was nearly sold to Sun, and to IBM, in its darkest days; if that had happened, it would now be a footnote in history. Thinking about sales is what bankers do, and there's a team of them crawling over RIM at the moment. Ignore them and get on with the work. Partition your market to give yourself clarity Steve Jobs created a quadrant: consumers and professionals on one side, laptops and desktops on the other. (This was long before iPods, iPads or iPhones.) Consumer looking for a laptop? Here you go - iBook. Professional after a desktop? Power Mac for you. Simpler to make, simpler to choose. RIM needs that same clarity. It could almost split its market into two - consumer and enterprise. High-end and low-end. Four phones. Sorted. Dump products that aren't working Simple, really. Jobs killed the Newton. Time for RIM to kill the PlayBook, which has shipped a grand total of 1.1m in a full year while costing it billions in production, writeoffs and distraction. And of course kill at least 18 of those damn phones. Hire a visionary, inspiring chief executive This is bad news for Heins, but the brutal truth is that you don't lead a company out of the valley of death by doing the meat-and-potatoes work (to mix metaphors). Jobs was exactly the right person for Apple: he was committed to its survival and he'd learnt his errors and weaknesses through his failures at NeXT Computer and successes at Pixar. (His hiring of Tim Cook, an exemplary supply chain controller, in 1997 was indicative of that recognition.) So who's the right person for RIM? Often, founders can revive a company; besides Jobs, there was Michael Dell returning to Dell in 2008, when he saw the business he created in trouble. (That hasn't been enthralling, but Dell was in less trouble.) However in this case the two founders are Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, who were only ejected in January. Neither is the right one to run the company out of the pit, because they got it there in the first place, although Lazaridis is a brilliant inventor. I'd suggest there's an obvious candidate: Jon Rubinstein, ex-Apple hardware chief, ex-Palm chief, ex-head of HP's tablet effort. He was drafted into Palm in June 2009 after things began going seriously wrong, and got it organised enough to release the WebOS software and Palm Pre products. That wasn't enough to dig Palm out of its troubles (and \"Ruby\" seems to have hated life inside the byzantine bureaucracy of HP) but there's no doubt that he has the management skills to turn RIM around. Unfortunately for Heins, in this situation he gets to be the Gil Amelio - the incumbent CEO who gets pushed out by the cuckoo, and can take none of the credit for any subsequent success. Cut jobs Sorry, but this has to happen to get costs down. Start with the people who are doing all the marketing stuff for those 22 different phones and work outwards. Give up the idea of BlackBerry 10 as a smartphone platform Also: drop the idea of trying to sell pricey BB10 handsets in 2013. This sounds bizarre, doesn't it? Aren't we constantly hearing that BB10 is RIM's last great hope? But nobody can see the point in trying to sell BB10 on handsets. Heins has showed off touchscreen versions. Be honest. Those won't persuade people to ignore iPhones or Android phones (or Nokia phones). They'll vanish into the abyss. Mobile carriers like selling RIM's phones because they make better profits on them than they do on iPhones or top-end Android handsets. There's a burgeoning and eager group of buyers in the developing world who like the BlackBerry keyboard. There are also lots of corporate users who like the keyboard. Keep them happy; play for time. (You could improve your browser, but stick with the basics in the meantime.) Stop developing the great-thing-before-the-last-one, and develop the next great thing You're never going to beat Chinese handset makers at churning out cheap handsets; you're never going to beat Apple or Samsung at the top end. Don't pick fights you can't win. Instead, do what Apple did to you: develop something that leapfrogs the competition. Go past smartphones to the next thing that we're going to do in connectivity. RIM did it before, leapfrogging featurephones to offer phones with data and email (and web browsing of sorts) built in. Now it needs to do it again. And what is next? Wearable computing - the sort of thing being demonstrated by Google with its Glass project. You shouldn't need to take your smartphone out of your pocket to see what messages and so on you have, nor should you need to press buttons to make things happen. A really \"smart\" smartphone will do all this and connect to things on your body - less an object, more a network of objects you use. Does that sound bizarre and futuristic? No more so than the idea of people carrying around little pocket computers and using them to find their way around unfamiliar places would have 15 or so years ago. Wearables are much closer than that - and so perhaps close enough for RIM to develop something before the next wave sweeps over it. In fact, QNX is rather a good choice for a wearable computing system, as Jean-Louis Gassée points out: QNX software is the preferred choice for life-critical systems such as air traffic control systems, surgical equipment, and nuclear power plants. And its cool multimedia features have QNX software turning up in everything from in-dash radios and infotainment systems to the latest casino gaming terminals. That sounds rather cool for wristwatches that tell you emails and calls, or glasses that show you maps. QNX could be the great secret asset - rather as NeXTStep, the NexT OS, eventually was for Apple; it forms the core of iOS, which is earning all those billions. Conclusion It's pretty simple: RIM has to simplify its product line, cut its workforce, hire a visionary and build the next great thing. How long should that take? Well, for Apple the gap between Jobs reappearing on the scene and the launch of the iPod, its first breakaway product, was five years. Rubinstein (let's assume he comes out of retirement to take the job) might not have that long - but if RIM can stop burning cash on lost causes like the PlayBook, focus its spending on a few products, keep a core audience (teenagers and businesses and carriers) then it can come through this. Well, here's hoping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/10/coalition-carbon-budgets-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-10T10:13:34Z","webTitle":"Coalition will miss carbon budgets, analysts warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/10/coalition-carbon-budgets-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/10/coalition-carbon-budgets-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Coalition will miss carbon budgets, analysts warn","bodyText":"The UK will miss its \"carbon budget\" targets to cut emissions over the next decade if it relies on existing policies, analysts warned today. The latest analysis by Cambridge Econometrics confirmed that the UK has missed its long-standing target to cut carbon by 20% by 2010, despite a large fall in emissions in 2008-09 as a result of the recession. The rise in emissions during 2010, which officials attributed to heating by households in the face of cold winters, is a warning signal to ministers striving to be the \"greenest government ever\", the analysts said. The forecast suggests UK emissions will fall by around 0.5% to 0.75% every year this decade, increasing to around 1% a year in 2020-25 as power generation moves towards more low-carbon supplies. But on existing policies, including those inherited from the last government and those soon to be put in place by the coalition, the UK will narrowly miss its first two five-year carbon budgets and fail to meet the third which runs from 2018 to 2022 by a wider margin. Prof Paul Ekins of University College London, a senior consultant to Cambridge Econometrics, insisted that failing to reach the 20% target by 2010 showed how difficult it was to put in policies that would achieve effective reductions. He said the official estimate of growth in emissions in 2010 showed that \"this government's aspiration for green growth has yet to be realised\". He said: \"The historical link between economic growth and increased emissions has clearly not yet been definitively broken, which must be deeply worrying for a government that is seeking both strong economic growth and ever deeper emission reductions. \"In this context it is clear that stronger policies will be required to meet the carbon budgets for the 2020s and beyond.\" He said much was riding on the impact of a carbon floor price, energy market reforms and the success of the \"green deal\" which aims to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. And he warned: \"The new question marks over the future of nuclear power due to the nuclear accident in Japan also underline the importance of the UK greatly accelerating its deployment of renewables - the statutory 2020 renewables target mandated by the EU looks set to be missed by a large margin on current policies.\" Under the EU rules, the UK has to supply 15% of all energy – including heating and transport as well as electricity – from renewables. The latest report suggests renewable electricity will be significantly increased after 2020, as will the number of new nuclear power stations, while coal-fired power generation will be reduced. But on current policies renewables are set to make up 17.5% of electricity generation by 2025, well below the government's stated aspirations of 30% by 2020. Ekins said the government was aware of the need for more stringent policies, and new measures were in the pipeline, but steps to cut carbon were under political pressure. The government's targets are within the reach of its policies, he said, \"but only if it holds its nerve\". A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said: \"The UK is expected to meet the first three carbon budgets according to Decc's central emissions projections. \"We are not relying on the recession to help us reduce emissions, which is why we are radically reforming the electricity market, increasing home energy efficiency under the green deal and creating a green investment bank.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/jul/05/edf-nuclear-power-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-04T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"EDF threatens to scale back nuclear power plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/05/edf-nuclear-power-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/jul/05/edf-nuclear-power-energy","fields":{"headline":"EDF threatens to scale back nuclear power plans","bodyText":"EDF Energy will scale down plans to build a new generation of nuclear reactors in the UK unless the government fixes the price of carbon, its chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, has warned. De Rivaz said that EDF's business case to build four new reactors depended on a carbon tax or minimum carbon price being introduced. The government will publish a wide-ranging white paper this month detailing plans to meet the UK's new carbon budgets. It is expected to discuss measures to prevent the carbon price fluctuating wildly. Two years ago prices fell to as little as €0.10 (£0.08) a tonne. Experts say that a far higher price - at least €60 (£51.40) a tonne - is necessary to make low-carbon technologies, such as nuclear power generation or carbon capture and storage, economic. De Rivaz told the Observer: \"If we are serious about decarbonising electricity generation, we need to be serious about the price of CO2. It's very important to strengthen the emissions trading scheme ... and to sustain a credible, robust carbon price.\" He said that EDF's plan to build the UK's reactors assumed there would be a \"stable energy policy which delivers a stable carbon price for low-carbon generation\". If the government did not guarantee a minimum carbon price, or guaranteed one at too low a rate, this could result in fewer reactors being built than planned, he said, adding: \"The business case has to be competitive.

But he is also a man with a dream: to change the nuclear landscape of the UK. Conventional nuclear power (fission) is controversial and carries inherent risks, but no other energy source has a chance of securing our energy needs for the future. Nuclear fusion – for many scientists the ultimate goal of energy production – is still a long way off. Cywinski is part of a team of scientists who are working towards an entirely new type of nuclear reactor: one that could be operated safely and without generating long-lived radioactive waste. This new reactor could even consume the toxic waste generated by conventional nuclear reactors, removing it from the ecosphere. It's called the Accelerator-Driven Subcritical Reactor (ADSR), or Energy Amplifier, and in a recent lecture hosted by the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society, Cywinski outlined his vision of an ADSR-powered future. The concept was first proposed in 1993 by Nobel prizewinning physicist Carlo Rubbia. The basic idea – and what distinguishes it from all other nuclear reactors – is the coupling of a particle accelerator, like the ones at Cern, with the reactor core. That may sound bizarre upon first reading, but there's good science here. Conventional reactors are fuelled by uranium – specifically, the uranium isotope U-235. That's a lively old isotope that likes to split: it is \"fissile\". When U-235 splits, it releases neutrons, and these go on to initiate an energy-generating nuclear chain reaction by splitting still more U-235 atoms. But there are downsides to the use of uranium-235 as fuel: first, it produces plutonium as waste. Second, the uranium-235 fuel cycle is what engineers call \"critical\": once it gets going it's self-sustaining, so there is a risk – albeit a tiny risk – of loss of control. In the ADSR proposed by Rubbia, we wouldn't use uranium-235 as nuclear fuel at all. Instead, we would shift two spaces to the left in the periodic table, to uranium's unsung cousin: thorium. Despite being named for the god of thunder, thorium sits quietly in the Earth as a safe, unreactive mineral – and it sits there in great abundance, especially in Welsh earth. Unlike uranium-235, the thorium atom does not easily split, making it safe to store and handle. But we need a fissile atom to initiate the energy-generating nuclear reaction. Since thorium is not fissile, it must be converted to something that is. That's where the particle accelerator comes in. In an ADSR, the thorium-containing reactor core would be coupled to a particle accelerator. This would fire up a beam of protons before slamming them into a block of lead inside the reactor core. The bombardment induces the lead to release neutrons, in a process called spallation. Those neutrons are then smashed into the thorium atoms, turning them into atoms of uranium-233, which is fissile – and so the reaction begins. It's still nuclear fission, but a crucial safety difference between a conventional nuclear reactor and an ADSR is that in the latter the reaction operates at subcritical levels: it is not self-sustaining. So in the event of a problem, all the operator has to do is switch off the proton beam. Almost immediately, the reaction will cease. Furthermore, the small amount of toxic waste generated by the thorium/uranium-233 fuel cycle ceases to be radioactive after a few hundred years, rather than the thousands of years during which uranium waste remains toxic. Better yet, an ADSR could actually utilise, as fuel, the plutonium waste created by current reactors, eliminating toxic waste while generating further energy. But surely that particle accelerator needs a lot of energy to operate? Yes, it does. However, you get far more power out at the other end. That's where the ADSR's unofficial name – Energy Amplifier – comes from. The Thorium Energy Amplifier Association, ThorEA, calculates that an ADSR would generate 600MW of electrical power – pretty much the same as a conventional power station. Yes, the accelerator will require power input – around 20MW – but that power can be taken from the ADSR's own output, leaving an excess 580MW of electric power. So what we have, in principle, is a reactor running off stable, abundant fuel, producing an excess of energy, with no danger of meltdown. If ADSRs are really this perfect, how come we don't already have one? The problem is that, for the moment, our available options for the accelerator are limited. Commercial accelerators are pretty big, not to mention expensive to build and run. We can't have a Cern in every city. If we're going to have ADSRs as standard power stations, we have to get around this. That's where Emma comes in. The Electron Model of Many Applications, Emma for short, is a new type of accelerator designed to be the perfect partner for an ADSR. A prototype Emma lives under the grounds of the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire. Emma's unique selling point is that she is a new hybrid of a cyclotron and a synchrotron, combining the advantages of both into a compact, economical form. Last month, Nature Physics published the first results of Emma's operation, showing that she is indeed, despite her petite proportions, capable of stably accelerating electrons to the kind of velocities needed. Emma is a proof-of-principle for the new hybrid. She accelerates electrons, not protons, so will never be connected to an energy amplifier. But what we learn from Emma will be used to construct proton versions in the near future. Given sufficient investment, ADSRs could be operational in the UK by 2025. But do we really need them, given that conventional reactors, however unpopular, do still work? Yes, says Cywinski, because it's time to move on.

The Metropolitan police said four houses in east London had been searched in a series of raids on addresses linked to those detained. The five were arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which says a \"constable may arrest without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist\". The investigation is at an early stage. Some past arrests by UK counter-terrorism officials have led to people being released without charge. The arrests came hours after the death of Osama bin Laden had been announced and security was increased at key sites across the UK, though police say they are not \"at this stage\" connecting the arrests to the al-Qaida leader's death at the hands of US special forces. The men were detained at 4.32pm on Monday after a vehicle was stopped and checked by officers from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), which polices the facility in west Cumbria. The five, all in their 20s and from London, were held in police custody overnight in Carlisle before being taken to Manchester on Tuesday morning, a spokesman for Cumbria police said. The investigation has been taken over by the north-west counter-terrorism unit. The arrests, sources say, are not intelligence-led. The men may have been taking photographs or video footage, a source suggested. It is understood that a video camera was removed from the men. The police have not confirmed the ethnicity of the arrested men, though they are believed to be from a Muslim background. Sellafield confirmed that the five men had been arrested close to the site, saying: \"It is a security issue and our security people are having discussions.\" The spokesman said the plant had not been evacuated. Roads leading up to Sellafield were sealed off by police during the arrests, but security is likely to remain tight at the site for the next few weeks. The sprawling coastal site is heavily protected by both private security guards and officers from the CNC, some of whom are armed. According to reports last year, a counter-terrorism review of Britain's nuclear power plants was carried out after fears arose over safety at Sellafield. Officials at HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, which is responsible for assessing the work of police forces across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, had begun an urgent assessment, it was claimed. Concerns about protecting the plant may have come to light during an exercise in which special forces posed as terrorists to test security, said a report last December. Sellafield is responsible for decommissioning and reprocessing nuclear waste and manufacturing fuel, on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The site has been operating since the 1940s, when it was used as a Royal Ordnance factory supporting the second world war effort. The site is also home to the world's first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, which operated from 1956 to 2003. Today the site comprises redundant buildings associated with early defence work, and operating facilities associated with the Magnox reprocessing programme, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp), the Sellafield Mox plant and a range of waste treatment plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/green-living-blog/2011/oct/20/high-speed-rail-london-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-20T14:12:00Z","webTitle":"Will the High Speed 2 rail line reduce emissions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/oct/20/high-speed-rail-london-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/oct/20/high-speed-rail-london-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Will the High Speed 2 rail line reduce emissions?","bodyText":"When I travel through places such as France I always think, \"Why can't we have high-speed rail like this in the UK?\" So, I was excited when I first heard about plans to build HS2 from London, up through the Midlands, to Scotland, but is it really true to claim that it will help to bring down net emissions? The high-speed network in France uses electricity from its nuclear power stations. How will we power our network? And will it really reduce domestic flights? I find myself increasingly torn about whether it's a good or bad thing for the environment. T Johnson, by email You're right: on paper, HS2 would appear to offer environmental benefits, based on the theory that moving as many people out of cars and planes onto trains is a \"good thing\" if reducing emissions is the goal. But HS2 is a complicated brew of various environmental issues. How much localised environmental damage will be caused - and emissions created - building the network of rail lines? Will it really lead to fewer people flying between, say, London and Manchester? How do motoring and aviation emissions compare to those created by trains travelling at up to 400km per hour? And, in the decades ahead, how will the electricity used to power the trains be produced? Back in July, as part of the consultation process, the Institution of Engineering and Technology said that it had \"uncovered a number of flaws in the proposals, some of which question the claim that HS2, as proposed, will reduce carbon emissions...For example, not considering the effects of aerodynamic drag from environmental mitigation measures such as tunnels, which could lead to an increase in carbon emissions.\" Stop HS2, the national campaign aimed at blocking the scheme, points to the conclusion of HS2 Ltd, the company set up by the government to \"consider the case for new high speed rail services between London and Scotland\", as proof that any emissions claims made in favour of HS2 are questionable. HS2 Ltd's findings concluded that \"the impact of HS2 on carbon emissions is both complex and highly uncertain\". The Department of Transport - which has a brand new secretary of state in Justine Greening - currently says that HS2 would be \"broadly carbon neutral\". So, it would appear that no one really knows the answer yet. But, perhaps, you've seen some clearer, more conclusive calculations? Or done some yourself? More widely, do you think HS2 can be justified on environmental terms? Do you accept the \"business case\" made on its behalf, namely, that it will benefit the economy by reducing journey times between our city centres? This column is an experiment in crowd-sourcing a reader's question, so please let us know your own thoughts below (as opposed to emailing them) and, if quoting figures to support your points, please provide a link to the source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. My verdict (31 October, 2011): As ever, thanks to all those below who contributed to the debate. There were many points raised - electrification of track, speed vs capacity, modal shift away from domestic flights etc - but nowhere did anyone, I feel, convincingly make the case that HS2 will reduce carbon emissions enough to let it be a significant reason for the government to give it the green light. If anyone is to make environmental claims on behalf of HS2 in the future, they are going to have to come up with much better analysis than seems to be currently available. • Please send your own environment question to ask.leo.and.lucy@guardian.co.uk.

Ben Moxham, David Cameron's senior policy adviser on energy and environment and a former BP employee, said claims by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) that a 30% rise in electricity bills by 2020 would be offset by lower energy consumption through energy efficiency were \"unconvincing\". In a note written in July and copied in to other senior advisers at Downing Street including Ed Llewellyn, the prime minister's chief of staff, policy head Steve Hilton and Cameron's permanent secretary, Jeremy Heywood, and seen by the Daily Telegraph, Moxham said: \"DECC's mid-case gas price scenario sees policies adding 30% to consumer energy bills by 2020 compared to a world without policies.\" While the DECC, headed by Huhne, predicted the impact of green policies on household electricity bills \"would be lower due to the effect of other policies, notably energy efficiency measures, in lowering electricity consumption\", Moxham said \"we find the scale of household energy consumption savings calculated by DECC to be unconvincing\". He added: \"Their analysis may be based on the assumption that many energy efficiency measures will be taken up without subsidy, whereas we believe a large number of measures will need to be subsidised, given the hassle factor and other barriers to consumer uptake,\" he adds. Huhne has been pushing through energy reforms, which he has said will boost investment in low-carbon energy and allow Britain to meet its target of cutting emissions by 34% by 2020. In July he launched the white paper on electricity market reforms, which include policies on carbon pricing, which promotes the use of low-carbon renewables and nuclear power, and obligations on energy firms to provide help in making low-income homes more energy efficient and use more renewable energy. Huhne has also argued that without reforms, bills would still rise and called reports that they lead to the highest bills in Europe \"absolute nonsense\". A DECC spokesman said: \"Reforms will not add £300 to bills. Our policies will both add and subtract from future bills because we need to build new reliable energy sources to keep the lights on, but we'll also be helping people to cut their bills through greater energy efficiency. Our reforms to the electricity market will deliver the best deal for Britain and for consumers: getting us off the hook of relying on imported oil and gas by creating a greener, cleaner and ultimately cheaper mix of electricity sources right here in the UK.\" • Footnote: The headline and first two paragraphs of this story originally stated that \"green energy policies could add £300 to household fuel bills.\" Subsequent analysis of the leaked document showed this to be incorrect and therefore the headline and first two paragraphs have been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/sep/29/nuclear-power-thorium-india","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-29T12:29:27Z","webTitle":"India plans to cut carbon and fuel poverty with untested nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/29/nuclear-power-thorium-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/sep/29/nuclear-power-thorium-india","fields":{"headline":"India plans to cut carbon and fuel poverty with untested nuclear power","bodyText":"India's prime minister today signalled a huge push in nuclear power over the coming decades, using an untested technology based on nuclear waste and the radioactive element thorium. Manmohan Singh, speaking at a conference of atomic scientists in Delhi, announced that 470,000MW of energy could come from Indian nuclear power stations by 2050 — more than 100 times the current output from India's current 17 reactors. \"This will sharply reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change,\" he said, adding that Asia was now seeing a huge spurt in nuclear plant building. The Indian plan, which relies on untested technology, was criticised by anti-nuclear campaigners as \"a nightmare disguised as a dream\". The prime minister said a breakthrough deal with the US, sanctioned by the international community, had opened the door for the country to \"think big\" and meet the demands of its billion-strong population. He did not say how much the plans would cost, or how they would be paid for. The intervention comes as talks in Bangkok aimed at resolving the impasse between developing and developed countries over a new climate change deal to replace the Kyoto protocol have stalled. India, one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, has been dismayed that its pledges of action – including a dramatic expansion of nuclear power - have been met with inaction from richer nations. The prime minister's statement also brings Delhi alongside Beijing which has long promoted atomic energy. India's plan would see it leapfrog its northern neighbour. At present China has 11 reactors in operation producing 8,000MW but has proposed that by 2020 this output be increased 10-fold. The UK, by contrast, has an installed capacity of around 12,000MW, much of which is due to go offline and be replaced by a new fleet of reactors in the next decade. Nuclear power has been a contentious issue in India. Although the country has had a decades-old atomic programme, it was effectively blacklisted from global civilian nuclear trade after testing a nuclear device in 1974. That embargo was lifted in 2008 after negotations with Washington. The result has been a rush to sign deals – both to supply uranium and to build reactors. France, Russia and the United States have all sought access to the booming Indian market. India has an ambitious three-stage nuclear programme which it sees as a \"silver bullet\" to its dire energy shortage. At present 400m people cannot light their homes and the country imports 70% of its oil. Delhi says that it will be able to surmount these considerable problems and generate clean green power with an atomic programme that \"virtuously recycles\" the plutonium waste that reactors produce. This radioactive isotope takes thousands of years to be rendered safe and dealing with it is the greatest challenge facing nuclear energy's proponents. The Indian plan turns this waste into fuel. Using thorium, which is abundant in the country, combined with plutonium, the country aims to produce power and \"breed\" stockpiles of uranium. It is a technology that no other country has mastered – and many have dropped – but India still has more than 2,000 scientists working on the technical problems. Singh said the country had entered \"stage two\" of the programme and had completed a prototype breeder reactor in southern India. However campaigners said \"if climate change is the problem, nuclear power is not the answer\". SP Udayakumar, convenor of India's Alliance for Anti-Nuclear Movements, questioned whether the technology India was pushing would ever be ready. \"The nuclear technology the prime minister talks about is not proven. If we start going ahead then the issue is the amount of carbon emitted by building, maintaining, operating and decommissioning nuclear plants means that (nuclear power) is a hugely polluting technology. If it does not work then we are left with waste that takes 24,000 years to become safe. It is a gamble we will pay for generations to come.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/11/climate-change-targets-row-cameron-intervene","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-11T17:18:17Z","webTitle":"Cameron must intervene in carbon row, say businesses and campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/11/climate-change-targets-row-cameron-intervene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/11/climate-change-targets-row-cameron-intervene","fields":{"headline":"Cameron must intervene in carbon row, say businesses and campaigners","bodyText":"A chorus of businesses, politicians and green campaigners have called on the prime minister, David Cameron, to intervene in a deepening row over the government's climate change targets, as warring departments have put the UK's future emissions cuts in jeopardy. The call came as the renewable energy industry called on ministers to \"put up or shut up\", after Vestas, the world's leading wind turbine maker, dangled the possibility of creating more than 2,000 green energy manufacturing jobs in the UK – but only if the right policies were set up. The worsening Whitehall row over whether to accept the recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change – which would entail a 50% emissions cut by 2027, based on 1990 levels – threatens to derail the government's promise to be \"the greenest ever\", just before the first anniversary of the pledge this weekend. Vince Cable, Lib Dem business secretary, has taken the unusual step of writing to Nick Clegg to call for a lower target . But a lower target would imperil jobs and growth, said Andrew Raingold, executive director of the Aldersgate Group of more than 30 large businesses. \"David Cameron should intervene and show clear leadership. Cable's view that jobs and growth don't go with green targets is misguided: there is clear evidence to show stronger targets would stimulate jobs.\" Huw Irranca-Davies, the shadow energy minister, said: \"It needs David Cameron [to decide] – the sooner he does, the better.\" These views were echoed by green campaigners. Martyn Williams of Friends of the Earth said: \"Clearly, it is the job of the prime minister to settle this disagreement, and whether he accepts the recommended targets will be a test of his commitment.\" Greenpeace is planning to send a team of huskies to the House of Commons on Friday, a satirical reminder of Cameron's trip to the Arctic while in opposition. The carbon budget drawn up by the CCC, setting out the reductions that need to be made in the 2020s to meet the UK's longer-term targets, was \"robust and considered\", said David Kennedy, chief executive of the committee. He refused to be drawn on whether Cameron should intervene, but said: \"We have given a very well-evidenced proposal and I am not aware of any other well-evidenced alternative that would be consistent with the Climate Change Act. We urge the government to accept our recommendation.\" The renewables industry, which is likely to be the source of many of the promised green jobs, is also deeply concerned about future government policy. Turbine-maker Vestas signed a deal on Wednesday to develop land – the equivalent of 93 football pitches – on which it wants to construct a huge new North Sea turbine production facility at Sheerness in Kent. But it said the project would go ahead only if ministers took decisive action to help. \"Before our customers can provide us with the needed order pipeline, they need stability in the market and a long-term political and regulatory certainty that ensures their business case,\" said Anders Søe-Jensen, president of Vestas Offshore. \"Making that happen lies in the hands of policymakers, so we are looking forward to seeing the UK government providing the best possible terms for the offshore wind market to truly take off and the potential jobs becoming a reality,\" he added. The Vestas executive said the timing of a report from the government-established CCC on Monday, which raised questions about the high cost of offshore wind, \"could not be worse for us.\" Søe-Jensen warned it would be a \"shame\" if a great new job opportunity at Sheerness was lost. The report suggested that offshore wind might be more expensive than nuclear power, but was rebuffed by the renewables industry, which said the figures did not take account of the very high cost of dealing with nuclear waste. The industry lobby group, RenewableUK, said it was now time for ministers to stop the debate about offshore wind and come down firmly in favour of pressing ahead. \"We have an unprecedented situation where some of the best-known companies in the world are queuing up to invest in the UK. The government now needs to seal the deal on offshore: it needs to bag the first 8,000 jobs and hundreds of millions of pounds already pledged, by firmly supporting the technology,\" said Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK. The same message came from Friends of the Earth. \"Uncertainty over energy policy has put companies off investing in the UK for too long,\" said Tony Bosworth, FoE's national climate change campaigner. \"To reassure investors, the government must guarantee long-term support for renewable energy and allow the new green bank to borrow money straight away so that it can help clean energy projects such as offshore wind farms to get off the ground now.\" Vestas said it was still optimistic that it could obtain the orders from the deep-sea round 3 projects that would allow the Denmark-based company to build vast new turbines, which would be as big as the Gherkin office block in the City of London. Vestas has also built a new research and development centre on the Isle of Wight, but created controversy when it closed a facility for building smaller turbines in the summer of 2009. The worldwide renewable energy sector has been facing tougher times as politicians worry about bigger budget cutbacks and seek to reduce subsidies to wind and solar, despite a continuing desire to cut carbon emissions and tackle global warming. But there was a boost on Tuesday from Japan, where the prime minister promised to scrap a plan to obtain half its electricity from nuclear power and said it would promote renewable energy as a result of its nuclear crisis. Naoto Kan said Japan needed to \"start from scratch\" on its long-term energy policy after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by an earthquake on 11 March, and began leaking radiation. A United Nations report out earlier this week predicted that, if the regulatory and other conditions were right, renewables could provide nearly 80% of the world's energy needs after 2050."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/dec/27/wrong-policy-on-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-27T00:05:05Z","webTitle":"Letters: Wrong policy on renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/27/wrong-policy-on-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/dec/27/wrong-policy-on-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Wrong policy on renewable energy","bodyText":"We urge support for real feed-in tariffs for renewable energy and not nuclear power. British policymakers are poised yet again to ignore the dominant and most effective mechanism for promoting renewable energy across the world (feed-in tariffs) in favour of an auction system (Huhne promises 'seismic shift' to greener power, 17 December). This will replace the renewables obligation. The obligation is expensive, but allows good opportunities for onshore and offshore wind developers to set up schemes. The auction approach is tried and tested across the world (including the UK in the 1990s) and shown to consistently fail to deliver large capacities of renewable energy. We need a German-style system which offers open-ended opportunities to developers to take up contracts to supply renewable energy at good, guaranteed rates for 20 years, with rates tailored for different renewable technologies.

During his current career as an academic expert on Islamophobia, Bob Lambert has regularly spoken at political rallies to promote campaigns against racism and fascism. However, in his previous career as a special branch officer, which lasted 26 years, he ran operations at a covert unit that placed police spies into political campaigns, including those run by anti-racism groups. The unit also disrupted the activities of these groups. Lambert became head of the unit after going undercover himself. Since becoming an academic three years ago, he has made no secret of the fact he was a special branch detective between 1980 and 2006, working on what he describes as \"countering threats of terrorism and political violence in Britain\". However, he has kept quiet about his undercover work. Lambert, who was involved in the secret unit for around 10 years, becomes the seventh police officer to be exposed as a police spy in the protest movement. The disclosure comes before a major review of the use of such methods is published on Thursday. The report by Bernard Hogan-Howe, the new commissioner of the Metropolitan police, was commissioned by police chiefs after a series of revelations about Mark Kennedy, the officer who spent seven years embedded in the environmental movement. Lambert was confronted about his past by a group he once infiltrated, while at a conference on Saturday. In one of many appearances on political platforms, he was a speaker at the conference, organised by Unite Against Fascism to promote anti-racism and multiculturalism. Last week he urged people to attend the conference to \"show a united front against hatred and bigotry and celebrate the diversity of our multicultural communities\". Using the alias \"Bob Robinson\", Lambert posed as an activist in the group London Greenpeace between 1984 and 1988, say other members. The group, which had a libertarian philosophy, campaigned against nuclear power and weapons, as well as on other environmental issues, and says \"Robinson\" attended protests and meetings. It is understood that he also infiltrated animal rights protests. On Saturday, members of the group pressed him to apologise for long-standing infiltration of political campaigns. He refused to comment, according to them. At the time, he was acting as a member of a secretive police unit, the Special Demonstration Squad, which embedded undercover officers into groups it believed posed a threat to public order. During the late 1990s, Lambert took charge of operations for the SDS, which penetrated both left and rightwing campaigns. He was responsible for undercover police officers such as Pete Black, who spent four years pretending to be an anti-racism activist, and Jim Boyling, who was embedded in an environmental campaign against cars, Reclaim the Streets. Between 2002 and 2007, Lambert ran the Muslim Contact Unit, a Scotland Yard department which sought to foster partnerships between police and Muslim community groups to prevent Islamist terrorist attacks. In recent years Lambert has had a high public profile. A lecturer at Exeter and St Andrews universities, he has produced academic papers and articles for the media, including the Guardian and the New Statesman as he continued to argue that the government and police should work with Muslim groups to prevent terrorism. However he has attracted virulent criticism from rightwing commentators who argue for a tougher approach. They believe it is counter-productive for the police to work in partnership with Muslim groups they claim are extremists. London Greenpeace said it confronted Lambert to show \"that recent police spies outed (such as Mark Kennedy) were not 'rogue officers' but part of an unacceptable pattern of immoral infiltration of environmental groups, condoned at a high level\". Lambert could not be reached for comment yesterday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/nov/08/carbon-capture-power-station-setback","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-08T15:55:27Z","webTitle":"UK carbon capture power station plans suffer further setbacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/08/carbon-capture-power-station-setback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/nov/08/carbon-capture-power-station-setback","fields":{"headline":"UK carbon capture power station plans suffer further setbacks","bodyText":"Scottish ministers are expected to order a public inquiry into plans to build the UK's only new coal-fired power station with carbon capture technology after it suffered another serious setback. Councillors in North Ayrshire are expected on Wednesday to vote against the highly controversial proposals to build the power station, the UK's only plant to be built in advance with \"clean coal\" carbon-capture equipment, at Hunterston near Largs. As the local planning authority, their objections would force the Scottish government to hold a public inquiry into Ayrshire Power's £3bn proposals, even though the planned power station has been earmarked by ministers as a national priority in their strategic planning. That would add further and potentially significant delays to the project which has already suffered damaging blows, including the withdrawal of the Danish energy company Dong from the original consortium. Despite initially receiving backing from Alex Salmond, the first minister of Scotland, Ayrshire Power's bid to build the 1,852MW plant, and fit it with CCS for about 20% of its output from the start, has become the most unpopular project in Scottish planning history. More than 21,000 people have formally objected to Scottish ministers about the scheme, more than three times the objections to the now-shelved Kingsnorth coal fired plant in Kent, while another 500 objections have been made to the council. North Ayrshire councillors have been told by officials the plan would adversely affect the local landscape and environment; has insufficient data on health implications; does not capture 100% of all its CO2 from the start; and fails to properly consider transport, industrial and environmental implications for the wider area. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has also criticised the plans, while the Church of Scotland has formally objected. EDF, which operates Hunterston B nuclear power station next door, has also formally objected as it would weaken their chances of installing new reactors there in future. Environment campaigners have also detected a noticeable cooling in the Scottish government's enthusiasm for the scheme, said Richard Dixon, chief executive of WWF Scotland. \"It is by quite a way the most unpopular planning application ever in Scotland; clearly the reputation of coal has taken a big knock,\" Dixon said. \"People have realised that coal isn't the way forward if we're to meet our climate targets, and so many aspects of the application are incomplete or riddled with schoolboy errors, it just lacks credibility.\" The expected public inquiry is also another damaging setback for supporters of carbon capture and storage (CCS), where CO2 from the power station is trapped and then piped to vast underground reservoirs, often exhausted North Sea oil fields. Last month, proposals for the UK government to spend £1bn to retrofit CCS equipment to Longannet power station in Clackmannanshire, and Europe's third largest coal-fired power station, collapsed entirely in a row over escalating costs. This was the only scheme in the final running for UK funding but there are several other CCS schemes, including plans to fit CCS to a gas-fired power station at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire and the Ayrshire Power proposal, which are competing for European investment bank funding. Last month, Ayrshire Power's project director, Muir Miller, pleaded to councillors to back the project. He said it would introduce 1,600 temporary construction jobs and 160 permanent jobs to an area with Scotland's highest rates of unemployment and give Scotland a global competitive advantage on testing CCS technology. \"Scotland and the UK face an unprecedented energy crisis which requires bold decisions in order to ensure security of electricity supply,\" Miller said. \"The issue of future low-carbon energy supply is something we must address now, a fact that was brought into sharp relief with [the] news that the proposed CCS facility at Longannet will not now be going ahead. \"Over the next 15 years, around 25% of the UK's ageing fleet of power stations will close, including Hunterston B and, if this capacity is not replaced, electricity supplies could be compromised, bills could rise even faster and fuel poverty will increase.\" • This article was amended on Wednesday 9 November 2011 to clarify that the decision on the plant rests with North Ayrshire council rather than Scottish ministers"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/25/germany-liberal-collapse-free-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-25T09:59:01Z","webTitle":"Germany's liberal collapse parallels Clegg's fate | Hans Kundnani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/25/germany-liberal-collapse-free-democrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/may/25/germany-liberal-collapse-free-democrats","fields":{"headline":"Germany's liberal collapse parallels Clegg's fate","bodyText":"In September 2009, Germany's liberal Free Democrats had their best ever result in a general election. They won 15% of the vote, enabling Angela Merkel to drop the Social Democrats – who suffered their worst result since the second world war – and instead form the first \"black-yellow\" coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats since 1998. But in the 20 months since then, the Free Democrats have spectacularly collapsed. In Baden-Württemberg in March, they lost power after their share of the vote dropped from 11% to just 5%. Meanwhile in the Rhineland-Palatinate, their share of the vote dropped under 5% – which meant they would no longer even be represented in the state parliament. They did even worse at the weekend when they got just 2.5% of the vote in the \"mini-state\" of Bremen in the fifth of seven regional elections in Germany this year. The Free Democrats now seem to be in danger of being replaced as Germany's third-largest party by the resurgent Greens, who seem to have benefited from the Fukushima nuclear disaster and are now the second-biggest party in both Baden-Württemberg – where they now lead a state government for the first time in their history – and Bremen. Merkel had extended the life of Germany's nuclear power stations after the 2009 election but immediately after Fukushima promised to shut them sooner. The Free Democrats, on the other hand, resisted the U-turn – a big reason for their plummeting popularity in a reflexively anti-nuclear country. Guido Westerwelle, the exuberant but somewhat irascible figure who has been the face of the Free Democrats for the last decade, has been blamed for the election defeats. In opposition, Westerwelle's calls for tax cuts seemed to resonate with German voters. But as soon as he took over as foreign minister in 2009 – even though he seemed to have little interest in foreign policy – things started to go badly wrong. In particular, he was blamed for Germany's decision to break with its Nato allies and to abstain on UN security resolution 1973 on military intervention in Libya in March (perhaps unfairly, since Merkel was ultimately responsible for the decision). Although his foreign-policy positions may actually reflect the views of many Germans, Westerwelle has squandered the reputation for foreign-policy competence that the Free Democrats have had since the 1970s, when Hans-Dietrich Genscher was foreign minister. \"He's no Genscher,\" wrote the US ambassador to Germany, Philip Murphy, in a leaked cable in 2009. Following the regional elections in March, Westerwelle was replaced as party leader by the 38-year-old Philipp Rösler, Germany's first ethnic minority cabinet minister (he was born in Vietnam but adopted by a German couple when he was a baby). However, like other liberal parties elsewhere, the Free Democrats also face a deeper dilemma that goes beyond the ability of individual politicians. Back in the 1960s, when Ralf Dahrendorf was a leading figure in the party, the Free Democrats were above all social liberals who stood for civil liberties. But in the 1980s, when they switched allegiance from the centre-left Social Democrats to the centre-right Christian Democrats, and the Greens also emerged, the Free Democrats became a party of economic rather than social liberalism. In a sense, they are Germany's only real Thatcherite party. In particular, the implosion of the Free Democrats since 2009 parallels that of the Liberal Democrats in the UK since they went into government last year. Like the Liberal Democrats, the Free Democrats are perceived as having little influence on the government (\"No other coalition in the history of the Federal Republic has had so little coalition than 'black-yellow' under Merkel and Westerwelle,\" wrote Heribert Prantl in the Süddeutsche Zeitung earlier this month) but are also blamed for unpopular policies (tuition fees in the case of the Liberal Democrats, nuclear power in the case of the Free Democrats). In Germany, as in Britain, voters punish parties that are in power and in particular the junior partner in a coalition government. In other words, it's not all about Nick Clegg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/07/japan-fukushima-plant-new-quake","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-07T19:44:19Z","webTitle":"Japan's Fukushima plant evacuated after new earthquake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/japan-fukushima-plant-new-quake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/07/japan-fukushima-plant-new-quake","fields":{"headline":"Japan's Fukushima plant evacuated after new earthquake","bodyText":"Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant were forced to evacuate on Thursday night after a powerful earthquake shook northeast Japan, almost a month to the day since the region was hit by a quake and tsunami that killed an estimated 28,000 people. Two people were killed in the quake and more than 130 people injured, according to the national police agency. A 79-year-old man died of shock and a woman in her 60s was killed when power was cut to her oxygen tank. Fears that the magnitude 7.1 quake, the strongest since the tsunami, would set off another series of huge waves subsided with the lifting of a tsunami warning about 90 minutes later. The nuclear plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, said Thursday's earthquake had not caused further damage to the facility, adding that workers battling to cool down overheating reactors had temporarily retreated to an on-site quake-resistant shelter. The latest earthquake caused power outages across a wide area of northern Japan and knocked out several power lines at Onagawa nuclear power station north of Sendai city. One remaining power line continued to supply electricity as normal, and there have been no reports of abnormal radiation levels in the area. The plant's spent fuel pools briefly lost cooling capacity but an emergency diesel generator quickly kicked in. The earthquake struck 30 miles beneath the water off the coast of Sendai, about the same depth and location as the magnitude 9.0 quake on 11 March. The earthquake hit shortly after 11.30pm local time. The violent shaking lasted about 30 seconds, hurling items on to the floor in the neighbourhood near the city's main railway station. In Miyagi prefecture motorways were closed and bullet train services were partially suspended. In Sendai hotel guests and diners filed on to streets, some clutching torches as they began walking home in near-darkness. Sirens from emergency vehicles filled the air, but more than three hours later there were no reports of major damage. Police and the fire service officials said they had received numerous calls about fires and gas leaks. NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, said seven people had been injured, two of them seriously. The earthquake sent the dollar sliding against the yen and wiped out early gains in European stock markets. The International Atomic Energy Agency said progress was being made to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi plant, where workers have been injecting nitrogen into a reactor to prevent a potentially explosive build-up of hydrogen gas. \"The situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remains very serious,\" Denis Flory, head of the IAEA's nuclear safety department, told reporters.

But fears of \"astronomical\" rises as a result of building a clean energy system for the UK have been rejected by the report, which says charges on future bills for renewable energy and energy efficiency will contribute just £110 of the increase. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) calculates that the total rise could be just £25 if the full energy savings can be delivered by insulating lofts and cavity walls and replacing inefficient refrigerators and washing machines. Some reports have suggested bills will rises up to £3,000 by 2020, up from £1,060 in 2010, the typical bill for homes that use electricity, and gas for heating. \"There have been claims that there will be astronomical bill rises in the next decade due to low-carbon policies. Our analysis disproves this,\" said David Kennedy, chief executive of the CCC. \"We want to demystify this issue and have an honest debate based on facts not assertions.\" Previous bills for gas and electricity rose by £455 between 2004 and 2010, the CCC found, and 84% of this rise was due to the soaring cost of gas on international markets. Green measures have added £75. Investing in low-carbon energy was the \"sensible economic path\" said Kennedy. \"It will be very expensive to solve the problem [of cutting carbon emissions] later. We could ignore the issue and build gas plants, but then we will end up with lots of power stations we will have to scrap.\" \"There has been a concerted effort by some campaign groups to completely mislead the public into believing that green taxes have been the main cause of rises in fuel bills,\" said Bob Ward, at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at London School of Economics. \"These groups, including the Global Warming Policy Foundation and the Taxpayers' Alliance, appear driven by an extreme ideological opposition to environmental regulation, and have sought to confuse and misinform the public with blatantly inflated figures.\" The CCC's analysis was conducted independently of the government, but reached a similar conclusion. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"The CCC is correct in their analysis that past bill increases are primarily due to increased wholesale gas costs. This underlines why it is so important that we reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels and protect our homes and businesses from international fossil fuel price shocks.\" The CCC said the uncertainties in £110 expected to be added to bills for low-carbon measures were small, but that uncertainties on whether energy efficiency could be delivered were much greater. \"The challenge for the government is to put measures in place to encourage people to improve their energy efficiency,\" said Kennedy. The CCC says energy use could be cut by 6% by 2020 by properly lagging the millions of lofts in the UK which have no or inadequate insulation, and filling the millions of empty cavity walls. But its report argues there is a much greater opportunity from the replacement of old and inefficient refrigerators and washing machines. If these white goods are replaced at the end of their useful lives with efficient devices, energy use could be cut by 19%. \"They are not much more expensive and you will save a lot of energy and money,\" said Kennedy. Kennedy said one of the errors made by other analyses was to suggest that 30GW of wind turbines would be built by 2020 – the equivalent of around 30 nuclear power stations. The official objective of the government and the recommendation of the CCC is 12GW. \"This report shows that wild speculation on bill increases has been nothing but scaremongering,\" said Doug Parr from Greenpeace. Nick Molho, at WWF-UK said: \"It's great the CCC has injected a note of sanity into the fevered debate around household energy bills and confirmed what everyone knew – the cost of fossil fuels are forcing up energy bills.\" He added: \"It is the UK power sector's heavy reliance on gas and other fossil fuels – not renewable energy – which has overwhelmingly driven recent price hikes. The reality is that renewables offer us the best chance to diversify our energy sources away from our excessive over-reliance on gas and to create a substantial renewable energy industry here in the UK.\" Separately, a new YouGov poll published on Wednesday revealed that 60% of the public think the \"government is right to subsidise windfarms to encourage more use of wind power\". Three-quarters of the public said the government should be looking to use more solar power, although ministers have recently slashed solar subsidies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/07/davey-spell-out-green-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-07T20:59:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: Davey needs to spell out green policy loud and clear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/07/davey-spell-out-green-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/07/davey-spell-out-green-policy","fields":{"headline":"Davey needs to spell out green policy loud and clear","bodyText":"I was delighted to read of the government's strong commitment to support UK industry in developing offshore wind power (Nick Clegg defends wind power subsidies in face of Tory attack, 7 February). This exciting form of clean, low-carbon energy is a real \"win-win\" for our energy needs and economy. Germany has created over 350,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector alone and Scotland is creating thousands of new jobs as well, so it's surprising that so many backbench Conservative MPs seem unwilling to support what could, and should, be a jobs bonanza in their recent letter on wind power to the prime minister. So I'm pleased that both the PM and the deputy PM have firmly rebuffed this letter. But I'm disappointed to hear the new UK energy minister Ed Davey do the same as Chris Huhne and repudiate his long-held opposition to nuclear power by supporting the proposed UK nuclear new build programme. I urge Ed Davey, as the architect of the Lib Dems' anti-nuclear pre-election policy, to challenge whether nuclear new build really stacks up, and where on earth the nuclear industry or the government will find the money to finance it when the industry is debt-laden and the radioactive waste bill soars. There is still time to think again Cllr Brian Goodall Chair of UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities • Ed Davey has got off to a good start in his new job (Report, 3 February) firmly backing an agenda for green growth, jobs and defending wind power. His visit with Nick Clegg yesterday to a home energy-saving technology centre is a clear indication that they intend to put household bill payers and cutting-edge UK industry at the heart of their energy policy. Davey should have vocal support from the prime minister too. He will face a tough battle against the Treasury, the gas and nuclear industry, and the politicians who are putting those interests above bill payers, industry and jobs. Davey and the PM now need to provide the policy clarity and certainty on energy saving, renewables and decarbonisation of the energy system that shows the UK is a long-term good bet for green business. The test of Davey's success, and that of the government, will be if they deliver a timely boost to the economy, thousands of skilled jobs, and get a good deal for consumers. Andy Atkins Chief executive, Friends of the Earth, David Nassbaum Chief executive, WWF, John Sauven Executive director, Greenpeace • Environmentalists who oppose the use of geoengineering to tackle climate change should think again (Concern grows over role of scientists and billionaire backers urging climate fix, 6 February). To say that research into technological solutions \"could undermine efforts to reduce emissions\" ignores the fact that those efforts have already failed. International conferences and resolutions can't alter the political reality of electorates not supporting the radical changes to their lifestyles which would be required by significant emissions cuts. So we need to invest urgently in geoengineering, as well as carbon capture and storage, and ending deforestation. Richard Mountford Hildenborough, Kent • We hope Mr Davey will rebuild the relationship with local government - based on mutual respect – which was severely strained and undermined by the Department for Energy and Climate Change deciding to prematurely cut the Feed in Tariff for Solar installation. It caused industry turmoil and job losses, forcing councils to reduce or abandon long-planned investment in cheaper, cleaner energy for tens of thousands of domestic homes and public buildings. A major step in rebuilding the relationship between DECC and local government would be for Davey to instruct his department to abandon the farcical and humiliating appeal to the Supreme Court against Friends of the Earth's successful Judicial Review, and enter dialogue with councils, business, and the environmental sector on strengthening the future of solar and renewable energy, rather than undermining. This would immediately build trust and confidence between Davey and those partners who share responsibility for reducing carbon emissions, tackling fuel poverty and developing a low carbon economy with the jobs that will come with it. It is a chance not to be missed. Cllr Clyde Loakes London borough of Waltham Forest, Cllr Tim Moore Liverpool city council, Cllr Ed Turner Oxford city council, Cllr Tracey Simpson-Laing City of York council, Cllr Tony Newman London borough of Croydon • Your lead article (Report, 6 February) is cause for concern, but not primarily for the reasons voiced by the environmentalists you quoted. As most of them (including, in particular, Clive Hamilton, whose book \"Requiem for a species\" provides a brilliant analysis of our collective failure to address the seriousness and urgency of climate change) will be only too aware, current global policies will, on present projections and despite high level assurances to the contrary, result in CO2 levels of at least 650 ppm and a global average temperature increase of 4-6c later this century — well past tipping points which will trigger uncontrollable climate change. Given the world's continuing obsession with economic growth at any cost, this is unlikely to change within the timeframe necessary to avoid such catastrophic consequences. Recourse to geoengineering may, therefore, be the only option available to buy time for the world to catch up with reality. At the very minimum, it is essential that we research such possibilities as a precautionary measure. More fundamentally, the blanket rejection of all geoengineering as unwelcome needs challenging. Humanity has, by default, already been engaged for the last 200 years in a progressively disastrous experiment in geoengineering by virtue of its rapidly growing GHG emissions. A significant area of research supported by Bill Gates, Murray Edwards and Richard Branson is atmospheric carbon reduction, which offers the possibility of reversing history through permanently sequestering CO2 emissions as part of the natural carbon cycle, with none of the risks associated with other geoengineering options such as SRM (solar radiation management). Including such potentially valuable work under the same generic heading as other, understandably contentious interventions, is nonsensical. For nearly 30 years, progress on dealing with climate change has been hampered by the undue influence of powerful vested interests. Environmentalists should be pleased that a new generation of influence is on the right side.

The economics, the legacy situation and the carbon cycle are hidden from the population. The Sellafield site is \"privately managed\" but publicly owned, its liabilities being passed like a parcel between successive \"managers\", because of its toxic contents. I am not anti-nuclear but pro-renewable energy. The scrutiny exacted upon renewable energy is absent when it comes to nuclear energy. My objection is not the nuclear option, it is the secrecy. This is a political and economic decision related to energy futures, security of supply and carbon.

Questioning scientific sources for that is one thing, but downplaying the devastating consequences of Chernobyl and leaving aside the world's most eminent scientific source for that is cynical. Monbiot's article is suggestive of neglecting the victims of Chernobyl as the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (Unscear) only acknowledged a relatively small number. It is also surprising that the author does not consider the World Health Organisation, the UN Environment Programme and Unicef. They have counted 148,247 invalids until December 2000 directly related to Chernobyl. Monbiot also disregards clear evidence from his most cited source – the Unscear report 2000. Apart from physical illness, the report mentions psychological disorders due to fear of radiation, inevitable rumours of detrimental health effects, stress of relocation, economic hardships and highly politicised handling of the consequences of the accident.

Confirmation by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) that fuel in the cores of reactors 2 and 3 had melted came days after new data confirmed a similar meltdown in reactor 1 about 16 hours after the disaster. The utility, which last week suffered the biggest annual loss by any Japanese firm outside the financial sector, said most of the melted fuel in all three reactors was covered in water and did not threaten to compound the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The temperature of the fuel rods, which are believed to have melted and settled at the bottom of flooded reactor pressure vessels, remained well below dangerous levels, the company said. \"It is unlikely that the meltdowns will worsen the crisis because the melted fuel is covered in water,\" said a Tepco spokesman, Takeo Iwamoto. It said the fuel rods in the reactors 2 and 3 had started melting two to three days after the earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out vital cooling systems. Tepco officials repeated their insistence that the reactors had been crippled by the waves, but speculation has mounted in recent days that the quake itself had been responsible, casting doubt on Tepco's claims that the plant was able to withstand even the most violent seismic shifts. Tepco said it had been unable to confirm the meltdowns until it had finished analysing data, but Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University, suggested the revelation was timed to minimise its impact on the public. \"In the early stages of the crisis Tepco may have wanted to avoid panic,\" he told Reuters. \"Now people are used to the situation … nothing is resolved, but normal business has resumed in places like Tokyo.\" Tepco's handling of the crisis will come under closer scrutiny with the arrival in Tokyo of a delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The UN nuclear inspectors will visit the Fukushima plant and present their findings at a meeting of ministers from IAEA member-states on 20 June. Tepco has suffered recent setbacks that may derail attempts to bring the plant under control in the next six to nine months, which is the deadline the firm announced just over a month ago. On Monday, it said makeshift containers being used to store tens of thousands of tonnes of contaminated water were almost full. The company has yet to complete a system to reprocess the water for reuse in the reactors, raising fears that contaminated liquid could leak into the sea. A Tepco spokesman said dealing with contaminated water that has gathered in reactor buildings and trenches could take until the end of the year, adding that the volume of water being used to cool the damaged reactors could rise to about 200,000 tonnes. Tepco is working with the French nuclear engineering firm Areva to reprocess the water. Japan's shift towards renewable energy, meanwhile, is expected to gather momentum later this week. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, will unveil plans at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, to require all new buildings to be fitted with solar panels by 2030, the Nikkei business newspaper said. Kan has already announced a comprehensive review of Japan's nuclear energy policy and ordered the temporary closure of an atomic plant in central Japan that is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquake damage. But he is also expected to tell G8 leaders that Japan will continue to use nuclear energy after making safety improvements. Some have criticised Kan and Tepco for failing to quickly release information about the extent of the damage at Fukushima Daiichi. \"I am very sorry that the public doesn't trust the various disclosures the government has made about the accident,\" Kan told parliament. Separately, Italy's government voted by 313 votes to 291 to shelve plans for new nuclear power plants. Earthquake-prone Italy currently has no reactors, but pro-nuclear prime minister Silvio Berlusconi had planned to build new nuclear plants.

A letter to the prime minister signed by more than 100 Tory backbenchers called for a \"dramatic cut\" in subsidies for onshore windfarms, and new planning rules to make it easier for local communities to object to them. But the deputy prime minister defended subsidies to help renewable energy compete with fossil fuels, highlighting a growing division in the coalition over energy policy. \"The race is on to lead the world in clean, green energy,\" Clegg said at his first public event with the new Liberal Democrat climate secretary, Ed Davey. \"Last year we saw record-breaking global investment in renewables, outstripping the cash piled into fossil fuels. The new economic powerhouses – China, India, Korea, Brazil – are now serious contenders for that capital. In today's world, the savviest states understand that going for growth means going green. Low-carbon markets are the next frontier in the battle for global pre-eminence. I want the UK to be the number one destination for green investment. We're in this race to win it.\" Davey, who took over the climate brief when Chris Huhne resigned on Friday, said: \"I've been a lifelong supporter of renewable and wind power and I'm not going to change now. I think that onshore and offshore wind power has a real place in a balanced mix of energy generation so I'm a huge supporter of renewables and I'm going to make sure that they have a real role to play in the future.\" \"We don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past where we have polluted our planet, where our country has been dependent on fossil fuel imports, where the price is high and variable … we want to make sure we have our own energy production that is clean and green.\" The letter's organiser, Conservative MP Chris Heaton-Harris, said he had asked only backbenchers to sign, and not ministers, whips or parliamentary private secretaries. The strength of support – including big names such as the former defence secretary Nicholas Soames and two-time leadership candidate David Davis – will encourage the view that MPs feel they have support from ministers, including the chancellor, George Osborne. Davey responded with what party insiders called a \"strong rebuke\" to the signatories, who included two Lib Dem MPs. \"I think the case [for wind subsidies] is pretty compelling,\" Davey said. \"Already we've seen through the subsidies that this government has invested in onshore wind that the price has come down to make onshore wind competitive, so we've got money to invest in all sorts of renewables because of the success of these investments.\" Laura Sandys, a Conservative MP who supports wind power, said: \"Wind often gets a bad press but actually it costs the average UK household only £10 a year and generates electricity 80% of the time. Onshore, offshore, marine, solar, waste to energy should all form part of our mixed energy economy. As a collective, these technologies have the capability to help guard families across the country against energy price shocks.\" Zac Goldsmith, Tory MP and one of the party's foremost environmentalists and supporters of renewable energy, said he would write to Davey to urge an analysis of wind power to address claims it is too expensive and unreliable. He said: \"The government has to make a clear and robust case or it's going to lose the argument.\" Davey was also confronted with a critical article in Monday's Times by the economist Dieter Helm, who claimed that the policy of reducing demand to offset the extra costs of renewable energy such as wind power was \"hype\", and was not helping cut climate change emissions from fossil fuels because industries were simply moving to countries with lower prices. Another contentious area within the coalition is nuclear power, which is widely supported by Tories but has traditionally been opposed by many Lib Dems. Davey said there would be \"no change\" on nuclear policy from the coalition agreement, which made special arrangements that the government would produce new planning guidelines to allow existing nuclear reactors to be replaced, and that Lib Dem MPs could oppose the move and abstain in any vote on the issue in parliament. \"There have been understandable concerns given the expensive mistakes made in the past which the taxpayer is still paying for,\" Davey said. \"But coalition agreement is crystal clear: new nuclear can go ahead so long as it's without subsidy. Developers will be required to put money aside from day one to pay for the eventual decommissioning and waste management.\" Clegg's strong words were welcomed by environmental and energy campaigners, who have warned government that signs of political wavering on support for renewable energy are making investors nervous of spending money in the UK. long-term policy signals and ministerial support were crucial for boosting private investment in renewable energy and the green economy. David Nussbaum of WWF-UK said: \"Investor confidence is vital to build a sustainable and resilient economy, so it's essential that senior members of the government give consistent vocal support to renewables, green jobs and the low-carbon economy. I've heard from renewable energy investors that negative comments from senior politicians on going green impact directly on their ability to raise funds for investment in the UK.\" One of the MPs who signed the letter was Simon Reevell, the Conservative MP for Dewsbury, in Yorkshire, where the engineering company David Brown last week announced a big contract with Samsung to boost a new research and innovation centre it is building for wind turbine gears for offshore windfarms. Reevell said he was opposed to onshore wind turbines, which he said were an eyesore for many local communities and caused a health and safety threat. In December, Siemens announced it was developing a wind turbine manufacturing plant in Hull, and in January the Port of Sheerness submitted a planning application for a new turbine manufacturing facility proposed by Vestas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/02/nuclear-reactors-consume-radioactive-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-02T12:56:41Z","webTitle":"New generation of nuclear reactors could consume radioactive waste as fuel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/02/nuclear-reactors-consume-radioactive-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/02/nuclear-reactors-consume-radioactive-waste","fields":{"headline":"New generation of nuclear reactors could consume radioactive waste as fuel","bodyText":"A generation of \"fast\" nuclear reactors could consume Britain's radioactive waste stockpile as fuel, providing enough low-carbon electricity to power the country for more than 500 years, according to figures confirmed by the chief scientific adviser to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). Britain's large stockpile of nuclear waste includes more than 100 tonnes of plutonium and 35,000 tonnes of depleted uranium. The plutonium in particular presents a security risk as a potential target for terrorists and will cost billions to dispose of safely. The government is currently considering options for disposing of or managing it. Decc's preferred option is to build a plant to combine the plutonium with other materials in so-called mixed-oxide fuel (Mox), which is less dangerous than the current plutonium-oxide powder. But there is currently no large-scale capacity for consuming Mox fuel, and the previous Mox plant at Sellafield has been shut after being beset by operating and financial problems. In addition, Mox fuel allows only a tiny proportion of the energy in the waste to be converted into electricity. The engineering firm GE Hitachi has submitted an alternative proposal based on its Prism fast reactor, which could consume the plutonium as fuel while generating electricity. \"It's a very elegant idea that we should try and use [the waste] as efficiently as possible. I definitely find it an attractive idea,\" said Prof David MacKay, Decc's chief scientific adviser. Recent news reports have suggested this proposal has been rejected by the government and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) on the grounds of being too far from commercial viability. But the Guardian has confirmed that talks between GE Hitachi, Decc and the NDA are continuing. MacKay told the Guardian: \"My position as chief scientific adviser at Decc is that I think Prism is an interesting design and I'd like to see [details about its credibility] worked out.\" A spokesperson for the NDA said: \"The statement that the NDA has rejected the GE Hitachi Prism reactor is completely without foundation.\" He added that the current round of discussions \"might last about six months\". Fast reactor technology was developed by the US government over many decades until 1994 when President Clinton terminated all nuclear power research. GE Hitachi's Prism reactor is a commercial offshoot of that government-funded research. No Prism reactors have yet been sold, but GE believes it could construct one in a few years plus the time taken to license the technology. The reactor is a fixed small size, producing around 311MW of power – equivalent to 100 large wind turbines running non-stop or a quarter of a conventional nuclear plant. The reactor core is submerged in a pool of liquid sodium, which acts as a coolant, transferring the heat to the turbines where electricity is generated. Designers say that passive safety features ensure the reactor won't go into meltdown if its power source is cut off, which is what happened in last year's accident at Fukushima, Japan. In the proposal currently under discussion, a pair of Prism reactors would be installed at Sellafield and optimised to consume the plutonium stockpile as quickly as possible. If, however, the government decided to prioritise low-carbon power generation rather than rapid waste disposal, a larger number of Prism reactors could theoretically be combined with a fuel recycling system to extract as much electricity as possible from the plutonium and depleted uranium. According to figures calculated for the Guardian by the American writer and fast reactor advocate Tom Blees, this alternative approach could – given a large enough number of reactors – produce enough low-carbon electricity from Britain's waste stockpile to supply the UK at current rates of demand for more than 500 years. MacKay confirmed this figure. \"As an upper bound on what you could get from those resources in fast reactors I think it's a very reasonable estimate. In reality you'd get all kinds of issues so you wouldn't achieve the upper bound but I still think it's a reasonable starting point.\" But he added that free or low-cost fuel was not in itself sufficient to make inexpensive nuclear energy. \"When you think about the economics of the low-carbon transition, it isn't the nuclear fuel that's the expensive bit – it's the power stations and the other facilities that go with them.\" The cost of any Prism installation would depend on unknown quantities, including the details of the licensing requirements. However, Eric Loewen, chief engineer at GE Hitachi nuclear, claims that the technology should be economically competitive due to its small and fixed-size modular design, which allows it to be produced in an off-site factory. MacKay said, \"I think it's credible that it could be cheaper [than Mox] but it's up to GE to tell us the price tag\". He added that the alternative option of making Mox would not be easy either. \" You have to make a big facility to make the Mox fuel and you need to have a load of reactors that can accept the Mox fuel, and we don't have either of those in place yet.\" MacKay also said that he supported \"long-term research and development\" into new reactor technologies that could be safer and more efficient than current designs. He argued that such research should not be seen as a threat to renewable technologies such as wind and solar, which were crucial but not sufficient on their own to meet the UK's ambitious carbon targets. \"If you've seriously looked at ways of making plans that add up you come to the conclusion that you need almost everything and you need it very fast – right now. You need all the credible technologies that can develop at scale … I don't think anyone serious would say that we only need nuclear … but similarly I think it's unrealistic to say we could get there solely with renewables.\" Get the Guardian's environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/sep/20/simon-hoggart-sketch-clegg","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-20T20:25:26Z","webTitle":"Simon Hoggart: Cleggy, the bells toll for thee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/20/simon-hoggart-sketch-clegg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/sep/20/simon-hoggart-sketch-clegg","fields":{"headline":"Cleggy, the bells toll for thee","bodyText":"On Tuesday we heard from two people who are not contenders for the Lib Dem leadership. Not at all. No way. They demonstrated this by unswerving loyalty to Nick Clegg, whom older readers may recall as the object of Cleggmania last year, for about a day. Its sudden evaporation would have been quite a relief for these two chaps, if it weren't for their unswerving loyalty. Chris Huhne, who may be the Michael Heseltine of the party, in that everything he says in support of his leader is interpreted as another attempt to grab his job, spoke about the environment. It was a curious speech. In the middle of a section on predatory pricing, he revealed to us that John Donne had once said that no man is an island. \"But national frontiers do not bar toxic waste, sulphur or carbon,\" Mr Huhne added. I am not sure that is exactly what Donne meant. He didn't go on to say, \"no manne is an island, entire unto himself, but sitteth with his fellowes upon ye mountaine of toxick waste…\" Nor did the poet have much to say about windfarms, which are saving the environment by ruining it. Mr Huhne is all in favour. But I noticed that we got past onshore windfarms in one sentence and skittered straight on to nuclear power. Windfarms are trouble, and Mr Huhne has always been good at speeding away from trouble. At the end he pleased the conference with an attack on the Tory right: \"In the alternative vote referendum … I for one thought the vilification of Nick was appalling.\" This from the man who called him \"Calamity Clegg\" during their leadership election. It was one of those displays of loyalty that give leaders a queasy feeling in their stomachs, as if they had eaten boiled onions too fast. Then Mr Huhne actually turned on the Tories: \"If you keep beating the anti-European drum, if you slaver over tax cuts for the rich, you will … wreck the nation's economy and common purpose!\" This was supposed to be met by a ripsnorting standing ovation as the conference thundered its support. And they did stand, but slowly, and patchily; some were leaving for a fringe meeting before the free sandwiches ran out. If, in Julian Critchley's famous words, Mr Heseletine could find the clitoris of the Conservative party, Mr Huhne has barely got his hand on the Lib Dems' knee. The other pol who would have been a challenger, except he is far too loyal, is Tim Farron, the party's president. He plays the plain-spoken Lancashire lad: \"the economy's buggered\", he told us, plainly, at a Channel 4 fringe meeting. He was asked if Mr Clegg would lead the party into the next election. \"He almost certainly will,\" he said, which did not hit precisely the right note of crazed allegiance. He then described the security arrangements at the Clegg home. No of course he didn't say where they leave the key when they're out! To misquote Donne's poem [see footnote] again, \"always send for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for Cleggy\". That's what they want to hear. Or would, if they weren't so ear-bleedingly loyal. • This footnote was appended on 21 September 2011: No Man is an Island was not originally written as a poem. It is a prose passage from John Donne's Devotions upon Emergent Occasions of 1624, a series of meditations and prayers written during convalescence on the subject of health, pain and sickness.

As is often the case in France, there is specific legislation dictating when and for how long traders can discount goods, aimed at stopping \"unfair\" competition and protecting small shopkeepers who cannot afford to sell at a loss all year round. Not that anyone could sell at a loss all year round even if they wanted to. There is a law against this too; because here competition is a dangerous thing that needs to be regulated. There was a parallel to the Élysée's response to the loss of France's AAA status in the muted declaration by French shopkeepers on Wednesday that takings had been \"satisfactory\", despite many of them offering 70% discounts from the off, instead of later on in the official five-week sale period. The downgrade came as a bitter blow to President Nicolas Sarkozy, just four months from an election in which he is expected to seek a second term of office. The French leader had made it a point of pride that only he was capable of preserving France's credit status and is said to have remarked in a recent meeting of ministers: \"If the rating goes, I'm dead.\" But as he summoned ministers to a crisis meeting, the message seemed to be: \"Keep calm, carry on … and create a diversion\". It was not the French economy that was to blame, said Sarkozy's chief adviser, Henri Guaino, but \"the responsibility of all those players in the eurozone\". Sarkozy is between an economic rock and a political hard place. He is already committed to bringing down France's public spending to within the 3% limit imposed by the European Union by 2013. The government has already voted in a series of austerity measures, including savings of €65bn by 2016, announced in November, on top of a €12bn deficit reduction package announced in August. The government has said it needs to make savings of €100bn-plus to balance France's budget by 2016. All this at a time when the country is gearing up for elections, unemployment is at a 12-year high and the economy has virtually ground to a halt – and, to pile on the agony, when growth is expected to be considerably lower than the 2% forecast. Although his finance minister François Baroin pledged on Friday night that there would be no more \"austerity measures\", only a fool, or someone who expected to be out of office later this year, would promise otherwise. Political rivals rushed to put the boot in, from Socialist François Hollande, who said it was the Sarkozy government that had been downgraded, to the far-right Front National, which said it was the beginning of the end for the euro and the shattering of the \"myth of a president who protects\". The French enjoy a high standard of living, and generous social and employment benefits. Its strengths are carmaking, aerospace, railways, cosmetics, nuclear power, insurance and pharmaceuticals. It is also the world's number one tourist destination. About 25% of the workforce is in the public sector and, until now, largely cushioned from the economic downturn. In the three-decade period between 1945 and 1975, known as les trente glorieuses (\"the glorious thirty\"), the French economy grew much faster than that of the UK or US, through a series of government four-year plans. Political leaders of all colours supported nationalisation of whole industries, including banking and pharmaceuticals, and state intervention. But France began privatising under Socialist president François Mitterrand in the late 1980s and carried on until well into the centre-right presidency of Jacques Chirac, who was replaced by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007, though the state remains a major shareholder in key utility companies. Its infrastructure, healthcare and social services, the envy of many European neighbours, however, have proved a black hole for the country's finances. To fund them, taxes, particularly on French businesses, are high – which has led the corporate sector to outsource employment to low-wage countries where the same levels of job protection are unheard of. Paradoxically, France's productivity levels are rated consistently higher per hour than for workers in the UK and the US, but economists say this is because a far smaller proportion of the French population is in full-time work. Students begin their working lives later and a large number of people retire in their mid-50s. Though France was able to ride out the 2008 recession better than many other European Union economies because of its large government sector, this has made recovery sluggish. In a report entitled 'Doing Business 2012\" in Europe, the World Bank rated France 29th in terms of ease of doing business, compared with the US, which ranked 4th, Norway, 6th, Britain, 7th, Ireland, 10th, Sweden, 14th, and Germany, 19th. When France was warned last year that its credit rating was threatened, Sarkozy's response was a variation on his 2007 election theme: \"Work more to earn more\". The French, he added, had to be more like the Germans. But the downgrade has exposed the mirage of balance in the Franco-German relationship that Sarkozy and German chancellor Angela Merkel – known together as \"Merkozy\" — have been keen to promote as the core of Europe. \"We need the French or else this will be seen as Germany bossing everyone else,\" said a German official before one of many crisis summits, in Paris in December. Now it will certainly be harder for France – and Sarkozy – to offer other European partners lessons in good housekeeping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/11/fukushima-fallout-cattle-farmers-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-11T12:22:35Z","webTitle":"The dairy farmers who returned to Fukushima's fallout path","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/11/fukushima-fallout-cattle-farmers-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/11/fukushima-fallout-cattle-farmers-radiation","fields":{"headline":"The dairy farmers who returned to Fukushima's fallout path","bodyText":"\"The alarm is ringing. That means danger,\" says Keiko Sanpei, above, with a nervous laugh as she looks at a meter which shows radiation levels, at her dairy farm, more than five times the health limit. \"I was afraid when I first returned. But being with the cows, that fear goes away.\" Sanpei's home is in Namie, a radiation hotspot 17 miles downwind of the leaking Fukushima nuclear plant. It is just outside the government's mandatory exclusion zone, but the ground here was so contaminated during the crisis residents are now exposed to almost as much radiation as someone standing outside the plant's west gate. Namie has become a ghost town. The fields, normally a hive of activity in this season, are deserted. Roads are almost empty, apart from emergency vehicles and a police van that blocks the route into the 16 mile-radius exclusion zone. Almost all of the 2,000 residents followed government advice to evacuate after the explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant on 15 March, but Sanpei and her husband were among a few dozen farmers who returned, more concerned for their cattle than their personal safety. \"I could hear the cows in my ears mooing. I couldn't sleep. I was so worried,\" says Sanpei as one of the herd licks her arm. \"We came back after a week. Even though the radiation was frightening, when we saw the cows again we had peace of mind.\" Back then they were unsure of the risks. At the peak, in the worst affected areas of Namie, residents say radiation levels surged past 150 microsieverts per hour when it rained. But the government did not release data about radioactivity in the area until April. \"The government draws a boundary with a compass from the site of the reactor. But the reality is completely different. The most irradiated areas are in a line heading north-west from the plant. That includes here. But we only realised that in April,\" says Sanpei. She now has her own dosimeter. It shows radiation outside her home is 13 microsieverts per hour – 200 times the level in Tokyo and equivalent to having a chest x-ray every four or five hours. Radiation readings are falling slowly as the situation stabilises at the nuclear plant. This week, for the first time since the earthquake and tsunami, radiation levels inside No 1 reactor fell low enough to allow workers to enter. But the crisis is far from over. Engineers are still battling to prevent further leaks from the four damaged reactors and pools of highly radioactive spent fuel. Sanpei's only precaution is to stay mostly indoors, where she is exposed to three microsieverts an hour. But she needs to go out to tend to the cows, though the milk has to be thrown away. Hideaki Monma, another resident, has to borrow money from the bank to cover the daily loss of roughly 1,000 litres of milk. It is not just affection for the animals that keeps him in the danger zone. He has invested 30 years of his life in his herd. \"We all want to evacuate. But if we leave the cows behind, then all we will take with us are debts,\" he says. \"Tokyo Electric [which operates the Fukushima plant] promise compensation but I doubt it will be enough. They have so many people to pay.\" The government has ordered the company to pay initial compensation of 1m yen (£7,580) each to about 50,000 families forced to leave the exclusion zone. Merrill Lynch estimates the final bill could climb to 11 trillion yen. Monma is unsure, but not too concerned, about the effect on him of the radiation. Doctors found radiation in his throat – the area of the body most susceptible to contamination. \"On a risk scale of nought to 10, it was just a one. It will be OK,\" says his wife . \"The cancer rate rises only very slightly with this level of exposure. I think it is acceptable.\" The government no longer thinks so. After ignoring earlier calls for the evacuation area to be widened, it announced last month that people in hotspots such as Namie must leave by the end of May. Frustration was evident at a public meeting at the weekend between cattle farmers and officials from Tokyo Electric and the Fukushima prefecture. One farmer who had to abandon cattle inside the evacuation zone related the horror he found. \"All my cows had died of starvation. The bodies stank. I'm furious. It is like losing members of my family,\" said Takashi Sanbonmatsu. So far only beef cows have been transported from Namie. No decision has been made about the dairy cattle. \"I think the government is waiting for them to die,\" says Monma. \"We don't stay for fun. We think of the cows we have lived with. We want to look after them until the end.\" Many farmers say the fear over contaminated milk has grown to encompass discrimination against people from affected areas. Some spoke of carparks refusing vehicles with Fukushima licence plates and families cancelling marriages because they did not want a bride from an area with higher-than-normal radiation. A sign on the wall of the meeting read: \"Don't give up after the earthquake. Don't give in to nuclear power. Don't give in to public opinion.\" Tokyo Electric officials have apologised repeatedly. The company president, Masataka Shimizu, went down on his knees to Namie residents last week. Such shows of contrition do not impress those whose homes are irradiated. \"I am angry as a result of Tokyo Electric. Our lives have been turned upside down,\" says Sanpei. \"We didn't know very much about the nuclear power plant even though it was very close. But Tokyo Electric told us it was safe. They repeated that over and over. They did that to hide the danger.\" The government said this week it has no plans to abandon nuclear power, which supplies about a third of Japan's electricity. It has ordered extra safety inspections and the decommissioning of three reactors at the Hamaoka plant considered vulnerable to earthquakes. The residents of Namie are finally preparing to leave. They are not sure if they will ever come back. Sanpei says soil samples near her home showed 30,000 bequerels of radioneuclides, which might make it impossible to grow fodder for cows. \"The government says it will take a year to clear up. But cleaning up this land … will take a long time and a lot of money,\" she says. \"Even though I want to come back, I might have to give up hope of returning any time soon.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/aug/31/nuclear-technology-developing-countries","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-31T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"New nuclear technology 'could benefit developing countries'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/31/nuclear-technology-developing-countries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/aug/31/nuclear-technology-developing-countries","fields":{"headline":"New nuclear technology 'could benefit developing countries'","bodyText":"The world is on the brink of a nuclear power renaissance, and developing countries may also benefit, according to researchers. In a study published in Science this month (12 August) British researchers outlined a vision for flexible and more user-friendly nuclear technologies, as worries over the climate change, energy supply security, and depletion of fossil fuels, are overturning decades of hesitancy over the safety of nuclear power plants. Robin Grimes, materials researchers at Imperial College London and William Nuttall, senior lecturer in technology policy at the University of Cambridge, believe nuclear power will become viable for energy production in developing countries post-2030. \"Outside currently established nuclear countries, flexible nuclear technologies will be especially attractive, reducing the need for grid infrastructure,\" Grimes told SciDev.Net. The authors envisage ship-borne power plants providing energy to big cities, requiring less grid infrastructure and making it easier to invest in cost-effective nuclear energy from scratch. Grimes also suggested 'fuelled-for-life core reactors' — fully sealed modular reactors that could last 40 years and remove fuel handling from the energy production process. These would also reduce workers' exposure to radiation, reducing the need for expensive monitoring. Another idea is to develop reactors with replaceable parts to extend their 40–50 year life span, so that investment in reactors was more cost effective. Technologies now under development could mean 'fast reactors' using uranium 15 times more efficiently than at present. They could become available by 2030, reducing the cost of raw materials. But any country, developing or not, must show both an \"economic need for nuclear energy\" and \"a clearly independent nuclear regulatory body that has access to the necessary facilities and the people to carry out its work,\" Grimes told SciDev.Net. Safety and nuclear proliferation criteria as laid down by the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty would need to be met, as well as compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency, standards. If these criteria are met, reducing reliance on grid infrastructure is a key point for developing countries wishing to join the predicted renaissance, as it keeps costs low, Grimes said. But some experts are doubtful. Referring to solar energy, John Finney, chair of the British Pugwash Group but speaking in a personal capacity, said that other options such as solar power might also suit developing countries. Bob van der Zwaan, senior scientist at the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands said that nuclear energy was not a silver bullet, but could address climate change, pollution, and energy dependency problems \"along with other options such as renewable\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/07/sellafield-and-selling-nuclear-solutions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-07T21:00:08Z","webTitle":"Letters: Sellafield and the selling of nuclear 'solutions'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/07/sellafield-and-selling-nuclear-solutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/07/sellafield-and-selling-nuclear-solutions","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield and the selling of nuclear 'solutions'","bodyText":"George Monbiot (We need to talk about Sellafield.

Around 1995-96, I worked for Nirex, the industry-owned body tasked with dealing with the nation's stockpile of nuclear waste. In 1992, an essentially political and financial decision had been made to dispose of much of that waste in underground tunnels dug on nuclear industry land at Sellafield. Many tens of millions of pounds were spent on experiments, scientists, consultants, lawyers, PR people, and so on, to deliver the project. During a five-month public inquiry near Sellafield a team of us then worked, lived and drank as part of the Sellafield nuclear community. We were there to justify the decision that had already been made, and to persuade an independent inspector, and then the secretary of state, to grant the necessary planning permission. At the inquiry, the cash-stretched local authority, and some dedicated environmental campaigners, chipped away at Nirex's case (including on safety issues). When they dashed holes in our assumptions, our numbers or our arguments, we stayed late reworking them to try and plug the gap. It was hard work but (I hate to admit it) almost fun. It was easy to suppress any doubts about the correctness of what we were there to promote. With hindsight, the \"groupthink\" was obvious. In the end, we failed. The brave and independent-minded inspector recommended that the secretary of state refuse permission, which, to his credit, John Gummer then did. Had they not, then by now casks of nuclear waste would be being buried under Cumbria in a nuclear dump which might, or might not, have been safe in the long run. So, even if George Monbiot is right when it comes to anti-nuclear campaigners, they are certainly not alone in throwing the scientific process into reverse. Ironically, changes to the planning system mean that today's proposals for new nuclear facilities will not be subject to anything like the scrutiny which we endured. My personal experience leads me to fear for the results. Name and address supplied • George Monbiot isn't talking about Sellafield, he's having a go at anti-nuclear environmentalists and proposing a technical fix for nuclear waste. If he were to come to Sellafield, he'd find out that we have two reprocessing plants (Thorp and Mox) that don't work and, yes, a lot of highly dangerous nuclear waste that the industry and politicians have neglected for the past 60 years. The fate of this is currently being \"consulted upon\" among Cumbrian residents, who are being asked whether the local councils should volunteer to host a deep disposal facility (somewhere unspecified) for both high- and intermediate-level waste. This too depends on a technical fix since the geology is unsuitable, the technology is untested, there are more than 100 flaws in the design – and it will involve an immense engineering project at the back door of the Lake District national park. The spent fuel we already have here could be persuaded without great difficulty to devastate a significant area of the planet. The ill-functioning Mox plant costs us £90m a year (and another one is being proposed – with no customers for the fuel). Who is peddling snake-oil – one environmentalist's business or the nuclear industry? Which technical fix should we pin our hopes on? And how green is an accommodation to a small but definite chance of nuclear catastrophe at Sellafield and the prospect of ruination of the western Lake District? Dr Ruth Balogh West Cumbria &amp; North Lakes Friends of the Earth nuclear issues campaigner • George Monbiot demeans himself by implying that all anti-nuclear campaigners are ignorant ranters, and by holding up the disgraceful Dr Chris Busby as an archetype. This cuts off any possibility of a sensible dialogue about the real pros and cons of nuclear power. The integral fast reactor (IFR) that Monbiot and some others portray as some sort of perfect solution is not as easy or available as he implies. It would be cooled by liquid sodium, a very difficult technology that has been written off by the US, France and the UK (at Dounreay). The new form of reprocessing that might allow the IFR to use its own waste as a fuel source has never been tested. Nor does everyone agree that the IFR is as proliferation-resistant as he claims. Even if development of the IFR were to be pursued – and successful – it would be decades before it could make a useful contribution to electricity generation. Wouldn't it be better to use the time, effort and cost of trying to develop the IFR to develop better, safer and cheaper forms of renewable energy generation and, crucially, energy storage? Professor Eric Eisenhandler Queen Mary, University of London • So Georgie is now a pro-nuclear \"green\", is he? What nonsense. Nuclear is never green; it is not just dangerous, it has the potential to effectively declare the UK an uninhabitable death zone should there be an accident or mishap. Why would we even take the chance of destroying our country, when renewables can easily supply all our electricity needs several times over? What we get from George is the usual drivel from the pro-nuclear lobby: \"It's safe, trust us\"; \"It makes financial sense, it's much cheaper\"; \"Chernobyl could never happen again, don't worry.\" Let's get this straight: nuclear is not a green power and it is not a cheaper option – in fact it's several times more expensive for taxpayers overall. We need to get turbines erected at the most suitable sites in the UK. All those opposed because \"it messes up the countryside\" need a reality check. We must deal with climate change now. Stephen Reid Glasgow • It is with sadness that I again read another pro-nuclear column from the prominent environmentalist George Monbiot. He writes that anyone that opposes new nuclear build and all that it entails is both anti-science and anti-technology. Has he not read some of the other nuclear-related articles in the Guardian recently? No consideration from George of the overly close relationship between the UK government and the nuclear industry (Report, 6 November)? No comment from George on the £100bn that the radioactive waste legacy now costs the UK taxpayer – almost as much as UK national debt? No comment from George on how easy it was for Greenpeace activists to get into a nuclear power station in France? No comment from George again about that 45 tonnes of radioactive water which has recently leaked out of the Fukushima plant, probably into the Pacific Ocean? And now George mentions the great benefits of a new plutonium reprocessing plant at Sellafield, not mentioning the tens of billions of pounds that have already been wasted on developing completely inefficient reprocessing plants at Sellafield over the past two decades! None of these issues makes me feel confident about the \"superior\" science and technology of nuclear energy. Germany's move to renewables is fast and remarkable and it will have long-term, sustainable environmental improvements, but George does little to mention that in his column. I wish we could have a genuine, fair debate on future energy policy in these difficult economic times. Councillor Brian Goodall Chair, Nuclear Free Local Authorities • So George wants to talk about nuclear. Indeed we do. And we need to talk about his phrase \"either it is stored and then buried\". We need seriously to talk about the consultation process just started in West Cumbria about the proposals for the deep burial of high-level nuclear wastes somewhere yet to be revealed in the countryside between the borders of the Lake District National Park and the Irish Sea. We need to talk about the geology and the science, and the wholesale destruction of land to make a burial ground as deep as 1,000 metres, and many kilometres in length; about the 7m cubic metres of rock to be excavated and stored over 40 years in the course of backfilling. We need to talk about who suffers up to 30 daily journeys by road of nuclear waste from Sellafield to the site or up to 80 train shipments. We need to talk of the unknowns – the almost impossibility of calculating the effect over say 1,000 years of time and change on stores of hazardous material. Above all, we need to talk about a process that makes it clear in the consultation document that the views of a local community can in certain circumstances be overriden – assumedly in the national interest. This is the nation's waste; yet the consultation process is only directed to some 78,000 households, of whom perhaps two-thirds work in the nuclear industry or have relatives in the industry. Apologists for the process may witter on about the right to withdraw at specific stages but consistently every document fails to mention that as per para 6.39 of the 2008 white paper: \"All parties to a community siting partnership should work positively to seek to avoid the need to exercise the RoW [right of withdrawal].\" The process in its present form should be halted forthwith. But research and development should continue as independently of the nuclear industry as possible. Where should the waste go ? Where in England should it be stored or buried and where, if it is to be buried, has the optimum geology? What are the health and safety risks to future generations over say 1,000 years? Then and only then should potential host communities be approached and negotiations initiated on the fraught issues of impacts and benefits to be paid as compensation. Michael Baron Cockermouth, Cumbria • By looking to integral fast reactors as a way of drastically reducing carbon emissions, George Monbiot ends up blaming the environmental movement for the lack of progress on dealing with global warming. Describing greens as \"medieval\" in their attitudes towards technology misses the enormous contribution the movement has made over the years in highlighting the environmental destruction caused by faulty technologies, industry's vested interests and the lack of political interest. Monbiot himself has often been at the forefront of this work. There are criticisms to be made of IFRs, but one should be more wary of looking simply for a technical fix to global warming. The technology already exists to tackle climate change. What is lacking is political will. This is epitomised by the 4,500 people who find themselves on notice of redundancy at Newcastle's Carillion plant. Men and women who install and maintain solar panels. Government policies on reducing feed-in tariffs are to blame for this, not environmentalists, who will be joining the trade unions in the fight to save these jobs. Who is really at fault for the continued rise in emissions and lack of action on global warming. Is it the environmental movement as Monbiot suggests? Or is it those politicians who continually fail to find agreement at conferences like that at Durban, or Copenhagen before. The choice that environmentalists face is not, as Monbiot says, between nuclear waste or IFR technology. It is about whether or not we give up trying to change political priorities, and how we continue the campaign for the planet's future. Monbiot's misplaced criticisms hamper that struggle and end up bolstering the real climate criminals.

We're paying the chairman £200,000 a year, and also supporting a team of 25 commissioners, a chief executive, five directors and a communication team. But the Infrastructure Planning Committee - a quango set up by the government to fast-track nationally important projects such as windfarms and nuclear power stations - has yet to receive a single application. And if the Tories or Lib Dems win the election they're going to shut it down. British planning at its best. The IPC is the crowning achievement of a five year overhaul of our planning system. Back in 2004 Kate Barker – economist and member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - was asked to carry out a review of land use planning. She concluded that the current system was overcomplicated, and was losing us money, and she recommended \"introducing a new system for dealing with major infrastructure projects, based around national Statements of Strategic Objectives and an independent Planning Commission to determine applications\". Her wish came true; in the very next white paper the Department of Communities and Local Government promised a \"new system\" which would be simultaneously accountable, transparent and streamlined. Wow. Needless to say – this is the planning process after all - the setting up of the resulting IPC, a national commission entrusted with the job of making decisions on large scale projects of national importance, has been fraught with difficulties. Local councils complain that they have been given new responsibilities, with no money to carry them out; moreover they've been told to ask the companies planning the projects to pay for environmental assessments. Environmental campaigners including the RSPB and Friends of the Earth have complained of being \"deeply disappointed by the national policy statements (NPS) which guide the decisions of the IPC. And the Royal Town Planning Institute has warned that the NPSs may form a \"jigsaw which won't fit together\". Moreover, there are fears from many quarters that the processes of the IPC will exclude the public from taking part in decisions. The new system will only allow the public to intercede at three points in the process; before the application is made (while the company making the application are consulting), in written form or during a one day public hearing. They can also make a legal appeal during six weeks after a decision is taken. And this comes as the EU is threatening to take the UK to court for being so opaque in its planning decisions. The Lib Dems vowed last year that they would shut the IPC down. The conservatives have wavered, promising last July to keep it going, before stating finally in their manifesto last week that \"we will abolish the unelected infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) and replace it with an efficient and democratically-accountable system that provides a fast-track process for major infrastructure projects\". So now, the IPC, which declared itself open for business last October, and officially announced that applications would be welcome from 1 March 2010, is sitting, waiting to discover its fate. So far, it has published one opinion, on an expected application for a waste plant. But that had to be withdrawn because it failed to meet consultation requirements. The press officer for the IPC told the Guardian yesterday that he's not sure when the first application will actually be arriving. But he believes that it will be fairly soon. And when we rang back yesterday with more questions, the communication team was off. Apparently they don't come in on Tuesdays. Who can blame them, really? It's hard not to wonder what they would have to communicate anyway. There is a certain poetry to the idea, however, that the body designed to modernise the UK's rococo planning system may well turn out to be the biggest white elephant of all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/16/greens-won-argument-lost-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-16T20:15:01Z","webTitle":"Letter: Greens won argument, but lost the politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/16/greens-won-argument-lost-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/16/greens-won-argument-lost-politics","fields":{"headline":"Greens won argument, but lost the politics","bodyText":"As a former national director of Friends of the Earth, I would like to support Charles Secrett's comments on the current state of the environment movement (Report, 14 June). He is correct that the movement has gained resources and credibility, but lost the initiative. However, we should not be totally surprised: an early study of environment groups (Lowe and Goyder, 1983) foresaw that such groups have a life cycle – they either accommodate to the establishment (becoming co-opted) or they wither and die. Environmentalists have won the argument, but lost the politics. We have been \"co-opted\" into confronting environmental issues on the terms of the status quo, arguing for climate change and ecological policies which tackle the symptoms, not the causes. This is no different from parallel movements which came to prominence in the postwar decades: disarmament, child poverty, housing, health and education. The current political apathy in England (I suspect more campaigning energy survives in Scotland, and perhaps Wales) reflects this feeling among many one-time activists that they cannot make a difference in the face of bland professionals – be they politicians or NGO staff. What is needed is a revitalised political process based upon ethical principles and honesty, not political expediency and spin. But without a fair electoral system in Britain, the only remaining party of principle – the Greens – can make little headway. Friends of the Earth was created to achieve rapid change by short, sharp campaigns which seized the public imagination. By becoming bogged down in protracted policy campaigns, FoE, Greenpeace and the rest have effectively been neutralised – compare Germany's and Italy's response to nuclear power post-Fukushima with that in Britain, if you don't believe me.

Nuclear companies like EDF Energy have warned they will not make the billions of pounds of investment necessary in the UK without government financial guarantees. Speaking to the Guardian, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, admitted that the energy market needed \"radical reform\", but denied the plans amounted to subsidies for the nuclear industry. He insisted that all forms of low-carbon generation – nuclear plants, wind farms and clean coal plants – would benefit from the proposed changes. \"It's important we make clear that this is about low-carbon generation,\" he said. Environmentalists like Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and Greenpeace are opposed to nuclear, in part because of the industry's history of relying on state subsidies to meet escalating costs. The government has narrowed the range of energy market reforms it is considering. Companies are expected, under the current free market approach, to invest in new power plants and wind farms based on future – and volatile – electricity prices. The government estimates that at least £110bn needs to be invested in the electricity sector over the next decade to meet ambitious carbon targets and keep the lights on. But companies are reluctant to build low-carbon generation plants, particularly nuclear reactors, because they do not know what return they will make on the huge up-front investment required. EDF Energy, which says it could have the UK's first new reactor operational by the end of 2017, needs to make a decision soon on whether to go ahead. Officials are considering introducing subsidies for low-carbon generation like nuclear. The costs would be passed on to all consumers through higher utility bills. This could be in the form of a \"low-carbon obligation\", similar to the existing renewables obligation, requiring suppliers to pay a higher electricity price to nuclear generators, depending on the carbon price. Miliband insisted that the reforms, which will not be finalised until next year, would not result in additional utility bill increases. He claimed bills will only rise by up to 8% over the next decade, even though regulator Ofgem estimates the increase will be as high as 25%. \"We are talking about a radical reform of the market,\" he said. \"It's necessary to get the low-carbon investment we need.\" The industry broadly welcomed the proposals. Professor Dieter Helm, an economics of energy expert at the University of Oxford, said reforms needed to be introduced more quickly. \"There is a question of urgency here,\" he said. Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica said: \"We welcome the idea of a UK mechanism to achieve higher carbon prices, following the principle that the polluter pays.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/oct/09/iaea-fukushima-inspectors-arrive","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-09T12:24:09Z","webTitle":"International nuclear inspectors arrive in Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/09/iaea-fukushima-inspectors-arrive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/oct/09/iaea-fukushima-inspectors-arrive","fields":{"headline":"International nuclear inspectors arrive in Fukushima","bodyText":"Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency have arrived in Fukushima city to observe efforts to decontaminate the area following the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 12-member team arrived as Japan announced the launch of long-term checks for thyroid abnormalities in local children. The screenings will target 360,000 children who were aged up to 18 on 11 March, when a tsunami overwhelmed the plant, knocking out power to cooling systems and triggering meltdowns in three of its six reactors. The IAEA inspectors will visit the facility, operated by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), as well as farms and schools where decontamination efforts are under way. After the agency's first visit to the stricken plant in June, it criticised Tepco for failing to prepare for a large tsunami, but praised its post-disaster response. The inspectors will give a preliminary report to the Japanese government at the end of next week and present more detailed findings next month. The plant released large quantities of radioactive material over a wide area, including locations well outside the 20km (12-mile) evacuation zone imposed in the early days of the crisis. About 100,000 people in and around the evacuation zone were forced to leave their homes; some have no idea when, or if, they will be able to return. Health experts are particularly concerned about the possible health effects on children of long-term exposure to low levels of radiation in affected areas such as Minamisoma and Fukushima city, which has a population of almost 300,000. The government recently lifted an advisory warning for people living in five locations between 20 and 30km from the plant to evacuate should the situation at the plant worsen, but thousands still refuse to return. Health authorities refused to release the results of the first tests, conducted on 100 children at Fukushima Medical University. The children will continue to be tested every two years until they reach 20, and every five years thereafter. Those found to have suffered damage to their thyroids will undergo more detailed examinations. Children and adolescents are more at risk because their thyroids absorb radioactive iodine and other harmful substances more easily than those of adults. Sunday's examinees included a seven-year-old boy whose parents took him out of Fukushima after the accident. \"My son hasn't shown any symptoms, but I'm worried about what might happen in four or five years from now,\" his mother, Kikue Komatsu, told Kyodo News. \"I'm with Fukushima in spirit, but there is no way we can return while radiation levels are still high.\" Last week, a Japanese charity and hospital reported that they had found thyroid irregularities in 10 out of 130 children evacuated from Fukushima prefecture. Representatives from the Japan Chernobyl Foundation and Shinshu University hospital said they could not make a direct link between the accident and the findings, but called for children to undergo lifelong medical observations. Health authorities in the former Soviet Union identified about 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer among people who were adolescents or children at the time of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Towns outside the evacuation zone have sprayed streets with water and removed topsoil from school playgrounds in an attempt to make their communities safe. But cleaning up the towns and villages closest to Fukushima Daiichi could take decades, the government admitted recently. Older residents in those communities accept they may be dead by the time their old homes are safe to live in . Decontaminating areas outside the exclusion zone could take until March 2014, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said, citing government officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"government-computing-network/2012/may/15/bletchley-park-codebreaking-colossus-government-computing","type":"article","sectionId":"government-computing-network","sectionName":"Guardian Government Computing","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-15T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Bletchley Park: where government started computing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2012/may/15/bletchley-park-codebreaking-colossus-government-computing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/government-computing-network/2012/may/15/bletchley-park-codebreaking-colossus-government-computing","fields":{"headline":"Bletchley Park: where government started computing","bodyText":"For every £40 spent by the UK state sector, nearly £1 goes on information and communications technology; well over twice what we spend on roads. Yet just 70 years ago, the electronic programmable computing on which all ICT depends was just a theoretical concept in the minds of visionaries such as Alan Turing. Calculations were made by humans, sometimes with the aid of machines, but these were mechanical and electrical. At Bletchley Park, a country house and estate by the train lines and communication cables from London to the north-west, the government employed Turing and his peers to turn the concept of electronic programmable computing into reality, in order to crack the sophisticated enciphering machines of the Nazis. The work, which some historians believe shortened the war by two years, was blanketed in secrecy, and remained undercover for decades afterwards. No longer. \"Bletchley: Home of the codebreakers,\" reads the town sign. Pointers to Enigma Court, a new housing development named after the most famous enciphering equipment broken by the park, appear miles earlier. Bletchley Park is now a collection of museums which show how rapidly computing developed during the desperate years of war. In September 1940, former university student Mavis Lever used pencil and paper to make a key breakthrough in cracking Italy's naval cipher, contributing greatly to Britain's first major naval victory in the war, when it sank five Italian ships at Cape Matapan on 28 March 1941. To crack the Enigma field cipher machines, in March 1940, based on a design by Turing, the park introduced 'bombes', electro-mechanical machines that hugely speeded the checking of possible combinations after cryptanalysts had narrowed these down. The cryptanalysts prepared 'menus' – what they thought might be parts of the Enigma settings for the day – and the bombes ran the missing elements until (or if) they found a match. Now, a rebuilt bombe clatters away on the ground floor of the park's main museum, just past the largest public collection of Enigmas and Alan Turing's trousered teddy bear Porgy. But as a sign makes clear, the bombe is not a computer. Colossus is. A recreation of the world's first electronic semi-programmable computer fills much of a room at the National Museum of Computing, in Block H at the edge of the park. It took engineer Tommy Flowers 11 months to build the first Colossus at the Post Office research station at Dollis Hill in London, and is thought to have attacked its first message at Bletchley on 5 February 1944, looking for combinations used by Nazi Lorenz machines used to encipher teleprinter traffic (generated by machine, unlike the hand-tapped Morse code used to send Enigma messages). A second version went online just before D-Day, contributing to the 18,000 messages a day the park deciphered in the weeks following. After the war, the Colossi were used by the London forerunner of GCHQ, and remained secret until the 1970s. It has taken the museum nearly 15 years to rebuild one, on the site of the ninth original machine acquired by Bletchley Park. While a Colossus has been reconstructed, the museum's Witch is the real thing. Later this year, the museum hopes to reanimate the Harwell Dekatron, later renamed the Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computer from Harwell, which it believes will become the world's oldest working extant computer. The machine, already on show at the museum, was built in 1949 for the Harwell atomic power station in Oxfordshire. \"Its job was almost mundane – to produce mathematical tables,\" says trustee Kevin Murrell, a job that had previously fallen to teams of luckless graduates. In 1957, a college in Wolverhampton won a competition to take it on, and used it for many years, with local firm Chubb borrowing it to design key patterns. In 1973 it went to Birmingham's science museum, where Murrell saw it in as a teenager. Years later, he recognised its control panel in a photograph taken of something else by a colleague in a museum store. Later this year, Murrell hopes to reunite Witch's three designers, all of whom are still alive. As well as sheer age, the six foot high, nine foot long Witch is a fascinating machine. It uses Dekatrons made by Ericsson to calculate in decimal, rather than the binary transistors used by virtually all computers since. Its 90 'stores' (rows of Dekatrons) can each store eight 0-9 digits – equivalent to about 3 kilobytes of binary data – and each digit is visible through the position of a yellow light within each Dekatron. Having covered UK government's first uses of computing for military and research purposes, the museum also commemorates its first municipal use – in Norwich. In 1957 the city treasurers department spent £37,000 on an Elliott 405, with the option of an 80% discount if it returned it within a year. The museum has photos of deliverymen in white coats moving Fred (fiendishly rapid electronic device), higher than the men and covered with a drape reading 'Elliott Electronic Computer', down from a truck and towards a worryingly small door. And it has a later Elliott 803 among its collection, which is merely the size of several desks, with 16k of core memory in an eight-inch cube of metal and a further megabyte on a spool of familiar looking tape – it is magnetised 35mm Kodak camera film. When the museum's machine has successfully loaded software, it plays a tune to show it is working. Elliott, a British firm, also spawned the UK's first software house – when programmer Dina St Johnston, who had written the applications for the Norwich treasurers computer, left the firm to start a family, and in 1959 set up Vaughan Programming Services. The firm continued independently until 1996. The museum has numerous other treasures: an 8Mb three-foot wide hard disk that has recently served as a novelty coffee table; an Ericsson air traffic control screen installed in 1978 at West Drayton which needed two separate computers to run it; a five foot high black Cray Y-MP EL supercomputer with a massive red 'click here to launch the missiles' button on its top; and a Marconi computer the size of several large wardrobes, which used its 8k of memory to help run a nuclear power station at Wylfa on Anglesey from 1961… until 2004. A room dedicated to personal computers has the feel of a Curry's in a time-warp, with items such as a 1984 Apple Mac (128k for a cost of £1,600) and a Sinclair ZX81 (1k, but just £70 ready-assembled). There is also a wealth of products from Acorn, which fought its compatriot Sinclair to dominate British home computer manufacturing in the mid-1980s, including an entire room of working BBC Micros. The machines, built to the corporation's specifications to accompany its IT education work, were bought by most schools. The museum's learning co-ordinator Chris Monk used to teach in a room like this – and is now doing so again, with groups from schools, colleges and universities who are studying ICT skills or computer science, but are unused to computers that encourage – in fact, insist – users to program them. Monk says the BBCs, which when switched on are instantly ready to accept Basic computer code, were a great way to introduce students to programming. \"It's very accessible,\" he says. \"You couldn't hurt it. You couldn't damage it.

That is the warning from critics of the mines, ahead of the release of a government report on Friday on the potential impact of fresh mining. Mining has been banned within the Grand Canyon national park since President Roosevelt declared it a national monument in 1908. But since 2003, foreign companies have submitted 2,215 claims to prospect on the edge of the canyon. Ken Salazar, the secretary of the interior, temporarily withdrew 1m acres of land from exploration in 2009 to allow time for an environmental assessment. Salazar must decide by July whether to ban \"mineral entry\" for two-thirds of the claims for the next 20 years. Uranium deposits mineralise in 2,000-feet deep \"breccia\" pipes, a geological feature common to the world-famous golden brown sedimentary rock in the canyon. When left alone, the uranium is not harmful. But once dissolved in water, it can leach into springs and aquifers that then feed into the Colorado river, which ultimately supplies 18 million people in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The water can remain contaminated for decades after a mine shuts. Taylor McKinnon, campaigns director of public lands at the Centre for Biological Diversity, said the expansion of mining would threaten the park's delicate ecosystem that ranges from desert scrub in the parched canyon to the Californian condors that wheel above the craggy outcrops. He said: \"The Grand Canyon is an international treasure and known for its breathtaking expanses. Its isolated seeps, springs and caves harbour a remarkable diversity of life, including species found nowhere else on earth. Uranium mining puts those species in the crosshairs.\" Mining companies have been drawn to the Grand Canyon area since the 1940s, because of large quantities of high-grade uranium that fuelled the nuclear weapons and nuclear power industries in the US. But fast-paced nuclear power programmes in countries such as China and Korea are fuelling a new rush for \"hard rock\", and have sent uranium prices soaring from $7.10 a pound in 2001, to $63.88 a pound in 2011. Vane Minerals, a UK-based company, has submitted approximately 700 claims. Kristopher Hefton, the company's director and chief operating officer, said: \"The deposits are among the highest-grade deposits that you can find in the United States, so they are a good target for exploration and mining.\" Denison Mines, based in Canada, already operates one mine in the area with plans to reopen three further mines that were approved in the 1980s without being subject to the environmental review. Denison recently told investors that it will increase production by at least 10 million pounds a year by 2020, some of which will be destined for a new nuclear plant in the United Arab Emirates. Roger Clark, air and energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, said the post-gold rush General Mining Act of 1872 allowed the exploitation of public land to provide energy security in other countries and for foreign profit, while providing very little economic benefit to the US economy. He said: \"We're not building new nuclear power plants in this country and we haven't for 20 years.\" \"It's a net loss to the federal government. In these [tough] economic times, when hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent on this report, the mining companies are getting a service that they're not paying for. It's a rip-off.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/nov/14/minister-sorry-dangers-depleted-uranium","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-14T15:06:37Z","webTitle":"Armed forces minister sorry for misleading MPs over depleted uranium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/14/minister-sorry-dangers-depleted-uranium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/nov/14/minister-sorry-dangers-depleted-uranium","fields":{"headline":"Armed forces minister sorry for misleading MPs over depleted uranium","bodyText":"The armed forces minister has been forced to apologise over misleading statements he made regarding the legality and dangers of depleted uranium weapons. Nick Harvey admitted that he had inadvertently misled MPs about a Ministry of Defence review that he said had concluded the weapons were permissible on humanitarian and environmental grounds under the Geneva conventions. It subsequently emerged that the review had never happened, and Harvey has apologised for the error, which he said had been made \"in good faith\". He has ordered that a review into the weapons' legality be carried out by civil servants. The department is facing calls for the weapons to be suspended until it is completed. The revelations come as a cross-party campaign is launched to pile pressure on the MoD to phase out the use of depleted uranium (DU). The tank shells that depend on it have to be renewed in 2013. DU is a chemically toxic and radioactive heavy metal produced as waste by the nuclear power industry that is included in weapons because it is an extremely hard material capable of piercing armour. Once the frontline has moved on, however, it can contaminate the environment, and has been linked to health problems in civilian populations. The British army fired shells containing 2.3 tonnes of DU during the Gulf wars in 1990-91 and 2003. DU is used to harden 'Charm3' armour-piercing shells carried by British Challenger tanks. In 1998 the UK government ratified additional protocol 1 of the Geneva conventions. Article 36 of that requires that all weapons are subject to a legal review to assess whether they are \"capable of being used discriminately\", or cause \"widespread and severe damage to the natural environment\". In the past few years anti-DU campaigners have repeatedly been assured by the MoD that DU weapons had undergone such a review and been cleared. Most recently, on 10 October, Harvey wrote to the Labour MP Katy Clark saying that \"the conclusions of the original legal weapons review on Charm3 are extant\", and that \"DU can be used within weapons\". But when Clark then asked to see the review, Harvey said it did not actually exist. \"A subsequent search of departmental records has failed to find any such review,\" he told her on 26 October. \"Though incorrect, the statement in my letter was made in good faith on the advice of officials, and I apologise for the error.\" Harvey added: \"In the circumstances, and given the concerns that have been expressed over DU, I have directed that a legal review should be carried out to establish the position clearly.\" Clark accused the MoD of misleading the public, and demanded a public apology. \"Compliance with the Geneva conventions has been used to reassure people on the legality of DU weapons, however no review has taken place to ensure that the munitions used by UK armed forces meet the conventions' criteria,\" she said. \"I am pleased that the government has stated that a review will now take place and believe it should use this opportunity to carry out a detailed study into the long term impact of DU use.\" Clark is one of the sponsors of an early day motion in the House of Commons calling on ministers to stop using DU weapons before Charm3 expires in 2013. The motion is backed by other Labour, Liberal and nationalist MPs, as well as the Conservative MPs Peter Bottomley and Zac Goldsmith. Aneaka Kellay from the Campaign against Depleted Uranium, called for Charm3 to be immediately removed from service until its risks had been legally reviewed. \"We find it extremely disappointing that the MoD has misled parliamentarians and the public,\" she said. \"It seems bizarre that, given the long history of justified concerns over the potential health and environmental impact of these weapons, assessing whether they may be illegal was not prioritised before they entered service.\" The MoD argued that it did not need to review weapons that predated its ratification of the Geneva protocol in 1998. But campaigners pointed out that Charm3 entered into service in 1999 as a modification of an earlier DU shell. According to Prof Manfred Mohr, from the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, munitions should be subject to a legal review when they are modified. \"It is therefore surprising that the UK failed to adequately review the legality of Charm3,\" he said. The MoD made clear it would continue to retain its DU capability and was \"considering options\" for renewing the Charm3 propelling charges in 2013. But because of \"public concerns\" it had begun a legal review. \"The use of depleted uranium within weapons is not prohibited under international agreements,\" said a spokeswoman. \"Until the review concludes, our position remains unchanged.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/dec/19/north-korea-peace","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-19T16:40:13Z","webTitle":"Time to make peace with North Korea | Robert Willoughby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/19/north-korea-peace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/19/north-korea-peace","fields":{"headline":"Time to make peace with North Korea","bodyText":"The death of North Korea's Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, has thrown up one certainty, that now more than ever we in the west can bring stability to the Korean peninsula by finally making peace with Pyongyang. It's reported that Kim's death has made for much uncertainty about the state and region. Predictably, missiles have been fired into the water, but we will be shown a sea of tears in Pyongyang rather than a sea of fire on Seoul, nor is any civil implosion likely. Open opposition to the regime in North Korea essentially doesn't exist. While many tens of thousands have risked their lives by wading across the border rivers with China, North Korea lacks the critical mass of opposition, and the communication infrastructure, to precipitate an Arab spring in Pyongyang. For all the talk of its \"collapsing economy\", the North Korean state is in fact incredibly resilient. It's survived decades of being on a semi-war footing with South Korea and the US, economic and diplomatic isolation and sanctions, famine, global opprobrium for its nuclear bomb programme, and the death of Kim Il-sung. What North Korea does best is survive, and it will continue to do so under the 20-something Kim Jong-un. That said, as often overlooked in any analysis of the north are the 24 million souls trying to survive there, human beings too often portrayed in the west as brainwashed automatons slavishly revering the dead presidents, and therefore we're less bothered when they die from famines of food and fuel that western sanctions do much to bring about. We were told that the regime, under the aegis of a madman, put its own survival first and directed resources primarily into the military. But what else would it do, when it's not at peace with either South Korea nor the hyperpower US? For all that, the west must realise that threats and throttling sanctions just don't work and take this chance to leave all the blame for the past with the dead man and his personality cult, and offer aid, trade and peace with the North Koreans, nukes or not. It's not a question of \"rewarding Pyongyang's bad behaviour\", nor appeasing the regime, nor need the efficacy of any existing structure monitoring any dealings with dangerous arms or nuclear components be compromised by peace. Anyway, it has been a nuclear power for some years and the sky hasn't fallen on anyone – not least as Beijing won't allow it. It should be remembered that the north reprised its nuclear bomb programme following claims that it had already done so from George W Bush neocons, who had already reneged on a long-standing deal for North Korea to mothball its nuclear reactors in exchange for light-water technology and fuel oil from the US. They listed the north on the \"axis of evil\", and didn't even bother to produce a dodgy dossier about Pyongyang's bomb-making, while invading the Middle East on lies. You'd be crazy not to make a bomb in the face of such aggression. But worse was that the whole atomic fracas did so much damage to years of diplomatic and economic progress in bringing North Korea in from the cold and in touch with the world, first and foremost with South Korea and the US. During the 1990s, South Korea under Kim Dae-jung, with the blessing of the Clinton administration, offered the north the \"sunshine policy\" of rapprochement and investment, and the north, under Kim Jong-il, eagerly took it up. Pyongyang's nuclear bomb programme stopped. The anti-US propaganda stopped. Diplomatic and trade relations were founded with the EU and the UK. The North Korean people, those people who just want to have enough to feed their families and have a beer with friends, who go on picnics, and lie in the park looking at the sky – ordinary people like us but whose elders still weep for Kim Il-sung and who simply happen to live in an extraordinary state on the edge of the world – genuinely believed a new age of peace was burgeoning before the Washington neocons dashed the lot. Yet, amid the ensuing sabre-rattling, billions of South Korean won were still invested into building factories and tourist facilities in North Korea. Parts of the world's most heavily fortified frontier, the de-militarised zone, have been de-mined and tourist buses have crossed south to north where tanks fear to trundle. As it is, hopes are that South Korea's free trade deal with the EU will be cemented by rail links running via Pyongyang. And just last week, officials from the US and North Korea met to talk about the US delivering food aid, with no strings attached to the north's bomb programme. Add peace to the bargain, and let Obama end the war with North Korea as well as Iraq. The precedents have long been set that working with Pyongyang pays off, and aid and trade would at the very least give some deliverance to the suffering populace. Now's the time to make the death of Kim Jong-il the greatest event in the history of North Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2011/jun/12/hugh-osmond-buys-temporary-power-generator-apr-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-11T23:07:49Z","webTitle":"Hugh Osmond buys temporary power generator APR Energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/12/hugh-osmond-buys-temporary-power-generator-apr-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/jun/12/hugh-osmond-buys-temporary-power-generator-apr-energy","fields":{"headline":"Hugh Osmond buys temporary power generator APR Energy","bodyText":"The buyout vehicle set up by British entrepreneur Hugh Osmond has spent £850m buying a US energy company that plans to expand the market for international temporary power generation services. Osmond's company, Horizon, which was listed on the London market last year, will take a 60% stake in APR Energy, a Florida-based firm that specialises in supplying generators to developing-world countries and regions suffering temporary electricity shortages such as the tsunami-hit region of Japan. The deal follows an injection of cash earlier this year from George Soros's hedge fund, Quantum Strategic Partners, and Albright Capital Management, the investment vehicle of the former US secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The company plans to expand its fleet of power generators to compete with its larger listed rival, Aggreko. It is understood that APR was generating 30% return on capital and strong cash flow, but had struggled to find the funds to invest in new and more expensive machinery. Developing-world countries are struggling to meet the demand for electricity and have increasingly sought temporary generators while large energy plants are under contruction. APR has also signed contracts in Japan to supply generators to fill the gap in supply left by the collapse of the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Founder and chief executive John Campion and co-founder Laurence Anderson will see their holding cut from 25% to 10% while Quantum and Albright will own 30% of the shares. Campion founded Show Power, a power rental business for high-profile events, in 1987 and sold that business to General Electric in 2000.

Banks might not be flavour of the month, but if they invest in the right things, that's good. And there are any number of projects that would benefit the environment, yet struggle to raise backing from conventional financial institutions. Many environmental campaigners had been calling for a green bank for years. So this is an initiative we can welcome, right? Well, politics is a funny world. Even when you think they've listened, and the words they use are just the ones you'd have chosen yourself, it's always best to check the small print. And with the coalition's version of a green investment bank, testing each word is an education in sophistry. Let's start with the word \"bank\". We all know what a bank is: it borrows and lends money (and may or may not also pay its senior executives millions in bonuses for being clever enough to manage this complex transaction). Except that it's not at all clear that this bank can borrow or lend. Without these powers, it would be a fund – that is, a pot of money that, once used up, is gone forever. Maybe something still to be welcomed, but not a bank that can recycle the money it receives and so invest it again and again, producing far more benefit over the long term. How about the word \"green\"? The way businesses sometimes stick \"green\" on the front of things they want to flog is definitely in the \"don't get me started\" category. But here, surely, the green investment bank will invest in new green projects: reducing energy consumption and waste, supporting clean energy generation, or backing \"lean\" technologies that use less raw materials in manufacturing. Projects that may be just on the edge of being viable, say, or have a risk element that puts off traditional investors. Projects a bank that offers good interest rates on loans, and understands the sector, could really benefit from. But there are signs the coalition is considering allowing its green investment bank to fund nuclear power. Even if you think nuclear could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it's still a bit rich to call it \"green\", given the huge question of waste. And it certainly isn't a new technology. Plus, the huge costs of a nuclear power station would quickly eat up the funds available in the Bank for other projects. Any commercial pay-back for nuclear is likely to take decades to emerge. And crucially, using the bank in this way would undermine the coalition's pledge not to use public money to subsidise nuclear. Fortunately, I'm not alone in having concerns about the way the bank might develop. And to be fair to the coalition, they still have the chance to confirm that it will have the power to lend and borrow, and sufficient capitalisation to make a significant impact on the backlog of important pro-environment projects. They can also confirm that it will not be funding nuclear projects. But perhaps what we need most is the right board for this new bank. Not the kind of board we've seen at some other banks I could name – presiding over mismanagement and the creation of huge toxic debts and ignoring their vital role in society, all the while trousering unjustified salaries and bonuses. We want a board of people who understand finance, but also industry, society and the environment. Who are on the board to ensure it invests in the right ways: not to maximise profits, but to meet its environmental and social potential and responsibilities and so generate a greater return for our country than profits alone can ever do. Get that right, and the bank could be one that all of us can be proud of – no matter what it's called. • Caroline Lucas is the leader of the Green party of England and Wales and the country's first Green member of parliament"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/jan/04/emissions-trading-working-civitas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-04T17:50:28Z","webTitle":"Emissions trading is the right approach, despite what Civitas says | Damien Morris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/04/emissions-trading-working-civitas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/04/emissions-trading-working-civitas","fields":{"headline":"Emissions trading is the right approach, despite what Civitas says","bodyText":"A report released by the thinktank Civitas on Tuesday paints a damning portrait of Europe's flagship climate policy, the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). The scheme, which polices roughly half the carbon emissions in Europe, was designed to help governments meet their climate goals by devolving responsibility to large polluters in the private sector. At the start of each year governments distribute a limited number of tradeable carbon certificates, and at the end of the year compliant factories and power stations are required to surrender certificates equivalent to the amount of CO2 they have emitted. Civitas claims that the EU's trading scheme is a needlessly expensive and ineffective means to combat climate change, that it places an undue burden on consumers and businesses, and that it serves chiefly to line the pockets of greedy energy suppliers. In each of these respects, Civitas contradicts our own findings: at Sandbag, we have found emissions trading delivers carbon reductions at lowest cost, minimises the burden on consumers and businesses, and that the electricity sector has consistently shouldered the greatest effort under the scheme. The problem with the EU trading scheme is relatively straightforward: an over-supply of carbon permits. The recession, as well as new overlapping policies, has reduced emissions below the pollution ceiling set by EU governments. This has eliminated any net demand for carbon permits until 2015 or beyond. Weak demand has in turn depressed the carbon price to its current low of €7 – roughly a third of where it stood only four years ago – and analysts expect it to languish there until 2020 without urgent political intervention. But that doesn't mean the scheme is completely flawed. Encouragingly, several options for adjusting the supply of permits have been provisionally approved by the EU environment committee and will again be voted upon by the industry committee later this month. But for Civitas, this is unwelcome news. While it acknowledges that the current carbon price is insufficient to drive essential investment in low-carbon technologies, it also argues that reducing the supply of permits will only serve to drive British and European companies to regions with weaker climate policies. In saying this Civitas both exaggerates the level of international competition facing most companies covered by the scheme, and underplays the special protections companies have already been granted: in the current trading period (2008-2012), every single industrial sector in Europe has been awarded more permits than were required. Only the electricity sector faced a shortfall and had to buy carbon permits from auctions and the open market. Civitas contends that the UK should renege on its commitments under both the trading scheme and the government's renewables obligation, and replace these with a carbon tax used to fund low-carbon electricity generation – specifically nuclear power. We wholeheartedly agree that decarbonising the power sector should be prioritised, but so far as we can tell, this is what has been happening all along, without government picking winners in advance. In fact, the story of the trading scheme to date has been one of the power sector undertaking all of the effort, purchasing some 934 megatonnes of carbon to meet its shortfalls, but failing to achieve any actual reductions due to 856 megatonnes of undeserved surplus permits in the industrial sectors that Civitas appears so keen to protect. Over the forthcoming trading period (2013-2020), the electricity sector will purchase all of its pollution permits at auction, while industrial companies will continue to receive up to 100% of their permits for free depending on their exposure to international competition and their carbon efficiency compared with their European competitors. This still leaves the question of how competitively exposed industries shoulder the indirect carbon costs contained, but the emissions trading directive entitles member states to compensate such industries where necessary, and indeed the chancellor's autumn statement announced a generous support package to do exactly this. Some of the most cynical messaging in Civitas's report relates to aviation. Coverage in the Telegraph proclaimed the ETS will increase the price of a family trip to America by £80 next year, rising to £130 in 2020, and risks making Heathrow and other European airports uncompetitive. But these estimates assume that airlines will pass on the cost of the 85% of permits they have received for free to the consumer – something which should be impossible for a competitively exposed industry wishing to retain market share. It also assumes that the cost of carbon will grow up to 2020, which is unlikely to happen without a political adjustment to the supply of carbon that would restore the environmental integrity of the scheme. The European commission currently estimates the extra cost of a transatlantic flight will be less than €2 per passenger. The successful inclusion of aviation in the EU's trading scheme is a great political achievement, not only because it will start to control one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions, but because it helps evangelise carbon regulations to parts of the world that have so far been reluctant to shoulder them. This is an achievement the Durban platform does not aspire to until 2020. Flights between Europe and other parts of the world can gain exemption from the ETS if equivalent measures for controlling carbon are in place. The principle is one of non-discrimination between European and non-European airlines. Given Civitas's acute concerns about competitiveness, it should be applauding the EU for its clever construction of this policy; instead its merits are submerged within the wider tide of the thinktank's remorseless pessimism towards emissions trading. • This article was amended on 5 January 2012.

Janez Potocnik said he had issued a \"final warning\" to Britain, which had agreed to new rules but not implemented them. \"All national governments signed up to these regulations and it is in everyone's interests that the quality of life in a country is preserved. If anyone thinks we are happy with infringements then they are terribly mistaken,\" he said. Under European law citizens have the right to know about the impact of industrial pollution and about their potential effects on the environment. The EC first warned the UK in October 2007 that its system for reviewing decisions on the environment were \"prohibitively expensive\" and individuals or campaign groups felt unable to mount legitimate court challenges against public bodies for fear of the financial impact of losing. The EC warning comes at a critical time: the problems of democratic accountability over decisions that affect the environment are set to soar as both Labour and the Conservatives have promised to streamline planning decisions so new nuclear and other power plants can be built faster. The commissioner, a farmer's son from Slovenia, also called for a shake-up of the EU's common agricultural policy so farmers and businesses would gain subsidies only if they took on a far wider stewardship role and adopted a \"greener\" agenda. He said it was time Europe focused on \"resource efficiency\" as much as energy efficiency to improve land quality and create a more sustainable way of life. Farmers are already paid for adhering to environmental regulations on top of food production subsidies but Potocnik wants a more comprehensive settlement. \"If we really care about key issues such as water, quality of soil and biodiversity then we really need to look after them,\" he said. \"Who is best to do that? The people already working on that land … they should do a good public service, which would be helpful for each of us and therefore they should be paid for that public service just like people are paid for such service in towns. \"Also public awareness of environmental concerns [is] very high … I think a common agricultural policy that took into account that [environmental] angle would more easily get the support and understanding of people. It is something they would prefer to see so that quality of life could be kept for the future,\" he said.\" Potocnik accepted that he alone could not change the controversial CAP, which costs the EU about £35bn a year, but had already started a debate with the agricultural commissioner and others in the European commission on the topic. Potocnik claimed he had received fairly positive responses to the idea of a \"common agricultural and environmental policy\". Vicki Hird, of Friends of the Earth, praised the environment commissioner for his innovative ideas but said a future compact with the farming community also needed to cover social and health goals alongside the environment and agriculture: \"We would definitely go along with that. We need to get away from food mountains and the race for the bottom and create a more sustainable future.\" Potocnik said he wanted to make resource efficiency a central plank of his work to get away from an undue concentration on \"eco-innovation\" by a few forward-looking companies and concentrate on greening the entire business sector: \"We need cleaner industry in general, not just cleaning up industries.\" This is all part of a sustainable world that used its resources much more carefully, whether they were material ones such as metals or natural ones such as clean air and water, he believes. And it should all be done as part of a wider framework that decouples economic growth from the use of scarce resources, he argues. \"It's a compelling idea that we have continued economic growth whilst managing sustainably our resources. But it's one that makes complete sense,\" said Potocnik. \"If you plot on a graph the most competitive countries in Europe against the most resource-efficient countries in Europe … there is a positive correlation.\" Potocnik took up the environment job on 9 February after six years as science and research commissioner.

Nuclear power mines the radionucleides, concentrates them, sends them critical and then wonders what to do with the leftover mess - not very elegant by comparison. The coalition government has pledged that nuclear power will receive no taxpayer subsidies. But it can receive financial support by other means which are subsidies in all but name. So what support is there for deep geothermal projects? Nothing. As Tim Smit - founder of the Eden project where one of just two projects in the UK is sited - put it last night at a Renewable Energy Association event in Westminster: \"I'd like the same 'lack of support' the government is giving to nuclear.\" Geothermal energy has been tapped in the UK since Roman times, via the hot springs at Bath and elsewhere. Shallow geothermal projects - such as ground source heat pumps - are slowly growing. But even Decc's own and very conservative estimate is that deep geothermal - a few kilometres down - could provide 10% of the UK's electricity. And how! It runs 24 hours a day, so perfect for baseload. The water circulates in a closed-loop, so it's clean and sustainable. It is virtually zero carbon and the plants have a small surface footprint, so it's pretty nimby-proof. The catch is this: you'd be awfully brave to invest in it right now. Unlike most European nations, there is no licensing system in the UK. So you could sink your test wells at the cost of millions of pounds, find the right spot, then see someone else set up in the next field. There is no feed-in tariff support for electricity from geothermal. And the Renewable Obligation Certificates (Roc) support scheme is set at 2 Rocs, compared to the equivalent of 4 Rocs in Germany. It's a familiar tale of German succes and British failure. Germany itself lags the leaders, the US and the Philippines, as well as El Salvador, Kenya and Papua New Guinea, but is the fastest growing in the world. It has about 150 projects in planning this year, representing a total investment of €4 billion, says Ryan Law, from Geothermal Engineering, which is developing the UK's other current project near Redruth, Cornwall. In terms of plants, Munich already has 24 alone, for both heating and electricity, he told me, adding that the geothermal potential for both countries is more or less the same. Germany has invested about €10m a year in geothermal research since 2002: the coalition government cut in half the available funds to £1m and there is nothing more in the pipeline. What is the government afraid of? The tiny earthquakes that some geothermal plants have triggered are surely less worrying than piles of nuclear waste, particularly in seismically stable country like the UK. I'll declare an interest: I used to be a geologist and I like geothermal's style. It is simple and proven. And it has all of the advantages of the nuclear power coveted by successive governments, but none of the problems. And while the nuclear industry will benefit handsomely from low-carbon energy incentives, geothermal stands to get next to nothing. If there was ever a time to hold our minister's feet to a renewable fire, this is it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/09/iea-energy-outlook-carbon-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-09T10:02:00Z","webTitle":"The burning issue of energy can't wait for economic good times | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/09/iea-energy-outlook-carbon-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/09/iea-energy-outlook-carbon-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"The burning issue of energy cannot wait for economic good times","bodyText":"The house is ablaze and we are throwing bucket after bucket at it - buckets of petrol. Worse, if that is possible, the world's politicians are not stepping in to stop us stoking the flames: instead they are helping us pay for the petrol. That simple, devastating analogy captures entirely the current global action on climate change. Despite warnings from scientists that have been clear for years, the globe is not curbing its carbon emissions: they are rising by record amounts. We are not even getting more efficient in our use of fossil fuels to power our economies, we are now getting worse. And the rising subsidies poured into fossil fuels swamp those for clean energy by six to one. The previous charge made against the world's leaders - you are not moving forward fast enough - failed to spark action. Will the new message - you are now reversing at speed towards a hellish future - change that? The UN negotiations on a global climate change agreement, reconvening in Durban shortly, will be the first test of whether this new reality has sunk in. But, with tackling global warming tumbling down the agenda with politicians transfixed by economic crisis, the omens are gloomy. The new warning this Wednesday from the International Energy Agency, a deeply conservative organisation, could not be more stark. Unless we shift the global energy supertanker off its current, dirty course by 2017, we will have locked in enough greenhouse gas pollution to condemn the world to a temperature rise above the 2C deemed \"safe\" by governments. Yet the best aspirations for Durban look utterly inadequate. UK's climate change minister Greg Barker recently said having a global climate deal ready to \"click in\" by 2020 was realistic. The IEA predict a temperature rise of 3.5C if current energy policies around the world are delivered but no more. That means a future world of mass migration, severe water shortages and England having the summer climate of Morocco today. If those policies fail to materialise, the IEA predicts 6C. That's Armageddon: large parts of the planet uninhabitable and the risk of runaway warming threatening the rest. So what to do? The IEA says the wide difference between these scenarios and one that limits warming to 2C \"underlines the critical role of governments to define the objectives and implement the policies necessary to shape our energy future.\" The current silence on tackling the energy crisis and climate change from Prime Minister David Cameron and the antipathy from Chancellor George Osborne is simply shameful. The investment needed for a clean energy future is already huge and is made yet more expensive by political uncertainty. With the economies of developed nations stagnant, some are pleading poverty as an excuse for inaction. But, says the IEA, \"delaying action is a false economy\". It states that avoiding $1 of energy investment before 2020 will require $4.30 to compensate after that date. If money needs to be saved, start with the $409bn gifted to the fossil fuel industry in 2010 in subsidies. The G20 backed this idea in 2009 but has yet to deliver. The subsidies do not enable the impoverished to access energy: just 8% of the subsidies reach the world's poorest 20% of people. Renewable energy, the only truly sustainable source of power, received just $66bn of support last year, and even the IEA thinks this will rise to no more than $180bn by 2035. There's plenty more that ought to spur action in the IEA report. It predicts the oil cartel Opec will get more powerful and Russia will be confirmed as the \"cornerstone\" of the world's energy economy, with all that implies for energy security in importing countries. The IEA also foresees a \"golden age of gas\", replete with environmental challenges and with 20% coming from the fracking of shale. The UK's first planned carbon capture and storage demonstration plant may have collapsed in farce, but making CCS technology work by the 2020s is critical, says the IEA. \"If not,\" says the report, \"an extraordinary burden would rest on other low-carbon technologies.\" New nuclear power plants must be built, the IEA says, especially in emerging economies. The IEA acknowledges some \"steps in the right direction\", but the central message is a deafening alarm. If you thought that tackling the red-hot issue of cleaning up energy now was tantamount to burning money, you ain't seen nothing yet. Without urgent and transformative action, today's conflagrations will seem like stray sparks compared to the wildfires to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/may/17/carbon-budget-greenest-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-17T15:33:26Z","webTitle":"Carbon budget: Could this be the greenest government ever? | Caroline Lucas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/may/17/carbon-budget-greenest-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/may/17/carbon-budget-greenest-government","fields":{"headline":"Carbon budget: Could this be the greenest government ever?","bodyText":"It seems a deal has finally been brokered on the UK's long-term climate change targets, with an announcement expected this afternoon from the energy and climate change secretary committing the UK to a 50% cut in greenhouse gases – compared with 1990 levels – by 2025. The bitter divisions in the cabinet over whether to accept the advice of Lord Turner's independent Committee on Climate Change and commit to a fourth carbon budget are incredibly revealing. The Treasury and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) reportedly mounted the greatest resistance to this pillar of existing climate policy, making a mockery of George Osborne's pre-general election claim that, under his chancellorship, the Treasury would be \"a green ally, not a foe\". A positive decision on climate targets is certainly welcome, and it's a good news story for a coalition which has so far failed to impress with its shambolic environmental policy – so naturally the prime minister is keen to take credit. The idea, though, that a principled intervention from David Cameron saved the day rings a little hollow. Since pledging that the coalition would be \"the greenest government ever\" and posturing as the \"fourth minister\" at Decc, Cameron has shown little interest in green policy and the sustainability agenda. Even his new environmental adviser, a former policy director for BP's now defunct Alternative Energy – and commended for the No 10 post by Lord Browne, former BP chief executive, no less – comes with a health warning. And the truth is that signing up to the fourth carbon budget is the very least this Conservative-led administration should be doing. The previous government accepted all of the three previous carbon budgets set out by the CCC and the coalition is bound by law under the Climate Change Act to set this fourth by the end of June. That this legally binding element was ever in any danger hints at the level of scepticism amongst the government's biggest players. Furthermore, the coalition is set to ignore CCC advice to toughen up the existing targets for 2013-2023. And campaigners are rightly concerned that a concessionary review clause in the fourth budget, set for 2014, could allow the government to backtrack on its promises. Perhaps worst of all, it appears that the government is also disregarding the committee's advice that the budget should be met through domestic action alone. Allowing the use of trading mechanisms such as offsetting essentially means outsourcing our emission reduction responsibilities to other countries – and will weaken the drive to achieve more green technologies and industries, with all the jobs those would bring, here in the UK. The dramatic politicking over the fourth budget – which ironically will cost Cameron nothing in this parliamentary term – comes precisely a year after the formation of the coalition. Ultimately, actions speak louder than targets, so what of the Lib Dem-Conservative environmental record so far? To be the greenest government ever isn't a particularly ambitious goal, given Labour's record on the environment. While the Climate Act was undoubtedly a milestone achievement, road building under Labour increased, aviation grew, Britain languished at the bottom of the EU's record on renewable energy, and fossil fuel use actually rose. Perhaps the coalition was mindful of the fact that Labour didn't set the bar too high when it decided, just a few weeks into its new term, to scrap the very body designed to measure its environmental performance – the Sustainable Development Commission. A strong and independent voice providing well-informed scrutiny of government policy, the SDC worked towards mainstreaming sustainability throughout Whitehall. Ministers insist that the independent monitoring and scrutiny role can now be fulfilled by the Environmental Audit Committee, on which I sit. But its chair and its members strongly disagree, since the capacity and the resources are simply not there. The government has also ignored advice, including from the EAC, to make the cabinet responsible for mainstreaming and embedding sustainable development across all departments – instead giving that role to Defra, ensuring that it continues to be perceived as a marginal environmental issue. The \"green investment bank\" is next on the list of coalition disappointments, as perhaps the most inappropriately named government initiative to date – given that it is neither very green nor a fully fledged bank, as I've noted before. This squandered opportunity to lever sufficient capital to help everything else in the low-carbon economy get going says much about the government's lack of vision on green policy. Not only is the government actively considering using the bank to subsidise nuclear power, the bank's wings are being clipped from the outset by insufficient capitalisation and no initial borrowing capacity. So rather than unlocking the £450bn in finance for renewable energy and the low carbon infrastructure needed in the next 15 years, the bank's impact will, initially at least, be limited to the original £3bn funding. The government's seeming determination to back nuclear power and channel taxpayers' money into the industry without having to publicly renege on the \"no subsidy for nuclear\" coalition pledge manifests itself in imaginative ways. The proposed electricity market reform, for example, has the potential to help update our ageing energy infrastructure and facilitate urgently needed investment in renewables. But, as the committee pointed out in a report yesterday, ministers have failed to be upfront about the fact that nuclear is set to benefit massively – especially from the carbon floor price, which at £30 a tonne, would give nuclear power companies a windfall subsidy of anything from £1.3bn to £3bn over 13 years. And while the government remains in thrall to nuclear, uncertainty over renewables seems inevitable. The extraordinary U-turn on feed-in tariffs, for instance, left the solar industry reeling in shock. The government's decision to indicate it will slash financial support to solar over 50 kW has effectively pulled the rug out from under the industry, creating significant investment uncertainty in one of the few industries to have created thousands of new jobs. Also falling short of expectations was the energy bill, presented to parliament for its second reading last week by the energy and climate change secretary. Despite some significant statements of ambition on improving energy efficiency in housing and positive moves to address standards in the private rented sector through the green deal, the proposals lacked detail, joined-up thinking and realistic strategies to deliver on the scale really needed to address fuel poverty and reduce climate emissions. Meanwhile, coalition pledges to enhance and protect our natural environment have been completely undermined by a considerably weakened Defra – most clearly illustrated by the debacle over the reckless, ideologically motivated plans to sell off the nation's woodland and forests. It's clear that some in the coalition are more committed to a greener economy than others. But the overwhelming impression of government policy is unambitious and incoherent. If it's not actively challenging the principles of green politics – lumping essential legislation such as the Climate Change Act into its \"red tape challenge\", for example – the government is refocusing the political debate in favour of deregulation in order to return the economy to an unsustainable \"business as usual\". Despite all this, could this still be the greenest government ever? In the words of George Eliot: \"It is never too late to become what you might have been\". But the prime minister and his colleagues must start showing real political leadership on the environment and commit to ambitious policy reforms – otherwise this government's legacy will be a failure to realise the UK's significant potential as a leading green economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/mar/09/fukushima-residents-plagued-health-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-09T13:55:50Z","webTitle":"Fukushima residents plagued by health fears of nuclear threat in their midst","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/09/fukushima-residents-plagued-health-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/mar/09/fukushima-residents-plagued-health-fears","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima residents plagued by health fears of nuclear threat in their midst","bodyText":"The noise levels soar inside Fukushima city's youth centre gymnasium as dozens of nursery school children are let loose on bouncy castles and pits filled with plastic balls. The handful of teachers and volunteers on duty are in forgiving mood: for the past year, the Fukushima nuclear accident has robbed these children of the simple freedom to run around. Instead, anxious parents and teachers have confined them to their homes and classrooms, while scientists debate the possible effects of prolonged exposure to low-level radiation on their health. \"Many parents won't let their children play outside, even in places where the radiation isn't that high,\" said Koji Nomi of the Fukushima chapter of the Japanese Red Cross, which organised the event. \"Unless they have the opportunity to run around, their physical strength is at risk of deteriorating. \"That in turn puts them at risk of succumbing to stress. Some are allowed to play outside for short periods every day, but that's not enough.\" Hundreds of thousands of children in the area have been living with similar restrictions since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's triple meltdown last March, sending radioactive particles over a wide area. The immediate threat of a catastrophic release has passed, but residents of several towns, including those outside the 12-mile (20km) exclusion zone, say they live in fear of the invisible threat in their midst. Kumiko Abe and her family evacuated from Iitate, 39km from the power plant, weeks after the accident after a study by Tetsuji Imanaka, an associate professor of nuclear engineering at the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute, found unusually high pockets of radiation in the village. They now live in private accommodation in Fukushima city, but Abe says she continues to take precautions to protect her nine-year-old daughter, Momoe. \"We have stopped eating rice grown by my husband's parents, and I never buy locally grown vegetables,\" Abe, 46, said. \"I started buying imported meat, and we drink only bottled water. I try not to hang out laundry on windy days ... I'd like to be able to air our futons, but I can't.\" Her concerns centre on her daughter, who has a tiny lump on her thyroid gland. Doctors have assured her it is benign. \"Even though they say there's nothing to worry about I'd like her to have more frequent tests,\" Abe said. Her anxiety is compounded by conflicting messages from experts about the risk of exposure to low-level radiation. Shunichi Yamashita, a professor at Fukushima Medical University who acts as an adviser on radiation risk management to the local government, angered parents when he said exposure to 100 millisieverts a year – the level recommended for nuclear plant workers in an emergency – was safe, even for children. He has since claimed that his comments were taken out of context. A cumulative dosage of 100 millisieverts a year over a person's lifetime increases the risk of dying from cancer by 0.5%, according to the International Commission of Radiological Protection. No study has linked cancer development to exposure at below that level, but there is agreement that the Fukushima case is unprecedented. Much of the unease stems from the wildly varying levels of radiation recorded in the same areas: in parts of Fukushima outside the evacuation zone, readings vary from negligible to as high as 50 millisieverts a year. Normally, the Japanese are exposed to about 1 millisievert of background radiation a year. The emergence of thyroid cancers in children living near Chernobyl is on many parents' minds, despite UN data showing that exposure to radioactive iodine, an established cause of the condition, was much lower in Fukushima. Campaigners said this week that Japan's government had been too slow to providing health checks and information to residents. \"A year on, we are really not seeing basic health services being offered in an accessible way and we are not seeing accurate, consistent, non-contradictory information being disclosed to people on a regular basis,\" Jane Cohen, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, told Reuters. \"People have to at least be equipped with accurate information so that they are evaluating their situation based on real facts.\" The government has tried to ease health concerns with the launch of a testing programme in Fukushima prefecture that will include 360,000 children aged up to 18. They will undergo thyroid checks every two years until they are 20, and every five years thereafter. In all, 2 million residents will be screened over the next 30 years, but so far only a fraction of those eligible have been tested. Serious threats \"Our children have all been wearing glass badges [to measure radiation absorption], but only a few of them have been screened,\" said Mitsue Shiga, a teacher at a kindergarten in Fukushima city's Watari suburb. \"We don't allow the children to play outside at all.\" Medical professionals in the area say they lack the specialist equipment to quickly test and reassure residents. \"We have just one whole body radiation counter, but we need three,\" said Tomoyoshi Oikawa, assistant director of Minamisoma municipal general hospital. Anti-nuclear campaigners accused the authorities of putting children's health at risk by ignoring calls to help women and young people leave at-risk areas outside the evacuation zone. \"We are finding that radioactive contamination is concentrating in many places, creating hot spots that pose serious threats to health and safety,\" said Jan van de Putte, Greenpeace's radiation expert. \"These spots are worryingly located in densely populated areas, but people do not have support or even the right to relocate, and decontamination work is patchy and inadequate at best.\" According to preliminary estimates, the doses of radiation received by people living near the nuclear facility were probably too small to have much of an effect on health, even among those who were in the vicinity during the meltdowns. But the relatively small doses measured so far could pose problems for long-term attempts to properly gauge the Fukushima effect. \"There is no opportunity for conducting epidemiological studies that have any chance of success,\" John Boice, the incoming president of the US national council on radiation protection and measurements, said recently. \"The doses are just too low. If you were to do a proposal, it would not pass scientific review.\" For a more comprehensive assessment of the accident's impact on health, Fukushima residents will have to wait for the UN scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation to publish its findings in May 2013. Iitate residents say the conflicting information has left them confused and fearful about the future. \"Young children were living in the village for months after the meltdown,\" said Toru Anzai, a rice farmer who now lives in temporary housing on the outskirts of Fukushima city said: \"We're being treated like lab rats. The authorities should have told us as soon as they knew the reactors had melted down and helped us leave immediately. That's why people here are so angry.\" Anecdotal evidence suggests that fear of radiation, rather than contamination, is triggering stress-related problems among evacuees. A handful of children from Iitate suffered nosebleeds, despite having no history of the condition, and blotches on their skin, according to Anzai, who says he has had stomach pains, pins and needles and hair loss since last spring. Tadateru Konoe, president of the Japanese Red Cross, said parents from Fukushima were living in an \"information vacuum\". Abe was dismissive of promises by Iitate's mayor that the village would be decontaminated and that some residents would be able to move back in the next few years: \"I have a young child so I don't think I'll ever go back. There will always be some contamination left, especially in the mountains. It's no place to bring up a child.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/mar/05/iaea-iran-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-05T09:26:00Z","webTitle":"IAEA meets to consider action on Iran's nuclear programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/mar/05/iaea-iran-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/mar/05/iaea-iran-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"IAEA meets to consider action on Iran's nuclear programme","bodyText":"Member states of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) begin a week-long meeting today focused on the debate over Iran's nuclear programme, at a time when it threatens to become the casus belli in a new Middle East war. A day after President Obama told the main American Jewish lobby it was time for a pause in the near constant sabre-rattling of recent months while stressing that the US would use force if it deems it necessary, the outcome of the IAEA board of governors meeting will help set the tone for the next few tense months. The quarterly meeting at the agency headquarters in Vienna will also assess nuclear issues in Syria and North Korea as well as performing some IAEA housekeeping duties, but the gorilla in the boardroom today and for most of the week will be the report by the agency's director general, Yukiya Amano, on Iran's compliance or lack thereof. That report, which leaked some days ago, follows a visit to Tehran by a team of IAEA officials last month, which did not go well. The team went to Tehran for the second time in less than a month in search of answers to questions the IAEA has on evidence, supplied by other member states and collected by its own experts, that suggests that Iran had a significant weapons design programme in the past, and may have continued experimentation in low-key ways, like computer modelling, in recent years. Although Tehran had signalled that it was ready to discuss the IAEA's concerns, the agency team, led by the deputy director general, Herman Nackaerts, made no real progress over the course of the two visits. Nackaerts asked to go to Parchin, where the IAEA wants to investigate satellite imagery of a large steel vessel being installed in 2000 of a sort which could be used for explosive testing of warhead components. But the request was turned down on the grounds that Parchin was a military site and it takes more time to get permission. Nackaerts team also wanted to find out about the activities of Vyacheslav Danilenko, a Ukrainian-born scientist who worked in the Soviet weapons programme and who lectured in Iran from 1996 to 2002. Danilenko, who is referred to in IAEA reports simply as 'the foreign expert', told the agency that he was helping the Iranians make nano-diamonds using the same implosion techniques employed in nuclear warheads. The inspectors wanted to see some of the fruits of his labours and interview some of his students but were told that no such materials or personnel were available. The Nackaerts team also asked for a Iranian statement on the evidence of possible military dimensions of the country's nuclear programme, but only received a blunt point-by-point rebuttal of the 65 concerns the agency raised in its last report, in November last year. In previous discussions, Iranian officials acknowledged having carried out some of the experimentation mentioned by the IAEA but insisted it was for non-nuclear purposes. This time, Tehran rejected every scrap of evidence as a fabrication. At the same time, the IAEA found that Iran had tripled its rate of production of 20%-enriched uranium, and is doing much of it in a heavily-protected site dug under a mountain at Fordow. That is a matter of concern as it is much easier to turn 20% uranium into weapons-grade (90%-enriched) uranium, should the Iranians choose to go down that route, that it is with 3.5% uranium - the kind used in nuclear power reactors that Iran has been producing until recently. Iran says the 20% material is intended for use in its research reactor. The inspectors pointed out that the country already had more than enough for use in its research reactor in Tehran for the production of medical isotopes, but the Iranians claimed they were going to build five such reactors. Furthermore, the IAEA discovered that in the three months since the last report, Iran had dramatically accelerated its installation of centrifuges, bringing 2,600 more into production. Washington, London and Paris are hoping that these developments, in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, will be enough to persuade Russia and China to agree to Iran's referral to the council once more for further punitive sanctions. However, there are reasons to believe that will be a hard sell in Vienna this week. The freshly re-elected Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on the day the IAEA report was leaked that he suspected the nuclear issue was being used as a vehicle for 'regime change' in Iran. Moreover, there is a 'glass-half-full' interpretation of the new IAEA report, that suggests that the Iranian programme is not progressing quite as fast as Tehran's boasts and Israel's claims suggest. The thousands of centrifuges Iran has newly installed are all early model IR-1's, using technology that is half a century old. It is clear from the report that Iranian efforts to develop more advanced centrifuges that could enrich uranium much faster, have so far been a failure. As one Vienna-based diplomat familiar with the IAEA investigation said: \"They have been working for years on IR-2 and IR-4's and they have not yet run a full cascade [an array of 164 centrifuges] with these second-generation centrifuges, or at least not for a long time.\" Iranian claims to the IAEA that it would soon be testing IR-5's and IR-6's \"is another way of saying that its IR-2's and IR-4's haven't worked\", another diplomat said. Reports published before the IAEA Tehran visit, suggesting that Iran would imminently install new generation centrifuges at the underground site of Fordow - cited as a 'red line' by some Israeli officials - turned out to be groundless. All the centrifuges at Fordow are clunky old IR-1's. Furthermore, Iran's centrifuge development appears to have been fast but not deep. Some 2,600 new centrifuges have quickly been brought on-stream at the main enrichment centre in Natanz, and are being fed with uranium hexafluoride gas, but as an analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) suggests, they are not working particularly well. And while more than 6,000 centrifuge casings have been installed at Natanz, it is far from clear that Iran has sufficient materials to put the working parts in those casings in the near future. In short, there is evidence of a rush by the Iranian authorities to create facts on the ground that make it look like they have achieved more than is actually the case. This may reflect the urgency of harried technicians trying to keep up with the pre-election boasts of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but it may also be an attempt to establish a strong bargaining position in anticipation of serious negotiations. The regime has said it is ready for new talks, although a time and a venue have yet to be agreed. So while the IAEA board will convene today to consider an Iranian regime that is clearly intransigent and defiant, the Russian, Chinese and non-aligned countries will have plenty of material to point to in support of their arguments that there is still time for diplomacy and that the agency should refrain from taking dramatic actions that could be interpreted as a trigger for war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/18/japan-salarymen-encouraged-dress-down","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-18T19:00:03Z","webTitle":"Japan's salarymen encouraged to dress down and chill out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/18/japan-salarymen-encouraged-dress-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/18/japan-salarymen-encouraged-dress-down","fields":{"headline":"Japan's salarymen encouraged to dress down and chill out","bodyText":"When the earthquake struck the north-east coast of Japan in March, the crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant and several other thermal-generating plants triggered a drop in energy output.

In April the governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, suggested that the city's many vending machines be unplugged, saying: \"Why can't [you] just cool these kinds of products in your refrigerator at home?\" Coca-Cola Japan has already announced that it will be turning off the refrigeration of its machines between 10am and 9pm over the summer. Building on the \"Cool Biz\" summer campaign that started in 2005 as part of the government pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto protocol, the government has extended its original guidelines (turn down air conditioning, wear short-sleeved shirts to work, etc) even further. Workers, Japan's famed \"salarymen\", are now being urged to wear cotton trousers, sandals, T-shirts and even the casual Friday staple of loud Hawaiian shirts. It's been dubbed \"Super Cool Biz\".

Could it really have happened? Could the fishing industry have achieved the remarkable feat of destroying the last great stock? Until 2010, mackerel were the one reliable catch in Cardigan Bay in west Wales. Though I took to the water dozens of times, there wasn't a day in 2008 or 2009 when I failed to take 10 or more. Once every three or four trips I would hit a major shoal, and bring in 100 or 200 fish: enough, across the season, to fill the freezer and supply much of our protein for the year. Those were thrilling moments: pulling up strings of fish amid whirling flocks of shearwaters, gannets pluming into the water beside my kayak, dolphins breaching and blowing. It was, or so it seemed, the most sustainable of all the easy means of harvesting animal protein. Even those days were nothing by comparison to what the older residents remembered: weeks on end when the sea was so thick with fish that you could fill a bucket with mackerel just by picking them off the sand, as they flung themselves through and beyond the breaking waves while pursuing their prey. Last year it all changed. From the end of May to the end of October I scoured the bay, on one occasion paddling six or seven miles from land – the furthest I've ever been – to try to find the fish. With the exception of a day on which I caught 20, I brought them back in ones or twos, if at all. There were many days on which I caught nothing at all. There were as many explanations as there were fishermen: the dolphins had driven them away, the north-westerlies had broken up the shoals, a monstrous fishmeal ship was stationed in the Irish Sea, hoovering up 500 tonnes a day with a fiendish new vacuum device. (Despite a wealth of detail on this story I soon discovered that no such ship existed. But that's fishermen for you). I spoke to a number of fisheries officials and scientists, and was shocked to discover that not only did they have no explanation, they had no data either. So I hoped for the best – that the dearth could be explained by a fluctuation of weather or ecology. When the fish failed to arrive at the end of May I told myself they must be on their way. They had, after all, been showing off the south-west of England – it could be only a matter of time. I held off until last weekend. The conditions were perfect. There was no wind, no swell, and the best water visibility I've ever seen here. I looked at the sea and thought \"today's the day when it all comes right.\" I pushed my kayak off the beach and felt that delightful sensation of gliding away from land almost effortlessly – I'm so used to fighting the westerlies and the waves they whip up in these shallow seas that on this occasion I seemed almost to be drifting towards the horizon. Far below me I could see the luminous feathers I used as bait tripping over the seabed. But I could also see something else. Jellyfish. Unimaginable numbers of them. Not the transparent cocktail umbrellas I was used to, but solid, white rubbery creatures the size of footballs. They roiled in the surface or loomed, vast and pale, in the depths. There was scarcely a cubic metre of water without one. Apart from that – nothing. It wasn't until I reached a buoy three miles from the shore that I felt the urgent tap of a fish, and brought up a single, juvenile mackerel. Otherwise, though I paddled to all the likely spots, I detected nothing but the jellyfish rubbing against the line. As I returned to shore I hooked a greater weever – which thrashed around the boat, trying to impale me on its poisonous spines. But that was all. Is this the moment? Have I just witnessed the beginning of the end of vertebrate ecology here? If so, the shift might not be confined to Cardigan Bay. In a perfect conjunction of two of my recent interests, last week a monstrous swarm of jellyfish succeeded where Greenpeace has failed, and shut down both reactors at the Torness nuclear power station in Scotland. The Israeli branch of Jellyfish Action pulled off a similar feat at the nuclear power station in Hadera this week. A combination of overfishing and ocean acidification (caused by rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) has created the perfect conditions for this shift from a system dominated by fish to a system dominated by jellyfish. If this is indeed what we're seeing, the end of vertebrate ecology is a direct result of the end of vertebrate politics: the utter spinelessness of the people charged with protecting the life of the seas. In 2009 the Spanish fleet, for example, vastly exceeded its quota, netting twice the allowable catch of mackerel in the Cantabrian Sea, and no one stopped them until it was too late. Last week, the European commission again failed to take action against the unilateral decision by Iceland and the Faroes to award themselves a mackerel quota several times larger than the one they agreed to, under their trilateral agreement with the EU and Norway. Iceland and the Faroes have given two fingers to the other nations, and we appear to be incapable of responding. The mackerel haven't yet disappeared from everywhere, but my guess is that the shoals which, since time immemorial, came into Cardigan Bay, were a spillover from the mass movements up the Irish Sea. As the population falls, there's less competitive pressure pushing them towards the margins. Without data, guesswork is all we've got. I desperately hope it's not the case, but it could be that the fish that travelled to this coast, in such numbers that it seemed they could never collapse, have gone. monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/16/japan-emperor-nuclear-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T10:22:08Z","webTitle":"Japan's emperor expresses fears over nuclear situation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/16/japan-emperor-nuclear-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/16/japan-emperor-nuclear-fears","fields":{"headline":"Japan's emperor expresses fears over nuclear situation","bodyText":"Japan's emperor has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about the worsening situation at a stricken nuclear power plant, and called on its people to work together to overcome the country's worst crisis since the second world war. In a rare public address, Akihito said events unfolding at the Fukushima Daiichi plant were \"unpredictable\", hours after a surge in radiation levels prompted the withdrawal of 70 workers who have been battling to make the facility safe. \"I am deeply hurt by the grievous situation in the affected areas,\" Akihito said in his first public appearance since Japan's north-east coast was devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in which more than 10,000 people may have died. Dressed in a dark suit, the sombre-looking 77-year-old said the disaster was on an \"unprecedented scale\". \"I hope from the bottom of my heart that the people will, hand in hand, treat each other with compassion and overcome these difficult times.\" The country remains in a state of high anxiety over the nuclear emergency, but Akihito's appearance may go some way towards lifting people's spirits. He is widely respected as a thoughtful, intelligent man and his opinions continue to hold sway more than 65 years after his father, Hirohito, was forced to renounce his divine status after Japan's defeat in the second world war. As a symbolic figure, Akihito must be careful to refrain from involvement in political issues. His address carefully avoided any comment that could be construed as criticism of Japan's nuclear power industry or the official response to the crisis. It is unlikely that Akihito and Empress Michiko will travel to the disaster zone for as long as the threat persists of a serious nuclear accident. The imperial household agency said in a statement that the couple wanted to visit the area hit by the tsunami but felt that the focus should remain on the rescue operation for the time being. The imperial couple made similar visits in the wake of other disasters, including to the western city of Kobe, where 6,400 people died in an earthquake in January 1995. Akihito thanked emergency workers and the more than 100 countries that have offered aid and assistance with the rescue and recovery effort. \"We don't know the number of victims, but I pray that every single person can be saved,\" he said. Akihito voiced hope that the engineers and technicians trying to avert disaster in Fukushima would be successful. \"I am deeply concerned about the nuclear situation because it is unpredictable,\" he said in remarks broadcast on television. \"With the help of those involved I hope things will not get worse.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2012/may/01/letters","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-01T12:59:02Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 4 May 2012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/may/01/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2012/may/01/letters","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 4 May 2012","bodyText":"I found Ai Weiwei's piece, Censors can never vanquish liberty, quite amusing (20 April). The censors have been vanquishing our liberty for centuries – and getting away with it. If it hadn't worked so well they would have given it up as a bad job decades ago. Who's kidding who? No wonder this young Chinese artist and writer is such a darling of the west. There is no doubt he views the west through particularly rosy spectacles. They can't make spectacles any rosier. \"They threaten people, your family, saying 'your children won't find jobs,'\" he tells us. That would hardly sound like a threat in the west. How many millions of willing workers remain unemployed in the US, I wonder? How many millions in the UK are similarly unemployed? And throughout Europe? Is Weiwei so bound up with his own difficulties in China that he simply hasn't noticed that there's an economic problem in the west? Perhaps he should have taken notice of what Naomi Wolf had to say in her piece, US has a new tool to control the masses (13 April). Many people in the US are spooks: not only government spooks, but even more private companies' spooks. All they do all day is spy on other people – for profit. Wolf warns: \"No one should want the state to have power to strip your clothes off. And yet that's what is happening, thanks to the [US] supreme court\". May I recommend to Weiwei that he read Wolf's article, and reconsider the matter of freedom in the west?

No organisation has ever had such control over access to information that Google now exercises. Who decides how our questions should be answered? Google. Where do journalists research their articles?

Jen Nicolson Brisbane, Queensland, Australia Finding best energy mix While reading about Japan's frenzied importation of fossil fuels in order to maintain its industrial exports (Japan's costly trade-off, 20 April), I was reminded of Egypt's current difficulties with its own balance of trade. In 1960, with 28 million people, Egypt was a food exporter. By 2008, with 82 million people, it was importing 40% of its food. For many years it could pay to import food because it was a net exporter of oil. In 1996, however, Egyptian oil production peaked and in 2006 it became a net importer of oil. Without oil, Egypt has little other than tourism dollars to pay for food imports. While population continues to grow by 2% annually, the situation is likely to get worse. It will be interesting to see what energy mix the Japanese choose to get them through the current energy crunch as they shift away from nuclear power. Too much dependence on oil, now that global conventional supplies have peaked, may not be wise. On the other hand, a move to renewables as the Germans have done may be the best economic course, and certainly the most environmentally desirable one. Global banking giant HSBC has noted that the cost of key renewable energy technologies is falling more rapidly than previously thought. Wind is already competitive with fossil fuels in many energy markets. HSBC forecasts, as have the Chinese, US and Indian governments in recent months, that solar is likely to achieve grid parity with conventional fuels in this decade. Some energy analysts say that Japan sits on about 20,000MW of geothermal energy, though not all of this could be developed. Nevertheless, it would go a long way towards meeting their energy needs. And unlike Egypt, Japan's population is declining – by 0.2% last year. While some bemoan the distortion to the age structure, it does mean that the population might decline to a more sustainable level, one that is in balance with its resources. Jenny Goldie Michelago, NSW, Australia Romney's flip-flopping I read with interest recent articles touching on Mitt Romney's lack of consistency in adopting certain policy positions (Romney seeks votes among gun lobby; NRA convention brandishes its weaponry with a swagger, 20 April). In particular I was struck by the similarities in that regard between his campaign and that of his father. In 1968 George Romney was in the race for the Republican nomination. He reversed his support for the war in Vietnam, justifying the decision due to having been previously \"brainwashed\". This caused much derision at the time, including from Eugene McCarthy, who noted \"I would have thought a light rinse would have done it.\" Romney's ratings subsequently nose-dived. With his courting of the more egregious elements of the Republican support base, one can only hope history eventually repeats itself for Mitt Romney during this year's presidential election. Barrie Sargeant Otaki Beach, New Zealand A strategy for Syria Normally, I appreciate Timothy Garton Ash's shrewd comments. But this time I am puzzled (Ottoman solution destined for Syria, 20 April). Rather than admit defeat, Garton Ash falls back on the sterile but dangerous interaction of greater and lesser powers to do the trick. There is an alternative: going back to the original \"Ottoman solution\" – that is, shifting attention from external to internal forces in Syria – based on indigenous communities, operating more or less with autonomy, such as Christians and Jews, Sunni and Shia Muslims, Kurds and so on. John Girling Toulouse, France • How long can Kofi Annan be \"alarmed\" by the violence in Syria? How long can Ban Ki-moon continue to express his disappointment? What happens when they run out of adjectives to express their impotence in this situation? What action will the UN take when they finally admit what everyone knows: that Bashar al-Assad has sensed the powerlessness of the UN and continues to butcher his own people? Gillian Hearn Monemvasia, Greece Party funding problem That Labour leader Ed Miliband should endeavour to cap the parties' campaign contributions is praiseworthy, though a bit quixotic (There may be hope for Labour, 20 April). Each election cycle in the US we have the selfsame conversation and each time it goes off a damp squib. The incumbent party tends to be advantaged under the status quo and so temporises over reform; alternately in eight years it will cheer rah-rah out the other side of its mouth. And since 2010, thanks to a supreme court decision (courtesy of Justice Antonin Scalia), corporations per se have gained first amendment free speech rights, as if transubstantiated into living, breathing \"bodies\". The sky's the limit, eg: President Barack Obama's electoral \"war-chest\" is swelling towards $1bn. Ours has become a proportional system of representation whereby one dollar equals one vote, as it were. It is a government of corporation and capital now, rather than of human heart and head. R M Fransson Denver, Colorado, US We are the poorer for it As Ros Wynne-Jones describes, it is indeed a great tragedy that we are losing our view of the night sky, and that children lose the most (Stellar magic is vanishing, 20 April). But the tragedy is greater than that: city dwellers don't even know that they are missing something. Imagine listening rather dismissively to a poor, mono recording of a Beethoven symphony and never realising that it is possible to experience a live performance, as fresh and vital as the day it was composed. And it's not just the night sky. Birdlife, for example, is impoverished now to a degree nobody growing up today would ever imagine possible. I grew up in 1960s and 70s rural England. I thought the birdlife was pretty good then. But my grandfather told my brother (who is a keen birdwatcher) that what we were seeing even then didn't compare to his own childhood in the first decade of the 20th century.

Received wisdom at the time was that the Games would provide a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity to showcase Britain to the world, and thus boost tourism, inward investment, and political and cultural capital. Len McCluskey's suggestion of possible industrial action (Anti-cuts strikes could target Olympics, says union boss, 29 February) has sent a ripple of panic across the Westminster village, not least because such action is seen as a threat to this \"PR\" legacy of the Games. A London summer rife with demonstrating union members – or indeed anti-capitalist and anti-war protesters – is evidently perceived by some, including David Cameron, Tessa Jowell and Nick Clegg, as a major threat to this country's global image, and therefore national interest. How wrong they are. Recent research has demonstrated that it is in fact very difficult to shape the way your country is perceived around the world, particularly in the case of a highly visible country like Britain. Simon Anholt, former vice-chair of the FCO's own public diplomacy advisory board, told the foreign affairs select committee in 2010 that \"national images are very robust; they really don't change very much\". In trying so hard to manage the way Britain is perceived this summer, officials and politicians risk wasting their time on an ineffective attempt to make this country look like an Anglo-Saxon Singapore. The once encouraging noises from politicians about showing the world our diversity and creativity have been replaced with a desire to show that our pavements are clean and that we are all in bed on time. Even recognising the limits of public diplomacy, what better message could we send to the world this summer, at this time of anti-authoritarian revolution across the world, than that in the motherland of democracy constructive social protest and political dissent are thriving? Politicians misguidedly fear a commercial opportunity will be spoiled this summer. I fear that a different, much more powerful opportunity will be wasted. Philip Fiske de Gouveia Senior research associate, The Foreign Policy Centre • Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, points out our way of life is threatened with the Tory attacks on public sector pensions, attempts to privatise the NHS and cuts to public services. The fact that Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have now joined in with the government's demands for pay restraint and austerity is, as Len says, sending the wrong message to trade unionists and lacks economic credibility. Instead of attacking Unite for seeking to outline how trade unionists can best defend jobs, wages, pensions and public services, they should be standing by our side. The millions who struck on 30 November to defend public services, the thousands of Unite members who last week beat back construction employers' attempts to tear up long-standing agreements with up to 35% wage cuts, or the young campaigners who this week forced the government to rewrite their workfare plans – these people are an inspiration. This government is weak. We need more strikes to stop employers and the government. Len is correct to start to raise a debate about the type of action we can take inside and, if need be, outside the most restrictive labour legislation in the advanced world. We look forward to Unite members across the public sector joining hundreds of thousands of trade unionists in co-ordinated strike action on and beyond 28 March to defend public services.

However, I suspect his idea that the Olympics could be targeted for strike action is not shared by the vast majority of his members. He says it would be wrong to pretend \"everything in the garden is rosy\". Who's suggesting it is? But why destroy the hard work of hundreds of thousands of people in preparing for the Games; the effort athletes have made to compete; or the reputation of the UK? McCluskey harks back to when the country was the sick man of Europe and governments asked \"who governs Britain?\" I do not believe his members want to drag us back to the past. Andrew Boff Olympic spokesman, London assembly Conservative group • On Wednesday's front page we learn that Unite's leader thinks his members should take advantage of London's hosting of the 2012 Olympics, and take the opportunity to blackmail – sorry, \"leverage\" – the government. Turning to page 3 we have a half-page photo of some of the people risking their lives, working in heavy protective suits, to dismantle the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant following last year's catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. It makes me ashamed to be British. Jayne Wilkinson East Bilney, Norfolk • Perhaps David Cameron might lead by example (Labour should return Unite cash, says Cameron, 1 March) and return the donations made to his party over the years by Barclays, RBS, Arcadia, Goldman Sachs et al. Cathy Wood Chiselborough, Somerset • Nick Clegg may claim to be appalled at the suggestion of strike action during the Olympics, but I suspect he is overplaying the nationalistic outrage in an attempt to deflect attention away from his government's attack on the NHS. The Olympics themselves are likely to be a great deal more disruptive to people living and working in London than a few strikes. In fact strikers will probably be doing commuters a favour by giving them the excuse not to go into work on those days. Also, it might be a mistake to overestimate the amount of uncritical support that the Olympic event has from the public. The UK is hosting an extremely commercialised and corporate-friendly event, where everything is being done to satisfy the rapacious needs of business sponsors and corporate hospitality ticket-sellers, while ordinary folk and even some cash-strapped participants are left scrabbling around for a few crumbs dropped from the top table. Basically, the Olympics is a gigantic marketing opportunity where the watchwords are not only the \"spirit\" and \"spectacle\" of competitive sport, but also the \"greed\" and \"profits\" of companies cashing in. Take the 100m final; in a stadium of 80,000 capacity, only 21,000 tickets were available to the public. The rest have gone to sponsors or corporate hospitality ticket-sellers who will sell the tickets on at a massive mark-up (one company JetSet claimed to have made £20m from the Beijing Olympics). With over 200,000 tickets (many focusing on the most popular events) distributed this way, claims by politicians that this is a great event for the \"whole nation\" could ring extremely hollow.

After a hectic year of meetings in three continents and soon in Africa, the annual climate platform is attracting the usual appeals, communiques, media attention, and clamouring for more action by governments. This all sounds very familiar, and the real question is whether the upcoming United Nations climate change conference in Durban, South Africa, really matters. Our view is yes but government leadership is unlikely to be strong. The discussions in Durban will revolve around the post-Kyoto era, and question future commitments of the US and emerging economies and the rescue of the carbon markets in the absence of a new round of the Kyoto Protocol. Another significant issue will be building on the work of the Cancún agreements, including the establishment of three new institutions – the Green Climate Fund, the Technology Mechanism and the Adaptation Committee. All of these aspects must be on the agenda for decision-makers in Durban. Governments and business are taking action on the climate When we look around the globe, we see that climate action is very much on the minds of policymakers – and not just in developed countries. China is taking a leadership position on reducing carbon intensity and India is moving along the same lines. In the developed world, Australia has recently committed to a carbon tax while the UK has increased its resolve to lower emissions. And Germany's recent decision to forego nuclear power will have a huge impact on the acceleration of clean energy demand. Yet despite these gains, cohesive action on a multilateral scale remains elusive. This lack of consensus among and between nations stands in stark contrast to what's happening in the boardrooms of global businesses. There is a growing consensus in the business community that a new path must be forged. Leading companies are demonstrating the benefits of reduced emissions, improved efficiencies and smarter planning. These businesses are leading the way toward a reframing of the climate debate: call it profit with a purpose. Because ultimately, smart businesses want to see their capital invested in ways that return both profits and other long-term societal benefits. This is the definition of sustainable business. Yet it is also true that businesses are looking to governments to provide stability. Following from Panama, the last official round of climate negotiations before Durban and the very recent final meeting of the transitional committee to design the Green Climate Fund, the expectations that Durban will provide this stability are modest. The decades-old political stumbling blocks remain – a feasible legal form for any new agreement, the level of ambition by developed countries, measurable and verifiable actions by developing countries, the availability and effective management of climate finance and technology deployment and the fate of the Kyoto Protocol and its economic instruments. It sounds complicated and indeed it is. But there is willingness to move forward to an end goal. But more concerted efforts are needed In the final analysis, we must move toward a common understanding that carbon emissions have a price. Our goal must be to put into place a system that not only recognises the true price of emissions and so incentivises their lowering over time, but also rewards innovation and early action. This is going to take time, but we should not lose sight of the goal – and this will need international consistency and convergence which will need oversight and support at a global level. So what will success in Durban look like? We should look for three things: a smart Green Climate Fund design; an effective technology mechanism that empowers the internal capacity of countries; and a framework that allows countries to take on their appropriate responsibilities in a comparable and concerted way Without this, we are likely to see a gradual dismantling of the international carbon market mechanisms and with it, the loss of incredibly innovative economic tools to make emissions reduction more cost effective. Despite the doom and gloom – there is a silver lining – companies are taking the lead in measuring and managing greenhouse gas emissions, and taking diverse measures related to energy-efficiency, low-carbon options, renewables, new cleaner technologies, and working on climate resilience. This is a serious business agenda and one which will continue to drive action post-Durban. For those committed to solutions on climate change, it is encouraging to see that even though the expectations for the conference output are low, and apart from the opportunistic gestures, the breadth of long-term interest and commitment to the climate issue still appears solid, serious and engaged in real action.

Sammy Thomson, by email Pension envy is a terrible thing, but congratulations on managing to accumulate more than one. Judging by recent news reports, you are already well ahead of most people. I wouldn't even dare to offer financial advice on this matter - you'd only need to study my own financial arrangements to understand why - but you raise the intriguing and sometimes troubling question about exactly where the many billions of pounds inside the nation's pension pots are invested. According to the law, anyone holding an occupational or local government pension is entitled to know what \"social, environmental or ethical considerations are taken into account in the selection, retention and realisation of investments\". But, crucially, this doesn't mean the trustees of the pension fund have to make investments based on such considerations, only that they must reveal what considerations they have taken into account. Clearly, each of us will have very different views about what constitutes a \"social, environmental or ethical\" investment. For example, should a green pension fund be actively investing in nuclear power because of its claims to be low-carbon, or should it be avoided due to the radioactive waste it creates? And, in 2009, FairPensions, a charity which \"promotes responsible investment by pension funds and fund managers\", noted that there was a \"general disparity between policy and practice\". It would appear, therefore, that the onus is very much on the prospective pension holder to ask the questions they feel they need answered.

They are a desolate, liminal place where land melts into sea and history floats on geography: a place where smugglers lurked, where Spitfires once swirled like starlings. Here, buttressing the marshes where Dickens had Magwitch confront Pip [see footnote], and where Derek Jarman lived in his famous poppy-strewn retreat, Prospect Cottage, lies the peninsula of Dungeness, England's last line of defence against the Channel – a unique, denuded moonscape. For naturalists, this corner of England has assumed totemic importance. The peninsula's lichen-rich waves of shingle offer sanctuary to an internationally important variety of wildlife. Newts, leeches, butterflies and bees are common; the abundant birdlife includes Bewick's and mute swans, bitterns and shovelers; the area is home to rare species of leafhopper and grass-fly, and is the only place in Britain inhabited by the Sussex emerald moth. Its rich biodiversity is recognised in a bewildering array of perfunctory but significant initials. The peninsula is a National Nature Reserve (NNR) and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Parts are also protected under European law as a Special Protection Area (SPA) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Conservationists see this environmental ring-fencing as immutable. But not every- one agrees. Next month, after years of wrangling, the government will have to decide whether it backs plans to transform the region's tiny airport, a few minutes' drive from the small marshes town of Lydd, into a major aviation gateway that will fly millions of passengers a year overseas on budget airlines. And its decision will have ramifications throughout the south-east, where the exponential rise in air traffic has made the issue of airport expansion – not to mention the creation of the \"Boris Island\" airport proposed for the Thames Estuary – increasingly contentious. Supporters say the redevelopment of the airport will bring prosperity to a region that is stagnating. \"There are no jobs here for our children,\" one shopkeeper in the town tells me. \"This place is slowly dying. It's one of the poorest places in the south-east, and young people are moving out. We need the airport to put this place back on the map.\" To him and others who support the project, the airport's owner, a billionaire Saudi sheikh called Fahad Bin Saleh Mohammed al-Athel, is an exotic entrepreneur who can transform the marshes' sinking fortunes. And they believe they have the government on their side. Chancellor George Osborne captured the mood last November when he attacked the \"gold-plating of EU rules on things like habitats\" for stifling business interests. Now the growing fear among environmental groups is that the current economic turbulence will be used as a justification for sending the concrete mixers into some of the country's most heavily protected areas. The decision whether to approve Lydd's expansion will reveal whether this fear is justified. \"What happens at Lydd will determine how prepared we are to look after the best bits of the British countryside,\" says André Farrar of the RSPB. \"Dungeness is probably the most heavily designated place in Europe. The stakes couldn't be any higher.\" Currently Lydd Airport is little more than a landing strip used by the odd executive jet to ferry fewer than 1,000 passengers a year abroad. But half a century ago it brought glamour to the marshes. The first airport to be finished after the war, Lydd Ferryfield, as it was then called, flew motorists and their vehicles to Le Touquet in France. Film stars such as Diana Dors, Gregory Peck and Humphrey Bogart used Lydd, and the royals gave it their imprimatur with an official visit. It was the development of cross-Channel ferries, the rise of rival airports like Heathrow and Gatwick, and more recently the Channel Tunnel, that did for Lydd's ambitions and proved runway hubris is not confined to modernity. Today the airport cuts a forlorn image, resembling a military landing strip attended by a squat, white-washed terminal that looks as if it would be better deployed framing a checkpoint in a demilitarised zone. Sheikh Fahad al-Athel's London Ashford Airport (LAA) Ltd wants to bring back the glory days with a gleaming glass-and-steel passenger terminal. Planning documents submitted by LAA show the company hopes to expand the airport's capacity to 500,000 passengers a year and then, ultimately, 2m. The runway would be extended by 300m so that it can be used commercially by larger jets; the company's website adds: \"Any destination within a 1,000-nautical-mile radius will be possible.\" The scheme's supporters, who include the local Tory MP, Damian Collins, say this would relieve pressure on Gatwick and other south-eastern airports. But many locals, horrified that the tranquillity of their historic town, which boasts buildings half a millennium old, is threatened, have mobilised in opposition. A referendum found 66% of the local population are against the airport's expansion. Shepway District Council, which was initially responsible for granting approval, held a series of public inquiry sessions. The No camp, which gave itself the name Lydd Airport Action Group, argued that the council was required under European law to consider the impact on the surrounding wildlife. The airport's owner was obliged to present a scientific case, in conjunction with other interested bodies such as the RSPB and the government's advisory body, Natural England. If this \"appropriate assessment\" found the airport would have a negative impact on the protected sites, or even if its owner was unable to demonstrate that it would not have an adverse effect, the expansion could not go ahead. The council commissioned an environmental consultancy, Bureau Veritas, to undertake the assessment. Written by an ecologist named Kevin Webb, the assessment heavily influenced the council's planning officer when, in July 2009, he recommended that the council reject the application. Then something curious happened. Following representations from the airport, Bureau Veritas was asked to review its report. A second assessment, also written by Webb, insisted the airport's owners could not prove the Special Protection Area (SPA) would be left unscathed if the expansion went ahead. On 19 February 2010, guided by the second assessment, the planning officer again recommended a refusal. Twelve days later, following a full meeting, Shepway District Council approved the expansion of Lydd Airport. According to government estimates, the number of passenger journeys from UK airports is forecast to rise from 211 million in 2010 to 335m in 2030, and then to 470m by 2050, and the south-east will bear most of the increase. The region's airports are already anticipating this growth. Manston airport near Margate has applied to run night flights. This April, easyJet will start operating services at Southend, a key step in the Essex airport's plan to be flying 2 million passengers a year by 2020. This is consistent with the claims made in the 2003 Air Transport White Paper, which influences existing policy, \"to make the best possible use of the existing runways at the major south-east airports\". The mass influx of people flying in to watch the Olympics this year has strengthened arguments for the development of airports across the south-east, especially as expansion at the region's established airports has been limited. Plans for a third runway at Heathrow were scrapped when the coalition came to power in 2010 as prime minister David Cameron sought to establish his green credentials; airport operator BAA withdrew its application for a second runway at Stansted in the same year, and expansion at Gatwick has been ruled out until 2019. Fears that there is now a looming shortage of runways in the south-east have prompted both London mayor Boris Johnson and architect Lord Foster to push separate but similar plans to build a major new airport in the Thames Estuary. As with Lydd, campaigners argue that the site of \"Boris Island\" is an important breeding ground for birds such as avocets and marsh harriers. Friends of the Earth warns that the airport \"would have a devastating impact on local communities and the environment\". If the government is correct and people will fly more, not less, in the future, the politically explosive question is how this can be reconciled with the UK's commitments to reduce carbon emissions. But those opposing airport development question whether the claims made for expansion are valid, given that Stansted, which sought a second runway, is currently operating below capacity. The 211 million passengers who passed through the UK's airports last year are considerably fewer than the 2007 peak of 240 million. Sarah Clayton, of campaign group Airport Watch, points out that aviation fuel currently costs around $130 a barrel, 16% more than a year ago, and in the long run it will only rise. With a price of $150 a barrel, passenger numbers start to fall significantly, according to economic modelling. And as oil becomes ever more scarce, prices could increase dramatically – a major threat to smaller airports predicated on a budget-airline model. \"Yes, there's lots of oil left, but it's hard to extract without using an awful lot of energy,\" says Clayton. Smaller airports like Lydd and Manston are already loss-making. And Lydd, with its winding country lanes some 15 miles from the Eurostar terminal at Ashford International, is not an easy place to reach, throwing into question whether it would attract sufficient numbers of passengers. Peter Hobbs, chief executive of Kent Channel Chamber of Commerce, enthuses that in Sheikh Fahad al-Athel, Lydd has a \"very positive and vibrant investor\" ready to risk his own money to develop the airport. \"The airport would act as a catalyst for attracting better roads,\" Hobbs insists. A railway line between Ashford and Lydd, axed as part of Dr Beeching's wholesale network cuts, could, he says, be reopened. Hobbs suggests the region's tourism industry would improve while the airport, surrounded by wide open spaces that are easy to build on, could become an important hi-tech hub for aviation-servicing companies. \"The argument comes down to whether there's a future here for the next generation,\" Hobbs says. \"What is going to happen to the marshes? Do we want them to be flourishing, with better jobs and better services? If there's no work, the place will simply become a habitat for birds.\" Clayton disagrees. \"Everyone talks about the jobs airports create, but every airline is trying to cut jobs,\" she says. \"They are doing everything possible to limit human interaction. And the sort of jobs expansion creates – things like baggage handling – are hardly careers.\" In its submission to the inquiry, the Lydd Airport Action Group also expressed scepticism at claims made for job creation: \"Even if LAA achieves a throughput of 500,000 people per annum it will remain loss-making and only generate 200 to 210 gross jobs by 2024/2028.\" The opening of a new Sainsbury's in the area a couple of years ago created 300 jobs. Talk to most people about Dungeness – \"the Ness\" to locals – and their first reference is usually to its nuclear power stations, two concrete leviathans located less than three miles from the airport, stoically facing the English Channel like Easter Island statues. Prosaically named A, one of the power stations is being decommissioned while the other, B, is due to close in six years' time. No one is sure of the risks associated with siting a major airport next to a nuclear power station in a region rich in birdlife. The modelling used to evaluate the probability of an air crash is flawed, according to nuclear-safety campaigners, who warn that the heightened chance of bird strike in the area could trigger a chain of events leading to an accident at the power stations. LAA declines to reveal whether it has employed specialists to assess the risk. In its submission, Lydd Airport Action Group, headed by Louise Barton, a former analyst for a major investment bank, claimed the expansion could lead to safety compromises as a result of \"tensions between an airport operator needing to control birds and organisations wishing to preserve birds\". Barton, who has lived near Lydd since 1994, admits she is a nimby, horrified that \"one of the most peaceful places in England\" is under threat. \"They call it the fifth continent down here,\" she says. \"It's not a particularly beautiful place in the classical sense. It's a place that grows on you. It's flat and has big skies.\" A series of freedom of information requests lodged by Barton revealed that text in the environmental reports had been changed by the council, which lawfully \"cherry-picked\" evidence in order to produce a positive assessment. It also revealed that on the eve of the vote, the council had chosen not to circulate a letter from Natural England criticising LAA's legal arguments and concluding that \"the application should be refused\". A spokeswoman for Shepway District Council explains that the council does not circulate copies of late planning representations to councillors, but insisted the letter's contents were reported verbally to councillors. \"A draft appropriate assessment was carried out by our ecological advisers and also a shadow appropriate assessment by the ecological advisers to the airport,\" she says. \"In many areas there was agreement among the ecological advisers, but in some areas the advice was different. Having considered all issues at length, the council made a positive appropriate assessment combining assessments from both sets of advisers. The council took legal advice that this was an acceptable course of action.\" The Lydd Airport Action Group cried fix. Webb, the ecologist who had written the reports opposing the application, was also dismayed. In an email to Barton, he declared: \"I am happy to appear as a witness… I would like the opportunity to state publicly that I believe the development if allowed to proceed would have a detrimental effect.\" Amid the ensuing furore, Natural England referred the decision up the chain to central government. A recommendation is expected to find its way to the in-tray of Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, who has the final say on contentious planning issues, within a fortnight. If Pickles approves the airport's expansion he will be going against the government's adviser, Natural England, Shepway's planning officers, the majority of Lydd's residents, the scientific consensus on the need to reduce carbon emissions, the prime minister's perceived green credentials and the coalition's belief in empowering communities as enshrined in its much-vaunted localism act. But few will be surprised if he does. The government's controversial decision to press ahead with High Speed Two, the new London to the north railway line, has been welcomed by many pro-business groups but is seen by conservationists as a portent of things to come. Barton and the Lydd Airport Action Group have vowed to fight on in the courts if the decision goes against them and ignores European habitat laws. They claim the battle is about more than nuclear safety, overcrowded skies, carbon footprints and preserving wildlife. \"People believe there would be just a few more planes in the sky above Romney Marsh, but they don't have any conception of the impact it would have,\" Barton says. \"The whole character of the place would change because, as studies show, airports lead to urbanisation.\" If so, a unique landscape described by Dickens as a \"dark, flat wilderness\" would be lost for ever. And with it, the certainty that the protection afforded much of Britain's landscape is irrevocable. • The following correction was published on 4 March 2012: A Magazine item on the threat of airport expansion to Kent's marshes suggested that Dickens's prisoner, Magwitch, escaped across Romney Marsh, but his prison hulk was moored in the Medway. Dickens appears to set the scene in Great Expectations in the desolate area between Gravesend and the Hoo peninsula (\"Project runway\")."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/28/hurricane-irene-downgraded-new-york","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-28T14:28:00Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Irene downgraded to tropical storm as rains batter New York","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/28/hurricane-irene-downgraded-new-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/28/hurricane-irene-downgraded-new-york","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Irene downgraded to tropical storm as rains batter New York","bodyText":"New York city was battered by tropical storm Irene, which was downgraded from a hurricane on Sunday morning, as it continued its surge up the north-east coast of the United States. There were widespread power outages and flooding all along a vast stretch of the country stretching from North Carolina through Virginia and up into New York and the New England coast. Irene, whose wingspan is about 500 miles wide, has so far killed nine people and knocked out power to 3 million people. But it weakened as it pushed into New York and was downgraded to tropical storm status, the National Hurricane Centre said. After battering the US mid-Atlantic coast with hurricane power, Irene's winds had dropped to 65mph by 9am Eastern standard time (EST), the centre said. As the eye of the storm bore down on the New York city area, its sustained wind speeds were lower than had been feared. There were also few early signs of a disastrous storm surge that many had been concerned could inundate lower Manhattan and other vulnerable and low-lying areas. The New York 1 television station reported the rising water levels at Battery Park City on the far tip of Manhattan had already started to top off at about 9am EST. But fears remained that the city had not yet escaped a serious flood. There were also more than 51,000 New York residents without power, with about half of them in the outlying borough of Queens. On Long Island – where southern coastal beaches were hit by heavy surf – more than 225,000 people had their electricity supplies cut off. There was some flooding along New York streets at the city's edges. Rainfall overnight overwhelmed some sewers and sent water streaming into streets. Seawater from New York harbour lapped at the edge of the pavement at Battery Park. Along the coast in the outer boroughs, flooding was worse. Ocean water was streaming into the main streets of the Rockaways. Coney Island also had some streets under water, and the neighbourhood of Red Hook in Brooklyn was also affected. All the city's airports were closed, with more than 9,000 flights cancelled. Broadway shows, baseball games and other events were all closed or postponed as the city came to a grinding halt. The public transport system had been shut down on Saturday afternoon. City officials on Sunday morning were still asking people to stay indoors until the storm had passed on Sunday afternoon. The National Hurricane Centre said the huge storm reached New Jersey at 5.35am EST. The eye previously reached land on Saturday in North Carolina before returning to the Atlantic, tracing the east coast shoreline. In North Carolina, shorefront hotels and houses were lashed with waves, two piers were destroyed and at least one hospital was forced to run on generator power. In Maryland a reactor at a nuclear power station at Calvert Cliffs was shut down due to the powerful winds. The number of airline passengers affected by the storm could easily be in the millions because so many flights make connections on the east coast. Irene caused flooding from North Carolina to Delaware, both from the two metre waves it pushed into the coast and from heavy rain. More than 1m of the homes and businesses without power were in Virginia and North Carolina."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/30/japan-yoshihiko-noda-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-30T07:50:00Z","webTitle":"Japan parliament elects Yoshihiko Noda as prime minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/30/japan-yoshihiko-noda-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/30/japan-yoshihiko-noda-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"Japan parliament elects Yoshihiko Noda as prime minister","bodyText":"Yoshihiko Noda has become Japan's seventh prime minister in six years, inheriting a parliament racked by division, a sluggish economy and a nation struggling to recover from the 11 March tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis. Noda's election was a formality: the party he has led since Monday, the governing Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), has a comfortable majority in the lower house of parliament; his appointment was later approved by the upper house, which the opposition controls. The former finance minister beat four rivals to become leader of his party in a contest that exposed deep factional divisions. Noda may attempt to heal those rifts by appointing opponents inside the DPJ to cabinet posts, but there were no early indications he was preparing to bring in members of other parties, whose co-operation he needs to end political paralysis in the divided upper chamber. Noda has said he is open to the idea of a grand coalition that could see members of the Liberal Democratic party return to the cabinet two years after they were turfed out of office in a DPJ landslide. Political manoeuvering aside, the 54-year-old will come under immediate pressure to revive the economy, rein in the strong yen and oversee the reconstruction of the tsunami-ravaged north-east coast and the operation to stabilise Fukushima Daiichi. He favours higher taxes over more borrowing to pay for tsunami reconstruction and to foot Japan's rising health and welfare bill. He has offered only guarded support for his predecessor Naoto Kan's plan to phase out nuclear power, saying only that no new reactors should be built, given the strength of public opposition. He has called for reactors that were closed after the Fukushima accident to be checked and restarted soon to avoid power shortages. Known as a fiscal conservative, Noda said his priority was the resurgent yen, which reached a postwar high against the US dollar earlier this month. \"I'm aware that we have problems with the strong yen and deflation,\" he told reporters. \"But at the same time, we need to maintain fiscal discipline.\" As finance minister, he approved three interventions in the global currency markets in attempt to weaken the yen. His possible successors include Katsuya Okada, the DPJ's secretary general, and Yoshito Sengoku, a former socialist turned free marketeer. Noda, the son of a member of Japan's self-defence forces, is critical of China's military buildup and has argued that Japanese wartime leaders convicted by the allies after the second world war should no longer be regarded as war criminals. A staunch supporter of Japan's military alliance with the US, he has also said he wants to promote stronger economic ties with China and South Korea to create a \"win-win situation\". In his campaign speech on Monday, Noda gave notice of a moderate, businesslike style of leadership, citing a Japanese poem to describe himself as more of a loach – a bottom-feeding freshwater fish – than a goldfish. Sheila Smith, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, described Noda as a \"moderate voice\" in Japan's governing party. \"He has a steady temperament and a reputation for fairness in a party where loyalties have been severely tested of late.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/cartoon/2009/apr/28/utilities-energy","type":"picture","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-28T08:03:08Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power station to replace wind farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/cartoon/2009/apr/28/utilities-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/cartoon/2009/apr/28/utilities-energy","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power station to replace wind farm","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/oct/03/edward-snowden-files-john-lanchester","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-03T18:01:00Z","webTitle":"The Snowden files: why the British public should be worried about GCHQ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/edward-snowden-files-john-lanchester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/03/edward-snowden-files-john-lanchester","fields":{"headline":"The Snowden files: why the British public should be worried about GCHQ","bodyText":"In August, the editor of the Guardian rang me up and asked if I would spend a week in New York, reading the GCHQ files whose UK copy the Guardian was forced to destroy. His suggestion was that it might be worthwhile to look at the material not from a perspective of making news but from that of a novelist with an interest in the way we live now. I took Alan Rusbridger up on his invitation, after an initial reluctance that was based on two main reasons. The first of them was that I don't share the instinctive sense felt by many on the left that it is always wrong for states to have secrets. I'd put it more strongly than that: democratic states need spies. The philosopher Karl Popper, observing the second world war from his academic post in New Zealand, came up with a great title for his major work of political thought: The Open Society and Its Enemies. It is, in its way, a shocking phrase – why would the open society have enemies? (But then, the title of Charles Repington's The First World War, published in 1920, was shocking too, because it implied that there would be another one.) We do have enemies, though, enemies who are in deadly earnest; enemies who wish you reading this dead, whoever you are, for no other reason than that you belong to a society like this one. We have enemies who are seeking to break into our governments' computers, with the potential to destroy our infrastructure and, literally, make the lights go out; we have enemies who want to kill as many of us, the more innocent the better, as possible, by any means possible, as a deliberate strategy; we have enemies who want to develop nuclear weapons, and thereby vastly raise the stakes for international diplomacy and the threat of terrorism; and we have common-or-garden serious criminals, who also need watching and catching. I get all that. It doesn't thrill me to bits that the state has to use the tools of electronic surveillance to keep us safe, but it seems clear to me that it does, and that our right to privacy needs to be qualified, just as our other rights are qualified, in the interest of general security and the common good. Reassuring read My week spent reading things that were never meant to be read by outsiders was, from this point of view, largely reassuring. Most of what GCHQ does is exactly the kind of thing we all want it to do. It takes an interest in places such as the Horn of Africa, Iran, and North Korea; it takes an interest in energy security, nuclear proliferation, and in state-sponsored computer hacking. There doesn't seem to be much in the documents about serious crime, for which GCHQ has a surveillance mandate, but it seems that much of this activity is covered by warrants that belong to other branches of the security apparatus. Most of this surveillance is individually targeted: it concerns specific individuals and specific acts (or intentions to act), and as such, it is not the threat. Even Julian Assange thinks that, and said as much in his alarming and perceptive book Cypherpunks: \"Individual targeting is not the threat.\" When the state has specific enemies and knows who they are and the kind of harm they intend, it is welcome to target them to make the rest of our polity safe. I say again, on the evidence I've seen, this is mainly what GCHQ does. I would add that the Guardian and its partners have gone to a lot of trouble to prevent any unnecessarily damaging detail about this work being published. Problems and risks The problems with GCHQ are to be found in the margins of the material – though they are at the centre of the revelations that have been extracted from the Snowden disclosures, and with good reason. The problem and the risk comes in the area of mass capture of data, or strategic surveillance. This is the kind of intelligence gathering that sucks in data from everyone, everywhere: from phones, internet use from email to website visits, social networking, instant messaging and video calls, and even areas such as video gaming; in short, everything digital. In the US, the Prism programme may have given the NSA access to the servers of companies such as Google and Facebook; in the UK, GCHQ has gained a similar degree of access via its Tempora programme, and the two of them together have a cable- and network-tapping capabilities collectively called Upstream, which have the ability to intercept anything that travels over the internet. This data is fed into a database called XKeyscore, which allows analysts to extract information \"in real time\", ie immediately, from a gigantic amount of hoovered-up data. In addition, the NSA has encouraged technology companies to install secret weaknesses or \"backdoors\" into their commercially available, supposedly secure products. They have spent a very great deal of money ($250m a year alone on weakening encryption), on breaking commercially available security products. Other revelations have been published in Der Spiegel, and concern the NSA exploitation of technology such as the iPhone. Access all areas What this adds up to is a new thing in human history: with a couple of clicks of a mouse, an agent of the state can target your home phone, or your mobile, or your email, or your passport number, or any of your credit card numbers, or your address, or any of your log-ins to a web service. Using that \"selector\", the state can get access to all the content of your communications, via any of those channels; can gather information about anyone you communicate with, can get a full picture of all your internet use, can track your location online and offline. It can, in essence, know everything about you, including – thanks to the ability to look at your internet searches – what's on your mind. To get a rough version of this knowledge, a state once had to bug phones manually, break into houses and intercept letters, and deploy teams of trained watchers to follow your whereabouts. Even then it was a rough and approximate process, vulnerable to all sorts of human error and countermeasures. It can now have something much better than that, a historically unprecedented panoply of surveillance, which it can deploy in a matter of seconds. This process is not without supervision, of course. In order to target you via one of these \"selectors\" – that's the technical term – the agent of the state will have to type into a box on his or her computer screen a Miranda number, to show that the process is taking place in response to a specific request for information, and will also need to select a justification under the Human Rights Act. That last isn't too arduous, because the agent can choose the justification from a drop-down menu. This is the way we live now. British reaction And yet nobody, at least in Britain, seems to care. In the UK there has been an extraordinary disconnect between the scale and seriousness of what Snowden has revealed, and the scale and seriousness of the response. One of the main reasons for that, I think, is that while some countries are interested in rights, in Britain we are more focused on wrongs. In Europe and the US, the lines between the citizen and the state are based on an abstract conception of the individual's rights, which is then framed in terms of what the state needs to do. That's not the case in Britain: although we do have rights, they were arrived at by specific malfeasances and disasters on the part of the state. Every right that limits the behaviour of the police, from the need for search warrants to the (now heavily qualified) right to silence to habeas corpus itself, comes from the fact that the authorities abused their powers. This helps to explain why Snowden's revelations, perceived as explosive in American and Europe by both the political right and left, have been greeted here with a weirdly echoing non-response. In the rights-based tradition, the flagrant abuse of individual privacy is self-evidently a bad thing, a (literally) warrantless extension of the power of the state. Here in the UK, because we've been given no specific instances of specific wrongs having been committed, the story has found it hard to gain traction. Even if there were such instances – just as there were 2,776 rule violations by the NSA last year alone – we wouldn't know anything about them, because the system of judicial inspections at GCHQ is secret. So it is a perfectly sealed mechanism: we aren't interested in rights in the abstract, and we are prevented by law from hearing about any of the specific abuses which might start to focus our attention. The documents make clear that GCHQ's eavesdropping abilities are on a scale unmatched anywhere in the free world, and they privately boast about the \"more permissive legal environment\" in the UK – and yet, nobody seems to care. It's tragicomic that the surveillance story which most gripped the public imagination concerned Poole borough council's use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa) to spy on a family suspected of cheating in regard to school catchment areas. Helping the bad guys It's worth taking a moment to ask how helpful the publication of information about this is to the bad guys. (Girls too. But mainly guys.) The answer is evident, I think, in the under-remarked fact that Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad didn't even have a telephone line running into it. In other words he not only didn't use the net, computers or phones in any way at all, ever, he was suspicious of the actual physical apparatus itself. This means that the bad guys know very well that they have to be careful. (It should also be noted that the absence of any electronic footprint at the Abbottabad compound was – as depicted in the movie Zero Dark Thirty – a sign to the spies that something fishy was afoot. Nobody innocent has no electronic footprint.) Some of the jihadi materials I read in the GCHQ documents make it clear that the terrorists are very well aware of these issues. There is a stinging jeer in one jihadi text, apropos a Swedish documentary that made clear certain bugging capabilities in Ericsson's mobile phones: \"It is customary in the Scandinavian countries to publish such helpful materials.\" While the broad details of general strategic surveillance are shocking and need to be known, the thing that would be helpful to the bad guys is the publication of the specific technical details. These the Guardian and its partners have gone to great lengths to keep secret. The unkeepable secret Bear in mind also that these documents were widely circulated: out of the 4.9 million Americans with access to classified information, 480,000 private contractors in the US had the \"top-secret\" security clearance issued to Snowden. If hundreds of thousands of people had access to these secrets, how secure were they? The NSA and GCHQ had no idea that Snowden had this material, and apparently still don't know exactly what is in it – which is one reason they've been panicking and freaking out. But if they didn't know that Snowden had copied it, how could they possibly be sure that someone else hasn't also taken a copy and slipped it to the Chinese or Russians or Iranians or al-Qaida? It was cheeky of Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser in the Cabinet Office, to harrumph about \"very poor information security practices\" on the part of David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald who was detained at Heathrow under anti-terror laws. Our spooks lost at least 58,000 pages of classified documents to a US civilian sitting at a workstation in Hawaii, and did so without realising it had happened. In effect they're saying, \"your secrets are safe with us, except when we lose them\". There's one further conclusion to draw from the fact that so many people had access to this material. It means that this story would at some point have come out. A programme of this scale in a modern democracy, involving hundreds of thousands of people with access to the fact of total internet surveillance, was an unkeepable secret. It may be no comfort to Snowden as he faces his future, but someone somewhere would eventually have done what he did. Some dams are fated to burst. What's new This brings me to my second reservation about looking at the material: the question of whether it contained anything that we didn't already know. In the Tony Scott movie Enemy of the State, the paranoid former NSA spook played by Gene Hackman lays it out with complete clarity: \"The government's been in bed with the entire communications business since the 40s,\" he says. \"They have infected everything. They can get into your bank statement, computer files, email, listen to your phone calls.\" That movie came out in 1998, and was a hit, seen by many millions, so even then, in some sense, everybody knew about the work of the NSA/GCHQ. People who kept informed on these subjects have for decades been careful about using specific words over the phone, especially over transatlantic phonelines. I remember Christopher Hitchens, at the time that concern about Salman Rushdie's welfare was at its peak, wouldn't use his name over the phone but would instead refer to \"our mutual friend\". So in some sense, perhaps it's true that everybody knew. This would be analogous to the manner in which we all know surveillance is pervasive in police work, and yet police methods are by law forbidden from being used in evidence, or indeed even mentioned in court. The ban on mentioning police surveillance is there because they don't want us to realise how much of it there is. We all know that, and yet it doesn't seem to matter much. Perhaps the GCHQ stuff was the same? I've changed my mind about that. It was changing anyway as I thought more about the meaning of Snowden's exposures, and it has changed more still now that I've looked at them first-hand. Broad definitions I've said that the concerns over GCHQ are at the margins of what it does: but those margins are very broad. They especially concern things that are referred to in the documents as \"SD\", which means \"sigint development\". \"Sigint\" is signal intelligence, which is what GCHQ does. \"Development\" means – well, that's the crux of it. It means finding out new things, exploring new technologies, and developing new ways of finding \"targets\". When you look at the documents, it appears to be the case that SD provides the legal basis for mass surveillance of the kind revealed in the Tempora and Prism programmes. The mandate of GCHQ – which by the way didn't have a legal basis of any kind until 1994 – is surveillance for reasons of \"national security, economic well being, and serious crime\". The main law concerning its activities is Ripa. If you read this 2000 act (which, by the way, I don't recommend, since it's tortured and laborious even by the standards of statute-speak), it's clear that the main focus of its provisions is targeted surveillance. It's about what the spies and cops are allowed to do to catch specific bad guys. Ripa is pretty broad in its drafting, and it seems apparent that the intention was to let the authorities do anything they wanted with phones and email. And yet, it nowhere explicitly allows the mass interception of communications by people about whom the state has no reason for suspecting anything – which is what programmes such as Tempora and Prism permit. Behind the times The law always lags behind technology, that's inevitable. If you look at the first version of the modern Official Secrets Act, which was made law in 1911 and is still the main broad statement of government secrecy in effect today, its first provisions concern the making of \"maps and charts\". It is evident that the kind of spying on the lawmakers' minds concerns a chap in plus-fours claiming that he's making drawings of seabirds, only why has he accidentally made accurate sketches of that nearby naval base, and why does he have a heavy German accent … ? The current spying laws continue to lag behind reality, not only because the spies are less concerned with mysterious birdwatchers, but because life itself has changed. Formerly, the activities for which the spies were on guard were visible acts of wrongdoing and intelligence-gathering: enemies making maps of naval bases, or breaking into offices, or bribing civil servants, or seducing and blackmailing other spies, or any of the other ways in which they could try to steal secrets. In the case of modern signals intelligence, this is no longer true. Life has changed. It has changed because of the centrality of computers and digital activity to every aspect of modern living. Digital life is central to work: many of us, perhaps most of us, spend most of our working day using a computer. Digital life is central to our leisure: a huge portion of our discretionary activity has a digital component, even things which look like they are irreducibly un-digital, from cycling to cooking. (I once happened to visit Google's offices in Victoria, where there's a live stream of people's queries on a huge flat screen. Most of them were in Japanese. My host, who speaks Japanese, glanced at them and looked at her watch. \"Recipes,\" she said. \"It's 7pm in Japan, people have just got in from work and are thinking about what to cook.\") As for our relationships and family lives, that has, especially for younger people, become a digital-first activity. Take away Facebook and Twitter, instant messaging and Skype and YouTube, and then – it's hard to imagine, but try – take away the mobile phone, and see the yawning gap where all human interaction used to take place. About the only time we don't use computers is when we're asleep – that's unless we have a gadget that tracks our sleep, or monitors our house temperature, or our burglar alarm, or whatever. This is the central point about what our spies and security services can now do. They can, for the first time, monitor everything about us, and they can do so with a few clicks of a mouse and – to placate the lawyers – a drop-down menu of justifications. Surveillance ambitions Looking at the GCHQ papers, it is clear that there is an ambition to get access to everything digital. That's what engineers do: they seek new capabilities. When it applies to the people who wish us harm, that's fair enough. Take a hypothetical, but maybe not unthinkable, ability to eavesdrop on any room via an electrical socket. From the GCHQ engineers' point of view, they would do that if they could. And there are a few people out there on whom it would be useful to be able to eavesdrop via an electrical socket. But the price of doing so would be a society that really did have total surveillance. Would it be worth it? Is the risk worth the intrusion? That example might sound far-fetched, but trust me, it isn't quite as far fetched as all that, and the basic intention on the part of the GCHQ engineers – to get everything – is there. Consider the direction in which we're moving. Britain has more CCTV cameras than anywhere else in the world, by a huge margin. Nobody knows how many CCTV cameras there are in the country, but the most respectable estimate seems to be the one made by Cheshire police in 2011, which came up with a number of 1.85m. Add to this the capacity for facial recognition software, which already exists and is improving sharply. Further add the capacity for surveillance brought by the \"internet of things\", involving the inclusion of internet-enabled computer chips in everything from cars (where they already are, in high-end models) to fridges to plants (which will tweet their minders when they need to be watered). This might sound like science fiction, but the current estimate is that there will be 20bn such devices in use worldwide by 2020. Add to this the fact that a lot of this electronic potential gives access not just to external real-world data – our locations, our conversations, our contacts books – but to the inside of our heads. I call this the \"knowing you're gay\" test. Most of us know someone who has plucked up the courage to reveal their homosexuality, only to be cheerfully told by friends and family, \"oh, we've known that for years\". Now, though, search engines know facts about people's thoughts and fantasies long before anyone else does. To put it crudely, Google doesn't just know you're gay before you tell your mum; it knows you're gay before you do. And now GCHQ does too. New society What this means is that we're moving towards a new kind of society. Britain is already the most spied on, monitored and surveilled democratic society there has ever been. This doesn't seem to have been discussed or debated, and I don't remember ever being asked to vote for it. As for how this trend appears in the GCHQ documents, there is something of a gap between how the spies talk in public and how they can occasionally be found to talk in private. It is startling to see, for instance, that the justification for the large-scale interception of everybody's internet use seems to be a clause in Ripa allowing interception of \"at least one end foreign\" communications. Whack on to this a general purpose certificate from the secretary of state, and a general warrant, and bingo, this allows full access to traffic via companies such as Google and Facebook – because their servers are located overseas. I can't believe that that was the intention of the people who drafted Ripa, who were surely thinking more of people taking phone calls from moody bits of Waziristan, rather than your nan searching for cheaper tights. There is a revealing moment in the most recent piece written for the Guardian by Sir David Omand, former head of GCHQ. He said that \"the real debate we should be having … is about what privacy in a cyber-connected world can realistically mean given the volumes of data we hand over to the private sector in return for our everyday convenience, and the continued need for warranted access for security and law enforcement\". That's a total non-sequitur: Omand seems to think that just because we hand data over to Google and Facebook the government automatically has the right to access it. It's as if, thanks to a global shortage of sticky gum, envelopes can no longer be sealed, so as a result the government awards itself a new right to mass-intercept and read everybody's letters. Staying within the law All through the GCHQ material there is a tremendous emphasis on the legal basis of its operations, particularly in respect of article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which grants: \"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\" It is repeatedly stated that \"GCHQ operates within the law\" and that \"GCHQ does it legally\" and that surveillance always has to be \"justified, necessary and proportionate\". Good – it would be terrifying if that weren't the case. But if GCHQ seldom breaks the law, it's because the law is so broadly drafted and interpreted it's almost impossible to break. Also, in the GCHQ papers there are occasional glimpses of a different attitude, usually to be found in slides which are marked as \"hidden\" in PowerPoint presentations, or in the presenters' notes to other slides. (Many of the clearest documents are internal GCHQ briefings laid out in the form of PowerPoint talks. I was reminded of Malcolm Gladwell's great joke, in response to whether he needed audio-visual aids for a lecture: \"All power corrupts, but PowerPoint corrupts absolutely.\") For instance, a legal briefing on the Human Rights Act lists the instances in which it is legal for the state to breach article 8: \"In the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\" The notes make the point that national security, public safety and serious crime are the three current reasons for which GCHQ is allowed to eavesdrop, but there is a chilling addition: \"'Just' 3 at the moment. No reason why GCHQ's remit would not be changed in the future but this is what we are allowed to do at the moment.\" It's usually only in books that people's blood runs cold, but mine did when I read that. \"Just\" three at the moment: in other words, there are \"just\" three reasons why GCHQ can violate article 8, the right to privacy. But that could change. It would be legal in human rights terms for GCHQ's mandate to cover \"the prevention of disorder\", not to mention \"the protection of health or morals\". Extending state power The totalitarian state in Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four would need no broader legal justification than that: it really does allow a government to do anything it likes. It was at this point that I became convinced that Snowden's revelations are not just interesting or important but vital, because the state is about to get powers that no state has ever had, and we need to have a public debate about those powers and what their limits are to be. At a moment of austerity and with a general sense that our state's ability to guarantee prosperity for its citizens is in retreat, that same state is about to make the biggest advance ever in its security powers. In public, the state is shrinking; in private, it is shrinking until it gets just small enough to fit into our phones, our computers, our cars, our fridges, our bedrooms, our thoughts and intentions. Another secret slide is headed SRA – a mysterious acronym that is not explained. The slide concerns 2P intelligence, 2P meaning second party, ie other countries in the \"five eyes\" alliance of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It says that an SRA, whatever it is, \"authorises receipt of 2P intelligence on UK based targets where GCHQ has no authorisation\". Since GCHQ can spy on any foreign national it wants, this can only mean the surveillance of people on whom it isn't legal for GCHQ to spy. That looks to me an awful lot like a means of obtaining permission to spy on people – British citizens? – outside the law. We've heard a lot of talk about the distinction between content and metadata – content being the stuff inside communications, metadata the who and when and where and how of the communication, but not the content. The idea is that the spooks focus on the metadata and ignore the content – so they notice your nan logging on to the net, where and when and for how long, but don't read the actual content of the search. This distinction is written into the law in both the US and the UK. This would be reassuring, if the notes didn't say this: \"GCHQ policy is to treat it pretty much all the same whether it's content or metadata.\" Put all these together and it is no wonder the documents contain a boast about the UK's \"more permissive legal environment\". A new panopticon The prospect this presents is something like the \"panopticon\" which Enlightenment philosophers advocated as a design for the ideal prison in the 18th century, and about which the French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote in his book Discipline and Punish. \"He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relations in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection.\" When I first read Foucault's account of the panopticon, where the individual at the centre can simultaneously see and judge a whole multitude of other individuals, I thought it was brilliant but overheated. Now, it actually seems like somebody's plan. That's what we risk becoming: a society which is in crucial respects a giant panopticon, where the people with access to our secrets can see, hear, intercept and monitor everything. Members of the security establishment always want more abilities, more tools, more powers for themselves and fewer rights for us. They never say \"thanks a lot, we're good from here, we have everything we need\". Public enemies From their point of view – the point of view of wanting ever more invasive secret powers – al-Qaida and its affiliates are the perfect enemy. Because al-Qaida combines the characteristics of an ideology and a network, it is everywhere, it is invisible, it is never more dangerous than when you can't see it. The new emphasis on anticipating the actions of \"lone wolf\" terrorists raises this danger even higher: the risk of terrorism from people who have never been caught committing a crime, who have no known terrorist affiliations, who are invisible, who could be anywhere … It is the ultimate version of the scare story that used to be called \"reds under the bed\". How can the state every hope to protect us against people like that, if not by permanent, omnipresent, ever-increasing surveillance? If we are going to remake society in the image of the fight against terrorism, and put that secret fight at the heart of our democratic order – which is the way we're heading – we need to discuss it, and in public. Exaggerated risks When we do so, it might be helpful to consider something called the banana equivalent dose (BED). This is a term used in physics to measure the amount of radiation emitted by a banana. It is a number popular with people who think the dangers of radiation are exaggerated, and who use it to make the point that almost everything is radioactive. A dental x-ray has a BED of 50; serious radiation poisoning takes a BED of 20m; sleeping next to someone for one night has a BED of 0.5 and living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant for a year has a BED of 0.9. Since 9/11, 53 people have been killed by terrorists in the UK. Every one of those deaths is tragic. So is every one of the 26,805 deaths to have occurred on Britain's roads between 2002 and 2012 inclusive, an average of 6.67 deaths a day. Let's call that the SDRD, standard daily road deaths. The terrorist toll for 12 years comes to 0.0121 SDRD. This means that 12 years of terrorism has killed as many people in the UK as eight days on our roads. The security establishment will immediately reply that this figure leaves out deaths of terrorism victims abroad and the lives saved by its secret actions, none of which can be made known without jeopardising current and future operations. Is that enough of a justification for the scale and extent of what is happening to our privacy? Is the current supervisory regime – which involves senior judges inspecting GCHQ's actions, \"within the circle of secrecy\", and issuing a secret report – adequate to the scale of the state's powers? I'd repeat the point that as digital technology, and the ability to enact surveillance through technology, expands its remit, those powers are increasing almost by the day. In the UK we have a strange sleepy indifference to questions of surveillance and privacy. \"The innocent have nothing to fear,\" says William Hague. But who gets to define who is innocent? Who gets to say what is contradictory to the \"economic wellbeing\" of the UK? If the innocent have nothing to fear, why is the state reading so many of our emails, and sucking up so much metadata from our phones and computers, under the umbrella of \"sigint development\"? Police state People misunderstand what a police state is. It isn't a country where the police strut around in jackboots; it's a country where the police can do anything they like. Similarly, a security state is one in which the security establishment can do anything it likes. We are right on the verge of being an entirely new kind of human society, one involving an unprecedented penetration by the state into areas which have always been regarded as private. Do we agree to that? If we don't, this is the last chance to stop it happening. Our rulers will say what all rulers everywhere have always said: that their intentions are good, and we can trust them. They want that to be a sufficient guarantee. My proposals There's no need for us to advance any further down this dark road. Here are two specific proposals. The first is that the commissioners who supervise GCHQ include, alongside the senior judges who currently do the work, at least one or two public figures who are publicly known for their advocacy of human rights and government openness. The \"circle of secrecy\" needs to include some people who are known for not being all that keen on the idea of secrecy. My second proposal is for a digital bill of rights. The most important proviso on the bill would be that digital surveillance must meet the same degree of explicit targeting as that used in interception of mail and landlines. No more \"one end overseas\" and \"sigint development\" loopholes to allow the mass interception of communications. There can be no default assumption that the state is allowed access to our digital life. As the second most senior judge in the country, Lord Hoffmann, said in 2004 about a previous version of our anti-terrorism laws: \"The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws like these. That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve.\" • Follow all the latest developments on the NSA from the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-cables-burma-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-09T21:30:05Z","webTitle":"WikiLeaks cables suggest Burma is building secret nuclear sites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-cables-burma-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-cables-burma-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"WikiLeaks cables suggest Burma is building secret nuclear sites","bodyText":"Witnesses in Burma claim to have seen evidence of secret nuclear and missile sites being built in remote jungle, according to secret US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, heightening concerns that the military regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. A Burmese officer quoted in a cable from the US embassy in Burma said he had witnessed North Korean technicians helping to construct an underground facility in foothills more than 300 miles (480km) north-west of Rangoon. \"The North Koreans, aided by Burmese workers, are constructing a concrete-reinforced underground facility that is '500ft from the top of the cave to the top of the hill above',\" according to the cable. The man is quoted as saying the North Koreans were \"blowing concrete\" into the excavation. An expatriate businessman told the embassy in Rangoon he had seen a large barge carrying reinforced steel bar of a diameter that suggested a project larger than a factory. Other informants included dockworkers, who reported suspicious cargo. The reports add rare detail to rumours that have circulated since 2002, most recently from a military defector this year, that Burma is covertly seeking a nuclear bomb with the help of North Korea. Both countries have strenuously denied this in the past and Burma insists there are no North Koreans in the country. The cables will compound existing international concern over Iranian and North Korean nuclear programmes, and show why Barack Obama has made nuclear non-proliferation one of the central planks of his foreign policy. According to the witness accounts, pieced together by US embassy staff, the work is at an early stage and haphazard. But they regard it as a troubling development, with the risk that Burma could join Pakistan, North Korea and possibly Iran in having a nuclear bomb. In a cable dated August 2004 titled \"Alleged North Korean involvement in missile assembly and underground facility construction in Burma\", one of the embassy staff wheedled information from an officer during a visit to Rangoon. The officer was in an engineering unit working at the site, where surface-to-air missiles were allegedly being assembled. The site is the Irrawaddy river town of Minbu in Magwe division, west-central Burma. The officer said 300 North Koreans were working at the site, though the embassy, in its cable back to Washington, described this as improbably high. The officer \"claims he has personally seen some of them, although he also reported they are forbidden from leaving the construction site and that he and other 'outsiders' are prohibited from entering\". Burma has made no secret of wanting a civilian nuclear reactor, in part because of severe electricity shortages, and has signed a deal with Russia to build one. The project has so far failed to start because of lack of funds. A secret deal with North Korea would be in breach of international rules on nuclear proliferation. According to a 2009 cable, a well-placed source within the Burmese government last year made an apparently indiscreet remark to the Australian ambassador that the agreement with Russia was just for \"software, training\" and the North Korea agreement was for \"hardware\". The source said General Thura Shwe Mann, who had overall command of military activity, visited North Korea in 2008. The source backtracked six months later, insisting that the talks with North Korea were only exploratory. In February 2009 the Burmese deputy foreign minister, Khin Maung Win, called a US diplomat to deny there was collusion between his country and North Korea over missiles, missile technology or nuclear technology. Alarmingly, there is a report of a businessman offering uranium to the US embassy in Rangoon. The embassy bought it. \"The individual provided a small bottle half-filled with metallic powder and a photocopied certificate of testing from a Chinese university dated 1992 as verification of the radioactive nature of the powder.\" He said that \"if the US was not interested in purchasing the uranium, he and his associates would try to sell it to other countries, beginning with Thailand\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/oct/09/socialist-primaries-france","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-09T11:43:56Z","webTitle":"Socialist primaries: France's novel exercise in democracy proves a hit | Agnès Poirier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/09/socialist-primaries-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/09/socialist-primaries-france","fields":{"headline":"Socialist primaries: France's novel exercise in democracy proves a hit","bodyText":"It's called primaries fever. It's taking place all over France and should last another week. Although, in theory, only affecting the people of the left, even the right has showed early symptoms. Today, left-leaning French citizens are invited to choose their candidate to run for next year's presidential elections. A second round will take place next Sunday, if necessary. Little did we know, back in spring, that this novel exercise in democracy, at least in France, would enthuse us all beyond partisan lines. After an orchestrated campaign from Nicolas Sarkozy's lieutenants last June, denigrating the Socialist primaries – calling it a massive operation of n'importe quoi – and denouncing the listing of citizens according to their political leaning, France's prime minister, François Fillon, had to eat his words. He declared this week that the right would follow in the steps of the Socialists, leaving the people to choose a candidate for the presidential elections in 2017. The three televised debates organised over the last few weeks have shown the best face of democratic debate. The exercise was perilous. The six contenders – Martine Aubry, François Hollande, Ségolène Royal, Manuel Valls, Arnaud Montebourg and Jean-Michel Baylet – had to offer different political viewpoints while maintaining the left's unity. Though none proved sensationally charismatic, they showed the many facets of what it means today to be on the left: on the environment, capitalism, globalisation, nuclear power, the euro, bank regulation, Europe, immigration – no subject was kept outside the debating ring. For many viewers – 5 million watched the final debate on Wednesday evening – it was a reassuring sight. If the candidate of the left wins the May 2012 presidential elections, here were the pillars of the future government. Although I'm not a member of the Socialist party, simply a French citizen, I'll be gladly paying €1 to cast my vote – and I'll have no qualms about signing a declaration saying I adhere to the principles of the republic: secularism, justice, solidarity, liberté, egalité, fraternité! I will vote for Hollande, the best-placed Socialist candidate to beat Sarkozy; the only figure of the left able to appeal to the centre, and even to the last remaining Gaullists in Sarkozy's party. Many on the right have long felt shame and embarrassment at being represented by such a divisive personality. They may feel tempted to vote for a Socialist for the first time in their lives. An MP for the last 23 years, president of the Corrèze region, dear to Jacques Chirac, the 57-year-old Hollande will strike the traditional right as a safe pair of hands. And who else could they vote for but Hollande? Aubry will always seem a hardcore Socialist, her image for ever tinted by the 35-hour-week – \"evil\" legislation for anyone on the right. Royal, the messianic pasionaria, had her chance and blew it. Montebourg may be an alluring orator and the embodiment of the perfect son-in-law, but his anti-globalisation programme is anchored in the far left. Valls lacks the bonhomie to make his right-of-the-left's ideas palatable to Socialists. As for Baylet, the 64-year-old outsider, his radical views on legalising cannabis and euthanasia cast him away from the mainstream. Hollande has the political clout, intellectual charisma, middle-of-the-road economic views, easy wit and gourmandise that befit a French president. Critics sneer at his \"normality\". But many will welcome some form of normality, especially after five years spent with histrionic Sarkozy at the helm of the state. Normal doesn't mean soft, it means calm, thoughtful and composed – all positive qualities at a time of global financial crisis. If a million people vote today, it will be a success for democracy. A bigger turnout would give an incredible legitimacy to the left's candidate. The challenge for the winner will then be to remain the favourite for another seven months – an eternity in politics. As we have learned, Sarkozy is never better than in the last 100m of a race."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk/2011/mar/29/fukushima-raditation-found-across-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T15:05:07Z","webTitle":"Fukushima radiation from Japan's stricken plant detected across UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/29/fukushima-raditation-found-across-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/mar/29/fukushima-raditation-found-across-uk","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima radiation from Japan's stricken plant detected across UK","bodyText":"Traces of radioactivity believed to come from the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan have been detected across the UK by emergency monitoring stations in Oxfordshire and Glasgow. The Health Protection Agency has said that \"the minutest\" levels of radioactive iodine have been detected at its air monitoring stations over the last nine days, but they posed no risk to health. The readings peaked at 300 micro-becquerels per cubic metre but averaged at a barely detectable 11 micro-becquerels over that nine-day period - readings similar to findings by monitoring stations in Switzerland and Germany. The HPA said the dose from breathing in air \"was minuscule and would be very much less than the annual background radiation dose\". It said it had expected to see these traces as a result of the Fukushima crisis, where four reactors have been seriously damaged and have emitted significant levels of radiation, in one of the world's worst civil nuclear disasters. But the agency warned that radiation levels in the UK could rise. \"Levels may rise in the coming days and weeks but they will be significantly below any level that could cause harm to public health,\" it said in a statement. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), which oversees radiation monitoring in Scotland, said the levels detected in Glasgow were less than a millionth of normal background levels. The detection of these traces was due to the extremely large volumes of air being tested and their very great sensitivity. Dr James Gemmill, Sepa's radioactive substances manager, said: \"The concentration of iodine detected is extremely low and is not of concern for the public or the environment.\" However, Alex Salmond, the first minister of Scotland and a prominent critic of nuclear power, has complained to the HPA about a delay in informing the public that radiation had been detected by the Glasgow monitoring station on Friday. Salmond said the HPA had been expected to release the Glasgow readings on Monday morning. This had been agreed with Sepa but it did not do so. Sepa officials had then been told it would be disclosed on Tuesday morning, but the HPA statement was released after 1pm. Salmond said he suspected this information was delayed to avoid clashing with the release of a report calling for rapid investment in new nuclear power stations from Oxford's Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, headed by Prof David King, the UK's former chief scientific adviser. Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment minister, is writing to the HPA to protest, Salmond said. \"When these things happen, our obligation is to tell people frankly, clearly and concisely as soon as possible. We're extremely angry and suspicious as to why the pre-arranged statement didn't appear,\" he said. The HPA said there had been no political influence on its decision on when to disclose this information. It had been keeping the situation at Fukushima under close review, and had waited until the Glasgow readings were compared to findings at other air monitoring stations before releasing its findings. It added: \"Because of the high volumes of air needed to identify any radioactive materials, measurements normally take place over extended periods of time. HPA instituted this special high volume air sampling to establish what the levels were.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2011/apr/01/corrections-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-31T23:05:02Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/apr/01/corrections-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2011/apr/01/corrections-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article about the Gravelines nuclear power plant in northern France said it had become the first in the world to produce more than one terawatt-hour of electricity.

The \"voice of business\" believes energy prices will have to rise 30% in real terms by 2020 and some kind of financial incentives might be needed so that up to 15 new nuclear plants are constructed, capable of providing 34% of UK electricity by 2030. John Cridland, deputy director general of the CBI, denied business leaders had become \"anti-renewables\" or have been captured by a nuclear lobby, which so far has talked about building six or eight new plants. \"We are not obsessed with nuclear. We have a passion for low carbon,\" said Cridland. But he warned that government targets of generating 32% of electricity from wind were unachievable and should be scaled back to at least 25%. \"While we have generous subsidies for wind power, we urgently need the national planning statements needed to build new nuclear plants. If we carry on like this we will end up putting too many of our energy eggs in one basket. But by moving government policy in a different direction we can achieve a good balance of wind, nuclear, gas and clean coal,\" he added. The comments came alongside launch of a report, Decision Time, which warns that failure to take a more balanced approach will leave the country dangerously dependent on imported gas. The CBI's advice comes just days before the government is scheduled to unveil an energy white paper, a renewable energy strategy and a low-carbon industrial strategy. Ironically, the business group's arguments were given more weight by the renewables industry itself. A report out tomorrow from the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA) accepts that only half of the onshore targets for England promised by local areas under \"regional spatial strategies\" have been met. The CBI stance will alarm large swaths of the environmental movement, which will note that references to the possible need for a floor price for carbon, and others about wind \"crowding out\" investment in atomic power, follow similar statements from EDF Energy and E.ON, the foreign-owned utilities that want to construct new reactors in Britain. Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF in Britain, and Paul Golby, the boss of E.ON UK, were both quick to welcome the CBI report, which was drawn up with McKinsey, the management consultant. \"We are pleased that the CBI chose to tackle the issue of how to encourage low-carbon generation,\" said de Rivaz. \"Action is required now in order to maximise our ability to hit our low-carbon targets in the most affordable way for UK consumers.\" The CBI report calls for the 2020 renewables target to be reduced to 25% but coal, either in its existing shape or \"cleaned\" by carbon capture and storage, should see its share of the total electricity generation portfolio raised to 16%. The CBI also wants energy efficiency targets to be almost doubled to 20%. Cridland said the CBI had been in close dialogue with ministers and he was confident some of its measures would be represented in the white paper. But he accepted it would be politically tough to dilute the wind target and boost nuclear – which supplies less than 20% of UK electricity – without protests from green groups. The BWEA said the results of its progress report on England's regional renewable targets were worrying: \"There is a divergence between government renewable energy and climate change planning policy and what is actually happening on the ground.\" John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \"The CBI claims to represent the interests of British industry but it's actually doing its members a great disservice. Investment in renewables would create much-needed British jobs in one of the few growth sectors in the global economy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/nov/07/nick-cleggs-lbc-phone-in-and-his-environment-speech-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-07T14:20:30Z","webTitle":"Nick Clegg's LBC phone-in and his environment speech: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/07/nick-cleggs-lbc-phone-in-and-his-environment-speech-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/nov/07/nick-cleggs-lbc-phone-in-and-his-environment-speech-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Nick Clegg's LBC phone-in and his environment speech: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• The heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ have just started giving evidence in public to the intelligence and security committee. My colleague Paul Owen is covering the hearing on his NSA files live blog. • Labour has challenged Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, to respond to claims that he leant on members of the Commons public accounts committee to try to get them to criticise his permanent secretary, Robert Devereux, in their report on universal credit. The allegation was made in today's Times (see 10.01am) and Labour MPs repeatedly raised it during business questions in the Commons. Chris Bryant raised a point of order. Disclosure of a draft report which has been submitted to a committee before such a report has been agreed to by the committee and presented to the House may be treated as a contempt. Now the allegations which [Andrew] Lansley [leader of the Commons) has tried to brush off today about what Mr Duncan Smith is said to have done go considerably further than what you are suggesting. We don't know whether Mr Lansley has asked Mr Duncan Smith all the relevant questions. We want to be able to ask the questions here. So my point of order to you, Mr Speaker, is can you make it absolutely clear to Mr Lansley that it's perfectly possible to have a statement tomorrow or, for that matter, an urgent question tomorrow, and that this House would regard it as a courtesy to the House to hear directly from Mr Duncan Smith and not just second-hand from Mr Lansley. Earlier Lansley told MPs that Duncan Smith had denied the allegations. Lansley said: I have talked to Mr Duncan Smith and I can tell the House that there is no need for a statement. I can tell you and the House now there is no truth in the allegations made about talking to members of the Public Accounts Committee because I talked to Mr Duncan Smith so I can tell the House. • Nick Clegg has said that the Conservatives and Labour are abandoning their support for environmentalism and that only the Lib Dems are firmly committed to the green agenda. (See 1.18pm.) • Clegg has criticised Jeremy Paxman for making a good living from politics while simultaneously \"sneering about politics\". • Theresa May, the home secretary, has unveiled plans to publish more information about the performance of police forces. She made the announcement in a speech on policing. I also want police forces to become more transparent about what they spend and what they do. I'm realistic that not everybody in the country is going to pore over spreadsheets of police data, but the experience of publishing this data in other parts of the public sector is that it is used by the media and others to improve accountability, and it encourages prudence, efficiency and better decision-making. So the Home Office will soon come forward with proposals to require police forces to publish not just spending data in raw form but more performance data too. • Concerns have been raised that fugitive terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed may have a second passport after confusion emerged over his British one. As the Press Association reports, Theresa May, the home secretary, told MPs on Monday that officers had seized the 27-year-old's British passport, but has since revealed that this was wrong. May initially told MP Keith Vaz in the Commons: \"I do not have his passport, but the police do.\" She has now asked for the parliamentary record to be corrected to say: \"I do not have his passport. Mohamed was not in possession of his British passport when he returned to the UK so there was no passport for the police to seize.\" • Ed Miliband has refused to commit himself to protecting shipyard jobs on the Clyde if Scotland votes for independence. On a visit to Edinburgh he was asked if a Labour government would go ahead with the plan to build new Type 26 warships in Glasgow in the event of Scotland voting for independence. He would not give that assurance. When it comes to your naval capacity you've got a take a long, hard look at the way these things are done ... I'm not contemplating defeat in the referendum. • Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister, has insisted the Royal Navy could still build its new warships in Glasgow after independence in a joint procurement deal with the Scottish defence force. As Severin Carrell reports, Sturgeon said it was \"preposterous\" for the UK government to threaten that BAE's two yards in Glasgow would lose their multibillion-pound contracts for 13 new Type 26 frigates if Scotland voted for independence next year. • Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes apologised to the Commons today after it was found he failed to properly declare donations in the register of members' interests. (See 12.09pm.) That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. There's been a mixed reaction from green groups to Nick Clegg's environment speech. Here's a round-up of all the responses to it that I've seen. From David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK Nick Clegg should be applauded first and foremost for making such a positive speech on the environment. This is especially welcome when some other senior politicians have been quiet - or even negative - about the opportunities for creating jobs and growth from protecting nature, tackling climate change and going green. As the deputy prime minister alluded to, green is not an alternative to growth, it is a vehicle for growth. It is the low carbon and wider green economy that has surged ahead at a time when growth has been anaemic elsewhere. This growth can continue, if our political leaders create a supportive environment for long-term green investment. Mr Clegg’s speech is also a recognition of a clear political truth, which is that Liberal Democrat voters and potential voters want to see environmental leadership from his party. He has eighteen months remaining until the general election to make leadership on climate change, support for the green economy and protection of our under pressure natural environment central to the record of a government that we were promised would be the greenest ever. Today is a good start: there is much to do. From Andy Atkins, Friends of the Earth's executive director Nick Clegg says he wants to champion the environment, but he’ll be judged on actions not words. If Liberal Democrats want to repair their battered green credentials they must show greater resolve – starting with a cast iron guarantee that they will defend the UK’s crucial climate targets. The reality is that far from making low-carbon the corner stone of the economy, Liberal Democrats have voted down a target to decarbonise the UK power sector and are allowing the Coalition to suck the life out of our once vibrant green sector. Nick Clegg must do much better if he wants to convince the electorate that the environment is safe in his hands. From Paul King, chief executive of the UK Green Building Council. The UK-GBC is particularly concerned about suggestions that the stop using energy bills to fund the Energy Companies Obligation (ECO). ECO funds energy saving measures for poor families. Nick Clegg’s words of support for action on climate change are hugely welcome, but there is a fragile industry and fuel poor households out there that need firm commitments on energy efficiency. Lib Dems in Government are quick to distance themselves from their Tory counterparts on the environment, but if that rhetoric is to mean anything, they need to grasp this opportunity and draw a line in the sand on ECO. Poor planning by government has already led to a massive drop in energy efficiency installations in our most vulnerable homes, and 7000 jobs have been lost. To scale back, or fundamentally change track on ECO now will devastate the only industry that can guarantee immediate and permanent reductions people’s energy bills. Then where will we be next year, when bills inevitably continue to rise? And here is some political reaction From Michael Dugher, Labour's Cabinet Office spokesman Nick Clegg may try and duck responsibility, but he can't escape the truth: he has totally failed on the green agenda in government. After so many broken promises people will judge Nick Clegg on what he does, not what he says. No matter how many painfully transparent attempts he makes to ‘differentiate’ himself and the Lib Dems from the Tories, Clegg and Cameron are joined at the hip. Their shared record is one of failure. Just as they have failed to tackle the cost of living crisis, the Lib Dems have failed to stand up to the energy firms or to stand up for the environment. We were promised this would be the “greenest government ever”, but on Nick Clegg and David Cameron’s watch investment in clean energy has hit a seven year low, fewer people are making their homes more energy efficient and low carbon emissions are rising. From David Cameron's spokesman at Number 10 This is the government that was the first anywhere in the world to introduce a Green Investment Bank, and the first in a generation to secure investment in a new nuclear power station, and the support that that we give to companies that are working in the green sector, with Vince Cable announcing more support today in the context of greener and lower-emission vehicles. I would just point to some of these things as to why the prime minister strongly believes that this is a government that has made huge steps forward in environmental policy. As the election gets closer, Nick Clegg and David Cameron are succumbing more and more to the gravitational pull of party politics. There used to be a time when their ministerial speeches were relatively free of party politics. But now it is not unusual to see them deliver a speech in a Whitehall setting that is overtly partisan, and today's environment speech from Clegg is a good example. Conscious, perhaps, that the main charge against the Lib Dems remains that they broke their promises on tuition fees, you can read it as a sustained attack on the Conservatives for abandoning the \"Vote blue, go green\" philosophy that was once at the heart of Cameron's politics. It's not a bad speech. I can't find it on the Cabinet Office website yet, but here are the main points. • Clegg claimed that the Conservatives and Labour were both abandoning their support for environmentalism. These days, across much of the Westminster village at least, the environment is being written off by campaign chiefs on both left and right: too expensive in hard times; a distraction from more pressing debates. On no other issue has the political establishment proved more fickle. The same Conservative and Labour politicians who used to shout at one another across the Despatch Box: ‘you don’t care about the environment, we’re the greenest’ now turn the accusation on its head: ‘you care too much about the environment, you’re the greenest’ ... And the upshot of all of this? That the green consensus across the political parties is, I’m afraid, falling away. • He said senior Conservatives were becoming more hostile to the green agenda. In government the Lib Dems were having to resist this, he said. Senior members of the Conservative party now openly attack environmental policies as anti-growth, as well as publicly question the threat of climate change ... I was as pleasantly surprised as you were, back in 2010, to hear a Conservative Leader declare he wanted this to be the greenest government ever. And every day my colleagues and I are working hard to hold our coalition partners to their word. • He claimed that Labour's plan for an energy price freeze was not green because it would cut investment in renewables. Labour’s promise to temporarily freeze energy bills – as well as being a con, with energy companies bound to hike up prices both before and after – would also be a huge blow to our renewables sector – spooking investors and threatening billions of pounds worth of investment in green energy. The only thing green about this policy is its naivety. Labour have undermined what was their one and only green pledge – a decarbonisation target – with a policy that would damage the very industry needed to deliver it. They’re abandoning the environment to score a few populist points. It’s utterly Janus-faced. • He said the Lib Dems' commitment to the green agenda was \"as strong as it ever was\". The Liberal Democrats are now the only one of the three main parties which still sees the environment as a priority, and we take our responsibilities extremely seriously here. • He defended the government's lobbying bill, and cited the need to protect the Green party as an example of why strict controls on election spending by non-partisan campaigning organisations were needed. The legislation the government has put forward does not in any way affect the day to day work of charities. All it seeks to do is to make sure that people with very deep pockets cannot distort the democratic process, subverting the legitimate role of democratic parties. Let me give you an example. At the moment you could have the oil industry going down to Brighton Pavilion and saying, “Don’t vote for the Greens, because the lights will go out if they get re-elected”. Nothing stops big oil from basically hijacking the Brighton Pavilion electoral contest. This kind of thing is not an idle threat – we have seen it in the US and here at the last General Election spending by non-party organisations doubled. So we have to act. • He said the reaction to his plan for a 5p plastic bag tax was universally positive - contrary to what he had been told to expect. This showed people did still care about green issues, he said. A few weeks ago, I announced a 5p charge on throw-away plastic bags. I cannot tell you how many people advised me against it. I was warned that this was the wrong time. It would be presented in the media as a tax on hardworking people. I would look out of touch. Yet every single person I have spoken to about it since has told me they support the move. Even the few who have grumbled to me that they would have preferred Government to foot the cost have still agreed: if it reduces the carrier bags blighting our countryside and harming our wildlife – which it will – it’s a small price to pay. • He said seeing green measures as anti-growth was a mistake. We must never, ever talk about consumers as if they are somehow divorced from the wider economy. The UK’s green industry is worth around £128 billion and employs almost a million people. We’re relieved when we hear that the economy is expected to grow this year by 1.4%. Well between 2011 and 2012, the low carbon and renewable sector grew by around 3% and it’s expected to keep on growing. So whenever someone tells you that we can’t afford to go green, correct them: we can’t afford not to. If you are for the environment, you are for cutting bills, growing our economy and creating jobs ... My Coalition partners talk a lot about winning the global race. Well, this is one area where we are in pole position and it would be a huge mistake to take our foot off the pedal now: economic myopia of the worst kind. • He announced plans to promote the use of electric cars. Elon Musk, a pioneer of electric vehicles in the US and CEO of Telsa Motors, will advise the government on \"how we can reach the UK tipping point for electric vehicles more quickly\", Clegg said. And he said he was launching a \"call for evidence\" to find ways of promoting demand for electric cars. I especially want to hear from fleet purchasers, and that includes those in the private and public sector, cab companies and others about what they would need to make the jump from buying low emission to specifically ultra-low emission vehicles. We already have some excellent tax incentives to help drive adoption of this technology in the crucial fleet sector. But what else can we do? If we get this right, we can help secure the UK’s position as a global leader in ultra low emission vehicles, and that would be a huge boon for our economy, and our environment too. • He said the Lib Dems were looking at the case for setting up a statutory body to advise the government on the natural environment. It could operate like the committee on climate change, he suggested. • He said the Lib Dems wanted the Green Investment Bank to be allowed to borrow on the markets \"as early as possible in the next parliament\". • He said the government would introduce a new national pollinator strategy next spring to protect the country's bees. The Commons standards committee has published a report this morning criticising Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader. The parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Hudson, launched an inquiry into allegations that he arranged a meeting that amounted to lobbying for money, and that he failed to register donations and declare financial interests. She cleared him of the lobbying charge (the most serious one), but did find that he had broken the rules about registering donations and declaring interests. Here's an extract from the report. We agree with the Commissioner that that meeting Mr Hughes arranged to discuss a local development did not constitute a breach of the lobbying rules. There was no attempt to conceal the donations to Mr Hughes's local party, which were reported to the Electoral Commission, although there was a failure to include them in the Register of Members' Financial Interests, and a failure to declare interests. The publication of the Commissioner's memorandum sets on record Mr Hughes's failures to declare appropriately. Mr Hughes apologised at the outset of the Commissioner's investigation, has since apologised to the Committee, and has taken steps to reduce the chance that such mistakes will occur in future. We recommend that he now registers any outstanding interests; late registrations will appear in bold italics. Nonetheless we are concerned that a Member of Mr Hughes's seniority and experience should have failed to observe The Code of Conduct over such a long period and failed to seek advice from the Registrar. We recommend that Mr Hughes apologise by way of a Personal Statement to the House. Hughes has just apologised in a statement to the Commons. \"I take full responsibility for these failures and apologise unreservedly to the House,\" he said. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's papers, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads, here the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories in the papers and here's the New Statesman's list of top 10 comment articles. And here are four articles I found particularly interesting. • James Kirkup in the Daily Telegraph says Britons pay the highest property taxes in the developed world. UK residents are paying twice as much as the international average, a report by the influential think tank Policy Exchange found. Property taxes in Britain cost the equivalent of 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product – around £70 billion — in 2011, the think tank said. The OECD average is 1.8 per cent. Separate figures showed that house buyers in the UK are being forced to pay ever higher sums in stamp duty as the Government attempts to cash in on a rising housing market. The average amount paid on housing sales is on course to reach £6,700, up from less than £4,200 in 2007-08, the Council of Mortgage Lenders reported. • Kat Lay and Laura Pitel in the Times (paywall) say that one of the whisteblowers in the controversy about alleged vote-rigging by Unite in Falkirk \"is standing by her account, casting doubt on Ed Miliband’s decision to drop an inquiry into the affair.\" Michelle Hornall was one of about half a dozen people who claimed to have been signed up to Labour without their knowledge. Her evidence helped to trigger an inquiry into the conduct of the union in the constituency, and forced Mr Miliband to pledge to recast his party’s relationship with the trade unions. Mrs Hornall maintains that she was signed up to Labour by Stephen Deans, the chairman of the local constituency party and a Unite convener, without her consent and using her maiden name, which she has not used since she was 20. Mr Deans has since resigned his union role ... Her mother, Lorraine, was one of the original whistleblowers who claimed Unite tried to rig votes. Mrs Hornall has declined to talk directly to the press about what happened to her, but her husband, Steven Hornall, spoke out for the first time to provide her version of events. He claimed that she had been signed up to the party during a meeting between her father and Mr Deans, who is a relative of the family, in a pub last year. Mr Hornall suggested that Mr Deans had paid for the membership ... He added that he blamed Mr Deans for dragging the Kane family into the scandal. “Stevie Deans has not even been in touch to see how they are doing. This is all one man’s doing and it is our family being harassed over it.” • Andrew Grice in the Independent says Labour is losing support amongst people who voted Lib Dem in 2010. Labour is losing the backing of the Liberal Democrat supporters who flocked to it after Nick Clegg formed the Coalition with the Conservatives, according to The Independent's latest \"poll of polls\". At the start of this year, about 39 per cent of people who voted Lib Dem at the 2010 election said they would now back Labour. But the figure has now dropped to about 29 per cent. The trend might help to explain why Labour's lead over the Tories has shrunk from 13 points in February to five points, and why it has not grown significantly since Mr Miliband announced his popular pledge to freeze energy prices for 20 months at the party's conference in September. That has set the political agenda since and boosted Mr Miliband's previously weak personal ratings. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, who compiled the \"poll of polls\", said Labour's loss of support among Lib Dem 2010 voters is big enough to cost it almost 2.5 per cent of the total vote - which could prove crucial in a tight general election. • Digby Jones, the former CBI director general and former trade minister, says in an article in the Times (paywall) that Britain should leave the European Union unless it can secure major changes. The Prime Minister’s plan to negotiate reform and then ask the British people to affirm or reject continuing membership would create a long period of uncertainty for business. It would be better to hold a referendum as soon as possible and end the uncertainty. David Cameron will get minor adjustments here and there but he won’t get the sort of reform upon which our future membership should be conditional. If anyone, the CBI included, thinks that fundamental reform is on the EU agenda, they are deluding themselves. Leaving is not, as some pretend, such an unattractive option. There is a lie put about that three million jobs depend on our continued membership. Not true. There would be free trade agreements in place the day after our exit. Germany would demand no less. We would be free to negotiate, at more than the current glacial pace, free trade agreements with the rest of the world ... Staying in a reformed Europe has to be the right course, but should we stay in the current mess? Frankly, our nation just can’t afford to if we are to provide our grandchildren with a globally competitive economy worthy of the name. Here's Peter Walker's Guardian story about Nick Clegg accusing Jeremy Paxman of a \"total abdication of responsibility\". (See 9.45am.) For the record, here are today's YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 40% (no change from YouGov yesterday) Conservatives: 33% (down 1) Ukip: 12% (up 1) Lib Dems: 9% (up 1) Labour lead: 7 points (up 1) Government approval: -25 (up 1) According to Electoral Calculus, this would give Labour a majority of 90. According to a survey by the Local Government Chronicle, a third of councils are planning to defy the government next year and raise council tax. That includes a majority of county councils. Here's an extract from the LGC's story. The decision of Conservative county leaders to reject the advice and financial incentives of their own coalition government comes ten months after county leaders wrote to the prime minister complaining of a “fractious” relationship with ministers. One Tory leader told LGC that the mood amongst colleagues had not improved in the months since the letter was sent. A realisation of the threat indicated in our survey would mean council tax increases in Conservative heartlands in the run up to the 2015 general election. Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, has put out a statement today claiming that government efficiency measures have saved the taxpayer £5.4bn. Here's an extract from the news release. New half-year savings figures of £5.4 billion demonstrate the ambitious work to make Whitehall more efficient and effective. The Efficiency and Reform Group is continuing to work with departments towards delivering savings of £20 billion by 2015 in 4 key areas, which at this half-year point includes: £1.8 billion by linking together departments to buy goods and services and enforcing sensible controls on the use of consultants £0.6 billion by improving online services, and raising money through selling empty buildings and exiting expensive rentals in sought-after locations £0.7 billion by reviewing and reshaping large scale projects (including construction) and stripping out inefficiencies £2.3 billion by reducing the size of the civil service and reforming civil service pensions What's particularly interesting about the news release, though, is that it is the first one I've seen from a government department quoting the TaxPayers' Alliance. It includes this quote from Jonathan Isaby, The TPA's political director. The savings which have now been announced are a sad testament to the fact that for too long politicians have been wasting billions of pounds a year that could instead have been left in taxpayers’ pockets. But there is no room for complacency and the Efficiency and Reform Group must now redouble its efforts to identify further savings that will cut out waste, reduce bureaucracy and ease the burden on hard-pressed taxpayers. Government news releases are supposed to be above party politics (although, of course, they are inherently political). The TPA is not a party political body. But (as readers of this blog love reminding me, whenever I quote it) it is not exactly neutral either. It is strongly rightwing, and highly ideological. It is odd to see it quoted approvingly in a press release drafted by civil servants. In the footnotes, the press notice also includes an interesting qualifier about the reliability of the £5.4bn figure. These savings figures are not national or official statistics; they are management information evidenced, normally, by department reports. These figures have not been assured by our internal auditors or the National Audit Office. The splash in today's Times says that Iain Duncan Smith intervened to try to ensure that today's damning report from the public accounts committee into universal credit blamed Robert Devereux, the permanent secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions. Here's an extract from Jill Sherman's story (paywall). Iain Duncan Smith tried to shift the blame for a £140 million waste of taxpayers’ money on to his senior civil servant by attempting to influence an MPs’ report, The Times understands ... Mr Duncan Smith and members of his parliamentary team are understood to have approached at least three Tory MPs on the cross-party committee to ask them to ensure that Robert Devereux, Permanent Secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions, was singled out for censure. The MPs were asked to make sure that the report “heaped blame on to the Permanent Secretary” and that “Robert Devereux was to be associated with the key failings”, a source said ... Sources close to the committee confirmed that the report, originally due to be published on Tuesday, was delayed for two days while MPs debated its contents and argued the case for Mr Devereux to be criticised. The remaining MPs on the committee refused to agree, and in the final report Mr Devereux is mentioned only once, by his title as “accounting officer”. The source said: “It was obvious there was some kind of co-ordinated effort going on. Some of the Conservative members wanted us to be much tougher on the Permanent Secretary than the rest of us were comfortable with.” Duncan Smith has denied asking for Devereux to be named in the report. A spokeswoman for the work and pensions secretary said this: Iain has not asked for anyone to be named in the report. He has publicly supported the Department for Work and Pensions permanent secretary throughout this whole process. But Margaret Hodge, the committee chair, has been more equivocal. This is what she said when asked about it on BBC News. Iain Duncan Smith didn't approach me. Beyond that I can't comment. Call Clegg is now over. It won't be competing with the intelligence and security committee hearing for the front pages. On Twitter the Clegg answer that attracted the most interest is the one about Clegg buying his underwear from M&amp;S. (I felt I would spare you the details.) But his swipe at Jeremy Paxman was worth reporting. (See 9.35am.) Recently he had a go at Lord Sugar on this programme. It's turning into Bash a Celebrity. Q: What do you make of Jeremy Paxman saying he did not vote? Clegg says Paxman is paid almost £1m. He lives off politics. But then he sneers at it too. Of course politics is not perfect. But sneering at it like Paxman is \"a total abdication of responsibility\", he says. Q: Shouldn't we stop having general elections and replace them with a permanent coalition? That would stop governments coming in and reversing what the previous one did. Clegg is not in favour of that. Opponents of this coalition would not be happy with the idea of a permanent one, he says. People should have a choice. But he says, on some issues, parties need to take decisions that stretch across parliaments. HS2 is a good example. Labour launched the idea, but now they are playing party politics with it. Q: How high should the population be allowed to rise? To 90m? To 100m? Clegg says he will not put a figure on it. The immigration system should be welcoming to people coming here to contribute. But it should stamp out illegality, and there should be proper checks on who is coming in and who is going out. Q: Why is the probation service being privatised? Clegg says the public probation service will remain in charge of the most serious offenders. But he does not accept that the system cannot be improved. Q: Do you do your fair share of household chores? Clegg says he is diligent about doing things with the children, getting them ready for school, helping with their homework. But he can't pretend that it's 50:50 with the household chores. Women are entitled to feel that this is unfair. Q: How much is your energy bill? Clegg says he won't say. Q: But you claimed £254 to heat your second home? Clegg says he does not see why he should say how much he pays to heat his own home. He rents a flat in Sheffield. The costs of that are paid through his expenses. Q: Should you be allowed to claim £254 for this? Clegg says you have to ask whether it is right for MPs to have help with the costs of a second home. Those expenses are now funded by the independent parliamentary standards authority. They set the rates. If Ipsa did not fund second homes, then only rich people would be able to become MPs. It would become a \"gentleman's sport\". Q: How has the recession directly affected you? Not as much as other people, Clegg says. He says he and his wife Miriam both have well paid jobs. Q: So you are not affected one iota? Clegg says it has not affected his family as much as other people. The caller says this shows Clegg has not been affected. Q: How many more deaths do we need before you bring in tighter controls on dogs? Clegg says the government is already tightening the laws on dangerous dogs. What else do you have in mind, he asks. Q: More laws to make people behave responsibly? Clegg challenges the caller to explain what he is proposing. Q: Do you think Islam is being unfairly attacked, in view of Ken Clarke's comments about the burqa? Clegg says he thinks Clarke is one of the most moderate people he knows. Clegg says his view is that people should be allowed to wear what they like. But, Clegg says, Clarke was just talking about there being some circumstances, such as courts, where wearing a burqa is not appropriate. Q: What's your view on the living wage? Clegg says he is in favour of people paying the living wage. But he is sceptical about using compulsion to enforce it. In a reference to Labour's proposal, he says he is not convinced a one-off tax break of £1,000 will encourage firms to start paying the living wage. But he is interested in increasing the value of the minimum wage. Vince Cable's Business Department is looking at this, he says. Q: Are you satisfied with a 20% failure rate for Tpims? Clegg says he is not satisfied with that. But Tpims are better than control orders. Q: Under control orders people were relocated. That does not happen under Tpims. Doesn't that make a difference? Clegg says the latest abscondee got away because he put on a burqa. That could have happened anywhere, he says. Q: So you don't see relocating being an issue? Clegg says if you cannot prosecute someone in court, there is a limit to how much you can curtail their freedom. The first question is about Tpims. Given that two people have absconded, are they a waste of money? Clegg launches into a long explanation of how they came to be set up. Control orders were not effective, he says, because they were constantly being challenged by the courts. The Tpim legislation is more legally robust, he suggests. The big event at Westminster today is the intelligence and security committee hearing, which will see Britain's three leading spooks being questioned in public by parliamentarians for the first time. But I will be leaving that to my colleague Paul Owen who has been writing an excellent live blog about global reaction to the Guardian's revelations about the National Security Agency and GCHQ. Today's hearing is likely to focus on the questions raised by the revelations, based on leaked documents obtained by Edward Snowden, and it makes sense for Paul to cover it. Instead I've got Nick Clegg being grilled by LBC listeners, which will perhaps not be quite so sensational, but which will be worth monitoring anyway. Here's the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, announces half-yearly efficiency savings in the civil service. 9am: Nick Clegg hosts his Call Clegg LBC phone-in. From 9am: David Laws, the schools minister, and Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, speak at the Westminster Education Forum conference on pupil attainment. 10am: Clegg gives a speech on the environment. As Fiona Harvey and Damian Carrington report, he will inflame coalition tensions on Thursday when he calls on David Cameron to hold his nerve on climate change, describing the prime minister's recent scepticism about renewable energy as \"economic myopia of the worst kind\". 11am: Theresa May, the home secretary, gives a speech on police reform and police and crime commissioners. 2pm: The heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ are questioned in public together for the first time when they give evidence to the intelligence and security committee. I won't be covering it, but instead my colleague Paul Owen will covering it on the NSA files live blog. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a summary at lunchtime and I will be wrapping up at about 2pm, earlier than usual, because I've got meetings this afternoon. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/david-king-uk-economy-crisis-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-15T12:17:00Z","webTitle":"Sir David King lambasts Treasury for preventing green economic recovery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/david-king-uk-economy-crisis-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/david-king-uk-economy-crisis-policy","fields":{"headline":"Sir David King lambasts Treasury for preventing green economic recovery","bodyText":"There are not many things that render Sir David King, the former UK Government's chief scientific adviser, momentarily speechless. But all he can do is raise his arms and shrug when asked to find a compelling reason for the UK Treasury's continuing refusal to support the green economy. On reflection, he says the only explanation for their opposition to what he considers a \"no brainer\" is that government economists are blinkered by a laissez faire ideology which he believes will inevitably drive the UK further into long-term economic decline. Re-enforcing this is the government's fundamentalist approach to deficit reduction and lack of political leadership and courage to develop a new and resilient economic model, rather than trying to do the equivalent of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. \"Inertia is the big problem,\" King tells the Guardian. \"We do what our grandfathers did rather than thinking forward.\" King says the government needs to understand that at a time when one narrow form of logic dictates that we should be slashing budgets to deal with the deficit, the more courageous path is to recognise that this is the very moment to invest. Facing up to social, environmental and economic challenges While the government is not for turning on ideological grounds, King is hopeful that it will be forced to change its policies on the basis of political expediency as voters become increasingly frustrated at the austerity drive. \"We have to do something apparently paradoxical,\" he says. \"Our economies are in deficit, we have a financial and debt crisis along with the financial demands of a transition into an economy which is much more resource efficient, which is taking opportunities to market that de-couples us from oil dependence. \"My solution is that we need the financial community, which is sitting on large sums of money, coming together with government to create stimulus funding to move us out of the crisis and use government direction to head us towards transforming the economy. This has got to be phrased as a massive opportunity. If we sit on our hands and invest in gold, which is a way of not making good use of funds, this will continue to worsen. \"To switch from an oil-based transport sector to an electricity-based transport sector, we need to de-fossilise our electricity. The private sector needs to see that this is the biggest missed opportunity for wealth creation in our economies.\" While King, who is director of the Oxford-based Smith School, points to a growing number of companies that have understood the need to face up to social, environmental and economic challenges, he says the \"more difficult thing is overcoming the position of power of economists. \"The Treasury civil servants are heavily driven by traditional dogma that we do not support winners but let them emerge in the market place. This is one time when we can no longer let this philosophy dominate and that is a tremendous job to be done. I know, just look at the scars on my back from my time in government.\" He contrasts the UK with South Korea which has become a technological powerhouse, with global companies emerging because of government intervention. He likes to point out that Rolls Royce, which we hail today as one of the great British engineering success stories, would have gone out of business had it not been for public support when it was bankrupt. Funding the green economy King says that the difficulty in funding the green economy is not a lack of money but a lack of confidence. Record gold prices are an indication that investors are fleeing to safety because they do not feel governments are providing the necessary long-term regulatory frameworks or incentives to give them the confidence to invest in emerging new technologies. He believes this can be countered by the government taking a more proactive role in creating public private partnerships. \"Venture capital companies focused on sustainable investment are finding it difficult to make money and we are fully aware of this,\" he admits. \"But I think the solution is for governments to set out a clear pathway and to invest in that pathway as then the finance will follow through.\" He gives the example of the Energy Technologies Institute he set up when he was in government. He convinced Gordon Brown to invest £500m on the basis this would be match-funded by the private sector. He found the other half within six months. To move this partnership agenda forward, King is using his position at the Smith School to next month bring together 250 of the world's most influential politicians, investors and business leaders from developed and developing countries to debate how to re-direct funds into the green economy. Those who have already registered for ReSource 2012 represent more than $4tn in assets. Transition from an oil based economy King says that the government needs to particularly focus on resource efficiency because commodity prices are rising rapidly, with no sign of a let up, and this will push the UK and other developed countries further into debt unless urgently addressed. \"We have a western financial crisis and what is fundamentally different from the 1920s and early 30s is that the downturn is not global,\" he says. \"We've still got the emerging economies growing rapidly so demand for commodities is pushing prices sky high. A growing population, now at seven billion, is also putting pressure on prices. It is crisis time. \"If we do not address this, there will be a continuing destabilisation of the global economy and western economies that are already in debt will come out worst as their balance of payments deteriorate. Countries like China can afford to soak up these costs. The Eastern spring is coupled with a Western autumn.\" While the price of food and minerals is of concern, what particularly worries King is our continuing dependence on oil. He points out that the Italian balance of payments was in the black in 2000 but has now gone 38 billion euros in the red, of which 34 billion is due to the increased cost of imported oil since the turn of the millennia. With the UK moving towards increasing oil dependency from imports due to the fall in North Sea oil production, he sees a time in the none too distant future when we are hit by an extra annual bill of 40 billion euros for oil imports, at today's price. He is despairing of the attitude of the Treasury, which he says \"is unconvinced about the argument that the solution for the energy sector is to provide energy within the nation. There has been a tremendous hoo-ha in government about the agreement with Norway to provide gas and oil to the UK. \"That is a good idea to have a secure gas supply but the notion is that we can import all the oil and gas as much as we need? Our economy cannot afford it.\" He recalls the last time he discussed with one of the Treasury chief economists about the need to reduce our oil dependency. \"The chief economist challenged me by saying Italy is not Britain, and we can control the value of the pound on the currency markets but I pointed out that devaluing the pound will improve our export capability but as soon as we do that we increase the import cost of oil. That was the end of the discussion.\" The power of big money King recognises that the power of the fossil fuel lobby is making it hard to make progress but he believes their power is at a high point and will soon start to wane. \"The power of big money has been incredibly successful in destabilising the transition, even more successful than the doubt that was sown between smoking and cancer,\" he says. \"The scientific community felt very battered by the University of East Anglia climate revelations but they continue to beaver away showing predictions for the next 20 years ago are even worse than predicted and we are faced with a human existential crisis. \"That will be the force that will bubble through. There is only so long you can deny that cigarette smoking is not linked to cancer until it becomes absurd.\" For the UK, he believes that developing our nuclear power capacity has to be the way forward but King vents his frustration at David Cameron, the prime minister, and the Chancellor George Osborne for not showing more leadership in developing new nuclear capacity, given the fact that we have enough stored uranium and plutonium to power a new generation of reactors. A long term vision is required He also believes it is imperative to fund other major infrastructure projects, such as the Severn Barrage, which would provide three gigawatts of electricity and still run in 200 years with minimum maintenance. \"The problem is that the longest time an economist will work on investment returns is 25 years. We need to look at taking a much longer view. What is missing is clear direction from number 10 and 11. \"The Climate Change Committee was asked to set up carbon budgets out to 2025 precisely to give confidence to investors was meant to give an assurance that if you invest in alternative energy – this will be an investment that will pay back. That needs the Treasury to back that up but I fear that we are seeing back sliding.\" King is famous for saying shortly after 9/11 that climate change was more challenging than terrorism. He says he created that \"sound bite\" because he felt climate change was not on the public agenda and wanted to create interest in the media and says we need many more people in positions of authority to raise their voices and create a stir. While he sees many challenges ahead, he remains optimistic that change is possible: \"Human ingenuity is the answer. We created the science and engineering technological revolution on which all our wellbeing is based. \"That same keen intelligence can point to the solutions to the hangover challenges and this requires nothing less than another renaissance. Rampant consumerism for the goal of status is not fit for purpose.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, who became Egypt's de facto leader when the army took power following the toppling of Hosni Mubarak last February, used an address to the nation to announce that the state of emergency – used by both the Mubarak regime and the ruling generals that replaced him to repress dissent and shield security forces from accountability – would be suspended, meeting one of the main demands of the revolution that erupted a year ago on 25 January. But Tantawi said an exception would be made for acts of \"thuggery\", an ill-defined category of crime that critics claim can be used to violate the legal rights of any citizen. In the first sign of potential conflict between the military council and Egypt's newly inaugurated parliament, which opened its doors this week, human rights campaigners called on MPs to face down the unelected generals and insist on a genuine roll-back of repressive laws. \"From our perspective, the state of emergency has not been lifted,\" Hossam Bahgat, director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, told the Guardian. \"Tantawi's speech does nothing to deal with the most harmful aspect of the state of emergency, which is allowing the police to retain powers to stop, search and detain anyone they suspect of being a 'thug', without having to obtain a judicial warrant. \"His comments are no different from Mubarak's repeated promise to only apply the state of emergency to terrorism and drug trafficking, a promise that was routinely violated and only led to the creation of a state of exceptionality that put the police above the law,\" Bahgat added. \"We call on the new parliament to reject this decree and insist on nothing less than the full and immediate lifting of the state of emergency and a return to normal civilian law.\" Security measures were ramped up at government buildings as Egyptian authorities braced themselves for what is expected to be one of the biggest outbreaks of popular unrest since the fall of Mubarak on Wednesday. In an apparent attempt to dampen the energy of revolutionaries, the Supreme Council of Armed Forces has announced a series of official celebrations including military parades, air shows, a specially commissioned operetta and the distribution of prize coupons to citizens on the streets. But anti-junta demonstrators have vowed to ignore the planned events and instead hold marches and rallies in several cities demanding an immediate end to military rule. \"We are not going down to the streets to celebrate,\" said Ahmed Emam, a member of the Popular Alliance party, at a press conference last week. \"We are going down to continue our revolution. We will not celebrate while the blood of the martyrs hasn't dried yet.\" On Tuesday new fortifications continued to be added to downtown Cairo's state television building, which was surrounded by barbed wire and armed soldiers and was expected to be a rallying point for protesters. Some high-end hotels in the city were boarding up their windows in expectation of violent clashes, and several airlines cancelled flights to Egypt on the anniversary. The US embassy has warned its citizens to steer clear of the centre of the capital. Trouble erupted in the Sinai peninsula after a group of bedouin tribesmen stormed a tourist resort in an effort to reclaim land. It was the latest in a string of clashes between the Egyptian state and local communities whose expectations of social justice have intensified with the revolution and who view the present political instability as an opportunity to redress longstanding grievances. Egyptian media reports claimed that dozens of armed gunmen took control of Aqua Sun, a Red Sea hotel complex boasting a mile and a quarter of private beaches to the south of Taba, and were demanding a £425,000 ransom in exchange for leaving the site peacefully. No tourists were staying in the resort at the time, and the lives of several Egyptian security guards taken hostage during the incident were not believed to be in danger. Disputes over land have been common in the Sinai since the central government embarked on a \"Red Sea riviera\" programme of resort construction along the eastern coast in the 1990s. Customary law was replaced by a new system of land ownership and large swathes of previously bedouin-controlled coastal areas were sold to private investors under the auspices of the state, leading to allegations by some locals that they were being cheated out of their property. Egyptian officials say it is difficult to mount any police or military response given the constraints imposed upon Egypt as a result of its peace treaty with Israel, which regulates the amount of security personnel the government can deploy to this sensitive border region. The relationship between the two countries became a significant political issue during the Egyptian parliamentary election campaign, but no major party has seriously suggested withdrawing from the 1978 Camp David accord. \"The bedouin are among the many marginalised groups in Egypt pressing for their rights since the revolution began last year,\" said Elijah Zarwan, a Cairo-based political analyst. \"There's long been a security vacuum in the Sinai and now on top of that you have a more generalised security vacuum throughout Egypt. It's no wonder that the bedouins, who are often well armed, feel emboldened to press for their rights more forcefully.\" This month residents in the Mediterranean coastal town of Dabaa broke through the security perimeter of a large government-owned site earmarked for a future nuclear power plant and blew up several under-construction buildings, including one that was believed to be the reactor. The Mubarak-era nuclear project has long attracted fierce opposition from the local community, who say they have been deceived on multiple occasions by the authorities and are now intent on reclaiming the land for themselves. Last week it emerged that some protesters had stolen radioactive material from the site, following clashes between security forces and protesters that left dozens injured. On Monday the government vowed to press ahead with the nuclear plant regardless, warning locals against any more \"violations of state-owned property\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/29/nuclear-industry-uk-expansion-king","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-28T23:29:50Z","webTitle":"British nuclear industry needs overhaul before it can expand, says top scientist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/29/nuclear-industry-uk-expansion-king","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/29/nuclear-industry-uk-expansion-king","fields":{"headline":"British nuclear industry needs overhaul before it can expand, says top scientist","bodyText":"The UK's nuclear industry is in no shape to cope with a large-scale reactor building programme and must be overhauled if the coalition wants to push ahead with its nuclear expansion plans, according to the former government chief scientist. The industry is better equipped to manage the decline and decommissioning of existing nuclear plants, rather than set up new ones, a study led by Sir David King has concluded. If Britain is to deal with its nuclear waste, as well as build new reactors, then more waste must be recycled. But this would mean keeping open and even expanding the controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield, which was shut down for more than two years, from 2005 to 2008, because of a serious, though contained, leak of radioactive liquid inside the plant. That was the longest of several shutdowns in recent years at the plant, which has been dogged with problems and has never run at full capacity. \"The structure of the UK nuclear industry, having been designed to address the rundown of nuclear power in the UK, is not well suited to the changed situation involving new nuclear build and an expanded UK nuclear role, and there is a need for realignment of policy across the sector,\" the report found. The study came against a backdrop of continuing problems at the Fukushima power station in Japan, where a partial meltdown of the nuclear core may have occurred. The report entitled A low carbon nuclear future: Economic assessment of nuclear materials and spent nuclear fuel management in the UK, was delayed by two weeks because of the Japanese accident, but was not rewritten in the light of those events. Greenpeace last night. \"Previous governments failed experiments at Sellafield mean that producing this sort of highly radioactive fuel has already cost the British taxpayer billions,\" said Doug Parr, the green campaigning group's chief scientist. \"By reprocessing nuclear waste and turning it into fuel, you create even more nuclear waste than you would otherwise have to deal with anyway. Reprocessing would also lead to increased multi-billion pound taxpayer handouts to the nuclear industry, and that's before you consider what it would mean for our ability to constrain nuclear weapons proliferation around the world.\" Parr added: \"A recent study by McKinsey and Imperial College showed that it's completely possible for more than 80% of Europe's power to come from clean, renewable sources. It simply isn't necessary to take on the risks inherent with using plutonium. If ministers choose to meet our energy needs through efficiency and renewable resources, it would spark a clean tech jobs boom which would help boost our economy and protect our environment.\" Sir David was a vocal advocate of nuclear power during his tenure as the government's chief scientist, arguing that the power source would be vital in generating low-carbon electricity to replace fossil fuels. After examining various scenarios including continuing to store the UK's spent fuel and other waste, the report's authors found that expanding Thorp would be the least risky and least costly way to deal with the problem and provide fuel for a new generation of reactors. Continuing to store all of the waste would be potentially costly, as the procedure would have to be underwritten by the government. But if some of it could be reprocessed, and more reactors are built to replace those aging stations that must be shut down, then the UK would have a readymade market for recycled fuel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/oct/04/hugh-muir-diary-justice-gloster","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-04T21:55:00Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/04/hugh-muir-diary-justice-gloster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/oct/04/hugh-muir-diary-justice-gloster","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"• Ding, ding. Day two of the high court struggle between Roman Abramovich and Boris Berezovsky. Berezovsky is suing Abramovich over the sale of shares. Very few people can make head or tail of it. Luckily canny Abramovich has chosen to be represented by Jonathan Sumption QC, once reputed to be the cleverest man in England. That's great for him, and great for Sumption, whose fees can reasonably be described as mind-boggling. But pity the poor judge in the case, Mrs Justice Gloster, who knows that once the case is over Sumption will be off to take up his already announced appointment to the supreme court. There was a time when barristers so elevated would stop court work, to avoid the possibility that judges they appeared before might be intimidated, so giving their clients an unfair advantage. But Sumption was given dispensation. Still: no pressure. All Mrs Justice Gloster has to do is ensure she doesn't make even the slightest mistake. • Off to Manchester then, and as Tories debate law and order, two questions: who was the pinstriped conference delegate pictured taking aim, as if firing a rifle. According to the Salford Star, the targets were those involved in Sunday's union protest. And who were the police officers, watching benignly? The Star prints the photo in the hope that someone might recognise the \"marksman\". Definitely antisocial behaviour. Still, Theresa May is on hand to make a citizen's arrest. • Much joshing, meanwhile, at the Nuclear Industry Association meeting led by the body's new chair – no less than John Hutton, former Labour energy minister. He made nice with 120 Tory delegates, scoffing dinner and cakes supplied by the power companies. All chums: Hutton opened the meeting saying he was \"very pleased to welcome my old friend Charles Hendry who has made an excellent job of energy minister. But not as good as I was\". For his part, Hendry said they should thank Hutton for initiating the next generation of nuclear power stations, adding \"I think Tony Blair deserves thanks as well\". Hendry said Hutton, Blair \"and myself were all born on the same day – 6th May\". That could mean something, it could mean nothing, but \"I think we were also all Conservatives at university\". Thereafter, in spirit. • And following those unfortunate scenes at last week's ResPublica fringe event at the Labour party conference, we spend a good time composing terms of reference for a full inquiry, the subject being: which audience member had the temerity to accuse Red Tory guru Phillip Blond of \"verbal masturbation\"? We had hopes that Yates of the Yard might chair it; – he who resigned from the Met amid concern about the phone-hacking scandal. Soon he will be just plain Yates. But the whole thing is now on hold, for out of the blue we get a call and it is Gordon D'Silva, the founder and CEO of Training for Life, who sees the offensive phrase in this diary and rings to claim authorship. \"Yes it was me,\" says D'Silva. \"Blond so obviously loved the sound of his own voice, so I said 'That sounds like verbal masturbation, and if that is so, what does that make you?'\" Honestly. We'd throw the book at him, but after the riots there's barely an inch free in our jails. • Finally, Neville Thurlbeck, the former NoW journalist who initiated employment proceedings against News International in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, titillated us all when he said: \"At the length, truth will out ... There is so much I could have said publicly to the detriment of News International but so far have chosen not to.\" Not everyone noticed that Neville was quoting Shakespeare. An erudite fellow, he was quoting Launcelot Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice while at the same time giving Rupert the shudders – \"Murder cannot be hid long; a man's son may, but at the length truth will out.\" Thurlbeck is a graduate in English and theatre studies from Lancaster University. Last year he returned to give a talk describing \"differing career challenges\" on the redtops.

The unprecedented intervention failed to prevent the country's main stock market index plunging by more than 6% on Monday, followed by a further 6% slump early this morning when markets opened, but is thought to have averted a steeper fall. Tokyo's Nikkei index dragged down shares across the world as investors worried that a decline in the world's third biggest economy would reduce the value of goods and services the country bought from overseas. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares slumped by nearly 1% and its Europe-wide equivalent fell by 1.06%. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.15% in afternoon trading, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 indices ended the day down 1.65% and 1.3% respectively. Analysts said European shares would probably have fallen further, if Brussels had not agreed at the weekend to increase the eurozone's bailout fund from around ¤250bn (£216bn) to ¤440bn, making a repeat of the Irish and Greek crises less likely. As Japanese workers battled to prevent a nuclear meltdown and the unrest continued in the Middle East, the price of oil and gas increased amid concerns that Japan, a country heavily dependent on nuclear energy, may need to significantly step up its consumption of fossil fuels. Japan typically gets about a third of its energy from nuclear power. It has seen its capacity reduced by more than a fifth by the country's worst earthquake, which has left 11 reactors out of action. Michala Marcussen, head of global economics at the French bank Societe Generale, said: \"Power supply is a critical factor. If power production output is damaged in a sustainable fashion, that could have a durable impact on the economy.\" The price of gas jumped by as much as 7.4% to the highest level since November 2008, while a barrel of Brent crude oil tumbled by $0.56, or 0.5%, to $113.28 at one stage before rising again slightly later. Gold jumped by as much as 1% to $1,431.89 (£885.34) an ounce and silver rose by more than 2% as rattled investors fled from any asset that looked risky into the relative safety of precious metals. The Japanese economy is expected to take a huge hit over the next few months as companies there, including foreign businesses such as GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug firm, temporarily cease production, with frequent disruptions expected to continue for weeks. Toyota, the world's largest carmaker, said that it would produce up to 40,000 fewer vehicles, as it closes 12 plants across the country until at least Wednesday night. The company will lose $72m for each day its operations are shut down in Japan. AIR Worldwide, the risk modelling agency, calculates that the global insurance bill for the earthquake will be $35bn (£22bn), while the total economic losses – insurance costs plus lost productivity – would add up to more than £62bn, according to the Equecat risk consultancy. Meanwhile, UK, European, US and Asian economies will also suffer, but to a far lesser degree, as exports to Japan fall. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHSGlobal Insight in New York, estimates the disaster could knock as much as 5% off Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter of the year – April to June – and between 0.3% and 0.5% over 2011 as a whole. The UK and the US are likely to see around 0.1% knocked off their GDP as a result of the disaster this year, with the Asian economies being hit \"about two or three times as hard as that\", Behravesh said. \"With these kind of disasters, the economy typically takes a big hit to start with but later benefits from huge levels of reconstruction activity. I would expect a significant slowdown in Japan in the second quarter but then there could be a significant rebound as soon as the third quarter.\" \"Purely in terms of economic growth, the damage as a result of the disasters and the reconstruction activity roughly cancel each other out,\" he added. \"It is a rich country with a lot of savings and can handle this.\" In Asia, the effect of the earthquake on the leading stock exchanges was mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose by 0.4% and China's Shanghai Composite edged up by 0.1%, with coal companies benefitting in particular on the hope that nuclear power problems in Japan would force the country to burn more fossil fuel at the same time as the expected frequent power cuts would allow Asian rivals to steal away some of its business. However, shares in Taiwan's TAIEX index fell by 0.56% to a three month low, on concern that the Japanese crisis would reduce tourists from the country as well as demand for exports. The earthquake also had a mixed impact on commodity prices. While some commodities increased, others, such as corn, cocoa, sugar, cotton and copper decreased, on concern that the decline of the Japanese economy would reduce demand for them. • This article was amended on 15 March 2011. The original said that Lloyd's of London calculates that the global insurance bill for the earthquake would be £31.7bn. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-death-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-19T10:55:55Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-il's death: an uneasy legacy | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-death-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-death-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-il's death: an uneasy legacy","bodyText":"To be honest, nobody knows for sure what may happen in North Korea following the sudden death of Kim Jong-il. A key part of the mercurial dictator's legacy is the dysfunctional secrecy that envelops the country like a dark funeral shroud. In equal measure, Kim threatened, and felt threatened by, the outside world. His personal insecurity translated into a national policy of paranoia. The first, pressing consideration for western countries, principally the US, which effectively guarantees South Korea's defence, will be whether Kim's designated heir and successor, his third son, Kim Jong-un, is able to assert and entrench his authority. State media today purposefully thrust Kim to the forefront of the nationwide mourning ceremonies, making clear that like his father and grandfather before him, he is the new \"dear leader\". This is both good and bad news. Western analysts have long warned of the dangers of a power vacuum and the possibly dangerous consequences of a struggle over the succession. Tensions with South Korea rose sharply in 1994 when Kim Jong-il took over from his father, Kim Il-sung, and unlike Kim Jong-un, who is in his 20s, he had two decades or more to prepare himself for the top job. It is highly significant that two days elapsed between Kim's death, reportedly of a heart attack during a train journey on Saturday, and today's public announcement of his demise. If powerful members of the extended ruling clan, or leading generals in the National Defence Commission (NDC), were going to successfully challenge the handover, they might have been expected to have done so by now. The unified stance presented to the world suggests there will be no destabilising internal coup-making, at least for now. But Kim Jong-un's ascendancy may prove to be contingent on his furnishing early proofs that he is up to the task. When his ailing father appeared to run into domestic turbulence at home last year, he resorted to the old trick of conjuring outside threats and externalising the problem. The result was the unprovoked sinking of a South Korean naval vessel and a brief bombardment, a year ago this month, of a South Korean island. Some reports at the time suggested Kim Jong-un was involved in, or even commanded, these attacks, as a way of proving his martial credentials. The worry now for South Korea, which has placed its armed forces on high alert, and for Seoul's American and Japanese allies, is that a fresh period of confrontation may be about to begin as Pyongyang's new leader attempts to demonstrate his authority. A second key consideration is the safety of North Korea's atomic weapons stockpile. Kim Jong-il's grisly signature achievement was to turn his country into an acknowledged nuclear power, conducting two bomb tests in 2006 and 2009. Disarmament talks between the US and North Korea resumed last summer after a year's hiatus, but substantive progress has been largely lacking, while the six-party talks involving both countries plus South Korea, Japan, China and Russia are stalled. Concerns that the succession crisis could mutate into a nuclear crisis seem misplaced at this point. North Korea's weapons stockpile is understood to be primarily under the control of the armed forces, principally the generals in the NDC rather than the Kim dynasty. Although military by nature, it remains essentially a political tool – a lever used for extracting concessions, respect and aid and assistance from supposedly hostile neighbours. This approach has served the regime well, in the sense that it has been able to maintain itself in power and has avoided foreign intervention despite its appalling economic mismanagement. The new leadership might be expected to continue to use its nuclear programme as a bargaining chip, rather than an offensive weapon. This is not to say, however, that there will not be more nuclear tests or provocative missile launches over the Sea of Japan in the weeks and months to come, depending on how the internal political dynamics play out in Pyongyang. China's public endorsement of the power handover is similarly reassuring and problematic at the same time. Beijing is North Korea's only significant ally and its praise for the late Kim and explicitly, for his successor, was evidently designed to calm matters. China believed the North Korean people would \"turn their grief into strength, unite as one, and continue to advance the cause of socialism,\" a spokesman said. China, he said, would help make \"active contributions\" towards maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the wider region. On the other hand, these statements indicate plainly that Beijing is counting on the regime staying in place and on maintaining the overall status quo, as far as possible. This is not an objective favoured in Washington or in London, which would dearly love to see North Korea come in from the cold and an end to its \"rogue state\" behaviour. Where China stresses continuity, William Hague, Britain's foreign secretary, sees an opportunity. \"This could be a turning point for North Korea,\" Hague said today. \"We hope that their new leadership will recognise that engagement with the international community offers the best prospect of improving the lives of ordinary North Korean people.\" Barack Obama, recently returned form his Asian tour, now faces an early test of his regional \"reset\" – his stated determination to promote American re-engagement in the Asia-Pacific area, not least in ensuring the security of US allies and US interests in the face of China's new assertiveness. It has been the historical failure of Washington and Beijing to agree about what to do about the North Korean regime that has enabled it to survive so long. In western eyes, the age of dictators is over. China sees things differently – and has just given its blessing to the enthronement to a brand new one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk/2011/nov/10/greenpeace-launches-rainbow-warrior-glastonbury","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-10T20:28:47Z","webTitle":"Greenpeace launches Rainbow Warrior III with help of Glastonbury founder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/10/greenpeace-launches-rainbow-warrior-glastonbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/nov/10/greenpeace-launches-rainbow-warrior-glastonbury","fields":{"headline":"Greenpeace launches Rainbow Warrior III with help of Glastonbury founder","bodyText":"Michael Eavis first went to sea in 1951, when he was a 15-year-old farmer's son from an undistinguished village near Glastonbury. The death of his father four years later brought an end to his career as a sailor, however, and he returned to manage the dairy herd and, almost by accident years later, to found Europe's biggest music festival. He has never lost his sea legs, however, and on Thursday the 76-year-old fulfilled a six-decade aspiration to take his place again behind the bridge of a ship. That the vessel was the brand new Rainbow Warrior, the flagship of Greenpeace which Eavis has long supported, was all the more fitting. There was no call for his training to take sextant measurements, but a stint behind the wheel had him giggling like a schoolboy. The ship, freshly launched from its German shipyard, is undergoing sea trials and so the first, Eavis-directed voyage (though the actual navigation was in the hands of the captain and a Thames river pilot) was a brief one, from West India Dock in London's east end to a mooring alongside the Design Museum on the South Bank. \"I'd love to take her under there,\" said the American captain Joel Stewart gesturing at Tower Bridge, \"but that's a battle we would not win.\" Even with the bridge open, the ship's enormous 55m mast is more than 10m too tall to journey any further up the Thames. This is the third Rainbow Warrior to sail under Greenpeace's livery – the first, notoriously, was sunk in New Zealand in 1985 by French commandos to prevent it hampering nuclear tests in a Polynesian atoll. The second has just been retired to Bangladesh, where it serves as a hospital ship. Rainbow Warrior III is bigger, greener and, for the first time, purpose built, which the organisation says will showcase green shipbuilding technologies. The huge A-frame mast system can carry considerably more sails than a conventional mast on a vessel of this size, meaning that the ship will travel, as far as possible, under wind power. Systems to recycle the engine's heat and waste \"grey\" water, and a hull designed to minimise friction in the water, add to its green credentials. \"The emissions from shipping are going up and are of increasing concern, so we have really got to think about how we can end our dependency on oil in this area,\" said John Sauven, Greenpeace's executive director. \"This lets us provide a fantastic example. \"There are so many features of this boat that are state of the art. I like finding technological solutions to environmental problems.\" Perhaps the most striking feature is a helipad worthy of the flashiest private yacht, though the organisation does not have a helicopter of its own. \"If you're going up the Amazon to investigate deforestation, there are very few roads, so you need to have something like a helicopter to take aerial photos,\" said Sauven. Not that much of the pad could be seen under a tangle of wires, amps and microphones, as a crew set up for a free on-deck performance by the band the Good, the Bad and the Queen, featuring Greenpeace supporters Damon Albarn and Paul Simonon, formerly of the Clash. There was a brief ceremony in which Eavis unveiled a plaque in his honour, adorned with a quote of his own: \"Live fast and live long\" (\"I don't remember saying that, but I'm sure I probably did. It's a good motto anyway\"). Greenpeace has particular cause to honour Eavis, who was joined on board by Emily, his daughter and festival co-organiser, and her baby son George, as he donates £400,000 of the festival's income to the organisation. Not all the crew had been fully briefed, however. \"I run a festival, called Glastonbury,\" Eavis was later overheard telling Seychelle Colland, a 26-year-old Canadian volunteer. \"I don't know what that is,\" she said. \"Is it famous here?\" Twenty-six years after the original Rainbow Warrior was bombed, Greenpeace is still seen as a threat. In 2006 the French energy company EDF hired private detectives to hack into its computers to find out more about its campaigns against nuclear power in the UK. As the ship pulled out of the dock mobile phones started ringing, to be answered by whoops – a French court had fined the company €1.5m (£1.3m) and jailed two executives for three years for their part in the spying operation. Thirty minutes later the ship was docking by Tower Bridge when a river cruise boat sponsored by EDF energy passed, to good-natured cheers. It was followed by a French navy warship, the Lieutenant de Vaisseau le Henaff, its crew standing to attention while a tug pulled it past the Royal Navy pontoon. Rainbow Warrior III sounded its horn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/apr/20/chernobyl-radiation-risk-dose-density","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-20T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Response: The Chernobyl deniers use far too simple a measure of radiation risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/20/chernobyl-radiation-risk-dose-density","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/20/chernobyl-radiation-risk-dose-density","fields":{"headline":"The Chernobyl deniers use far too simple a measure of radiation risk","bodyText":"In his article on \"the confusing world of radiation exposure\", readers' editor Chris Elliott was right to point out that getting a whole year's sunshine in an hour would fry him to a crisp (Open door, 4 April). Radiation dose rate is important. What he didn't say is that \"dose density\" is important too. The \"sievert\", as Elliott says, is a dose unit for quantifying radiation risk. He did not add that it assumes dose density is uniform. \"There are many kinds of radiation\", he says, but he does not mention how they differ. In fact, external sources like cosmic rays and x-rays distribute their energy evenly, like the sun; others, notably alpha-emitters like uranium, are extremely uneven in the way they irradiate body tissue once they have been inhaled or swallowed. Because alpha particles emitted from uranium atoms are relatively massive, they slow down rapidly, concentrating all their energy into a minuscule volume of tissue. Applying the sievert to this pinpoint of internal radiation means conceptualising it as a dose to the whole body. It's an averaging error, like believing it makes no difference whether you sit by the fire to warm yourself or eat a burning coal. The scale of the error can be huge. Radiation protection officials fell into this averaging trap in 1941. The Manhattan Project, rushing to build the atom bomb, was creating many new radio-elements whose health effects were unknown. Summing them all – external and internal, alpha, beta, gamma or whatever – into a single dose quantity gave an impression of certainty and precision. Post war, the US National Council on Radiation Protection closed down its internal exposure committee because it took the complexities too seriously. From then on radiation effects were estimated from acute external radiation at Hiroshima and Nagasaki – studies which are entirely silent on internal radioactivity. In 1952 the US forced this mindset on to the newly formed International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) whose advice now has almost the force of international law. In 2004 the UK scientific committee CERRIE challenged the commission's view by reporting that dose could be meaningless at the scale of molecules and cells. If one mentions published studies which show, for example, increased cancer in Sweden after Chernobyl or the doubled risk of child leukaemia near German nuclear power stations, health officials say the ICRP model doesn't predict them: \"Doses were too small to be the cause.\" Chernobyl is an acid test of ICRP's risk model since, at around 2 or 3 milliSieverts, doses were close to natural background. If this level of fallout was proved to cause any health detriment, the ICRP model would fall and the economics of nuclear power would worsen dramatically. So Chernobyl denial is crucial to nuclear interests. George Monbiot's article quoted a UN committee on Chernobyl: \"There has been no persuasive evidence of any health effect [other than thyroid cancer] in the general population that can be attributed to radiation exposure\" (The unpalatable truth is that the anti-nuclear lobby has misled us all, 5 April). But this too is based on the flawed ICRP model; there is a lot of evidence and many scientists attribute it to the accident. Monbiot's recent blog (The double standards of green anti-nuclear opponents, 31 March) relies on his friends Mark Lynas and Chris Goodall who in turn cite Radiation and Reason, a book by Professor Wade Allison. But Allison's preface says, \"many important topics have been omitted … in particular the subject of micro-dosimetry is treated rather briefly in spite of its importance for future understanding\". Monbiot and colleagues should note that in fact Allison doesn't discuss micro-dosimetry at all. It's easy to spin something if you leave out the difficult, challenging science. ICRP has admitted that its model cannot be applied to post-accident situations. Fortunately the European Committee on Radiation Risk employs weighting factors to modify sievert-based doses for internal exposures. This won't cure the mess in Fukushima but it will mean better public protection."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/jan/03/britain-ramoing-sanctions-against-iran-washington","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-03T21:00:09Z","webTitle":"Why is Britain ramping up sanctions against Iran? | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/03/britain-ramoing-sanctions-against-iran-washington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/03/britain-ramoing-sanctions-against-iran-washington","fields":{"headline":"Why is Britain ramping up sanctions against Iran?","bodyText":"'The dog returns to its vomit, and the sow returns to her mire/ And the burnt fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire.\" Kipling was right. Britain is out of Iraq and desperate to get out of Afghanistan. So why gird ourselves for a fight with Iran, a proud country of 75 million people with whom we cannot go to war without taking leave of our senses? Do any of Britain's leaders really think further economic sanctions will stop Iran's nuclear programme? I cannot believe it. Sanctions did not topple Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic or Muammar Gaddafi; they led merely to war. Sanctions have been imposed on Iran for 33 years because there was nothing else to do. They have done no good and almost certainly been counterproductive in reinforcing autocracy. Washington has announced new commercial and financial sanctions on Iran, blacklisting anyone who does business with it. With an election in the offing, President Obama must show America's pro-Israel lobby that he is tough somewhere in the Middle East. The EU must this month decide whether to collude with the US in this dangerous game and ban Iran's oil exports. The threat was enough to get Tehran to test medium-range missiles in the Gulf, and its wilder heads to murmur about closing the Straits of Hormuz, thus blocking a third of the world's sea-borne oil. This sabre-rattling – in the midst of a recession – is beyond stupid. No one has seriously doubted that Iran's government, surrounded by nuclear-armed or nuclear-allied powers, would one day seek a similar capability. It is the nature of well-resourced and insecure regimes to find comfort in \"the ultimate weapon\". It seems of no account that no war fought by a nuclear power has seen such a weapon even threatened. It was not a factor in Korea, Vietnam, the Falklands, the Caucasus, Kashmir or numerous Middle East conflicts. The one time such weapons were \"on the table\" was over Cuba in 1962 – and then they probably helped prevent war. Any fool may say, you cannot be too careful. It is the motto of the arms race. Israel has a nuclear capability for that reason, and that is why Iran wants one. A pre-emptive Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear plants might postpone their work, but make eventual war more likely. I would prefer it if Iran had no such missiles, but that is hardly for Britain to say when it demands \"the right\" to its own. In this case, what matters is the avoidance of escalation, of the megaphone belligerence that makes some western leaders vulnerable to the \"inevitability\" of war. The only question for the west over the last three decades has been how to respond to Iran's fundamentalist leadership and, more recently, its craving for nuclear status. The answer has been of startling ineptitude. The attempt to set up pro-west regimes in Iraq and Afghanistan led the west to upset the balance of power established by the Iran-Iraq war and the Taliban-Pakistan regime in Kabul. Now the Iraq occupation has secured for Tehran unprecedented influence in Baghdad. Its influence also penetrates deep into western Afghanistan, and its support for resistance movements in the Gulf sheikhdoms is said to be growing by the year. Where now the Foreign Office's famed Arabists? The long experience of sanctions indicates that they suck the sanctioning powers into confrontation. Their imposition is a prelude either to inert hostility or to war. They embattle the victim regime, driving power and money to its ruling cadres. In Tehran, as in Tripoli and Baghdad in the 1990s, sanctions toppled nobody but made rulers and generals rich. They impoverish not just the poor but the mercantile and professional classes, denying them contact with the outside world. They hasten middle-class emigration and thus reduce the scope for political pluralism and opposition. Government sources at the weekend rejected all this experience. They claimed tougher sanctions would \"hasten Iran's economic collapse and deepen rifts within the regime, in the hope that saner voices will deem the price of pursuing nuclear weapons too high\". This commits the democratic fallacy that totalitarian states react to economic pressure as democracies might. Sanctions do not initiate such a process. They just build walls. Meanwhile we are enraging Iran's scientific community by apparently condoning secret assassination as a way of impeding its nuclear programme. The idea that any nation becomes more malleable when threatened from outside is absurd. A reasonable observer could assume that every utterance from Washington and London at present is scripted to bolster the Iranian leader, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on his insecure throne. The west's threats must exhilarate the young bloods of the Revolutionary Guard and depress the opposition. They may be supported by Iran's émigrés, but the diaspora is seldom a reliable guide to politics in the home country. Economic sanctions are coward's diplomacy. They purport to high moral stance but are merely a low-risk way of bullying the world. The danger is that they encourage militarist lobbies to escalate the steps that lead to open conflict. Those who argue against unnecessary war are routinely asked the father's knee question, \"So what would you do?\" Taught since 1939 that Britain must be seen to do something, the British are programmed to meddle. There have been occasions in the last 50 years when it has been right to declare hostilities against other nations – the Falklands, Kosovo and the first Iraq war. But usually the answer to \"what to do\" about foreign regimes of which we disapprove is, quite simply, to do nothing. For the most part, other nations' business is not ours. In the last 25 years Britain has mostly been useless at putting the world to rights – it has struggled to wrap itself in the tattered flag of empire, at vast expense but to little effect. It would have been better, far better, to maintain good relations with other states in the hope of assisting causes we profess to hold dear. As for rattling a sabre whenever Washington says so, that is the most humiliating idiocy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/15/nuclearpower-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T21:39:00Z","webTitle":"'Nuclear renaissance'?

It's the tsunami that caused the problems with the backup generators. – spokesman for the US Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group Luddism – that is, the smashing of inhuman technology – always seemed to me to be quite a good idea. If a new machine is killing you, wreck it, as the 19th-century West Riding and Nottinghamshire weavers selectively wielded their God-given hammers to dismantle a certain type of automated loom that was driving them into poverty. King Ludd's followers, who ever since have enjoyed a bad tabloid press as technophobes, lost their class war against the textile factory owners, and many of them were hanged or transported after bloody pitched battles with the British army on the moors. The legacy of the Luddite defeat is to be found in the society we have today. Look no further than the GE-designed boiling-water nuclear generating plants – like the four reactors failed or failing at Japan's Fukushima and Tokai complexes. As of this time of writing, in the course of Japan's unfolding disaster, we know that 200,000 people have fled, or been evacuated from, the contaminated nuclear sites, which report \"partial\" meltdowns. Systemic failure, where rods are overheating – Unit 1 at Fukushima already has exploded, sending up a radioactive plume – and malfunctioning coolants and backup diesel generators are reported all over the Japanese nuclear network. Perhaps scariest of all is that Japan's nuclear safety agency, with its long record of mendacity, like the US's own Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is saying its reactors are \"under control\". I'll bet. The struggle to cool the reactors isn't the only problem. There is danger of widespread radioactivity from an inability to cool Fukushima's spent nuclear fuel pools housed in less safe buildings. These ponds hold far more radioactivity than the reactor core. There are reports of escaping caesium-137, a deadly isotope that gives off highly penetrating radiation and is absorbed in the food chain. Chief cabinet secretary Yukio Edano raised the possibility of another explosion at a second reactor at Fukushima Daichi, but insisted that radiation released into the air would not be \"harmful\" to people. Pull the other one. Already a number of Japanese workers have been hurt by radiation, and shipboard US Navy sailors on their way to a rescue mission have been contaminated. I live between two nuclear stations, San Onofre north of San Diego and Diablo Canyon up by central California's San Luis Obispo. The plant operators insist \"there is no immediate threat to the state\" and all is well. The operator of Diablo Canyon is Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the company successfully sued by the citizens of the small town of Hinkley after it had allowed poisonous hexavalent chromium to leach into their ground water and lied about it, as immortalised in the film Erin Brockovich. This Diablo reactor is built smack in the middle of four earthquake faults in a built-up suburbanised area. San Onofre, the plant closest to me, has tallied ten times the number of safety complaints by workers who are afraid to speak out fearing retaliation. For good measure, San Onofre is sited between both offshore and inland (San Andreas) active seismic faults. Its nearest large city San Diego has suffered 50% more earthquake activity since 1984. We Americans have a virile tradition of whistleblowers, nuclear and otherwise, although President Obama has declared a nasty punishing war on leakers who expose government scandals. The poor Japanese have no such historical legacy, which is one reason why they're in such a pickle. Japanese managers – salarymen used to working for one company their entire lives – keep their mouths shut. They must have known what we know now, that Fukushima's main operator, Tokyo Electric Power (TEP), never tested safety for a quake-and-tsunami anywhere near the 9.0-scale event that has devastated north-eastern Japan. Their nuclear watchdogs looked the other way. The result is \"full-scale panic\", because now they don't know what to do or how to do it. So, there goes our American \"nuclear renaissance\" trumpeted by Obama in his last state of the union speech. To tamp down climate warming and solve our energy needs, he boasted, \"It means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country.\" He aimed to give $36bn to the nuclear power industry and, for starters, a $4bn loan guarantee for two new nuclear reactors on the Texan Gulf Coast to be built by – guess who? – the same folks who brought you the Fukushima meltdown, TEP, assisted by the same American company that made false safety reports at New York's Shoreham nuclear plant. As if the Katrina- and BP-abused Gulf Coast hasn't suffered enough. Of the 104 old, fault-ridden, leaky, rickety nuclear power stations in the United States, 23 are of a similar GE-Toshiba design that has failed catastrophically in Japan. If a commercial nuclear reactor goes \"China Syndrome\" – melts all the way down, as occurred at Chernobyl which made a huge area uninhabitable and caused unknown thousands of deaths – its radioactivity will contain 1,000 times as much as the Hiroshima bomb. My atomic future and yours is in the hands of a president who hates whistleblowers and a Nuclear Regulatory Commission in hock to the industry it's supposed to control."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/18/japan-warned-okinawa-marine-base","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-18T13:17:22Z","webTitle":"Japan warned it must decide on future of Okinawa US marine base","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/18/japan-warned-okinawa-marine-base","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/18/japan-warned-okinawa-marine-base","fields":{"headline":"Japan warned it must decide on future of Okinawa US marine base","bodyText":"A US official who until March was in charge of American policy towards Japan has warned that unless agreement is reached soon over the transfer of a US marine base in Okinawa, Washington will drop the plan to reduce its military footprint on the island. Kevin Maher, who was sacked as director of the US state department's office of Japan affairs in March after reportedly making disparaging remarks about Okinawans, said disagreement over the future of the base threatened to prolong the island's burden of hosting about half of the 47,000 US troops in Japan. Under a 2006 agreement, Futenma base, situated in a city, is to be relocated to a coastal area of Okinawa and 8,000 US marines and their families transferred to Guam by 2014. Local opposition to the move – many Okinawans want the base moved off the island in southern Japan altogether – recently forced the countries to drop the deadline. \"If decisions are not made very clearly in the next few weeks to go forward with the realignment plan, Futenma is probably going to stay where it is,\" Maher said in Tokyo during a speech to promote his book, The Japan That Can't Decide. \"There's nowhere else to move it. I'm afraid the US Congress is not going to continue to put the [$150m] funding into the relocation of troops to Guam because they understand the condition for that is the relocation of Futenma.\" Maher was forced to resign on 10 March, but asked to head the state department's task force responding to the earthquake and tsunami that struck north-east Japan the following day. He said Japan's desire for consensus had slowed its response in the early days of the Fukushima nuclear crisis. \"After the earthquake the focus quickly shifted to Fukushima Daiichi [nuclear power plant], and it was very clear to me as co-ordinator of the task force that no one was in charge. No one in the Japanese political system was willing to say, 'I'm going to take responsibility and make decisions'. \"And decisions needed to be made, but they weren't being made. For the first five or six days of the crisis, the [Japanese] administration's position was that this wasn't the government's problem; it was Tokyo Electric Power's problem. Nothing was taking place at Fukushima Daiichi in terms of the government solving the problem.\" Maher said similar stalling had hampered the tsunami clean-up effort along the devastated Tohoku coast. \"You have to feel sympathy for the good people of Tohoku – they're basically living on a giant garbage dump right now. The debris up there just isn't being taken care of. \"It's another example of [Japan's] inability in crisis to make decisions when the system depends on everyone agreeing what that decision is.\" Maher denied he had insulted Okinawan people during a briefing to university students in Washington last December. A report by the Kyodo news agency in March, drawing on accounts given by some students, said he described Okinawans as \"masters of manipulation and extortion\" in securing government subsidies in return for hosting US bases. According to students' accounts, he also cited the island's higher than average divorce and drink-driving rates, attributing the latter to \"Okinawa's culture of drinking liquor with high alcohol content\". Maher accused the journalist who wrote the report, Eiichiro Ishiyama, of basing his article on hearsay, and has asked Kyodo to investigate the case and correct or retract the story. Kyodo says it stands by the article."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/sep/09/green-party-caroline-lucas-conference-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-09T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Green party leader seeks to woo Liberal Democrats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/09/green-party-caroline-lucas-conference-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/sep/09/green-party-caroline-lucas-conference-speech","fields":{"headline":"Green party leader seeks to woo Liberal Democrats","bodyText":"The Green party leader Caroline Lucas is to make a direct appeal to Liberal Democrats to abandon the party when she makes her leader's conference speech in Sheffield on Friday. Lucas pans to deride Lib Dem leader and Sheffield MP Nick Clegg as \"the minister for meeting angry people and being shouted at\", while claiming that his party is failing to get its policies into law. \"The Lib Dems aren't getting what they want,\" she will say. \"But they're helping the Tories give the rest of us things we don't want, and never voted for, like privatisation of the NHS, cuts in services and £9,000 tuition fees.\" In the first leader's speech of the party conference season, Lucas will address Lib Dem supporters directly in what she sees as \"once a Liberal Democrat stronghold\". Her speech says: \"I have a special message for those who are beginning to despair of the path their leadership has taken them down. If you became involved in politics to serve your local community, or to challenge the rich and powerful, or build a better future for the country, then join us.\" She will target each Lib Dem minister, accusing business secretary Vince Cable of failing \"to secure the far-reaching banking regulation that he once promised\" and suggesting his \"sole idea for more employment seems to be boosting the arms trade\". Treasury minister Danny Alexander, she will say, was behind the abandoned proposals to sell publicly owned forests to reduce the national deficit. Lucas will seek to challenge the perception of the Green party as a home for protest votes, arguing that the party's star is rising. She is its first MP, representing Brighton Pavilion, while Brighton became the the first Green-controlled council this year. \"It shows we offer much more than a protest vote,\" she will say. But she will acknowledge that the party's left-of-centre economic and social agenda is not universally popular: \"We've continued to say things the others won't, and call for policies that put people off. We've stuck to our principles.\" Despite the election breakthroughs in Brighton, national support for the party in opinion polls has not increased significantly and remains in low single digits. Support for the Lib Dems has declined by about a quarter since the general election but there is no evidence that those disillusioned voters have switched to the Greens. Lucas is also planning an outspoken attack on David Cameron and the Conservative party over its \"immoral\" response to the riots in August. She will lampoon \"Cameron's stupendously inane soundbite about a security fightback being followed by a social fightback\" and claim the prime minister's vision for dealing with socially excluded people is \"the idea of ghettoes, where the undeserving poor can be kept and contained through heavy policing, CCTV surveillance and the use of benefits as a stick to intimidate.\" Her speech positions the Green party apart from the three main political parties, who she will claim represent a \"ruling elite\" in hock to corporate interests. She will reveal a Green party investigation showing that paid consultants to government have been frequently replaced by secondees from companies, of whom there are now \"so many that the government has to admit that it can't count them all or say even which companies they come from\". She will argue: \"There are very few businesses who will lend their top employees to government for nothing. They expect something in return. Influence. Access. The inside track on the next fat contract.\" But Lucas will recognise her party's minority position. \"There's no shortage of people who want what's right. The only problem is, there are so few of them in traditional politics.\" The party conference will see debates on tax evasion and inequality as well as traditional green staples such as nuclear power and air pollution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2010/nov/05/what-the-green-moment-got-wrong-tv-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-05T06:45:00Z","webTitle":"Last night's TV: What the Green Movement Got Wrong and Ego: The Strange and Wonderful World of Self-Portraits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/nov/05/what-the-green-moment-got-wrong-tv-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2010/nov/05/what-the-green-moment-got-wrong-tv-review","fields":{"headline":"Last night's TV: What the Green Movement Got Wrong","bodyText":"Build 'em up, knock 'em down. For a long time, Channel 4 was the green movement's cheerleader-in-chief, but in recent years it has become its harshest critic – or, at least, its greatest contrarian. In 2007, it gave us The Great Global Warming Swindle, a documentary that questioned the accuracy of climate-change science. Now we have What the Green Movement Got Wrong. As with that film, this one comes with well-trailed controversy: here, Adam Werbach, a US sustainability consultant and former president of the Sierra Club conservation group, asking for his contribution to be removed from the film because the final version did not represent his views; and Greenpeace claiming to have been \"lied to\" about the film's focus, an allegation denied by Channel 4 and the producers. But Channel 4 stuck to its guns. The thrust was that the environmental movement had become too dogmatic in its objections to nuclear energy and GM foods, and that their stance is endangering the planet they are trying to save; so, rather than building nuclear power stations, governments had been building coal-powered ones that create far more CO2, while opposition to GM foods is contributing to famine in the developing world. I guess some environmentalists are sensitive souls, but none of this seemed particularly controversial to me. Nuclear power may not be ideal, but the industry has cleaned up its act since the 1970s, and if renewable sources can't do the job, then something has to make up the shortfall. Likewise with GM foods. For the greens to cling to idealistic notions of environmental purity while the oceans boil makes them look like myopic old hippies. Where this film really failed was in its sense of cause and effect. To assume the international rejection of nuclear energy and GM foods was all down to environmental pressure groups is absurd. Yet this was the central premise: that global economic policy over the past 30 years had been entirely shaped by well-meaning but woolly minded greens. If they really are that influential, why did the Green party only have its first MP elected this year? Stand by for further Channel 4 documentaries: How the Greens Caused the Banking Crisis, and Why the Greens Invaded Iraq. Call me a philistine, but I generally reckon an hour in an art gallery is enough. Any longer and my knees start aching and the pictures begin to blur into each other. But I could make an exception for the 90-minute Ego: The Strange and Wonderful World of Self-Portraits (BBC4), partly because it's such a treat to find such esoteric programming, but also because the Observer art critic Laura Cumming has that all too rare TV gift of being able to explain brainy stuff without making you feel stupid. It was no great surprise to find that artists were every bit as concerned with self-promotion and self-invention 500 years ago as they are now, but it was the details that were fascinating. To be told that, in Dürer's self-portrait as an older man, \"his scrotum echoes his eyeballs\" is a discomfiting thought for any man past 50 (and a reminder to keep our clothes on). We also discovered that Tintoretto was an insomniac, hence the red eyes; that the reason Van Gogh painted himself so often was because he couldn't afford a model; that Munch painted himself in a state of Freudian am-dram angst to make the girlfriend who had left him feel guilty; and that Mark Wallinger doesn't take himself nearly as seriously as the critics do. Here was knowledge of the least functional yet most precious kind. Jedward made an unwelcome appearance on Never Mind the Buzzcocks (BBC2). The show has long since ceased to be a music quiz and has instead become a forum where each week one witless and talentless guest (Jedward barely have enough brain cells to count as a single person) gets given half an hour of airtime to make a fool of themselves, while everyone else helps. This week, though, neither presenter Jack Dee, nor team captains Phill Jupitus and Noel Fielding, could quite lower themselves to waste their wit on the Simon Cowell artefacts – with the result that the idiot Jeds took over the asylum, running along desks and ruffling Dee's hair. The only person to emerge with any credit was Charlie Higson, who picked up his guest fee despite remaining almost entirely mute throughout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/scottish-independence-blog/live/2014/sep/19/scotland-votes-no-in-independence-referendum-live-coverage","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-19T17:46:00Z","webTitle":"Alex Salmond to resign as first minister after Scotland rejects independence – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/live/2014/sep/19/scotland-votes-no-in-independence-referendum-live-coverage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/live/2014/sep/19/scotland-votes-no-in-independence-referendum-live-coverage","fields":{"headline":"Alex Salmond to resign as first minister after Scotland rejects independence – live","bodyText":"And that’s it for our referendum results day live blog. I merely helped out at the end, but congratulation on an epic effort to Claire Phipps, Andrew Sparrow and Paul Owen. And thank you all for reading. This from the BBC – it seems some feelings are running high in Glasgow. As one independence bid fails, another resumes. The Queen has put out a rare personal statement, sent from Balmoral: After many months of discussion, debate, and careful thought, we now know the outcome of the referendum, and it is a result that all of us throughout the United Kingdom will respect. For many in Scotland and elsewhere today, there will be strong feelings and contrasting emotions – among family, friends and neighbours. That, of course, is the nature of the robust democratic tradition we enjoy in this country. But I have no doubt that these emotions will be tempered by an understanding of the feelings of others. Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all. Knowing the people of Scotland as I do, I have no doubt that Scots, like others throughout the United Kingdom, are able to express strongly-held opinions before coming together again in a spirit of mutual respect and support, to work constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country. My family and I will do all we can to help and support you in this important task. ELIZABETH R. As is ever the way in politics, Alex Salmond’s decision to stand down has brought a flood of glowing tributes from his fiercest political enemies. David Cameron: Alex is a politician of huge talent and passion. He has been an effective first minister and always fights his corner. While we disagree profoundly about his goal of a separated Scotland, and many other things, I respect and admire his huge contribution to politics and public life. Alistair Darling: Alex Salmond is a formidable political figure. He transformed the SNP into a party of government and delivered their referendum on independence which they had craved so long. Today he has accepted Scotland’s verdict, recognising that it is for others in his party to take the SNP forward. He has rightly said that the referendum was a once-in-a-lifetime event and that we all need to work to bring Scotland together. He can look back with pride on being the longest-serving first minister and to the huge contribution he has made to public life in Scotland. I wish him well in the future. Libby Brooks has penned a quick story on the seemingly likely succession of Nicola Sturgeon, which will be up soon. Here’s a taster: Alex Salmond’s shock resignation leaves the way open for 44-year-old Nicola Sturgeon, the woman whom many already believed was destined to become the first female leader of the Scottish government. The only bar to an orderly transition – Holyrood health minister Alex Neill and Westminster MP Angus Robertson have already been mentioned as potential challengers – would be the SNP’s resistance to anointment, but for a party that has been so disciplined throughout the referendum campaign it is unlikely that this will trump the desire for unity, especially while there is a further devolution deal to be hammered out. Last night’s results, which saw significant successes for the yes campaign in the west central belt, mark a shift in the geographical centre of the SNP, one party insider suggests, and Sturgeon’s base in Glasgow’s south side puts her in a strong position to rebuild from there. Sturgeon makes no secret of being to the left of Salmond, and a similar shift in the political centre of gravity of the SNP is expected. The two-year referendum campaign has seen Sturgeon grow in stature. Aside from Salmond himself, she was the most visible politician on the yes side, and the most visible woman: one criticism of an otherwise faultless and highly organised campaign is that she failed to close the gap in support for independence among female voters. Travelling all across Scotland over the summer to speak to local supporters and undecided voters, Sturgeon worked phenomenally hard. She connected with ordinary Scots in a way that some suggest Salmond did not. One observer believes that, in the first televised debate when he flailed against Alistair Darling, Salmond was not “battle ready” in the way that Sturgeon would have been, having answered such questions from voters every night of the week. That’s it from me (@Claire_Phipps) for the day – with a hugely appreciative nod to my colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Paul Owen, who were liveblogging the early stint. I’m handing over this liveblog now to Peter Walker, who will scoop up further reaction to Alex Salmond’s resignation. Thanks for reading, and for all your comments and tweets in these referendum blogs. Salmond’s fellow party leaders in Scotland have been responding to his decision to step down as SNP leader and first minister. Patrick Harvie, co-convenor of the Scottish Green party, who campaigned with him for a yes vote, tweeted this: Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, took issue with Salmond’s parting shot accusing Tory leader David Cameron of reneging on a deal to push through new powers for Scotland: Ed Miliband has called Salmond a “formidable politician” who always stood up for what he believed in. Ewen MacAskill sends further thoughts on the decision by Alex Salmond to step down: When I travelled with Salmond on the campaign trail on the eve of the poll, hurtling across the Ayrshire countryside and the small, struggling villages, pebble-dash former council estates, I asked him if he was planning to stay in office until 2016, and would he stand down then? In an otherwise friendly 30-minute interview, he became touchy, eventually saying, in relation to his post-2016 plans: ‘Don’t go there.’ Salmond has left the party leadership before, in 2000, only to make a surprise return – a shock for some of his rivals in the party – in 2004. Then, he did not think the man who had succeeded him, John Swinney, was up to the task, and the party risked going backwards. He has no such fears with Nicola Sturgeon. He is giving her plenty of time to ensure a smooth transition before the 2015 Westminster election and for the 2016 Scottish parliamentary elections, and possibly the UK referendum on Europe in 2017. If there was to be a Conservative government at Westminster and an exit from Europe, she could at the very least ponder whether the time was right for another independence referendum or she could decide to wait a few more years until she is as sure as she can be the support is finally there for independence. On the campaign trail, Salmond ruled out another referendum for a generation, roughly 20 years. Tellingly, though, on the Andy Marr show last weekend, he added a vital rider: that this was his view, meaning his successor would not be bound by it. Here is the full statement from Nicola Sturgeon in response to news that Alex Salmond is to resign. Sturgeon says she can think of “no greater privilege” than to succeed him as SNP leader and first minister, but that the decision “is not for today”: Alex Salmond’s achievements as SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister are second to none. He led the SNP into government and has given our country a renewed self-confidence. Through policies such as the council tax freeze, free prescriptions and the scrapping of tuition fees, he has made a real difference for hundreds of thousands of Scots. And yesterday he inspired 1.6 million of our fellow citizens to vote Yes to independence. The personal debt of gratitude I owe Alex is immeasurable. He has been my friend, mentor and colleague for more than 20 years. Quite simply, I would not have been able to do what I have in politics without his constant advice, guidance and support through all these years. Alex’s announcement today inevitably raises the question of whether I will be a candidate to succeed him as SNP leader. I can think of no greater privilege than to seek to lead the party I joined when I was just 16. However, that decision is not for today. My priority this weekend, after a long and hard campaign, is to get some rest and spend time with my family. I also want the focus over the next few days to be on the outstanding record and achievements of the finest first minister Scotland has had. Nicola Sturgeon, Salmond’s likely successor as SNP leader and first minister, has released this statement on what she calls “the finest first minister Scotland has had”: Asked by the BBC’s Kirsty Wark what – given he is “not an old man” – he is going to do next, Salmond said: “I am not going to withdraw entirely from political life.” He would put himself forward in elections and continue in politics, he said. “You don’t have to be leader of the SNP or first minister to contribute to the political process.” The SNP had, he said, “the strongest leadership team” in Scottish politics. “It’s right and proper that these people are given an opportunity.” My colleague Ewen MacAskill sends this first-thoughts analysis of the news that Alex Salmond is to step down as first minister and SNP leader: Scotland’s deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon is as certain as it is possible to be to take over from Alex Salmond, first as leader of the Scottish National party (SNP) and then at the head of the government. It will be a coronation, not a contest. There are no other serious candidates ready to challenge her. At best, someone might stand just to give the appearance of a contest, but she would still win. Why is Salmond going now? He has been saying for weeks when asked if he planned to resign in the event of losing the referendum vote, he would complete his term as first minister, which would take him to the next Scottish election in 2016. So why now? He may already have had a deal in place with Sturgeon depending on the referendum result. He may have judged, as he suggested in his resignation speech, that she is capable of reaching the parts of the electorate immune to his charms, primarily women, and also someone younger to consolidate and build on the enthusiasm of all those new young recruits. And here is the official tweet (because that’s what we do now) from Alex Salmond: Salmond: You don’t have to be leader of the SNP or first minister to contribute to the political process. I love the fact I’ve been the longest serving first minister … It has allowed lasting progress to be made. He says his proudest achievement is the restoration of free (higher) education. Salmond says, as far as he can see, there is not a case for another consitutional referendum on independence for a long while. Katie Allen adds: Salmond, asked if his leaving now was a bigger blow to those yes voters already waking up to disappointment this morning, said he had asked himself whether a new leader would benefit the party and “my judgment is it would”. He went on: “The base camp is not far off the summit now, but those who make that final move to the summit are not those who got us to the current position … “It’s my judgment that someone else in leadership would be best placed to take that forward to the summit.” He said he made the decision this morning. Salmond points out that he will be 60 on Hogmanay – he’s not being ageist, he adds, but 20 years at the head of the Scottish National party is enough, he feels. My colleague Katie Allen is also listening in to Salmond’s Q&amp;A with reporters and sends this update: Salmond said: ‘The position that we are in now, that Scotland is in now is redolent of opportunity... I think the situation is redolent with opportunity and political progress for the country.’ Asked about personal responsibility and failures, Salmond said: “45% of the vote, 1.6m votes, is a remarkable political development”, but he felt that what he was doing was the most “assured” way to take responsibility. He said the replacement new first minister should be in place by mid-November . Alex Salmond’s resignation has come as a shock to these yes voters: Salmond says he sees “no sign of a divided country”. The ability to choose in a referendum is an exhilarating process. When you have a contest, you have to accept the result. Salmond says his successor – all bets will surely be on his current deputy, Nicola Sturgeon – should be in place by 13 November, at the SNP conference in Perth, at which point he will officially step down as first minister. Here is the official resignation statement, via the SNP, from Alex Salmond: I am immensely proud of the campaign which Yes Scotland fought and of the 1.6 million voters who rallied to that cause by backing an independent Scotland. I am also proud of the 85% turnout in the referendum and the remarkable response of all of the people of Scotland who participated in this great constitutional debate and the manner in which they conducted themselves. We now have the opportunity to hold Westminster’s feet to the fire on the ‘vow’ that they have made to devolve further meaningful power to Scotland. This places Scotland in a very strong position. I spoke to the prime minister today and, although he reiterated his intention to proceed as he has outlined, he would not commit to a second reading vote by 27th March on a Scotland bill. That was a clear promise laid out by Gordon Brown during the campaign. The prime minister says such a vote would be meaningless. I suspect he cannot guarantee the support of his party. But today the point is this. The real guardians of progress are not the politicians at Westminster, or even at Holyrood, but the energised activism of tens of thousands of people who I predict will refuse meekly to go back into the political shadows. For me right now , therefore there is a decision as to who is best placed to lead this process forward politically. I believe that in this new exciting situation, redolent with possibility, party, parliament and country would benefit from new leadership. Therefore I have told the National Secretary of the SNP that I will not accept nomination to be a candidate for leader at the Annual Conference in Perth on 13th-15th November. After the membership ballot I will stand down as First Minister to allow the new leader to be elected by due Parliamentary process. Until then I will continue to serve as First Minister. After that I will continue to offer to serve as Member of the Scottish Parliament for Aberdeenshire East. It has been the privilege of my life to serve Scotland as First Minister. But as I said often during the referendum campaign this is not about me or the SNP. It is much more important than that. The position is this. We lost the referendum vote but can still carry the political initiative. More importantly Scotland can still emerge as the real winner. Salmond told reporters It has been the privilege of my life to serve as first minister. We have now the opportunity to hold Westminster’s feet to the fire on the vow they have made. Salmond says he has “no intention of retiring from politics”. There are other “useful” things he could do. The energised grassroots activism of the yes campaign has shown that politics is not about top-down any more, he adds. He says the “east commitments” made by the Westminster leaders “are now starting to be withdrawn”. He says voters will be “incandescent” if promises made to win no votes are withdrawn. Salmond says Scotland and his party, the SNP, will benefit from new leadership. He needed to make a judgment about who was the right person to do that. Alex Salmond’s resignation speech concludes: Scotland can still emerge as a real winner … For me as a leader my time is nearly over but for Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die. He now takes questions from journalists in the room. I’ll post more quotes from his statement imminently. He says he will stand down as first minister in November when a new SNP leader will be chosen. The first minister is speaking now. He says the vote has put Scotland “in a very strong position”. But he says that David Cameron, in a phone conversation today, has refused to commit to a second reading in Westminster of a bill for more powers for Scotland by 27 March 2015 – a promise he says was made by Gordon Brown during the campaign. My colleague Severin Carrell sends this about why the Guardian will not be at the first minister’s imminent news conference: After his defeat in Thursday’s independence referendum, Alex Salmond is facing a significant backlash after barring several newspapers and trying to handpick other reporters for his post-referendum press conference at his official residence, Bute House. The Scottish government - which is back in charge of the first minister’s official business now the referendum is over, has decided to exclude Scottish political staff based at Holyrood from three newspapers, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail and the Express from his post-independence referendum. Salmond’s advisers also sought to hand-pick the journalist who represents the Guardian at that event. The Guardian has refused to attend. Michael White has been wandering the damp streets of Edinburgh today to gauge voters’ reaction as the consequences of the no vote sink in (Edinburgh, of course, was a no city: 61.1% voted against). He sends these thoughts: Feeding a parking meter next to a car bearing an “NHYES: Protect our NHS” sticker a young Yes voter shrugged and said: “I’m a bit disappointed, but not surprised, it was always 50/50. It won’t make much difference.” Nearby a heavily-tattoed man delivering oxygen cylinders for the famous Tolbooth Tavern’s beer cheerfully declared: “I voted No; there were too many unanswered questions.” Down the hill towards the Holyrood parliament building, pensioners Anne and Brian McEwan were more conflicted. Anne voted No: “I thought of our sons, just married and with mortgages. It would have taken an independent Scotland 10 years to get on its feet.” Brian wavered but voted Yes. He has a long list of grievances, starting with Margaret Thatcher’s ruination of Scotland construction industry (“making people become self-employed means no apprentices coming through”) and ending with London’s “fiddling” of oil output data. He retains a good word for Gordon Brown. Less stoical by far was Jenny Lamont who stayed up most of the night with her partner, Blair Conacher, and their Yes camp friends, watching the results come in. “I am hugely disappointed, I’ve not stopped crying over this missed opportunity for change,” she said. She blames biased media coverage for not explaining – especially to their English audience – that independence isn’t about moving away from England but about change. The reform process will and must continue, she fervently believes. Lynne and John Kervel, on holiday from Adeleide, echo such sentiments: “It’s not our business, we don’t know your politics. But we’re republicans.” American tourists, mostly unaware of the seismic event they had witnessed when they booked their holidays months ago, were more cautious – but equally divided over yes or no. Social research and polling expert Rachel Ormiston at ScotCen has contacted my colleague Severin Carrell to point out that only 14 people aged 16 and 17 were polled by Lord Ashcroft, a very small sample that makes the 71% yes vote figure quite unreliable, in her view. It’s certainly worth bearing in mind when looking at the figures – and before making judgments about younger v older voters. First minister Alex Salmond is due to give a press conference in around 15 minutes’ time. We won’t have a Guardian reporter there, I’m afraid – our Scottish correspondent, Severin Carrell, tells me we have declined the place after the Scottish government insisted it would choose which reporter we could send. I’ll cover it from the TV news, should the cameras be on the invitation list. The Guardian’s data editor, Alberto Nardelli, has been thinking about why the polls – which had settled into a near-consensus that the gap between yes and no would be around four points – failed to predict what in fact turned out to be a significantly larger gulf: A gap of 10.6 points is decisive and nearer to a landslide than ‘too close to call’ territory. Having placed the yes vote on 47%, Ipsos/Mori and Survation were closest among the pollsters, but looking at figures across all surveys, the fundamental convergence around a four-point average was incorrect and, to an extent, probably suggests a systematic error across the models the pollsters used … Interestingly, the polls a couple of months ago were closer to the final result. Two-thirds among those who decided in the final days opted for independence. Some may well have dithered – we will never know – but if they did, in the end they went back to their original decision. You can read Alberto’s full analysis here. My colleague Esther Addley is heading south from her northerly posting in Unst, in the Shetland Islands, for polling day yesterday. She’s now reached Lerwick and sends this dispatch: There was a definite morning-after feeling on the damp streets of Lerwick on Friday, as shoppers and locals popping out from work paused in small huddles to discuss the result that many admitted they hadn’t quite been able to stay up for. The starkest symbol of that result was the Yes Shetland shop on Harbour street, which in the days before the vote had bustled with a diverse group of energetic local campaigners, but which was deserted and padlocked, having already been stripped of its T shirts, balloons and piles of leaflets. On the doorstep a large black bin bag waited to be collected, while inside a pile of Yes brochures had been jumbled without ceremony into a box awaiting disposal. Kieren Clubb, shopping with his heavily pregnant partner Dianne Goodlad, said that as a Yes voter he had felt ‘a bit deflated’ to hear the result, though having set his alarm to wake early, he admitted he had hit the snooze button when it went off and turned over to go back to sleep. ‘I don’t really follow politics a lot but you couldn’t really miss what was going on with this one. I just felt that there’s a lot of things that could be better – like the NHS and education. Some things could do with changing and maybe independence would have been one of the things that could have done that.’ Many others were relieved, however, with a number of older Shetlanders in particular speaking with quiet satisfaction of ‘the right result’. Shetland was never seriously expected to vote anything other than no, but the scale of the 64%-34% split locally was unambiguous.. Genevieve White, a teacher and writer who had written before the vote about her committed No position, said she was relieved, ‘but I do feel really sad for all the people who are so disappointed this morning; there’s absolutely no sense of celebration for me’. The vote had had a huge impact locally regardless of the result, she said, citing conversations with friends and family members about Trident, the political system, inequality – ‘things that I don’t remember people ever speaking about on such a level’. On Lerwick’s main harbour-side strip, Janet Davidge, owner of Westside Pine, a large gift shop, had been prompted by the result to hang a large union flag outside the door on Friday morning. ‘I didn’t think it was fair to put anything out before the vote because maybe not all my staff agree with me, but this morning I thought: we still have the Union Jack, we’re still all together – so I wanted to fly it.’ The White House has just put out this statement on behalf of President Barack Obama. He’s happy: We welcome the result of yesterday’s referendum on Scottish independence and congratulate the people of Scotland for their full and energetic exercise of democracy. Through debate, discussion, and passionate yet peaceful deliberations, they reminded the world of Scotland’s enormous contributions to the UK and the world, and have spoken in favor of keeping Scotland within the United Kingdom. We have no closer ally than the United Kingdom, and we look forward to continuing our strong and special relationship with all the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as we address the challenges facing the world today. An Obama tweet as polls opened in Scotland made his preference pretty plain: Following the intervention of a Russia Today presenter – who said the high turnout in Scotland’s referendum was suspiciously reminiscent of North Korea (there’s a lesson to all those who have praised it as an example of political engagement) – my colleague Luke Harding reports that Russia is not going to let these doubts lie: Russia has said the conduct of the Scottish referendum “did not meet international standards”, with its observers complaining the count took place in rooms that were too big and that the procedure was badly flawed. In an apparent attempt to mirror persistent western criticism of Russia’s own elections, Igor Borisov – an accredited observer – said the poll failed to meet basic international norms. Borisov said he was unimpressed by what he saw. He said the room where he watched the count on Thursday night was a cavernous “aircraft hangar” next to an airfield. It was difficult to see what was going on, he said, adding: “The hangar is approximately 100m by 300m. There are tables, with voting papers stacked upon them, but the observers are stuck around the perimeter. Even if you want to, it’s impossible to tell what’s happening. It’s also unclear where the boxes with ballot papers come from.” Supporters of Vladimir Putin had been holding out for a yes vote, Luke explains: The Kremlin apparently saw Scottish independence as a way of justifying its own hasty annexation of Crimea in March, following a “referendum” conducted in just three weeks and condemned by the west, as armed Russian forces and irregulars swarmed over the Crimean peninsula. Moscow also felt that a yes vote would weaken the UK and bring to power a post-independence Scottish government more amenable to Moscow’s wishes. Alex Salmond, Scotland’s first minister, expressed qualified admiration for President Putin in an interview with GQ in March. The Guardian’s political editor, Patrick Wintour, reports that Labour leader Ed Miliband has moved to seize the initiative from the prime minister on further devolved powers: Miliband countered David Cameron’s plan for only English MPs to vote on English issues in the Commons by saying he was going to convene a constitutional convention to discuss the future of devolution and power at Westminster. The proposal buys Miliband time to resolve internal differences in his party and also gives him the chance to show he is seeking to engage with a disaffected electorate on how politics can be fixed. Labour, like the Liberal Democrats, is opposed to Scottish MPs being excluded altogether, arguing it will produce two tiers of MPs at Westminster. The convention – a form of semi-representive assembly going beyond elected MPs – would begin before the next election with every nation and region in the country engaged in a dialogue with the people about how power needs to be dispersed, not just in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but in England too, Labour said. This would be followed in the autumn of 2015 with a constitutional convention to determine the UK-wide implications of devolution and to bring these recommendations together. Any recommendations would then be debated by parliament. Miliband said any convention should “be open to every citizen so that they can have their say”. It’s only just about still lunchtime, but everybody’s timing is a bit off today after last night’s count marathon. Scotland has voted no to independence by 55% to 45%. Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond accepted that voters had not “at this stage” opted for independence; British prime minister David Cameron said the result had settled the debate “for a lifetime”. Political attentions have immediately shifted to the range of powers promised to Scotland by Westminster party leaders ahead of the vote – and to calls for similar attention to be paid to Wales, Northern Ireland and England. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said today marked the beginning of “a phase of much greater decentralisation, devolution and autonomy for all the communities that make up the UK”. Polling carried out overnight by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft found that young voters had opted overwhelmingly for independence – 71% of 16- and 17-year-olds, permitted to vote for the first time, had plumped for yes. Police Scotland have thanked the public after polling day and the count passed off peacefully, with just six related arrests, mainly for alleged breaches of the peace and alleged assault. The outcome defied dark predictions of voting day “carnage”, which were swiftly disproved as millions of Scots headed to the polls. The Guardian’s Scotland correspondent, Severin Carrell, sends this analysis of Lord Ashcroft’s poll of referendum voters (see this earlier post for details of its findings): Among the clever questions asked by Ashcroft was one probing when voters made up their minds: in broad terms it confirms the headline opinion polls which found a sharp spike in the pro-independence vote quite late on – many yes voters were relatively late converts. No voters were largely solidly no from the off. Answering the question “when did you finally make up your mind?”, a full 72% of no voters were committed to no more than a year ago or had always known. For yes, that number was markedly lower at 48%. Only 19% of additional no voters decided in the last year or month, versus 31% of yes voters. And just 9% of no voters reached a definitive view in the final week: 21% of yes voters made that decision in the last seven days, with 8% deciding finally on Thursday. Ashcroft’s polls also found that 16- and 17-year-olds voted overwhelmingly for independence by 71% to 29% – a finding that confounds many other polls and the results of many high school mock referendums, and seems against the grain of most assumptions about their behaviour. With most voters in the late 20s to early 50s voting yes, the no vote was won by the retired and the late middle-aged. A full 73% of pensioners chose no, and 57% of over 55s. Following news that there were just six arrests on polling day yesterday, Police Scotland’s assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins has thanked voters “for their help and cooperation during the referendum campaign and ballot”. He added: It is to everyone’s credit that they remained calm on a day of potentially high emotion and cooperated fully with our police officers and also the staff at polling places on a day when record numbers turned out to vote. This meant the ballot and count passed off smoothly and there were just a very few isolated incidents across the country involving a small number of alleged offences. Police Scotland had plans in place to ensure the safety and security of the referendum and these worked. I would also like to thank our police officers across the country for the hard work and effort they put in to ensure the day went well. Over the 24 hours of the ballot and count there were six arrests, mainly for alleged breaches of the peace and alleged assaults. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat leader, is in Edinburgh today and says last night’s result shoos in “top-to-toe” reforms across the UK. Press Association files this report: The “clamour” for greater autonomy fuelled by the referendum campaign means more controls will now be put “into the hands of the people”, the deputy prime minister insisted. While a “clear” timetable for further devolution to Scotland has been set out, decisions must now be made about “how that then translates into new voting arrangements in Westminster”, he said during a visit to a coffee shop in Edinburgh to meet Liberal Democrat activists. Cross-party support must be sought for the proposals outlined by David Cameron, he insisted: “These are major constitutional issues. They shouldn’t be the play things of one individual party or another.” Clegg said: I see today as the beginning of a process, not the end, where we reaffirm what unites us in the United Kingdom but we move towards a phase of much greater decentralisation, devolution and autonomy for all the communities that make up the UK, and crucially that we enter into a new, exciting chapter of constitutional renewal where more power and more control is put into the hands of the people themselves. It’s really important that everyone who cares about Scotland, Yes or No, unionist or nationalist, Conservative or Liberal Democrat, all come together to unite behind the thing that we can deliver together, which is more devolution or powers to Scotland within the United Kingdom. It’s really important that the people who are so energised, and passionate and interested in the referendum, especially those who voted for independence who will be feeling disappointed this morning, also get involved. My colleague Helen Pidd is with voters in the Scottish Borders; yesterday, most voted no, so how are they feeling this morning? Helen writes: It was no great surprise that 66% of voters in Scottish Borders voted no to independence – so many people in the affluent region work over in England, with many English settled among the abbeys and heather-clad moorlands of the area. But a not-insignificant 27,906 people in the Borders wanted Scotland to be an independent country. One of them was 22-year-old Jamie Noble, a volunteer at a charity shop in the market town of Kelso, just six miles from England, who said on Friday: “I’m no’ happy with the result. I didnae want to be part of England any more. I cannae be doing with them, with some of them, anyway. They’re total snobby.” Robbie Douglas, a 25-year-old joiner, said he was “absolutely devastated” and found it difficult to discuss without crying. He insisted voting yes was “not about being Scottish. It’s about something much bigger than that. As I nation I think we are more socialist. I think about what’s best for people of Scotland as a whole before myself. No voters tend to say ‘I’m a no voter because I’m scared about my pension’. Whereas yes voters are doing it for others.” Others were cock-a-hoop. “Thank goodness,” said two ladies in their fifties, still wearing their leggings after a pilates class. “My husband works over in Berwick and people at his work had been saying to him, ‘oh, you’ll be needing your passport next week’. It could have made our lives much more complicated,” said one of the woman, who did not want to be named. Deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon has resurfaced on Twitter after a night of mixed feelings: the yes camp lost, but pro-independence votes reached heights that could hardly have been predicted when the referendum was agreed two years ago (when polls put support for yes at 35%, tops): Overnight, Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft polled 2,047 voters in yesterday’s independence referendum. He’s been tweeting some of the findings; I’ll post some analysis from Guardian colleagues shortly: Plus, ticklingly, some 11% of yes voters and 14% of no voters said they would be reluctant to tell friends, family and colleagues how they had voted. Libby Brooks is out and about in Glasgow’s George Square, and just bumped into Amy Calder, 18, who voted yes yesterday, along with Caitlin Paul, also 17, who opted for no. No one is smiling in Glasgow this morning, they told Libby: Some yes supporters in Glasgow don’t plan to give up just yet: Police in Scotland have confirmed that voting passed off almost entirely peacefully, defying earlier doomy warnings that the big day could be “carnage”. A statement this morning said: During the referendum period we can confirm there were a total of six referendum-related arrests across Scotland. These were mainly for alleged offences involving breach of the peace and assault. If the vote had been a yes, this morning would have seen Q&amp;As on the issues that proved so thorny throughout the campaign: currency, oil, passports and border controls. We can sweep those to one side, for now. For the time being (a generation, a lifetime, depending on whose take on the referendum result’s lifespan you go for), the pressing issue has become devolution: who gets what powers, from whom, and when. My colleague Alan Travis has compiled this informative Q&amp;A about what the promises being spouted today might mean in practice, and how an “English parliament for English votes” might look: The Conservatives have been working on proposals for how the Commons might implement the reform. Lord Baker, the former Tory cabinet minister, has suggested the UK Commons might sit on Mondays and Fridays to discuss the economy, defence, foreign affairs and immigration, while the English Commons meets on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. However, some constitutional experts say an English parliament would be so disproportionately large compared with the Scots or Welsh parliaments and assemblies that it would almost certainly lead to clashes. This is especially likely between a Labour UK government and a Conservative-dominated English parliament. Northern Ireland’s first minister, Peter Robinson, is speaking now about the result. He says there are anomalies within the United Kingdom that need to be addressed – Northern Ireland and Wales need to be part of that discussion, he makes clear. He says Northern Ireland is ahead of the curve: there is “wide agreement” between parties about how it should be governed. Scotland is seeking to “catch up” with some of the powers that NI already has, he adds, mentioning benefits. Robinson adds that devolved governments are never keen to raise taxes for local people; more control over levels of income tax has been promised to Scotland by all three main Westminster parties. The Labour leader Ed Miliband has thanked the Better Together campaign team for helping to secure a no vote, and backed plans for newly devolved powers for the nations. You can watch it here: While most people have been lauding the high turnout – 84.5% – and peaceful, cooperative process of yesterday’s voting, some (well, Russia Today) have seen the germ of a conspiracy theory, my colleague Matthew Weaver reports: Russia’s state-funded English news channel RT has aired doubts about the referendum and the size of the turnout, by giving a platform to a conspiracy theorist. Its commentator Afshin Rattansi, presenter of RT’s Going Underground show, suggested the result could have been rigged: “There weren’t UN observers. This may seem an absurd point to some, but this is a nuclear power in Scotland. There were international considerations – Britain’s nuclear deterrent. And with the vote as close as this, with the mainstream media on one side, with a massive amount of people from Westminster running up to beg Scotland the other way, and certain recounts in certain bits of the poll, which way did the vote go, really?” He added: “It is normally the sort of turnout you would expect in North Korea. Usually media here would go ‘we don’t believe it. How can it be nearly 90%?’” Cath Levett, the Guardian’s head of graphics, sends over this nifty map, showing Scotland sized by voter registration numbers, not geography. Glasgow, and central Scotland, while geographically tiny, have the largest number of voters – but the weight of Glasgow was not enough to shift the overall result to yes: Pictures are slinking in from the morning after the night before: It’s not all about yes v no. The referendum campaign has seen winners and losers from less expected quarters, and my colleague Frances Perraudin has rounded them up and put them in their place right here. Here are two thinktank blogs on the constitutional problems facing the UK. Nick Pearce and Guy Lodge at IPPR say in a blog that “political parties find it impossible to resist the temptation to succumb to party interests on matters constitutional” and that, as an alternative, London should follow the example of Ireland. This does not mean that the political parties should be excluded, however [from a constitutional convention]. Just as important as ensuring this is a genuinely open and democratic experience is the need to guard against the rise of a toxic, anti-politics populism. We need a model that complements rather than usurps representative politics. For guidance we can to turn to Ireland, which established a constitutional convention in the wake of the financial crash and the collapse of trust in politics that crisis precipitated. Politicians were able to participate but not to dominate: two-thirds of its members were Irish citizens selected by lot, with the remainder made up of politicians. To be sure, the agenda was too broad, covering an eclectic mix of political and social issues, and the timetable too tightly drawn. Nevertheless it has produced real change that simply would not have happened without the convention: the government has, for example, accepted the case for a referendum on same-sex marriage. Sunder Katwala at British Future says David Cameron should embrace the idea of a constitutional convention, and also appoint a secretary of state for England. Yet prime minister David Cameron was right to say this morning that meeting Scotland’s aspirations will also require a fair deal for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones has been making this case for some time. His proposal of a constitutional convention to shape a more federal UK did not receive the attention it merited outside Wales, but it may be an idea whose time has come. Yet any such process requires voices to speak for England specifically. The national party leaders have roles and responsibilities across the UK. Appointing a Secretary of State for England to participate in these pan-British debates would be an important and timely move from the Prime Minister. The Secretary of State could also convene cross-party discussions with MPs for English constituencies, and to find ways to ensure that the public get to participate too. As talk turns to devolution, increased powers for Scotland – and possibly Wales, Northern Ireland and England, too – GuardianWitness wants to know: is the UK political system working for you? Readers so far aren’t exactly giving the thumbs-up to the status quo: You can add your own contribution here. Another Conservative MP has criticised proposals to maintain the Barnett formula. In fact, Stewart Jackson wants UK funding for Scotland to be cut. It is not just the Conservative party that has English MPs unhappy about the decision of the three main UK party leaders to protect the Barnett formula, guaranteeing Scotland a certain level of funding. Some Labour MPs are uneasy about this too. One of them, Frank Field, has issued this statement. The promises to Scotland ensure that the English question will dominate May’s general election. Voters will demand from all English candidates whether they support English home rule and if they support giving an additional £1500 a year, for ever, for every person living in Scotland, over and above what they will vote for their own constituents. Voters will demand “yes” to the first question, and “no” to the second. These are the answers I shall willingly give. What next for the UK after Scotland’s vote against independence? My colleague Jonathan Freedland hosts this special podcast, with a great panel of speakers including Scottish historian and Yes supporter Sir Tom Devine; fellow Scottish author and No supporter Allan Massie; and Guardian colleagues Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr. You can listen to it below: Carwyn Jones, the Labour first minister of Wales, has for some time been calling for a constitutional convention to reshape the structure of the UK. He has been restating his case at a press conference this morning. The Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald, reports that the Protestant Orange Order is celebrating the no vote. The order’s pro-union march in Edinburgh last week sparked concerns that it could inflame sectarian tensions, though the event ultimately passed without incident. Henry reports: This morning the Orange bretheren say they are “delighted’ with the outcome. The Grand Lodge of Ireland’s Grand Master Edward Stevenson said: “Our family of nations, and the unmistakable bond we all share, remains unbroken and we look forward to Scotland remaining British for many generations to come. “We congratulate our Scottish friends on making the right decision, and pay particular tribute to our colleagues in the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland who worked tirelessly, despite being excluded by the Better Together campaign, to galvanise support and mobilise votes to maintain the Union. “There can be no doubt that the Union we cherish has been altered by the referendum campaign; and so there is an onus on those in government to take notice of the concerns and issues raised, and work for the benefit of Scotland and the entire UK going forward.” Owen Smith, the shadow Welsh secretary, has dismissed the Tory proposals for “English votes for English laws” on Twitter. Peter Hain, the Labour former Welsh secretary, has also said he would be opposed to any change that created two classes of MPs. But, as Wales Online reports, he says he would accept limits on Scots MPs voting on English-only bills at committee stage, when a bill is being scrutinised line by line. This suggests he would be amenable to proposals along the lines of those in the McKay commission. (See here.) Protest votes or swithering right to the wire? Vince Cable, the Lib Dem business secretary, told Sky News that he agreed with David Cameron about the need to address the so-called West Lothian question (named after the MP for West Lothian who first asked it, Tam Dalyell): why should Scottish MPs be able to vote on English matters when English MPs cannot vote on matters like health devolved to the Scottish parliament. Cable pointed out that the McKay Commission, which produced a report last year, offered solutions to this. “We think the blueprint is already there,” he said. Here’s the Guardian report of the McKay Commission findings. And here’s an extract. The McKay commission insisted that, to avoid destabilising parliament and creating two classes of MP, their proposals would not allow English MPs a right of veto over laws passed by the government. But it said the overarching principle with England-only bills was that any government should act with the consent of English MPs, unless it had good reason not to. “The status quo clearly cannot be sustained,” McKay said. “Our proposals retain the right of a UK-wide majority to make the final decisions where they believe UK interests or those of a part of the UK other than England should prevail. We expect that governments will prefer compromise to conflict.” The commission says a number of procedures can be used in the early stages of a bill, including: a grand committee of all English MPs; a special bill committee set up to amend legislation; or separate votes on different clauses that might be England-only. In some cases, where a bill also affected Wales, the same measures could be used. Scotland’s campaign and party leaders, after a long night counting down the results to no, are peeling away to bed/meetings about devolution (delete as appropriate). But not before they shared their thoughts on Twitter, naturally. Scotland’s first minister, Alex Salmond, was pensive in defeat: Fellow yes campaigner and co-convener of the Scottish Green party, Patrick Harvie, was eager to channel the thwarted energies of the pro-independence voters: And here’s the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson (for some, the revelation of this campaign): Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European council, has welcomed the result too. Having played a major role in helping the no campaign win, former prime minister Gordon Brown is not about to abandon domestic politics again - or at least not very quickly. His office has just announced that he will be giving a speech in Fife tomorrow, covering what should happen next to secure Scotland’s role in the UK, how the nation can be unified, and the lessons he has learned from the campaign. He has certainly been getting outstanding reviews. Here’s ITN’s Tom Bradby. And on Sky News Liam Fox, the Conservative former defence secretary, said Brown “played a blinder”. Fox added: What was interesting was when Gordon Brown, who can often seem very cold and calculating, when he actually got his teeth into something that mattered to him, he became much more animated, and I think much more likeable as a politician, probably a lesson in there for all of us. The Guardian’s Tom Clark has spent the last few days here in Scotland talking to campaigners on both sides of the debate. Here he presents a special (and commendably speedily produced) edition of the Politics Weekly podcast from Edinburgh, joined by the Guardian’s Nicholas Watt, constitution expert Stephen Tierney, Labour MP Gregg McClymont and radical independence campaigner Cat Boyd. The Queen is expected to make a statement on the result later today. Here’s an extract from the Press Association story. Palace officials said the Queen has been following the referendum very closely throughout the campaign. It is thought unlikely she stayed up through the night. Her private office with her at Balmoral was kept regularly updated by officials in London and Edinburgh as the counting began. Any statement by the Queen on results day will be seen as part of the process of reconciliation following the heated debate by both sides during the referendum. She is head of state, but in her less formal role as head of the nation, the Sovereign acts as a focus for national identity and unity and offers a sense of stability and continuity. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has welcomed the result of the Scottish referendum. Claire Phipps here, checking back in for liveblog duty alongside the tireless Andrew Sparrow. Equally indefatigable is my colleague Steven Morris, who is still in Dundee – a city that voted yes last night, by 57.3% to 42.7% no. (Check out the full results here.) He tells me: It’s a bit the morning-after-the-night-before in City Square, Dundee. Will Meek, 41, has been here all night. ‘I’m gutted. It’s good we won in Dundee, it’s terrible that we lost overall. We’re going to have a party here tonight anyway.’ He also spoke to another yes supporter, Gordon, who told him: I’m proud to be a Dundonian this morning. I’m proud that I voted yes, disappointed that apparently others didn’t. We’re not dead. We’re not going anywhere. We’ll try to keep together the community that has developed during the campaign to fight the cuts imposed by Westminster. We’ll stay positive. Jose Manuel Barroso, the outgoing European commission president, has welcomed the result in Scotland. He said it would strengthen the EU: I welcome the decision of the Scottish people to maintain the unity of the United Kingdom. This outcome is good for the united, open and stronger Europe that the European commission stands for. The European commission welcomes the fact that during the debate over the past years, the Scottish government and the Scottish people have repeatedly reaffirmed their European commitment. Owen Paterson, the Conservative former environment secretary, has joined Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London (see here), in criticising Cameron’s decision to maintain the Barnett formula (the funding arrangement that guarantees Scotland a certain level of funding from the UK government). Paterson said it was “unfair Scottish politicians will continue to vote on taxes raised from the English, while voting special tax raising powers to Scotland alone”. Maintaining the Barnett formula, under which the Scottish receive £1,600 per head more than the English and expecting English taxpayers, who are struggling to make ends meet, to keep footing the bill is unjust. Such a lopsided constitutional settlement cannot last; it is already causing real anger across England. If not resolved fairly for all the constituent parts of the UK for the long term, it will fall apart. The normal autumn routine of party political conferences is not sacrosanct. The prime minister’s promise of English votes for English laws is welcome and parliament should be recalled next week to discuss this and a wider constitutional settlement. The Guardian’s European editor, Ian Traynor, has this for us from Brussels: There have been quiet sighs of relief in the EU at the no vote since policymakers can now avoid the legal quagmire thrown up by a potential secessionist but pro-EU state. Brussels did not know what to do in the event of a yes. Now it does not need to answer that question and will be hoping the Catalans follow suit. But instead of having to face the nightmare of a UK breakup, Brussels policymakers must now grapple with keeping the UK in the EU. The no victory will be adduced in support. ‘Better Together’ indeed. Already that argument is being made. Karl-Heinz Lambert, social democrat leader in the EU’s committee of the regions, saw the result as pro-European. ‘The fact that the overwhelming wish of the Scottish people [is] to remain within the European Union has been a key element during the campaign,’ he said. ‘In the end, the victory of the no camp also reflects the conviction of the majority of Scottish people that Scotland has better chances if it remains anchored to the European Union, as part of the United Kingdom.’ With all the talk of a new era of federalism for the UK, there is puzzlement in Brussels that the same term is a dirty word in London when applied to the EU. The Greens in the EU suggested UK unionists should apply their Scottish campaign to the looming EU battle. ‘Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and the political establishment in London spared no efforts to highlight the benefits of a United Kingdom to the people of Scotland; we now expect them to show the same enthusiasm to make the case for a united Europe,’ said Rebecca Harms and Philippe Lamberts, the Greens leaders in the European parliament. ‘The arguments for being “Better Together” are no less valid for Europeans than they are for the people of the United Kingdom.’ A senior European Union official has said a yes vote would have been “cataclysmic” for Europe, spurring separatism elsewhere and creating an “ungovernable” continent of rival nationalisms, Reuters has reported. In one of the first comments from a European commissioner after the referendum on which the EU executive had observed a neutral stance in public, trade chief Karel De Gucht told Belgium’s VRT radio he had feared a yes vote. “If it had happened in Scotland, I think it would have been a political landslide on the scale of the breakup of the Soviet Union,” said De Gucht, a Belgian liberal who does not support demands from some of his fellow Flemings for their own state. “It would have been cataclysmic for Europe. That was what I feared,” he said. “A Europe driven by self-determination of peoples ... is ungovernable because you’d have dozens of entities but areas of policy for which you need unanimity or a very large majority. “Moreover it’s about countries, or parts of former countries, that would behave in a very nationalistic way.” Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, is renewing his call for a constitutional convention. (See here.) He says we learnt this morning that David Cameron did not consult the cabinet before he made his offer of swift action to give new powers to Scotland. Farage was referring to the answer William Hague, the Conservative leader of the Commons, gave to this rather good question earlier. Henry McDonald is back with reaction from Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister and Sinn Fein MP. McGuinness said: ‘The yes vote, whilst not delivering independence, means for all of us things can never be the same again.’ But behind his upbeat tone there will be disappointment within his party and amongst Irish republicans over the result. At the party’s annual conference earlier this year, President Gerry Adams said the vote in Scotland would prove to unionists in Northern Ireland that the union was ‘hanging by a thread’. Grassroots republicans had made their support for Scottish nationalists known. On the iconic wall in the Free Derry corner of that city, republicans replaced the words ‘You are now entering Free Derry’ with ‘You are now entering Free Scotland’. In Belfast, they painted giant yes slogans on the side of Divis Mountain. But as the unionist victory sinks in, those slogans are likely to quietly disappear over the weekend. David Cameron is being urged to match his offer of more devolution to Scotland with a similar offer to Wales. This is from Leanne Wood, leader of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party. Wales can no longer be a spectator in its own national journey. The Westminster parties made specific vows during the referendum campaign and in Wales the London parties have suggested a change of pace in terms of decentralising power to the people of Wales. Any offers to Scotland must be offered to Wales too. That’s the very minimum we should expect. Wales should not be treated as second class to Scotland. Miliband says voters in Scotland were telling politicians that the country only works for an elite few at the top. Labour understands that. And it will change the country, he says. We must tell our children and grandchildren we did not just keep our country together, we changed it, he says. And that’s it. He is not taking questions and, on the question of whether Labour supports change along the lines of the “English voters for English laws” plan proposed by David Cameron, he was completely silent. Miliband says change does not end today. It begins today, he says. All party leaders will keep their promise to deliver more devolution for Scotland. And devolution isn’t just a good idea for England. It is good for Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland too. Ed Miliband is speaking on the referendum result now. He starts off with a tribute to Alistair Darling, the leader of the pro-union campaign. After 2010, he could have decided to take a step back. But he played an important party keeping the UK together. David Cameron committed himself on Monday to carrying on with the Barnett formula. Which means there is space in Conservative politics for someone arguing for it to be cut, or dismantled (a very popular proposition in English Conservative circles). And, when there is a policy opportunity like that, it doesn’t take long for Boris Johnson, mayor of London and a rival of Cameron’s, to fill it. Right on cue, he popped up on LBC radio. That’s a reference to the London borough of Barnet. AS And here’s Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s deputy first minister, saying the referendum campaign has changed Scotland forever. And here’s the Guardian video of Alex Salmond making his concession speech. Here’s the Guardian video of David Cameron commenting on the results of the referendum. Over the last few hours, prime minister David Cameron’s plans for constitutional reform in England have become considerably clearer. William Hague, the Conservative leader of the Commons, has been giving interviews this morning and he clarified some of the proposals Cameron announced in his statement. Here are the main points. AS Hague said it was “inconceivable” that Scottish MPs could go on being allowed to vote on English-only laws. I think with further devolution to Scotland it becomes inconceivable to continue to allow Scottish members to vote on everything that is happening in England when as you know English members and indeed Scottish members can’t vote on so much of what is happening in Scotland. That is the heart of the issue. Hague was much more specific than Cameron, who addressed this issue in less absolute terms. Hague said the Tories would make this an issue for the 2015 general election. We have to discuss this with all the other parties. Of course if there is no consensus, well then it is something at the general election, the parties will have to stake out their positions, but I think there is a strong view in England, among the people of England, as well the Conservative party and I think many Liberal Democrats as well. He said that the Barnett formula, which guarantees Scotland a certain amount of UK funding, would “become less relevant” over time. He appeared to rule out regional assemblies, saying it was “unlikely” that the Conservatives would propose another layer of government. He said the decision by Cameron to offer more power to Scotland shortly before the referendum was not a new policy. The Conservatives had already agreed to offer Scotland more powers. What was new was the timetable, he said. Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour party, is about to make a statement on the result in Glasgow. In Spain, Ashifa Kassam reports that Catalan pro-independence campaigners, who have been watching the Scottish campaign closely, say the result will have little effect there. ‘What happened in Scotland was exactly what we expected would happen,’ said Ricard Gené, of the Catalan National Assembly, one of the grassroots movements that has been driving the independence campaign. ‘Whether they voted yes or no, that would have been all right,’ he said. “What we really feel is envy about the possibility of voting. This is what we are fighting for.’ His message was echoed online. ‘In Scotland the yes campaign lost, but democracy won. Spain has a lot to learn,’ wrote another. Catalan lawmakers are expected to pass a law this afternoon allowing them to hold a non-binding referendum as planned for 9 November. But earlier this week Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel García Margallo, said any type of vote in Catalonia would be blocked, suggesting the Spanish government will challenge the Catalan law in the constitutional court. Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip (the United Kingdom Independence party - a Eurosceptic party) has called for a full constitutional convention. In an interview on Sky News, he said that the cabinet committee offered by David Cameron was unsatisfactory. Farage said: The English are 86% by population of this Union. They’ve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. We still have a situation where Scottish MPs can vote in the House of Commons on English-only issues. I think what most English people want is a fair settlement. Mr Cameron this morning, as a last-minute measure yet again, has decided to put William Hague in charge of a committee to try to cobble together a solution. We had better get a constitutional convention set up PDQ (pretty damn quick), so we can get the best constitutional brains in this country working on it. I don’t think William Hague and a committee can work this out. I think we need a proper, open debate. Farage also said his preferred option was for some days in the House of Commons to be set aside for English MPs and English-only business. This is an idea backed by some English Conservative MPs like John Redwood. The head of the British employers’ organisation, the CBI, said businesses would greet the result with a “collective sigh of relief”. John Cridland said in a statement: “Business has always believed that the union is best for creating jobs, raising growth and improving living standards, and welcomes that the people of Scotland want to play an integral role in this internationally successful partnership.” He said, however, that further devolution should “not undermine the strength of the single internal market”. Cridland called on politicians, businesses and citizens to work together to help heal the “inevitable scars” from the campaign. “Now is also the time to rebuild relationships outside the UK to reassure international investors and other partners that we will emerge stronger and more confident in the months and years ahead.” Here’s the full text of David Cameron’s statement. The final turnout figure set a record. This is from the Press Association. Turnout in the referendum on Scottish independence hit a record high for any election held in the United Kingdom since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1918. The participation rate of 84.5% topped the previous best of 83.9% recorded in the 1950 general election and dwarfed the tallies in recent Westminster polls, which saw 65.1% vote in 2010 and 61.4% in 2005. Henry McDonald, the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, reports: The no victory is a morale-boosting shot in the arm for unionists on this side of the Irish Sea, with the leader of one of the pro-union parties describing it as ‘a victory for common sense’. Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist party chief, used the result to call for more devolved powers for the Stormont parliament in Belfast, including the right for the region to set its own corporation tax. Nesbitt said all Scots in both the no and yes camps deserved praise for ‘their ability to get where they are today without one bullet being fired or the creation of one innocent victim. Unfortunately that was not our experience in Northern Ireland.’ Prior to the count, nationalists here were calling for a similar referendum. Peter Robinson, the first minister of Northern Ireland, must now decide if it is worth testing opinion-poll evidence – which shows a stronger pro-union majority than in Scotland – and hold a decisive plebiscite that could secure Ulster’s future in the UK. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Nato secretary general, has welcomed the result of the referendum. The final result has come in from Highland. You can read all the results here. Here’s Patrick Wintour’s report on David Cameron’s speech. David Cameron committed himself to a devolution revolution across Great Britain, including votes on English issues by English MPs at Westminster, as he hailed the Scottish people’s decision to remain inside the United Kingdom in the referendum. But he made clear the constitutional reforms including in Scotland will not be delivered until after the General Election, and in tandem with reforms in England. “We have heard the voice of Scotland and now the millions of the voices of England must be heard”, he insisted. Cameron threw down a challenge to Labour to say if they will agree to English votes for English MPs and announced that William Hague the Leader of the House will advance the issue in a special cabinet committee. The Prime Minister, vindicated in his decision to stage a Yes No referendum, also revealed he has asked Lord Smith of Kelvin to implement the Scottish devolution reforms set out by the party leaders in the final weeks of the referendum campaign. He also announced that the government will shortly say more about the devolution of further powers to the cities and regions of the UK. Cameron also did not recommit himself to the Barnett formula - the method by which resources are distributed on a population basis across England Scotland and Wales. Both Labour local councils, Tory MPs and Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, immediately insisted the Barnett formula has to be torn up. Farage also pressed Scottish MPs to make an immediate commitment not to vote any further in English only issues, as he called for a constitutional convention to discuss the whole future political settlement in the UK. He said “The fact that three party leaders made commitments on behalf of millions of UK voters means nothing. Why should I stand by a panicky commitment to Scotland made by the Prime Minister?” Some of Cameron’s remarks make clear that the offer of further powers in Scotland is dependent not only on the next election, but also a wider constitutional settlement including the exclusion of Scottish MPs from voting on many issues confined to England. If you want to catch up with all the overnight developments, here are some stories and articles that will help. The Guardian’s splash story summarising the overnight developments, and Scotland voting no to independence. Severin Carrell’s story about the concession speech from Alex Salmond, Scotland’s first minister, in which he put the UK parliament at Westminster on notice that Scotland’s voters expect the UK parties to deliver on their vow to quickly introduce new powers for Scotland’s parliament at Holyrood, as he accepted defeat in the referendum. The full text of Salmond’s speech Martin Kettle’s analysis of the result The Guardian’s overnight live blog, covering in great detail all development’s from the moment polls closed until the prime minister, David Cameron, delivered his statement on the results outside Number 10 about an hour ago. The full results With the vote having been followed by people around the world, Paul Farrell from Guardian Australia reports mixed reactions from Scottish people in Sydney. As the results continue to come in indicating a no vote, Scots are celebrating, or commiserating, in the Arisaig bar in Sydney’s Surrey Hills. One lone bagpiper marched slowly and sadly up and down the road, welcoming prospective patrons into the Arisaig. Matthew Bywalec, a Scot who has lived in Sydney for a year, said he was gutted with the result. ‘I just feel like Scotland had been let down today. We’ve been let down by a very slim majority, that’s all it was.’ But he remained optimistic about a second round: ‘It starts from tomorrow. Bring on the 2020 referendum.’ Scottish first minister Alex Salmond’s statement this morning sealed a two-year campaign and was listened to by a group of soberly-dressed supporters, reports Ewen MacAskill. There was none of the raucous flag-waving seen at so many independence events and that was evident on the streets of Edinburgh just hours before. At the end of the statement, Susan Maciver, 48, stood in tears. A local government worker, she had been drawn into politics by the referendum. She feared that all the enthusiasm that it had generated, mobilising people who had not been engaged in politics before, would die. She was pessimistic too about the chances of another referendum. “I do not think they [the Westminster parties] will let it happen again.” Her husband, Alistair, 50, a civil engineer, described Salmond’s statement as magnanimous and also “gives us hope that this is not the end of the journey”. He had feared he was coming to hear Salmond announce his retirement. “I was scared he would stand down tonight. I am delighted he is carrying on. If he had stood down, that would have been two victories for Better Together.” Here are some of the key pictures that sum up a night of raw emotion on both sides of the campaign. It truly has been a dramatic and historic night. The eyes of the world have been firmly on the Scottish people, who in the course of the past 24 hours rejected independence in a referendum choosing to stay part of its 307-year-old union with England and Wales. An estimated 55% of voters rejected Scottish first minister Alex Salmond’s plans for his country to become a separate nation – although there were big majorities for independence in Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city, and in Dundee. Edinburgh, the country’s capital, voted no, along with Aberdeen, and a host of other areas that might have been expected to have voted yes. But in the end the vote was not as close as the last few polls - and the incredible energy and enthusiasm of the yes campaign on polling day - had suggested. Turnout was approximately 85% - unknown since the 1950s. In an early-morning concession speech, Salmond said he accepted the verdict of the people but noted that Scotland had not chosen independence “at this stage”, suggesting he may return to the idea of independence. “We have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,” he said. The Scottish first minister also warned the three main parties in the UK that they must make good on their promises of further devolution for Scotland by 22 January 2015. The last-ditch promise made by the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat party leaders is proving controversial, particularly among prime minister David Cameron’s Tories. “The people of Scotland have spoken,” declared Alistair Darling, the former chancellor of Great Britain who led the campaign to keep the union. Cameron spoke this morning, saying he was delighted Scots had voted to keep the union and suggesting the issue of Scottish independence had been settled for a generation - even for “a lifetime”. Further devolution would now be taken forward by Lord Smith of Kelvin, the prime minister said - not just for Scotland, but for Wales, Northern Ireland and England too. The controversial question of Scottish MPs voting on English matters needed an answer, he said. The Queen is expected to speak this afternoon, focusing on the reconciliation of the nation.

He was speaking in the Commons, where Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, answered questions about the plan. Darling said: I'm sure I'm not the only MP today who has a sense of deja vu when listening to what you had to say. Indeed I seem to remember announcing a number of these projects myself 10 years ago [when Darling was transport secretary], which perhaps demonstrates the problem that we face in that successive governments have found it very difficult to deliver on these large-scale projects, whether on housing or on transport or on energy, which we desperately need. I know that central government planning went out of fashion about 40 or 50 years ago but isn't there a case for actually seeing whether or not central government can't take a grip of these projects to match them up with the funds, including the insurance funds which is a good thing, to make sure these projects actually happen? They are too important for the country to be left to chance and I am sure that you would not want to join the very long list of ministers now who announce these things only to find a few years later they are filled with disappointment because they simply aren't there. • Sir Howard Davies, chair of the airports commission, has written to the Treasury saying his interim report will call for urgent measures to increase airport capacity in the south east of England. • Nick Hurd, the civil society minister, has been criticised for saying that some youth services closed as a result of spending cuts were \"crap\" anyway. • Norman Baker, the Home Office minister, has backed calls for an inquiry into mass surveillance by GCHQ and the National Security Agency. (See 2.47pm.) • Justine Greening, the international development secretary, has revealed that aid worth £80,000 went to Zimbabwe's government, in contravention of government policy. But the money was used properly for a fruit fly eradication project, she said. She made the admission as she announced that a £67m aid programme for southern Africa was being wound up because it has not been effective. • Dame Patricia Hodgson, a former BBC executive and the Ofcom deputy chairwoman, has been named as the government's preferred candidate to be the next Ofcom chair. That's all from me for today. I've got to wind up early. Tomorrow it's the autumn statement. I will be writing a joint blog with Graeme Wearden. Thanks for the comments. Norman Baker, the Lib Dem Home Office minister, has backed calls for an inquiry into the mass surveillance activities of GCHQ and the NSA in America. He was speaking in an interview with the New Statesman's George Eaton. Here's an extract. When I ask him whether he would like to see an inquiry into the allegations of mass surveillance by the British and US intelligence services, he replies without hesitation: “Yes. In my view, it’s perfectly reasonable for the Guardian to raise questions about the balance between the state and the individual to take account of the fact that technology has moved on a huge amount and the law was drafted when we didn’t have the means of communication we do now – Skype and everything else – and the capacity of the security services, or the Americans, to engage in trawling for stuff.” Baker also said that the Home Office was a \"hostile\" environment for a Lid Dem minister. Baker does not attempt to hide the extent of his disagreement with the Home Secretary, describing the atmosphere as “hostile”. “It’s no secret that the Home Office is quite a political department and that the Lib Dems and the Tories probably have more challenges in reaching common positions in that department than in many others,” he tells me. “I think the Conservatives will probably say that because of the external threats we have to have more security than liberty and we have to sacrifice a bit to achieve that. We start at the other end; [we think] that liberty is a precious thing and it’s always possible for someone to say, ‘Give me some of your liberty and I’ll give you more security.’ And going down that road is quite dangerous.” • David Cameron has admitted finding the process for infrastructure development in the UK \"frustrating\". He made the comment in an interview in China as Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, published a national infrastructure plan confirming plans to dispose of Britain's stake in Eurostar as part of a £20bn privatisation programme. Asked about the slow pace of projects like HS2, Cameron said: It is frustrating sometimes that we can't do things faster in Britain but we have a planning system, we have democratic accountability for that planning system, we have a need for everyone to have their say and make their point. That's very important in the British system. I think we can keep that system and that democracy but at the same time accelerate things and make them go faster. If you look at what this Government's done in terms of planning policy, decisions are now being taken faster, including on major infrastructure projects. • The government has confirmed that subsidies for onshore wind and solar energy will be cut, while subsidies for offshore wind will be increased. Ukip's energy spokesman, Roger Helmer, dismissed this as a \"political stunt\". He went on: \"It fails to address the real argument which is the nonsensical and frankly dangerous energy policy this Government is forcing upon UK taxpayers.\" • Business groups have welcomed reports that the government will cap increases in business rates. This is fromJohn Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. It is heartening that the chancellor appears to be listening to business, and is planning to limit the damage caused by relentless business rates increases. But a tax rise is still a tax rise. Although a cap on rates would spare businesses some £300 million in tax hikes, and reliefs help many of the smallest firms, companies of all sizes will still be paying hundreds of millions more in rates to the Exchequer next year than the £27 billion they are expected to pay in this year. • Cameron has said that it is possible to cut taxes and reduce the fiscal deficit at the same time as the economy recovers. As Nicholas Watt reports, Amid fury in Downing Street at reports that the prime minister has ruled out tax cuts for middle-income earners for the next decade, Cameron said that reducing the deficit and cutting taxes were not alternatives.Speaking in the Sichuan capital of Chengdu on the final day of his visit toChina, the prime minister told the BBC: \"The two aren't alternatives. It is possible to reduce people's taxes as your economy recovers. In April, there's going to be another significant tax cut as we complete the programme of allowing people to earn £10,000 before they pay anyincome tax at all. That's worth over £700 to the typical taxpayer.\" • Britain has won the right to export pig semen to China in a deal worth £45m a year. • The police officer at the centre of the Plebgate row that cost Andrew Mitchell his cabinet job is to sue the former chief whip for libel. As the Guardian reports, Toby Rowland, the officer on duty in Downing Street at the time of the altercation, insists Mitchell called him a pleb. Mitchell accused him of lying as part of his own libel appeal against the Sun. Now Rowland is to launch a libel action of his own against Mitchell. • The coalition is having to raid its school capital budget to find an extra £200m to build new school kitchens and fulfil its pledge to let all primary school children aged five-to seven-year-old receive a free school meal, a pledge announced by Nick Clegg at his party conference in September, it has emerged. As Patrick Wintour reports, In last-minute talks Whitehall sources said Clegg has been forced to raid either the schools maintenance budget or its basic needs budget to fund emergency construction and improvement of school kitchens to meet higher demand for school meals. The need to build extra kitchens had not been foreseen at the time of the initial £600m announcement. • The head of MI5, Andrew Parker, has agreed in principle to appear before the Commons home affairs committee to justify his claim that the Guardian has endangered national security by publishing leaks from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. • Theresa May, the home secretary, has said that Muslim chaplains are to be trained to challenge extremist Islamic views on university campuses as part of plans to prevent the spread of radical ideologies. As the Press Association reports, May said they would be used to prevent terrorist prisoners radicalising others while behind bars. She said the government was also looking at new orders to ban radical groups, including new civil powers to target individual extremists. In a written ministerial statement, she said there were plans to give the Charity Commission greater powers to stop the spread of hate-preaching. The proposals come after an extremist task force was set up to look at ways of stopping the spread of radical hate-preaching. • The Labour MP John Woodcock has declared that he is being treated for clinical depression. He has written an article about it. Because brilliant, inspiring people have had the courage to speak up and make the case that my latest ailment shouldn’t be treated any differently from these physical injuries, I am just going to come right out and say that I am clinically depressed. I went to see a doctor this week who prescribed me medication to relieve my black moods. • The House of Lords has said the second reading of James Wharton's backbench bill for an EU referendum will be held on Friday 10 January. Although it's sometimes hard to see what point PMQs serves, at the next election the electorate will have to make a choice between having David Cameron or Ed Miliband as prime minister and PMQs does at least allow a comparison. With Nick Clegg and Harriet Harman standing in for them, the occasion doesn't have the same edge and, frankly, today's exchanges were a political non-event. It wasn't that the two deputies were particularly bad; it's just that they didn't say anything remotely interesting or enlightening. But at least Harman was good humoured. The line about many Labour members being former Lib Dem ones sounded better in the chamber than it looks in print, and the line about even her knowing the difference between a brake and and accelerator was not exactly laugh-out-loud funny, but it was a rare example of a politician joking about their driving skills. (Harman does self-deprecation well; it is surprising that more politicians don't try it, because it works. Michael Gove is reputedly an appalling driver, but I've never heard him joke about it.) Harman also dealt with the claim that the coalition's bedroom tax policy was similar to a Labour one quite well. As for Clegg, he just rattled out the anti-Labour attack lines. It was a bit like @CCHQPress on speed. It was not subtle or endearing, but sometimes in politics it's important just to keep ploughing on, and he certainly did that. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says Clegg has been magnificent today. He has sounded like David Cameron. Can Clegg show he is really becoming Conservative by saying that he supports extending transitional controls on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants. Clegg says the government's position is that the freedom to travel is not the same as the freedom to claim. Labour's Gisela Stuart asks if Clegg thought the government got value for money with the sale of the Royal Mail. Yes, it did, says Clegg. John Baron, a Conservative, says the Lib Dems have a record of not delivering on EU referendums. Will Clegg ensure Lib Dem peers support James Wharton's bill, which is now in the Lords. Clegg says his party will stick to the position the government legislated for in 2011 - the referendum lock. Elfyn Llwyd, the Plaid Cyrmu MP, asks about a constituent who fled Italy with her son. She has been ordered to return. Does Clegg agree it would be wrong to take her into custody? Clegg says this is a desperately sad case. But ministers cannot comment on cases before the courts. He is sure the consulate in Italy will be able to help. Labour's Andrew Gwynne asks why more people are going to A&amp;E. Clegg accuses him of talking down the NHS. Average waiting times in A&amp;E have gone down, he says. Charles Kennedy, the former Lib Dem leader, says actions speak louder than words. Does Clegg welcome the fact that Cameron is now in favour of Britain staying in the EU? Clegg says Kennedy is being mischievous. Labour's Nick Raynsford says a school in his constituency is being closed to make space for a free school. Clegg says Michael Gove will write to Raynsford about this. But Clegg says he favours schools being freed from the dead hand of bureaucracy. Bob Blackman, a Conservative, says rogue landlords should be criminalised. Clegg says plans were announced last year to help tenants get a better deal. Ann McKechin, the Labour MP, asks if the sale of the Royal Mail has obtained value for money for the taxpayer. Clegg says the price of Royal Mail shares was at the higher end of the range suggested by the government's advisers. David Nuttall, a Conservative, asks what the EU's share of world trade was in 1973, and what it is today. Clegg says the share today is about 20%. David Cameron has been advocated a China-EU trade deal. Shabana Mahmood, a Labour MP, says the government has been pushed into acting on business rates by Labour. Clegg says the only thing the government has been pushed into is rescuing the economy. Aidan Burley, a Conservative, asks Clegg to lower the benefits cap, or to regionalise it. Clegg says the government has not decided to regionalise it. It has been set at a level equivalent to earning £35,000 before tax. He would like to know if Labour now supports this. Labour's Phil Wilson asks Clegg if he agress that the Conservative party's hostility to the EU is bad for business. Clegg says pulling out of the EU would be an act of \"economic suicide\". David Heath, a Lib Dem, says waiting for superfast broadband in rural areas is like Waiting for Godot. Clegg says the roll-out of superfast broadband is accelerating. More plans will be set out shortly. Labour's Lucy Powell says a woman in full-time work has seen her earnings fall by £2,500 on average since the election. Will a tax break for married men help? Clegg says Powell knows there are different views on this in the coalition. Sir Alan Beith, a Lib Dem, asks about subsidies for onshore wind farms. Clegg says the Treasury will announce details of its plans shortly. The changes will make offshore wind more attractive to investors. PMQs Snap Verdict: Who won? Who cares? The B team showdown doesn't really count, and it showed. Harriet Harman had a couple of half-decent jokes, Clegg was drab but resilient, but the whole thing was pretty uninspiring. Harman says there is no comparison between what Labour did and what the coalition is doing. Labour only imposed its rules on new tenants. The Lib Dems say they are making a difference. That's true. Without them, there would be no bedroom tax. She says even she knows the difference between a brake and an accelerator. Isn't the best deputy a Conservative prime minister could have? Clegg says without the Lib Dem there would have been no recovery. The Lib Dems would not have had a City prawn cocktail offensive, like Labour. And they would not have broken the economy in the first place. Harman says Clegg will go to any lengths to be a loyal deputy to a Tory prime minister. If you want to freeze energy prices and scrap the bedroom tax, you have to vote Labour. Clegg says Labour are not even an opposition in waiting. They have no sensible policies. Why should anyone trust them to run the economy. Harman says Clegg has not admitted that bills are going up. Not one penny will come from the profits of the energy giants. The government is tip-toeing around the energy giants. When it comes to standing up to the powerful, the government is weak. But they penalise the weak. Last week David Cameron said the disabled are exempt from the bedroom tax. That's not true. Will Clegg apologise? Clegg says that, on the subject of weakness, this weak we discovered that Labour is not standing up to the unions. Labour should stand up to the unions. Harman says Clegg should leave it to Labour to worry about its members, especially as so many of them happen to be his former members. What should people affected by the bedroom tax do if they cannot move? Clegg says the coalition is applying the same rule that applied under Labour to the private sector. Harriet Harman asks if this winter's energy bills will be lower or higher than last year's. Clegg says they would be higher if the government had not acted as it has. Labour's policy is \"economically illiterate\". A Labour energy spokesperson said a few days ago you cannot control energy prices. That's an admission the policy is a \"con\". Harman says Clegg has \"ducked and dodged\". Household energy bills are going up, not down. The £50 measure is not enough to stop bills rising. How much of that will come from the profits of energy companies? Clegg says he did answer the question. Bills will be £50 lower than otherwise. Labour's policy is \"fantasy\". It's a \"fantasy freeze\". Clegg says overcrowding is a real problem. Labour has no answers to these problem. They have a \"bankruptcy of ideas\", he says. Labour's Julie Elliott asks about health cuts affecting Sunderland. Clegg says NHS England is making funding decisions. To have questions on NHS spending from a party that still does not support the coalition's support for extra funding of the NHS is unreasonable, he suggests. Nick Clegg says he is replying on behalf of David Cameron. There is a lot of jeering. The whole House will want to offer condolences to family and friends of those killed in the Glasgow helicopter crash, he says. He praises the emergency services. Nick Clegg is about to take PMQs. He will enjoy Alice Thomson in the Times today. She says Clegg and the Lib Dems may be unpopular, but they are becoming more confident and powerful in Whitehall (paywall). The bizarre paradox is that the more scandals they have overcome and the worse the Lib Dems do in the polls, the more confident their high command has become. They are likely to come fourth in next year’s European elections and a ccording to YouGov they have lost more than half their votes since the last election, going from 24 per cent to just 10. They could lose a dozen or more seats in 2015 but they seem more assured than the other parties ... The Lib Dems are also becoming more influential. Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, is presiding over a growing number of expensive wind farms and has protected most of the so-called green levies that are pushing up the cost of electricity. He only allowed the Chancellor to make a token £50 cut in energy bills — financed by higher taxes. Mr Clegg has become increasingly bold at bartering after his refusal to let Mr Cameron have his boundary changes. When the Tory leader insisted on a transferable tax allowance for married couples, Mr Clegg insisted that he receive the same amount of money to increase free school meals for infants. “Totally bonkers and counter to everything the coalition stands for but we had to swallow it,” said a Downing Street aide. Last week Mr Clegg announced new plans for shared parental leave for up to a year, again angering Tories. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's papers, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories and here's the New Statesman's list of top 10 comment articles. And here are four articles I found particularly interesting. • Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun says George Osborne will scrap national insurance for workers under 21 in the autumn statement tomorrow. All jobs tax for the under 21s will be abolished this week as the centre piece of a major package to tackle the youth unemployment crisis, The Sun can reveal. George Osborne will scrap employers’ national insurance contributions for every worker aged 20 or under in his mini budget on Thursday. • The Financial Times (subscription) says senior Tories have attacked Alistair Darling's \"comatose\" leadership of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence. Alistair Darling has been dubbed “comatose” by senior Conservatives, amid signs of growing frustration in Downing Street over the former Labour chancellor’s leadership of the “Better Together” Scottish campaign. With just 10 months to go before the referendum on Scotland’s independence, the Tory top command is growing increasingly concerned that Mr Darling is not pressing the case for the union hard enough. “The man has never run a campaign,” said one very senior Tory figure. “He is comatose most of the time.” One Downing Street source described Mr Darling as a “dreary figurehead” for such an important campaign. • Mariana Campeanu, the Romanian labour minister, tells the Times in an interview (paywall) that Romanians and Bulgarians should be welcomed with open arms for doing jobs shunned by British workers who would rather live off the welfare state. “I do not know in depth the British social welfare system, this is an internal issue of the British Government how generous it can be in its welfare system towards its citizens,” Mrs Campeanu said in an interview in Bucharest. “This should maybe be a reason why many British people do not access the vacancies on the labour market for which Romanian citizens, for example, are going to apply. If there are any vacancies, somebody will fill them, whether they are from Romania, Italy, Spain or wherever\" ... “Taking into account the fact that Romanian citizens in the UK contribute greatly to the GDP and also that many of these people are young and well-qualified, the UK should be grateful that these people have come to live there,” Mrs Campeanu said. • Gavin Kelly in the Financial Times (subscription) says the autumn statement is likely to show that household debt has risen above £2 trillion. If a frothy housing market means rates start to climb before wages have recovered their mojo, things could get nasty. Should, say, rates climb towards 4 per cent by the middle of the next parliament – roughly 1 per cent higher than the markets expect but still lower than the long-term norm – about 1.2m households would be spending more than half of their income on repayments – a perilous amount. Nearly 6m would be paying more than 25 per cent. A gentler path would have rates staying low for some years, allowing wages to recover and households to adjust. So, while it is encouraging that the BoE looks willing to use its wider regulatory powers to avoid having to raise rates prematurely, on its own this may not suffice. As a final act in the crisis, we may still need aggressive debt restructuring to secure the position of today’s vulnerable but viable borrowers. Regardless of whether unemployment has fallen below the BoE’s key threshold of 7 per cent, it should be made clear that interest rates are unlikely to rise until real wages and incomes are buoyant. For the record, here are today's YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 40% (up 2 points from YouGov yesterday) Conservatives: 32% (no change) Ukip: 12% (no change) Lib Dems: 9% (down 1) Labour lead: 8 points (up 2) Government approval: -27 (up 3) According to Electoral Calculus, this would give Labour a majority of 104. Sky News has a scoop. PC Toby Rowland, the officer on duty at the gates of Number 10 who had an exchange with Andrew Mitchell, is going to sue Andrew Mitchell for libel. At a press conference last week Mitchell accused Rowland of not telling the truth. On Sky, Martin Brunt says he thinks the Police Federation may fund Rowland's libel action. The Treasury is briefing today that George Osborne will cap business rates in tomorrow's autumn statement. According to the BBC, business rates in England and Wales will go up 2% next year, instead of 3.2% as planned. This revelation seems to have been timed to coincided with today's opposition day debate. Labour has tabled a motion saying the government should \"take action to ease the burden of business rates\". Toby Perkins, the shadow minister for small business, says Osborne's plan does not go far enough. The government has been pushed into action on business rates by Labour after Ed Miliband's call for a cut. But today's announcement falls far short of what firms suffering from the cost-of-living crisis have been crying out for. Business rates are employers' number-one complaint about costs and, as with the government's announcement on energy prices, firms will still face rising bills. Business rates will still rise by an average of over £250 in April, on top of £1,500 so far under David Cameron. By contrast, under Labour's plan, 1.5 million start-ups, workshops and shops would benefit from a cut and then a freeze in business rates. At Labour's conference Ed Miliband said the party would cancel a planned cut in corporation tax (which would have helped large firms), and instead use the savings to cut business rates for small firms. Here's some reaction to the national infrastructure plan announcement. From Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury With the country facing a cost-of-living crisis we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs, boost living standards, and strengthen our economy for the long-term. But for the last three-and-a-half years the Government’s record on infrastructure has been one of complete failure. The ONS says that infrastructure work is down 3.7 per cent in the last year and fell by 10 per cent in 2012. And in the spending review the Government set out plans to cut capital investment even further in real terms in 2015/16. Scheme after scheme has been announced to great fanfare but then little actually delivered. Yet another announcement from Ministers about possible future investment will do little to reassure business that warm words will finally translate into diggers in the ground. From Nick Baveystock, director of the Institution of Civil Engineers The National Infrastructure Plan plays a critical role in enabling the UK to compete in a modern world, creating jobs and growth and providing the stability for the UK to grow its engineering skills and capacity. Previous editions of the Plan have set out a much needed and welcome vision for infrastructure, but the need for it to evolve into a robust delivery plan - aligned with the UK’s strategic goals – has become more pressing. The new 2013 Plan, with its updated pipeline of projects, further £25bn investment and evidence of a shift to “delivery mode”, is a positive step and presents us with an opportunity to drive this agenda forward. From Nick Prior, head of infrastructure at Deloitte, the consultancy firm The additional infrastructure funding announced by the Chief Secretary today is welcome but we need much clearer sight of where this money will actually be spent. The government guarantees scheme is making a difference. This has been the most impactful announcement on infrastructure to date. But, the reality is, little of this money will be spent this side of 2015, so we won’t see shovels in the ground on new projects for some time. The £25bn commitment from insurers is good news in demonstrating the attractiveness of UK infrastructure to investors. But they still need to see a clear pipeline of opportunities to put their money into and this will require some upfront commitment and ongoing funding from government. The intention is there but the funding is still aspirational. From Mat Riley, head of infrastructure at EC Harris, a built asset consultancy Today’s revised infrastructure spending programme is, again, strong on headlines, but unclear on delivery. The government is working hard to attract investors such as the insurance funds, but the UK still does not have the right policy environment for these funds to be put to good use and make a real difference, which is compounding the problem. Who would want to take the risk and invest in a nation that cannot even put together a coherent energy policy without fear of ridicule? Regulation is largely ineffective, and the balance of power now sits with asset owners and their investors, which means only one outcome for the consumer, and that is higher costs. Politicians are in denial, the real issue is how much cost consumers are ultimately going to bear, and by when. From Phil Blythe, chair of the Institution of Engineering and Technology's transport policy panel, on the plans to cancel the plan to fund the A14 road scheme from tolling This was always going to happen as they set the toll so low that whoever built the road and toll infrastructure would never recover their investment. What is needed is a network of such roads around the UK, to share the cost and the back office to make this feasible. In general, we support the idea of allowing private companies to build additional lanes on existing roads and recover the costs through tolls. We have to make the proposition attractive for investors. Technology is not an issue and the UK has a major pool of expertise in this area. The Treasury has now published its 152-page national infrastructure plan (pdf). And here's the Treasury news release about it. Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, has announced that he will issue advice to people using Twitter, Facebook and other social media to help them to posting comments that are in contempt of court. In practice, this means that the advisory notes that he sends out to media organisations will now be published, on his website and on his Twitter feed. There are more details here, in this news release. In an interview for BBC News, Grieve suggested that children should be taught about the dangers of tweeting on matters that are sub judice at school. We might want to look at what we do in schools, because after all children starting tweeting very young. So it may be that it’s something where we need to provide a bit of education explaining that you have responsibilities. Each one of us always has a responsibility when we say anything, but the difference is that what previously was a private conversation between two or three people, which would have had no impact on the trial, if it goes viral, then it may reach hundreds of thousands of people, and then at that stage people will start saying that the fairness of the trial process is being endangered. He also said that the best advice was just not to tweet about live court cases at all. It’s the best advice I can give: if there’s a live case, people should not be making public comment about it. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been touring the broadcast studios this morning to speak about his national infrastructure plan. Here are the main points he's been making. • Alexander has confirmed that subsidies for onshore wind farms and solar power are being cut. But they are only being reduced \"slightly\", he said. And subsidies for offshore wind are being increased. Within the total envelope of money that we are able to make available to energy suppliers, we have looked in detail at how much it costs to do offshore windfarms and onshore windfarms and big solar schemes and we are reducing slightly the subsidy we are providing to onshore wind and to these big solar schemes because we think that's the best way to get value for money for the electricity consumer. We should be doing so in the most cost-effective way we can and we should also be making sure that industries where the UK has a vast potential, like offshore wind, get the support they need really to take off. With the strike prices for offshore wind today that we are setting out, that will also I think enable, on DECC's (Department of Energy and Climate Change) analysis, at least 10 gigawatts of offshore wind between now and 2020. I hope that is also a big vote of confidence from the Government in that sector. Alexander also rejected a suggestion that the move was inspired by political opposition to onshore windfarms. • He said that the government had created \"an environment, in which people want to come and invest in UK infrastructure\". He was particularly pleased that six major insurers were announcing that they were going to invest £25bn in UK infrastracture of the next five years, he said. Those firms are: Legal and General, Prudential, Aviva, Standard Life, Friends Life and Scottish Widows. • He said total investment in infrastructure was higher than under Labour. We’re publishing figures today that show that overall investment in UK infrastructure in this parliament has gone up to about £45bn a year compared to £41bn a year in the last parliament. Those figures combine public investment and private investment, he said. • He said that, according to the Nabarro Infrastructure Investment Index, the UK was the best place in the world to invest in infrastructure now. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association and from PoliticsHome. And here's a Danny Alexander quote from the Treasury press release. The announcement today that six major insurers will invest £25 billion over the next five years is a massive vote of confidence in the UK economy. It supports the wider £100 billion public investment to rebuild Britain over the next seven years that I announced at the Spending Round 2013. Underground, overground, on shore, offshore, wired or wireless, tarmac or train track. You name it, we’re building it right now. I fear that final sentence may be a hostage to fortune. What about that new runway or airport in the south east? Or HS2? Or those new towns Nick Clegg has been talking about? Here's an extract from the Treasury's press release about the national infrastructure plan. The government will tomorrow publish a new National Infrastructure Plan (NIP) containing a pipeline of over £375 billion of planned public and private sector energy, transport, flood defence, waste, water and communications infrastructure up to 2030 and beyond. It comes on the day that six major insurers announced plans to collectively invest £25 billion in UK infrastructure over the next five years. Much of this investment could go into the pipeline projects published today. The decision follows the successful negotiation last week by UK government of the key European directive Solvency II. The UK negotiations ensured those capital rules incentivised life insurers to invest in a wider range of assets including infrastructure projects which can deliver the consistent long term returns these businesses seek. The National Infrastructure Plan published today provides the visibility and improved certainty industry has been looking for to commit to big investments. The Infrastructure Pipeline published alongside the plan is the most comprehensive overview of planned and potential UK infrastructure investment ever produced. And here, from the press release, is a summary of the announcements in the plan. The government will: • sign an agreement with Hitachi and Horizon to support the financing of the development of a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in North Wales through a UK guarantee, subject to final due diligence and ministerial approval • provide a further £50 million for a full redevelopment of the railway station at Gatwick Airport • take forward steps to convert public sector car fleets to electric vehicles investing £5 million in a pilot during 2014-15 • fund improvements to the A50 around Uttoxeter starting no later than 2015/16 • confirm that there will be no tolling on the planned A14 scheme between Cambridge and Huntingdon, construction of which is planned to start in 2016 • confirm that a UK guarantee has now been agreed for the £1 billion Northern Line extension to Battersea, unlocking a development the size of the Olympics in the Nine Elms area • announce a £8.8 million guarantee for new energy efficient lighting systems across NCP car parks in the UK • create a new court for infrastructure to avoid unnecessary delays in the planning process for major projects • confirm strike prices for renewable energy, so that energy providers know how much they will receive for electricity generated in the future • open a £10 million competitive fund in early 2014 to test innovative solutions to deliver superfast broadband services to the most difficult to reach areas of the UK. Options may include enhanced mobile services, new fixed technologies and alternative approaches to structuring financial support, working closely with the communications industry • build on the Spending Round commitment of £2.3 billion capital investment for flood defences by developing a new long-term plan, including naming key projects by Autumn Statement 2014 • The target for the sale of corporate and financial assets will be doubled from £10 billion to £20 billion between 2014 and 2020, including the Government’s shareholding in Eurostar • The government will also look at options to bring private capital into the Green Investment Bank to enable it to operate more freely in delivering its objectives There's a strong Lib Dem flavour to political events today. With David Cameron still in China, Nick Clegg is taking PMQs. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is announcing (or re-announcing - this builds on something he has announced before) a national infrastructure plan. And we may even hear from Ed Davey too. According to the BBC, the government is going to announce big changes to the way it subsidises renewable energy. The government is to make big changes to the way it subsidises renewable energy, the BBC has learned. Ministers will announce that they will cut support for onshore wind and solar energy, but give more backing to offshore wind power. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander described the shift in subsidy as \"a rebalancing\" and said overall spending would not change. But Labour said \"chopping and changing\" pricing was bad for business. The set prices for onshore wind power and solar energy will be cut from 2015, while those for offshore wind power will be increased. I'll be covering all these stories, and anything else that crops up. Here's the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee on crime reduction policies. 10am: Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Lord Deighton, the commercial secretary to the Treasury, launch the national infrastructure plan. As Rowena Mason reports, Alexander will say that Britain's stake in the cross-channel rail operator Eurostar will be sold off under a new £10bn privatisation programme. 10.30am: Rhodri Morgan, the former Welsh first minister, and Lord McConnell, the former Scottish first minister, and former cabinet secretaries Lord O'Donnell and Lord Butler give evidence to a Lords committee looking at the coalition government. 12pm: Nick Clegg takes PMQs. Alexander has been giving interviews about his infrastructure plan this morning. I will summarise the key points shortly. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon.

Sites at Braystones and Kirksanton, close to the Lake District national park, have been listed as well as nine existing locations for generating facilities to be considered as part of a month-long public consultation. McKinnon and Clarke, which claims to be the UK's biggest energy consultancy, said that even such a large building programme – to bring plants on stream by 2018 – would not be enough to stop the lights going out in 2015. The government, it said, was doing too little, too late to avert a crisis in six years' time as coal-fired power stations and the old generation of nuclear stations reach the end of their lives. The original 2015 completion date \"is no longer an option\", David Hunter, M&amp;C's energy analyst, said, adding: \"We are concerned, however, that 2018 is still too ambitious as ... construction would need to commence in two years' time.\" There were still huge obstacles to overcome such as planning, potential local and national opposition, justification to Europe, design assessments and decommissioning concerns. \"We hold out little hope that this can be achieved,\" Hunter warned. Ministers were upbeat, however, and believe that the proposals to replace ageing nuclear stations and polluting coal plants will provide more power at a time when North Sea oil and gas are running out. \"This is another important step towards a new generation of nuclear power stations,\" the energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said today. \"I want to listen to what people have to say about these nominations and I encourage people to log on to our website, read the information and let us have their comments. Nuclear power is part of the low-carbon future for Britain.\" The full list of potential locations for nuclear plants is: Dungeness, Kent; Sizewell, Suffolk; Hartlepool, Cleveland; Heysham, Lancashire; Sellafield, Cumbria; Braystones, Cumbria; Kirksanton, Cumbria; Wylfa Peninsula, Anglesey; Oldbury, Gloucestershire; Hinkley Point, Somerset, and Bradwell, Essex. The sites have been nominated by the energy groups EDF, E.ON and RWE, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which owns some nuclear sites. None is in Scotland or Northern Ireland. The Nuclear Industries Association said publication of a list of potential sites for nuclear development was an important step forward. \"[It] shows that we're making strong and tangible progress towards building new nuclear power stations, which will help keep the UK's lights on and drive down our carbon emissions,\" said Keith Parker, chief executive of the NIA. Local authority leaders also welcomed the move. Isle of Anglesey council leader Phil Fowlie said the announcement was \"very good news\" for the local economy, pointing out that 1,000 people are employed at the existing Wylfa power station and related businesses nearby. \"In these times it is so, so important for us to secure the future of nuclear power in Anglesey. In the short term, it will create thousands of construction jobs as the new power station is built and in the long term it will secure work for those already employed at Wylfa and nearby.\" But there was fierce criticism from the Liberal Democrats and campaigners who said they would fight hard to prevent any new power stations being constructed. \"A new generation of nuclear power stations will be a colossal mistake, regardless of where they are built. They are hugely expensive, dangerous and will take too long to build,\" said Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrats' energy and climate change spokesman. \"There is a real danger that the government is becoming too close to the big energy companies. The best answer to Britain's needs is a massive expansion of renewable energy. If billions of pounds are wasted on new nuclear sites, the money simply won't be available to do this.\" Charles Barnett, chairman of the Shutdown Sizewell Campaign, agreed: \"They are not safe. With the heightened risk of terrorism, it's foolhardy to build more. They are very expensive and they leave a legacy of dangerous waste. We shall be resisting the plans. The way forward is benign energy forms: wind, waves, solar and biomass.\" Martin Forwood, campaign co-ordinator for Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment, said any new nuclear installations in the county would be disastrous for Cumbria. \"It will seal its fate. It would become the Lake District Nuclear Park and sit very uncomfortably alongside the Lake District national park. It doesn't need to become a nuclear park; West Cumbria has so much more to offer.\" Reactors Local debates begin For \"We have got to go down this [nuclear] road or the UK is going to run short of electricity. I have lived here for 40 years and the power station has been a good neighbour.\" Trevor Hawkins, resident of Leiston, near Sizewell \"Everybody who I have spoken to seems to have a relation or a friend, or knows someone who works at the nuclear power plant. It is a massive local employer.\" Stuart Drummond, mayor of Hartlepool \"This will open the door to thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs in the near future. The new power stations are due to be running by 2017 and will create highly skilled jobs for future generations.\" Mike Graham, national secretary, Prospect union Against \"I am all for nuclear power but not here. How are the tiny roads going to take construction traffic? It's just cost me £800 to get the springs of my car fixed.\" Ed Williams, bed and breakfast owner, Kirksanton \"The moment the first sod is turned we are moving. I am relying on the Category C prison nearby which holds 400 inmates to save us. They have already said they could not evacuate all their prisoners in a [nuclear] emergency. \" Edwin Nettleton, Cumbria resident \"Many people in the vicinity of nuclear power stations are living with higher than expected rates of cancer mortality. Building without a solution to the waste problem is also irresponsible.\" David Taylor, Stop Hinkley Campaign"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/17/wind-cheaper-nuclear-eu-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-17T18:57:33Z","webTitle":"Wind power cheaper than nuclear, says EU climate chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/17/wind-cheaper-nuclear-eu-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/17/wind-cheaper-nuclear-eu-climate","fields":{"headline":"Wind power cheaper than nuclear, says EU climate chief","bodyText":"Generating energy from wind turbines at sea would be cheaper than building new atomic power plants, Europe's climate chief has said, in the latest challenge to the crisis-stricken nuclear industry. Connie Hedegaard, the EU climate change commissioner, said: \"Some people tend to believe that nuclear is very, very cheap, but offshore wind is cheaper than nuclear. People should believe that this is very, very cheap.\" Offshore wind energy has long been seen as an expensive way of generating power, costing about two to three times more than erecting turbines on land, but the expense is likely to come down, while the costs of nuclear energy are opaque, according to analysis by the European commission. The nuclear crisis in Japan has led the UK, France and other countries to tell their nationals to consider leaving Tokyo, in response to fears of spreading nuclear contamination. The crisis also prompted the EU's energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, to say: \"There is talk of an apocalypse, and I think the word is particularly well chosen.\" Hedegaard told the European Wind Energy Association's annual conference in Brussels that the problems facing nuclear power put renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power, back in the spotlight. \"There are 143 nuclear power plants in Europe and they are not going to disappear,\" she said. \"But when it comes to new energy capacity that discussion is likely to be very much influenced by what is happening in Japan.\" She suggested that the Japanese nuclear incidents, which have not yet been brought under control, would \"automatically\" turn attention to renewable power. However, she was careful to insist that it was up to member states to decide on their energy mix, as long as they adhered to the Europe-wide targets of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 and generating 20% of energy from renewable sources by the same date. Hedegaard published a \"roadmap to 2050\" this month that showed the EU was on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% if current policies are implemented. She said this strengthened the case put by some member states that the EU's current target of cutting carbon dioxide by 20% by 2020 should be toughened to 30%. China and Germany have put nuclear projects on hold after the incidents at several Japanese nuclear reactors. Europe's biggest nuclear operator, EDF of France, insisted that plans to build a new generation of reactors in Britain should not be held back by the problems in Japan. Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, said: \"While we understand the importance of adjusting the timetable to take into account the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate report [on the Japanese crisis], it is also equally important that establishing the framework for new nuclear should not be subject to undue delay. The events in Japan do not change the need for nuclear in Britain.\" He said meetings this week with local authorities regarding places such as Hinkley Point in Somerset, where EDF wants to build a new reactor, had still been positive. De Rivaz told the Nuclear Development Forum, including the energy secretary, Chris Huhne, that there was \"local determination to press ahead with our project, and the strong feeling that whilst we should learn any lessons we may need to from Japan, we should not delay our progress\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2011/jun/30/world-literature-tour-indonesia","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-30T10:47:49Z","webTitle":"World literature tour: Indonesia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jun/30/world-literature-tour-indonesia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2011/jun/30/world-literature-tour-indonesia","fields":{"headline":"World literature tour: Indonesia","bodyText":"Last month's trip to China, made all the more urgent by the regime's current crackdown on dissidents, came back with a five-year plan's worth of recommendations.

It said plans to attack dams, nuclear power facilities and nightclubs were discovered by US investigators, including a scheme to hide explosive devices in dolls and prams, along with extremist website postings. One read: \"It is war … until the infidels leave defeated.\" The 20-year-old Saudi national, Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, was arrested by the FBI on Wednesday following a tip-off earlier this month when he allegedly attempted to obtain the chemical phenol, a key ingredient in the explosive trinitrophenol or picric acid. After receiving the report, the FBI began an investigation that uncovered Aldawsari's other purchases of chemicals, including nitric and sulphuric acids, used in bomb-making, along with a journal found at his home that suggested he had long been planning a terrorist attack in the US. One journal entry describes how Aldawsari sought a particular academic scholarship because it gave him financial help and entry into the US, which he said \"will help tremendously in providing me with the support I need for Jihad\". The entry continues: \"And now, after mastering the English language, learning how to build explosives and continuous planning to target the infidel Americans, it is time for Jihad.\" The White House said Barack Obama was notified about the case before Aldawsari was arrested on Wednesday. Unlike several recent high profile arrests for terrorism-related offences, the justice department was at pains to stress that this was not a sting operation. Aldawsari travelled from Riyadh to the US on a student visa in October 2008, to study chemical engineering at Texas Tech University, and then transferred this year to South Plains College, also in Texas. According to the affidavit, Aldawsari emailed himself a document with the subject line \"Targets,\" said to contain the names and addresses of three former members of the US military who had been stationed at Abu Ghraib prison, notorious for the abuse suffered by Iraqi prisoners there at the hands of US soldiers. In other documents Aldawsari allegedly recorded the names of dams in Colorado and California, and in one email to himself — titled \"NICE TARGETS\" — he listed hydroelectric dams and nuclear power plants. On 6 February, according to the affidavit, Aldawsari sent himself an email titled \"Tyrant's House\" containing the address of George Bush's home in Dallas. Aldawsari will make his first appearance in court in Lubbock, Texas, on Friday.

Israel – like India, Pakistan and North Korea – is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The main atomic reactor in Dimona, officially for civilian use, was built with French help and became operational in the early 1960s. Within a few years the CIA concluded Israel was producing nuclear weapons at the plant, but it was not until 1986, when Mordechai Vanunu, a technician at Dimona, spoke to the Sunday Times that the extent of Israel's nuclear arsenal became clear. Four years ago Israel's then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, accidentally acknowledged Israel's nuclear capability when he told German television: \"Iran, openly, explicitly and publicly, threatens to wipe Israel off the map. Can you say that this is the same level, when they are aspiring to have nuclear weapons, as America, France, Israel and Russia?\" Formally, Israel says it will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons in the Middle East and has led calls for a hardline policy to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.

According to the semi-official ISNA news agency, officials at Iran's nuclear agency have met to determine how to combat the computer worm, called Stuxnet, which can take over systems that control the inner workings of industrial plants. The ISNA report said the virus had spread throughout Iran, but did not name the sites affected. Computer security experts who have studied Stuxnet since it emerged two months ago believe it was designed specifically to attack the Siemens-designed working system of the Bushehr plant and appears to have infected the system via the laptops and USB drives of Russian technicians who had been working there. Western experts say the worm's sophistication – and the fact that some 60% of computers infected appeared to be in Iran – pointed to a government-backed attack. Although the worm has turned up in other countries since first appearing in July – including Indonesia and the US – the frequency of its appearance in Iran has suggested the country was the intended victim of the cyber-warfare attack, with some analysts speculating that Israel might be behind it. The Russian-built nuclear plant will be internationally supervised, but world powers remain concerned that Iran wants to use its civil nuclear power programme as a cover for making weapons. While there have been no reports of damage or disruption at any Iranian nuclear facilities, last Tuesday's meeting signalled a high level of concern about the worm among Iran's nuclear officials. The Stuxnet worm has surprised experts because it is the first one created to take over industrial control systems, rather than just steal or manipulate data."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/16/nuclear-risks-and-renewable-alternatives","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T00:05:02Z","webTitle":"Letters: Nuclear risks and the renewable alternatives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/16/nuclear-risks-and-renewable-alternatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/16/nuclear-risks-and-renewable-alternatives","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear risks and the renewable alternatives","bodyText":"The assessment in your editorial (15 March) that \"the balance of the rational argument could conceivably be more in favour of nuclear [power] in a month's time\" is not just premature but ignores a number of important factors. Most worryingly, terrorists will have seen the devastation, disruption and fear that can be caused by an attack on a reactor's cooling system, which presents a much easier target for them than the containment vessel surrounding the core. Secondly, your claim that the renewable alternatives are \"illusions\" is at variance with the facts. Germany has installed more wind power capacity than the entire current UK nuclear capacity, and is adding to it at a rate equivalent to more than one new reactor a year. Furthermore, in 2009 alone Germany installed solar photovoltaic systems with capacity equivalent to approximately four nuclear reactors, and it looks like the 2010 figures will be much higher. The coalition should reverse Labour's dangerous decision to go for new nuclear build and use the money saved, firstly to strengthen our current nuclear facilities against terrorist attack, secondly to solve the long-term nuclear waste problem and thirdly to support renewables. Emeritus Professor Keith Barnham Kingston upon Thames, Surrey • You say offshore wind \"remains so costly that market forces would simply push pollution overseas if it were taken up in a big way\". Not so. As the Offshore Valuation report pointed out last year, the UK has enough offshore wind potential to become a net electricity exporter, and gain from the jobs, intellectual property and energy generated. A clean energy future lies not in nuclear, shale gas or oil imports from repressive regimes, but in developing North Sea wind. If it is to seize the winds of change, the government needs to unlock this potential by creating a strong green investment bank in next week's budget. Guy Shrubsole Director, Public Interest Research Centre • You suggest UK ministers need to apply rationality and not emotion in judging the reopening of the nuclear energy option, but they are already well down the road to a monumental nuclear decision based entirely upon politics, convenience, and a cynically breathtaking manipulation of local democracy. Rather than pursue the search for the safest place in the UK for nuclear waste, which has to be found a vault for thousands of years, the government last year asked local authorities to volunteer, certain that only those desperate to keep their sole large employer happy would do so. The authorities with few options but to be in thrall to Sellafield – Copeland, Allerdale and Cumbria – have duly agreed to \"volunteer\". So the process is already wholly skewed, with the safety aspect hardly visible. (Years ago Cumbria was ruled out for such a \"repository\" because of its unstable and watersodden geology.) UK nuclear cannot proceed until the waste mountain is resolved. A few local politicians desperate for the jobs they think it will generate, and the votes they will expect to earn, will be making that decision not only on behalf of the whole UK, but on behalf of future generations who will have to bear the consequences. Robert Straughton Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria • In the light of current terrible events (Race to save the reactors as Japan fears nuclear meltdown, 15 March), it is surprising that there is little or no discussion of thorium-based nuclear power (albeit the Guardian did mention it back in 2009). Thorium has several advantages over uranium, not least that fission stops if not maintained, so loss of power results in natural shutdown. Other advantages are higher efficiency (many times the usable energy output per unit extracted from the ground), much greater natural reserves of thorium, much lower environmental impacts of extraction, no need for costly enrichment, dramatically reduced byproducts and the much greater difficulty of obtaining fissile material for terrorism. Thorium power was tested successfully in the 50s in the US, and sporadically elsewhere, but was generally abandoned as it did not produce material for nuclear weapons. Recent reports suggest China may be considering thorium. We might be sensible to do likewise. Dr Mathias Disney University College London • I am truly shocked by John Vidal's piece (Nuclear is never safe, 15 March). Of course nuclear is never safe; neither is crossing the road. Indeed annual road deaths and lasting injuries in Britain alone comfortably exceed those of Chernobyl. It's that dreaded word \"nuclear\" that gets people going, because of panic merchants like John Vidal. The present Japan problem is not (yet) \"catastrophic\", so don't say so. Experts who give a balanced view of what is going on without the hype are drowned out by the doom merchants and a public eager for that prejudiced \"disaster\" story. Dr Nick Wrigley Boscastle, Cornwall • Given the Swiss and German authorities' rapid suspension of the replacement of their nuclear power plants (Report, 15 March), I wonder why it was that their hydroelectric schemes weren't similarly curtailed when the Banqiao dam failed in 1975, killing 26,000 people directly, and 145,000 subsequently from disease and famine. A considered analysis of the long-term impact of different energy sources will show that populist responses to nuclear emergencies are ill-fitted to an informed and rational energy policy. Dr Steve Bennett Liverpool • Where I live in Suffolk we have Sizewell. This is on a rapidly eroding, unstable coastline posing possible long-term problems for the site. But of more immediate concern to me, and others, is the very real risk of a man-made disaster. For me the costs are just too high. Surely there is another way?

He wasn't just a member of the world's first open online community, the Well; he co-founded it. And he wasn't just another of those 60s acid casualties; he was the definitive 60s acid casualty. Well, not casualty exactly, but he was there taking LSD in the days when it was still legal, with the most famous hipster of them all, Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters. For nearly five decades, Stewart Brand has been hanging around the cutting edge of whatever is the most cutting thing of the day. Largely because he's discovered it and become fascinated with it long before anyone else has even noticed it but, in retrospect, it does make him seem like the west coast's answer to Zelig, the Woody Allen character who just happens to pop up at key moments in history. Because no one pops up like Stewart Brand pops up, right there, just on the cusp of something momentous. I discover this for myself when I go and hunt down my ancient copy of Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. It's one of the defining pieces of new journalism, a rip-roaring ride through 1960s psychedelia in which Wolfe accompanies Kesey and the Pranksters across the States on a Day-Glo bus. And although I know about Brand's connection to Kesey, I didn't know he was in it. But of course he is, right there on page two, driving the Pranksters' pick-up truck (\"a thin, blond guy\", according to Wolfe, with \"a blazing disk on his forehead\" and \"a whole necktie of Indian beads … but no shirt\"). \"That is classic Stewart,\" says Fred Turner, associate professor of communication at Stanford, who has written a book about Brand. \"He only hung out with the Pranksters for about 10 minutes.\" And he's right there on page two, of the definitive account of them. \"Exactly. He has a sort of genius for being in exactly the right place at exactly the right time.\" It is a sort of genius. The same year that Tom Wolfe's book came out – 1968 – Brand just happened to be at what came to be known as the \"mother of all demos\" when the world first saw what computers could do. Douglas Englebart astonished the 1,000 foremost computer scientists with the first computer mouse, the first teleconferencing, the first word processing, and the first interactive computing. (Being Stewart Brand, of course, he wasn't just there, he was operating the camera and consulting on the presentation.) What's more, later that same year he published the first edition of what came to be the magnum opus of the entire counterculture, the Whole Earth Catalog – a book that some people, Turner included, believed changed the world. Though it wasn't exactly a book, it was a how-to manual, a compendium, an enyclopedia, a literary review, an opinionated life guide, and a collection of readers' recommendations and reviews of everything from computational physics to goat husbandry. This year marks its 45th anniversary. I have a slightly later, yellowing and decrepit edition, from 1971, though it's the same oversized format. It's the edition that sold 2m copies and won a US National Book award, and the tips on spot welding, home remedies for crabs (not the marine kind, I don't think), dealing with drug busts, and building your own geodesic dome are rather delightfully quaint. (I especially like an extract from the underground guide to US colleges which states that, at the University of Illinois: \"The hip chicks will do it. It is easier to find a chick who will have sex now than it was two years ago when things were extremely difficult.\") But it doesn't even begin to convey the revolution that the Whole Earth Catalog represented. But then, it's almost impossible, to flick through the pages of the Catalog and recapture its newness and radicalism and potentialities. Not least because the very idea of a book changing the world is just so old-fashioned. Books don't change anything these days. If you want to start a revolution, you'd do it on Facebook. And so many of the ideas that first reached a mainstream audience in the Catalog – organic farming, solar power, recycling, wind power, desktop publishing, mountain bikes, midwife-assisted birth, female masturbation, computers, electronic synthesizers – are now simply part of our world, that the ones that didn't go mainstream (communes being a prime example) rather stand out. Turner's 2006 book, From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network and the Rise of Digital Utopianism, gives more of a clue. Several epoch-making events were going on in the San Francisco area in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, and at the centre of them all, linking them together – no surprises here – was Stewart Brand. Ken Kesey believed that drugs would herald a new era of human consciousness. While scientists like Doug Englebart (who had, like Brand, taken part in LSD-assisted creativity sessions) came to believe that computers would be part of that. They were were developing the hardware while Brand was articulating a vision of how they might be a new tool to empower ordinary people: small scale, democratic and free. Or, as John Markoff, a technology writer for the New York Times, puts it, the Whole Earth Catalog was \"the internet before the internet. It was the book of the future. It was a web in newsprint.\" It changed the world, says Turner, in much the same way that Google changed the world: it made people visible to each other. And while the computer industry was building systems to link communities of scientists, the Catalog was a \"vernacular technology\" that was doing the same thing. \"And Stewart knew this because he's sitting here in the middle of the tech world. But much of the rest of America can't see that yet. But he can see it. And he makes it visible and he makes it cool – and these things are important.\" Forty-five years on and he's still cool. Mick Jagger might be the most obvious 60s icon who's kept on rocking. But mostly he's kept on rocking all the old tunes. Stewart Brand, on the other hand, has continued to evolve and change and at the age of 74, he's still out there at the intellectual cutting edge. The Whole Earth Catalog may have been his most famous creation, but he's been involved in dozens of other, possibly even more influential, projects since. I interview him at the TED conference in Long Beach where he'd just delivered a talk (his fifth at TED) on his latest enthusiasm, which is about as radical as they come: de-extinction. He's trying to resurrect extinct species by retro-engineering their DNA. In many ways, he's the elder statesman of radical ideas, an emissary from the Sixties counterculture who continues to inspire each successive generation anew; a living link between the heady days of the pioneering new technology and today. John Markoff, who wrote What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry, says, simply: \"Stewart was the first one to get it. He was the first person to understand cyberspace. He was the one who coined the term personal computer. And he influenced an entire generation, including an entire generation of technologists.\" It is in no way hard to find people who have been inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog and by Stewart Brand. Chris Anderson, curator of TED, the conference series for \"ideas worth spreading\", tells me that \"in my own mind, he's my intellectual hero\". Chris Anderson – yes, there's two of them – a former editor of Wired and leading light in the \"maker movement\" of industrial DIYers – describes him as \"an international treasure\" and \"one of my gods\". He actually thanks me for writing about him. Stewart Brand, it turns out, is the hero's hero. And to no one more so than Steve Jobs. No one was more influenced, or inspired by, Stewart Brand, than the founder of Apple. And while many credit Jobs with being one of the most creative agents of change in the late 20th century, Jobs credited Brand. Steve Jobs's Stanford commencement address, a short talk that he gave in 2005 and which went viral after his death in 2011, is, in many ways, the ne plus ultra of Jobsian wisdom. It encapsulated his thoughts on life, love and death. It expressed his lifelong philosophy and motivation. And it ends with a moving tribute to Brand and what he calls \"an amazing publication called the Whole Earth Catalog\", which he describes as \"one of the bibles of my generation\". It's worth quoting the rest of it in full: \"It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions. \"Stewart and his team put out several issues of the Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: 'Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.' It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.\" Were you surprised when you heard that, I ask Brand. \"I was, yes, though I'd known it meant something to him as I'd been told that he wanted a copy of the cover of 'Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish' signed by me. And I signed one and sent it off to him. That was the first inkling I had that it mattered to him. But I wish I'd had a chance to really quiz him on what he got from that. \"I think he used it as a way to deal with the amount of wealth and power that was accumulating around him. That though he took great care to make sure that it did accumulate, it was a way to keep himself two-minded about it. I think it may have been the way of dealing with the innovator's dilemma, where to keep building on the new innovations you have to destroy the wonderful thing you built a couple of years ago. \"And remember this was the 70s. We were: fuck around with it, mess with it, try it sideways. That was what it was all about. I was an early hippy as it turned out, and Steve Jobs was a late hippy, and we were paying attention to the beatniks and the late hippies were paying attention to the early hippies and so it goes on.\" Jobs may have given the world the Apple 2 and iTunes and the iPhone but he's the heir to a cultural mash-up that Brand was both an observer of and a participant in: hippies and computers. And for those puzzled by the confluence of Steve Jobs's professed peace'n'love ideals and his life spent making shiny consumer durables, Fred Turner points out that the Catalog was at its heart \"deeply consumerist\". I hadn't really thought of in that way but as Turner says \"it's full of stuff to buy. All those down jackets and kayaks. It's one of the first places you see the earliest mountain bikes.\" It offers a vision of changing the world, he says, through buying stuff, an \"idea which has stuck around\". There was nothing in Brand's background to suggest that he would become this pivotal figure. He was brought up in Rockford, Illinois, where his father worked in advertising and his mother was a Vassar-educated space fanatic, an enthusiasm that rubbed off on her son. He studied biology at Stanford and then had a stint in the army where he became a \"weekend hippy and weekday soldier\". It was meeting the Beats that changed everything. He took up photography and started photographing Native American reservations around the country and it is was this link that led him to Ken Kesey, who had featured a Native American as a central character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. \"I got his address from a mutual friend and he said come on by. So I went on by and was met at the door by somebody with a joint. Next thing I knew I was part of the scene.\" But his encounter with Kesey came at the same time as his encounter with another San Francisco phenomenon. \"I was at the Stanford computation centre and this was some time in the early 60s and I saw these young men playing Spacewar! [an early computer game]. They were out of their bodies in this game that they'd created out of nothing. It was the only way to describe it. They were having an out-of-body experience and up until that time the only out-of-body experiences I'd seen were drugs.\" It wasn't until 1972 that Brand wrote about it, and he still wrote about it before anyone else, in Rolling Stone magazine, an article that is so prophetic, it's almost hallucinatory. Brand's revelation, that he understood before almost anyone else, was that cyberspace was some sort of fourth dimension and the possibilities were both empowering and limitless. At that time, computers weren't hip. They weren't cool. They were controlled by faceless corporations and the military. They were Big Business and authority, or, as they said then, \"The Man\". \"What Buckminster Fuller was saying and what Marshall McLuhan was saying and what I was saying, all in our different ways, was that technology is liberating if you make it so. And a fair number of the hippies bought that programme. I guess Steve Jobs is the most conspicuous one. He was a total hippy, his last words were 'Oh wow' – he said it three times, according to his sister.\" It was also the starting point for another of Brand's most famously repeated ideas: that information wants to be free (although he always points out the second half of the sentence was that \"it also wants to be expensive\"). \"We are as gods and might as well get good at it,\" wrote Brand on the title page of the Whole Earth Catalog. Up until now, he noted, power has been in the hands of \"government, big business, formal education, church\". But now \"a realm of intimate, personal power is developing – power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment and share his adventure with whoever is interested. Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the Whole Earth Catalog.\" In his mind, he says, he had \"Diderot and his Encylopédie and this Enlightenment idea that basically knowledge had been held back by the aristocrats and all the rest. The whole thing was to keep people from knowing how to do things. So Diderot was in my mind. And so was the LL Bean catalogue which was full of outdoors stuff.\" His hero was Buckminster Fuller, a futurist architect and designer, who he says \"bent my twig\" with what Brand calls a \"psychedelic version of engineering\". \"Fuller said if all the politicians died this week it would be a nuisance, but if all the scientists and engineers in the world died it would be catastrophic. So where's the real juice here? \"And he really got me and others focused on that. Lots of people try and change human nature but it's a real waste of time. You can't change human nature, but you can change tools, you can change techniques.\" And that way \"you can change civilisation\". Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of Wired magazine, tells me how he first came across the Catalog when he was still in high school \"and it changed my life. But then it changed everybody's life. It inspired me not to go to college but to go and try and live out my own life. It was like being given permission to invent your own life. That was what the Catalog did. It was called 'access to tools' and it gave you tools to create your own education, your own business, your own life.\" Chris Anderson, the later editor of Wired, who is younger than both Brand and Kelly, says that he is absolutely the inheritor of the Catalog's \"chain of influence\". \"The Whole Earth Catalog inspired the Homebrew Computing Club, who inspired Steve Wozniak to build the Apple 2, who inspired the personal computer movement, who in turn inspired the original web. Who inspired the open-source software movement. Who inspired the open-source hardware movement which inspired the maker movement who inspired me.\" What's perhaps most remarkable about Brand, though, is the way that he himself has stayed hungry, has stayed foolish. Markoff says that his extraordinary capacity to be at the edge of the change \"has puzzled me for years. Some people will be at the heart of one event but not over and over a long period of time. It can't be happenstance to keep on doing it.\" He made millions from the Catalog but gave most of it away. At the final party he experimented with giving away $20,000 in cash because he thought that the extra stimulation of handing over wads of notes would \"be an interesting thing to do. And indeed it was an interesting thing to do. I did not turn out any particularly creative ideas, I have to say. That was part of what made it interesting. My hypothesis was that under duress people would get extra creative. But it turns out they become extra knee-jerk and the opposite of creative. But you know, that's how you find out these things.\" Turner calls him the most influential person you've never heard of, and though in Silicon Valley he's a god to many he still lives on a houseboat in Sausalito just outside San Francisco, and in the flesh is modest and unassuming. He looks like the fit and active 74-year-old he is, dressed in clothes that look like they'd take him straight from a conference hall to a hike in the mountains. I'd thought he might be quite forbidding but he's a great storyteller with a healthy sense of humour that he's happy to turn against himself. Can he remember where the idea for \"stay hungry, stay foolish\" came from? \"That one is a mystery,\" he says at first. And then, \"Oh I know, it's because of my campaign to get photographs of the whole Earth which I did in 1966 and after which the Whole Earth Catalog is named. \"We were just starting to get files of photographs of the Earth, and there was a sequence from a satellite of basically a day in the life of Earth from sunrise to sunset, and I wanted that sequence and to make the connection between the view from space of the shadow moving across the Earth, and the experience of being on Earth and seeing dawn. And for some reason the image I had in my mind was of a hitchhiker at dawn on a road somewhere and the sun comes up and there are trains going by. The frame of mind of the young hitchhiker is one of the freest frames of mind there is. You're always a little bit hungry and you know you are being completely foolish.\" It's a long explanation but what's interesting is how it ties in Brand's cosmic view of Earth, expanded consciousness (he first started his campaign to get photographs of the Earth from space after an LSD trip in which he thought he could see the curvature of the Earth), science – the Nasa space programme – and personal freedom. He's always someone who's been able to take the long view, says TED's Chris Anderson. \"I see him as someone whose life's work has been making people see the world in a different way.\" In recent years, he established the Long Now Foundation, which aims to promote long-term thinking (projects include building a clock that will keep time for 10,000 years, ticking once a year and chiming to mark each millennium). He's written on architecture in How Buildings Learn, he's shaken up the ecology movement with Whole Earth Discipline – in which, among other things, he espouses mass urbanisation and nuclear power and then of course there's \"de-extinction\". He's working alongside his wife, Ryan Phelan, a biotech entrepreneur, and George Church, the leading Harvard geneticist, and there's more than a touch of Jurassic Park to the concept. They're trying to retro-engineer lost species by comparing their DNA with that of their closest living relatives – though sadly they're starting with the American passenger pigeon rather than Tyrannosaurus rex. Once the most populous bird in North America, its extinction was a \"tragedy\", Brand says in his TED talk, but then adds: \"Don't mourn, organise.\" This could be another of Brand's maxims. He's always been a doer. Kevin Kelly tells me that he says when he has an idea, he tries to act on it within 10 minutes, which just seems impossibly dynamic. But then, Fred Turner points out, \"he's also had a lifetime of organising. And a lifetime teaches you things. I assure you that when he was much younger he did not feel he needed to get things done in 10 minutes. He would do things like take his entire production staff out into the desert, inflate a giant plastic bubble, and try to live around and inside that bubble to see how that affected production.\" Adversely, it turned out. But then Brand is first and foremost a scientist. As was the case when he gave away $20,000 in cash, he wants to test things empirically. He's an experimenter who's always prepared to test his theories. (\"It may have been the entire function of communes to go big, fail and then go home,\" says Brand, to take one example. \"At the time we thought we were reinventing civilisation but all we discovered is that free love isn't free at all, that [when] one guy puts up all the money for your commune he is going to feel robbed after a period of six to 12 months, that gardening is actually hard, and that if you treat your women as people who are supposed to wash the dishes, they will leave after six months.\") The drugs didn't work. Or at least only for a bit. \"We believed there was no hope without dope but we were wrong. I'm always amazed there aren't drugs by now, but there aren't. They didn't get any better, whereas computers never stopped getting better.\" He didn't just theorise about cyberspace, he co-founded the Well, the pioneering online community in the 80s, and lived on it, fighting the first flame wars, the first trolls, making the first mistakes (he wishes he'd insisted the people used their real names rather than post anonymously, an innovation that may well have changed the web for the better). And he's still out there on the leading edge today. It's no surprise that he's into biotech. It really is the next frontier, though he claims at the moment that he's not so much surfing the next wave of innovation as \"paddling to keep up\". There used to be a sense, though perhaps less so now, that there would never be as exciting a time as the 60s again. And yet Brand, who had the best of the 60s, who really was there and can even remember it, is so much more excited by the present, by the future. \"It's much much more exciting right now. The tools of connectivity are so much stronger. The tools of empowerment have absolutely lowered the thresholds of entry. There's things like the iGem with tens of thousands of students producing new organisms. And society is not noticing. I find that both strange, wonderful and in some ways a little bit disturbing.\" And it's possibly worth noticing what Stewart Brand is noticing. \"Think about the Bay Area in the early 60s,\" Fred Turner tells me. \"He could have focused on antiwar protests, on fluorescent parties, on any number of things. He goes to a basement in Stanford and watches people run a computer game.\" Brand's career is as extraordinary and eclectic as they come. As they used to say in the 60s, it's been quite a ride. And yet I still hesitated over whether to include this last quote on him. It's rather delightfully of its time but it's also so over the top. Or is it?

The outcome of the four ballots, which will be known later on Monday, looked certain to dash the plans of Italy's embattled rightwing government for a big nuclear construction programme and water privatisation. Berlusconi said: \"We shall have to say good-bye to nuclear [energy].\" He told a press conference in Rome that his government would now throw all its energy into developing renewable sources. The expected outcome would be a huge success for the anti-nuclear movement in the world's first nationwide vote on the issue since Japan's Fukushima disaster. But the ballot was also the latest - and most persuasive - evidence that a majority of Italians has turned against their flamboyant prime minister. Under Italian law, referendums require more than half the electorate to vote to be binding. The government did all it could to keep turnout low and appealed to the courts for the vote to be declared illegal. Italian television, largely under Berlusconi's sway, almost ignored the approaching ballots until the final days of a poorly funded, low-profile campaign. Yet the interior minister, Roberto Maroni, said his department's projections indicated the opposition would reach its 50% target, regardless of the turnout among more than three million Italians overseas who are entitled to vote. Berlusconi's government, which yokes his Freedom People movement to the regionalist and Islamophobic Northern League, first ran into serious trouble on 30 May when his candidate for mayor of Milan lost in a local election runoff. Milan is Berlusconi's home city and has traditionally been a weather-vane, accurately pointing to Italy's future political direction. Since then, many rank-and-file league supporters have been urging their leader, Umberto Bossi, to cut himself free of Berlusconi. The party leadership has so far remained wedded to the coalition while pressing for a radical change in economic policy that would deliver tax cuts to its lower middle-class electoral base. Italy abandoned its nuclear programme following a similar referendum in 1987. But the moratorium it introduced only remained in force for five years. Berlusconi had planned to generate a quarter of Italy's electricity with French-built nuclear plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/20/new-europe-france","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-20T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"Welcome to France","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/20/new-europe-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/20/new-europe-france","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to France","bodyText":"This week the Guardian's New Europe series moves south-west, from Germany to France. Here, we will report from a country that is on the brink of election season, with the presidential contest to be held next year. But the economy is mired in gloom and doubts linger about the durability of its much-cherished exception culturelle. Over the next week, in the paper and on the Guardian's website, our correspondents, columnists and critics will write about food, film and finance, media, music and multiculturalism. We will explore France's affinity for nuclear power, investigate the strengths of the health system – and the weakness of education and the jobs-for-life culture. We will hear from numerous French voices as part of this series, which includes live blogs, films and podcasts. There will be interviews with leading French political and cultural figures. In subsequent weeks, our series will move further south, to Spain, before looking east to the biggest new EU country, Poland. Stay with us on this month-long journey.

The scenes of devastation that filled our screens and the tragic images of people searching for missing family members will haunt us for a long time. The threat from the damage to Fukushima nuclear power station gave the world a wake-up call. But with today the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, that other image of destruction from Japan leaves many questioning why on Earth we would countenance building a new nuclear weapons capable of causing death and destruction thousands of times worse than the havoc wreaked by a natural disasters and the fall-out from Fukushima. This week, the House of Commons defence select committee published a damning report highlighting that basic defence capability is falling below the minimum required. Cuts in conventional forces are no longer a myth but a reality, with redundancies already under way. Meanwhile CND believes that the government's estimate for spending on Trident replacement in the next 10 years is massively understated, with overall costs of design, procurement, materials and lifetime maintenance set to be in excess of £100bn. When I suggested recently in the House of Commons that the moral case against Trident replacement had never been more compelling, the defence secretary, Liam Fox, was arrogantly dismissive. But I believe I spoke for the many who want the government to focus on improving health and care services for our elderly and disabled, educating our young people and building homes for the future. In my experience, more and more people are questioning why the government claims that it needs to impose savage cuts on almost all areas of our public services while billions are still being poured into huge military projects that have no relevance to the defence of Britain. Defence experts have spoken out publicly and former ministers, including Lord Browne of Ladyton, are now actively involved in top level groups on disarmament. The \"main gate\" decision will not be taken until after the next general election, so we can influence future policy. Within the Labour party, we have the opportunity through the various policy reviews taking place to debate our position and we must give party members that voice. Otherwise, we will find ourselves behind public opinion, given opinion poll findings that highlight limited support for Trident replacement. Ed Miliband rightly recognised this during the leadership contest when responding to Labour CND saying \"we need to have a thorough examination of that [Trident replacement] decision as part of the government's strategic defence review\" and that \"the review should look at the totality of our conventional and nuclear capabilities, considering both our defence needs and what our priorities are in the changing economic climate\". Trident was excluded from the defence review, its funding guaranteed, when many other public spending commitments were cut back. Many of us in the Labour party believe no case has been made to continue with the replacement and believe the party should continue to press for that thorough review of defence policy – you can add your support here. The public deserves to know the comparative costs of conventional defence and peacekeeping with maintaining nuclear weapons, and that information should inform any decision on the construction of the new submarines. It is my personal view there is no longer a case for wasting Ministry of Defence resources on nuclear weapons. What better time than Hiroshima Day to renew our commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons, and continue the campaign to make it a reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/16/industrial-strategy-nuclear-manufacturing-forgemasters","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-16T00:05:01Z","webTitle":"Government rediscovers industry by funding nuclear firm Sheffield Forgemasters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/16/industrial-strategy-nuclear-manufacturing-forgemasters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/16/industrial-strategy-nuclear-manufacturing-forgemasters","fields":{"headline":"Government rediscovers industry by funding nuclear firm Sheffield Forgemasters","bodyText":"The government's much-vaunted \"low-carbon industrial strategy\" is set to receive a boost on Wednesday with the announcement of a long-awaited £170m funding package for the British nuclear manufacturer, Sheffield Forgemasters. The company, which has been in funding negotiations for more than six months, has secured the last remaining £20m from bank loans, the Guardian has learnt. It means Sheffield Forgemasters will be able to build a 15,000-tonne press to make large forgings used in modern reactors being built in the UK and overseas. The business secretary, Lord Mandelson, and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, will travel to Sheffield, along with the business minister, Pat McFadden, to make the announcement on Wednesday. Boosting the hi-tech industrial economy in the UK will become a key political battleground in the run-up to the general election after the credit crunch exposed the dangers of becoming over-reliant on financial services. Official data recently showed that in its first decade in power Labour had allowed the manufacturing sector to shrink at a quicker rate than under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. In response, Mandelson, who has been heavily involved in the complex negotiations, has been championing a new policy of \"industrial activism\". Ministers say that without more government support for industry, the tens of billions of pounds of new reactors and wind turbines planned to reduce carbon emissions would have to be imported. British manufacturers and workers would miss out. To secure the funding, the government has pledged £65m in soft loans, with £35m from the European Investment Bank. The nuclear reactor firm Westinghouse is paying £50m upfront for its orders. The deal also provides a much-needed boost to the north-east, where traditional manufacturers such as Corus have been hammered by the recession and which has one of the highest UK jobless rates. Mandelson wants to create a hub of low-carbon manufacturers in the region with ties to Sheffield University. He recently opened a new £25m research facility in Rotherham for Britain's civil nuclear industry where Sheffield Forgemasters can work with other UK firms in the supply chain. Dougie Rooney, of the Unite union, said: \"The only hope for the nation in terms of being able to pay off its debts is for the UK's engineering industry to become a global supply-chain player supplying components and equipment for new energy projects.\" The Sheffield firm is one of only a few around the world that can make the special forgings for reactors. There is increasing political pressure on nuclear companies to source as many components as possible from the UK. The deal will create 150 jobs directly, but thousands more could be created in the wider nuclear supply chain as a result, according to Unite. Sheffield Forgemasters, whose origins go back to the 1750s, became notorious in the 1990s after becoming embroiled in the \"Supergun affair\" over arms sales to Iraq."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
