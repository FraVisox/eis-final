The warning, in a report by the energy regulator, Ofgem, could embolden the government to trigger an early \"dash for gas\" which critics fear would mean higher carbon pollution for decades to come. Ofgem believes that the spare generating capacity available to cope with peaks and troughs in power demand will fall from the current level of 14% to just 4% as early as 2015. \"There could be insufficient power within three years of around 29,600 megawatt hours, equivalent to the annual demand of approximately 9,000 households,\" says the Ofgem report. It also mentions the possibility of blackouts. Ofgem pointed out that National Grid, which runs the pylons and pipes and co-authored the report, can safeguard the position of householders if all else fails by cutting power to businesses and industrial customers under the terms of special contracts. National Grid also has contingency plans to avoid interrupting supply to customers by asking power stations to maximise generation and importing more power from Europe. However, Andrew Wright, a senior executive at Ofgem, played down the chances of a return to 1970s-style power cuts. \"It is too early to be alarmist about the lights going out,\" he said on Friday, but \"it is likely the tightening of the market will lead to higher wholesale prices\". The cost of fuel is already a major political issue. Britain's second largest energy company, SSE, is planning to increase the price of a typical dual fuel bill by 9% from 15 October and other power companies are expected to follow. Government hopes that it could encourage the building of a new generation of nuclear power stations have been hit by Chinese, German and other major investors pulling back from expected UK investment. At the same time, wind farms have been delayed by planning objections. A report by Ofgem three years ago warned that Britain faced \"unprecedented challenges\" as a result of the global financial crisis, tough environmental targets and the closure of ageing power stations. The regulator admittedon Friday that despite a determination to safeguard the country's power structure by encouraging the building of lower-carbon power sources the \"problems have not gone away\". Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said his forthcoming energy bill and a series of measures on market reforms, about to be published by Ofgem, should help tackle the issue: \"Security of electricity supply is of critical importance to the health of the economy and the smooth functioning of our daily lives. That is why the government is reforming the electricity market to deliver secure, clean and affordable electricity.\" The Greenpeace policy director, Doug Parr, said the Ofgem report \"sends out a clear warning that we need to reduce demand\" rather than build new power stations. The energy outlook has been made more difficult by a 38% fall in coal prices in the past 12 months. This has made coal burning more profitable than ever for power generators, according to the independent energy consultant Inenco. \"However, the accelerated use of coal in the past year does now mean that some older, more pollutant coal power plants will have to come offline earlier than first predicted, leading to a bigger energy crunch further down the road,\" said Gary Hornby, an Inenco analyst. Audrey Gallacher, the director of energy at Consumer Focus, said householders needed protection from price spikes as well as power cuts. \"It is right that we close our oldest and most polluting energy plants, but it is essential that new initiatives deliver investment in alternative energy generation to meet this gap,\" she said, adding: \"At the same time, however, consumers cannot write a blank cheque to cover the costs of new energy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/08/wind-farms-ireland-uk-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-08T17:59:56Z","webTitle":"Windfarms on Ireland's bog of Allen could provide UK electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/08/wind-farms-ireland-uk-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/08/wind-farms-ireland-uk-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Windfarms on Ireland's bog of Allen could provide UK electricity","bodyText":"Hundreds of windfarms could be built on Ireland's great bog of Allen to generate electricity exclusively for the UK's national grid under plans being considered by ministers. Element Power, the company behind the £5bn proposals, hopes to build more than 700 turbines and transport power through two dedicated undersea cables across the Irish sea. Company executives met Ed Davey, the cabinet minister in charge of climate change, and civil servants to discuss the plans this summer. The plans have been discussed among the coalition and appear in theory to appease both political parties. Liberal Democrats wish for an increase in green energy but have concerns over the high price of building windfarms offshore. Conservative ministers are worried about the backlash in some rural communities as wind turbines have become more common in Britain. To proceed, the Irish project would need access to the subsidies currently given to UK wind power, but the difficulty for ministers in setting a precedent – which could mean any foreign energy projects can get UK subsidies – means the project face major challenges. Mike O'Neill, the president of Element Power, said the project would solve a number of thorny problems for the British government. \"Our experience is that it is easier to get planning permission in the Republic of Ireland, if you do it in a sensible and sensitive way,\" he said. Britain's electricity suppliers are obliged to provide an increasing percentage of their electricity from renewable sources, to help the UK meet its legally binding targets for cutting the carbon emissions that drive climate change. Costs for onshore wind power are currently estimated to be half that of offshore wind power. Element Power claims its project, entitled Greenwire, will provide electricity at two-thirds of the cost of building a big offshore windfarm, which will reduce the amount that needs to be charged to the UK consumer by £7bn over 15 years. The company says its proposed investment would be €8bn – two-thirds for the wind turbines and a third for the two big sub-sea cables that would take the electricity to the UK. It says the project could provide 3GW of electricity capacity and employ thousands of workers. O'Neill said the project could start generating power from 2018, if the subsidy obstacle could be overcome. Another hold-up were the delays in the government setting the actual level of the subsidy, so the project can proceed. O'Neill said energy company EDF was getting special treatment from the government over the price that will be guaranteed for nuclear power and that Greenwire should get the same. There are more than 1,100 turbines in operation in Ireland, mostly at 176 onshore windfarms with a further seven offshore. Element Power hopes to expand in Meath, Westmeath, Kildare, Laois and Offaly but says that its project will not prevent the Republic of Ireland meeting its own carbon target of a 40% cut by 2020. Coalition tensions over green issues have increased since September's reshuffle. Owen Paterson, who has campaigned against windfarms in his own constituency, is believed to have clashed with Davey, the Lib Dem secretary of state for energy and climate change. Davey appeared to see off Conservative ministers' attempts to slash the subsidies for onshore windfarms, instead sticking with a smaller cut previously agreed with the industry. The row began after more than 100 Conservative backbenchers wrote to the prime minister earlier this year demanding he \"dramatically cut\" the £400m in annual subsidies paid to onshore wind developers. The energy secretary said the new changes to subsidies for renewables, which also include reducing offshore wind payments and more than doubling support for tidal, stream and wave power, would boost clean electricity while curbing the cost to consumers. • References in this article and headline to the 'bog of Ireland' were changed to 'bog of Allen' on 9 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/jan/08/china-japan-drone-race","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-09T16:50:00Z","webTitle":"Japan and China step up drone race as tension builds over disputed islands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/08/china-japan-drone-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jan/08/china-japan-drone-race","fields":{"headline":"Japan and China step up drone race as tension builds over disputed islands","bodyText":"Drones have taken centre stage in an escalating arms race between China and Japan as they struggle to assert their dominance over disputed islands in the East China Sea. China is rapidly expanding its nascent drone programme, while Japan has begun preparations to purchase an advanced model from the US. Both sides claim the drones will be used for surveillance, but experts warn the possibility of future drone skirmishes in the region's airspace is \"very high\". Tensions over the islands – called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkaku by Japan – have ratcheted up in past weeks. Chinese surveillance planes flew near the islands four times in the second half of December, according to Chinese state media, but were chased away each time by Japanese F-15 fighter jets. Neither side has shown any signs of backing down. Japan's new conservative administration of Shinzo Abe has placed a priority on countering the perceived Chinese threat to the Senkakus since it won a landslide victory in last month's general election. Soon after becoming prime minister, Abe ordered a review of Japan's 2011-16 mid-term defence programme, apparently to speed up the acquisition of between one and three US drones. Under Abe, a nationalist who wants a bigger international role for the armed forces, Japan is expected to increase defence spending for the first time in 11 years in 2013. The extra cash will be used to increase the number of military personnel and upgrade equipment. The country's deputy foreign minister, Akitaka Saiki, summoned the Chinese ambassador to Japan on Tuesday to discuss recent \"incursions\" of Chinese ships into the disputed territory. China appears unbowed. \"Japan has continued to ignore our warnings that their vessels and aircraft have infringed our sovereignty,\" top-level marine surveillance official Sun Shuxian said in an interview posted to the State Oceanic Administration's website, according to Reuters. \"This behaviour may result in the further escalation of the situation at sea and has prompted China to pay great attention and vigilance.\" China announced late last month that the People's Liberation Army was preparing to test-fly a domestically developed drone, which analysts say is likely a clone of the US's carrier-based X-47B. \"Key attack technologies will be tested,\" reported the state-owned China Daily, without disclosing further details. Andrei Chang, editor-in-chief of the Canadian-based Kanwa Defence Review, said China might be attempting to develop drones that can perform reconnaissance missions as far away as Guam, where the US is building a military presence as part of its \"Asia Pivot\" strategy. China unveiled eight new models in November at an annual air show on the southern coastal city Zhuhai, photographs of which appeared prominently in the state-owned press. Yet the images may better indicate China's ambitions than its abilities, according to Chang: \"We've seen these planes on the ground only — if they work or not, that's difficult to explain.\" Japanese media reports said the defence ministry hopes to introduce Global Hawk unmanned aircraft near the disputed islands by 2015 at the earliest in an attempt to counter Beijing's increasingly assertive naval activity in the area. Chinese surveillance vessels have made repeated intrusions into Japanese waters since the government in Tokyo in effect nationalised the Senkakus in the summer, sparking riots in Chinese cities and damaging trade ties between Asia's two biggest economies. The need for Japan to improve its surveillance capability was underlined late last year when Japanese radar failed to pick up a low-flying Chinese aircraft as it flew over the islands. The Kyodo news agency quoted an unnamed defence ministry official as saying the drones would be used \"to counter China's growing assertiveness at sea, especially when it comes to the Senkaku islands\". China's defence budget has exploded over the past decade, from about £12.4bn in 2002 to almost £75bn in 2011, and its military spending could surpass the US's by 2035. The country's first aircraft carrier, a refurbished Soviet model called the Liaoning, completed its first sea trials in August. A 2012 report by the Pentagon acknowledged long-standing rumours that China was developing a new generation of stealth drones, called Anjian, or Dark Sword, whose capabilities could surpass those of the US's fleet. China's state media reported in October that the country would build 11 drone bases along the coastline by 2015. \"Over disputed islands, such as the Diaoyu Islands, we do not lag behind in terms of the number of patrol vessels or the frequency of patrolling,\" said Senior Colonel Du Wenlong, according to China Radio International. \"The problem lies in our surveillance capabilities.\" China's military is notoriously opaque, and analysts' understanding of its drone programme is limited. \"They certainly get a lot of mileage out of the fact that nobody knows what the hell they're up to, and they'd take great care to protect that image,\" said Ron Huisken, an expert on east Asian security at Australian National University. He said the likelihood of a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese drones in coming years was \"very high\". US drones have also attracted the interest of the South Korean government as it seeks to beef up its ability to monitor North Korea, after last month's successful launch of a rocket that many believe was a cover for a ballistic-missile test. The US's Global Hawk is piloted remotely by a crew of three and can fly continuously for up to 30 hours at a maximum height of about 60,000 ft. It has no attack capability. The US deployed the advanced reconnaissance drone to monitor damage to the Fukushima nuclear power plant in the aftermath of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami on Japan's north-east coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/24/political-posturing-green-investment-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-24T15:06:41Z","webTitle":"Political posturing has limited the potential of the green investment bank | Caroline Lucas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/24/political-posturing-green-investment-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/24/political-posturing-green-investment-bank","fields":{"headline":"Political posturing has limited the potential of the green investment bank","bodyText":"Writing on the green investment bank a few weeks ago, I had been optimistic about the emergence of a cross-party consensus and the chances of a positive outcome. Unfortunately, as is so often the case in the House of Commons, what followed was more than a little disappointing. In last Wednesday's vote on the bank, MPs had the opportunity to amend the enterprise and regulatory reform bill by supporting two crucial changes: the ability to borrow from the capital markets by 2015 at the very latest, and ensuring the bank would actually invest in projects that would fit with the UK's climate change objectives. It proved a very frustrating day, not least because the government made sure that there was barely enough time to debate the amendments. In the 45 minutes allowed, there was only enough time for the minister and the opposition spokesperson, and no time at all for backbenchers to speak. Worse still, all the work by organisations and MPs behind the scenes to create a cross-party consensus evaporated in a cloud of political posturing. The bank must be able to borrow as soon as possible in order to take advantage of the current low cost of capital and to leverage in a large proportion of the private sector investment needed for the UK's low-carbon economy to flourish. But despite Labour talking passionately about the need for policy certainty and the need for the bank to borrow by 2015 at the latest (rather than the expected 2017), they seemed to ditch this view at the last minute. The Labour amendment included a caveat that reintroduced uncertainty and aligned their position with that of the Treasury. The Liberal Democrats were hardly better. Just a few short weeks after a vote at their party conference to do exactly what my amendment proposed, the Liberal Democrats had a fit of amnesia and didn't take the opportunity to support it. Second, on the \"purposes\" of the bank: the green remit that the government has put forward for the bank to invest in is so wide that it is almost legally meaningless. There is a risk that it could even allow new fossil fuel power generation to receive support, which would be completely unacceptable. The amendment I tabled with other MPs would have required the bank's overall investment portfolio to increase the UK's ability to meet our carbon budgets. Importantly, it proposed an explicit link with the Climate Change Act, requiring the bank's board to consider advice from the Committee on Climate Change. Labour backed this amendment, but it was defeated because the Liberal Democrats opposed it, alongside the vast majority of Conservatives. Shockingly, a total of 292 MPs voted against ensuring that the investments made by the bank wouldn't undermine the UK's Climate Change Act. The CBI and many others in the business community have been vocal in recent weeks about the desperate need for certainty from ministers on the coalition's green policies – otherwise the investment needed for the green infrastructure of the future will simply not materialise. And yet, once again, MPs on all sides have allowed politics to get in the way of a good thing. The green investment bank could be at the heart of the green economy, but only if it lives up to its name. One piece of encouraging news did emerge on the day of the debate, but from outside Westminster. As part of the UK's state aid agreement with the European Union, the commission ruled out the possibility of the bank funding new nuclear power. Since the basic purpose of the bank is to support new and emerging innovative green industries – allowing them to grow and take advantage of new markets, and to be deployed at the pace and scale needed to meet our carbon targets – it's good news that nuclear, an old and failing technology, is now off the table. Now, in the months to come, I'll be doing all I can to ensure the bank can still reach its full potential.

Hendry will tell the Nuclear Industry Forum that there is a role for new nuclear plants, provided they do not require public subsidies. In one of the key differences between the two coalition parties, the Tories back a new generation of private sector-funded nuclear power stations while the Lib Dems have long opposed new nuclear build. The Tory junior minister, who works under Lib Dem energy secretary Chris Huhne, said conversations he has had with companies suggest they are willing to invest without being subsidised. But the government will take steps to remove \"unnecessary\" barriers to building new nuclear power stations. Government support is likely to include a strong floor price for carbon, which could be introduced in next week's emergency budget. This would push up the price of allowances for polluting and incentivise investment in low-carbon power such as nuclear. Hendry is expected to tell the forum in Westminster: \"The coalition agreement clearly sees a role for new nuclear, provided that there is no public subsidy. \"We are clear. It is for private sector energy companies to construct, operate and decommission new nuclear plants. \"It will be for us to ensure the appropriate levels of safety, security and environmental regulation.\" He will also tell industry leaders: \"From the commitment I've seen from the nuclear industry, I have no doubt that you can rise to the challenge. \"Nuclear power can have a key role in our energy mix. But I appreciate clarity from us is essential if new investment is to happen. \"I am pleased that some of those most interested in new nuclear, such as EDF, have welcomed the coalition's position on nuclear.\" Under the coalition agreement between the Tories and Lib Dems, the government will bring forward a national planning statement to parliament that will pave the way for new nuclear build.

Who would have thought that another renegade Nigel would rush so boldly to elbow Nigel Farage aside? Or that they'd both feel a bit light on the history of our turbulent continent? I read another speech by a far more obscure British politician this week which reminded his audience that we have a centuries-old interest in who controls the \"mouth of the River Scheldt\" which, as diligent schoolboys know is on the Dutch coast. That interest has not gone away just because Lord Lawson thinks it has. I don't think Portillo's intervention adds much to the debate. It largely echoes the Lawson analysis. An ex-Labourist turned ex-Thatcherite, ex-defence secretary and ex-frontrunner who failed to defeat IDS for the Tory leadership deserves to end his political career in impotent exile, making easy-listening programmes for TV. It is a dreadful fate. Boris is basically a lightweight, too, but a far more formidable politician. Nigel Lawson, Margaret Thatcher's boom-and-bust chancellor from 1983 to their own bust in 1989, is in a very different league, one of nature's political heavyweights. That doesn't make him right on Europe any more than his contrarian outlier's views on global warming make him right and Charlie Windsor wrong – he's at it again. But Lord Lawson, now 81, is a clever man who commands attention. Nowadays, he is also a thinner one, despite all those delicious suppers daughter Nigella must have put his way. Having read Lawson's article on Tuesday (paywall) and the anti-EU poll (paywall too) , which the Times obligingly laid on next day, I turned to \"The View from No 10\", his 1,100-page doorstopper of a memoir which he produced in 1992. Fair-weather trimming Since I vividly recall that first Lawson, then his predecessor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, had resigned over Thatcher's relentlessly hostile attitude to Europe, I assumed I'd find evidence of more fair-weather trimming by someone who should know better. After all, didn't Lawson \"shadow the Deutschmark\" as chancellor without telling Mrs T as a means of squeezing indisciplined inflation? Alas, I was disappointed. His memoirs, particularly a prescient speech at Chatham House in January 1989, are easily squared with this week's thunderbolt, at least in economic terms (the politics are awful), though not, as the Guardian editorial also pointed out, with his more recent and tolerant \"wait-and-see\" pronouncements on the eurozone crisis. Lawson now predicts that David Cameron's promised \"renegotiation\" of the EU treaties and powers will yield \"inconsequential\" results, much like Harold Wilson's trivial renegotiation in 1974-75 which prompted young Nigel (and young Margaret, too) to vote Yes to the Common Market in the 1975 referendum. I'm sure he's right and also sure that a much more sceptical electorate will see through the ruse in 2017 – or whenever the big vote comes. He'll be voting No with the other Nigel. Lawson's argument is that the EU is not what it was – or could have become – when he was a supporter from the 1950s onwards. Nor is the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), membership of which he and Howe failed to press on Thatcher (John Major succeeded briefly, with dire results), the same as the eurozone's monetary union inside a single currency which events are now forcing to change into a form of banking and fiscal union run from Berlin and Frankfurt. Instead of becoming an outward-looking beacon of free trade in a globalised world, the EU has become introverted, bureaucratic and steadily weaker. All true. What's more, he now asserts, it has served its purpose in helping to refocus British economic ambitions in the 70s – away from commonwealth trade, bolshie unions, exchange controls and lax management – towards the rich European export market. But times change: the emerging Asia/Brics-orientated world should now be our target market. Yes, indeed. As I never tire of reminding my eurosceptic chums, no one in Brussels or Berlin is stopping British manufacturers of goods or services from exporting to India and China. The Germans themselves manage quite well – and, whisper it not, we're doing better, too. But does the case made by the Two Nigels – Lawson and Farage – now make sense in the long-term British interest? I'm not persuaded. World view My first response was to wonder what Lord Lawson read at university that shaped his world view? With minimal research I found he had been a keen sixth form mathematician who won a scholarship (clever boy) to read law at Christ Church, Oxford, only to be persuaded that it was a poor preparation for a legal career (good advice, I suspect). So he read politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) like so many wannabe politicians nowadays, with philosophy his speciality. It trained him to think clearly and cut through the crap, he explains. Fine. He makes a powerful case for saying that the eurozone demonstrates both political contempt for democracy and a recipe for economic centralism and under-performance, much as he warned at Chatham House in 1989. Worse, meddling from Brussels threatens not merely to put the City's house in better regulated order (Lawson is a member of the Tyrie banking commission) but to hurt (\"a frenzy of regulatory activism ... foolish and damaging\") its position as a world leader, the one undisputed British claim to economic importance in 2013. Too many British firms now feel cosy inside the European club, it's time to get their suitcases out to sell to the world, says Lord Lawson, whose own travel was experienced mostly as an FT journalist, political bagman and politician: as much a career elitist as any Cameron, Miliband or Clegg today. The economic downside is exaggerated save for the one quantifiable UK gain – our £8bn net annual membership fee. This is A-level Ukip and Lord Lawson, as the tone of his memoirs reminds us on every impatient \"I-was-right\" page, is a clever men, a charming one, too, when mellow. I bumped into him in a Whitehall street only the other day and adjusted his collar which was turned up. Delightful company. But my reading of his Times article sagged when I read – quite early on – that \"there is no threat from German militarism\" because the EU has achieved its original and admirable aim of putting the \"German tiger in a European cage\". Oh really? In one sense he's right, after a century of traumatic wars and humiliation modern Germany is close to functionally pacifist, sheltering complacently under the US military umbrella, prepared to switch to the Russian one, I sometimes suspect, if the gas tap gets turned off in winter. Of all the continents, Europe is now the most energy vulnerable. Chancellor Merkel's odd turn against nuclear power makes things worse. Muddy harbours But nothing is certain and, as Lord Lawson often says, nothing is for ever, except that the harbours of the muddy River Scheldt – last fought over in 1944 – still point our way, a traditional stepping point for would-be invaders from a combination of any of our near-neighbours with whom it is always possible we will one day fall out. Unlikely, I know. But we always think that. For 500 years Britain has sought to prevent a hegemonic power emerging across the Channel. I therefore draw your attention to a recent speech by former Tory MEP, Tom Spencer. Given to the European Movement, the speech (pdf) urges the pro-Europeans to start dusting off old arguments about why it is in Britain's interests to remain with at least one leg inside the EU. Don't worry Tom. YouGov's Peter Kellner – a hate figure for Nigel Farage – explains here why your side will probably win, despite the Nigels, the Borises and the Rupert. Myself, I share much of Lord Lawson's dismay about current developments within the EU and never supported sterling's membership of the eurozone as so many much cleverer (now strangely silent) people did. I fear for its future – and therefore for ours, too. But I have equally pressing doubts about Britain's ability to go it alone in the 21st century with or without the help of the buccaneering bankers of the City. After all, it's not as if our own currency zone is doing so well. Unemployment here is better than the eurozone (good), negative growth since 2008 almost as bad, our deficit is worse, and the regional imbalances between London and the rest of the country is painful. If we're so smart and enjoying so much freedom of economic manoeuvre outside the zone, why aren't we doing better?' • This article was amended on 10 May 2013.

The nuclear emergency, which the Japanese authorities are still battling to contain, looks set to make it more difficult for the UK government to push through its planned programme of new nuclear power stations. Of those polled, 37 percent said they were now more likely to oppose the building of new nuclear power stations in the UK and 44 percent said they were worried about the safety of nuclear power plants here. Anti-nuclear campaigners have been quick to seize on the disastrous events at Fukushima as proof that nuclear power can never be 100% safe. Craig Bennett, a spokesperson for Friends of the Earth who commissioned the poll said: \"This poll shows that the government's plans for a major expansion of nuclear power in the UK are out of step with public opinion. People want clean and safe energy – the government needs to urgently refocus its energy policy, starting by improving the weak energy saving measures within its new energy bill.\" The poll, which was conducted by GFK NOP shows a drop of 12% in support for nuclear power to 35% compared with a similar poll conducted by Ipsos Mori in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Opposition to the technology rose 9% to 28%. Nikki Clark of the anti-nuclear Stop Hinkley campaign said: \"We have definitely had more interest since the events in Japan: when we protested over the weekend people really wanted to talk to us about what we were doing, and find out more about the campaign. I think people are realising just how dangerous nuclear really is.\" She is one of several campaigners fighting EDF's application for a new power station in Hinkley. But supporters for nuclear power continue to hope that in the long run the Japanese events will not spell the end for a form of energy which is, they point out, carbon-neutral.

Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said initial reports of a level 10m times higher than normal in parts of the No 2 reactor were inaccurate, although it could not say by how much. Tepco said at first that the worker who took the measurement, of a pool of water in the reactor's basement turbine building, had fled before taking a second reading. The discovery prompted another evacuation at the site, halting work to pump and store radioactive water that has built up in the turbine buildings of three of the six reactors. Tepco later said the pool of water had been contaminated but the extremely high reading was a mistake. \"The number is not credible,\" spokesman Takashi Kurita said. \"We are very sorry.\" However, later reports on Sunday showed contamination 100,000 times normal in water at reactor No 2, and 1,850 times normal in the nearby sea, the most alarming levels since the crisis began. Evidence of dangerous contamination in reactor No 2 emerged days after three workers were exposed to high levels while repairing the cooling system at the No 3 reactor. Two of the men received suspected beta ray burns after stepping into water. Reports said the workers were due to be discharged from hospital on Monday. One pump is being used to extract radioactive water, and two more will be taken to the site. The US military is sending barges loaded with 500,000 gallons of fresh water to nearby Onahama Bay. Early this morning a magnitude 6.5 earthquake rocked north Japan, the latest aftershock, and officials warned it would trigger a 50 cm (two ft) tsunami. Two of Fukushima's six reactors are safe, having achieved \"cool shutdown\", but the other four have yet to be brought under control. Japan's nuclear safety agency, Nisa, said the temperature and pressure inside all six reactors had stabilised. Yukio Edano, the chief government spokesman, said the myriad problems at the plant were no closer to being resolved. \"We have restored power and pumped in fresh water, and we are making basic steps towards improvement. But there is still no room for complacency.\" Modest progress was made on removing contaminated water and stepping up work to cool the reactors with fresh water, rather than corrosive sea water, over the weekend. But Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the emergency could continue for weeks, or possibly months. Concern over food safety spread to fishing over the weekend when officials said seawater samples taken 20 miles off the coast of Fukushima contained 1,850 times the normal level of radioactivity. Nisa said the tainted seawater posed no risk: \"Ocean currents will disperse radiation particles and so it will be very diluted by the time it is consumed by fish and seaweed, and even more by the time they are consumed by humans. There is no need to worry about health risks.\" US authorities said on Sunday night that low concentrations of radiation in samples of Massachusetts rainwater were probably caused by Fukushima. Nevada, California, Hawaii, Colorado and Washington state have also reported tiny amounts of radiation from the accident but officials said they presented no health risks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/jan/07/midterm-review-how-have-done","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-07T20:44:38Z","webTitle":"Midterm review: how have they done?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/07/midterm-review-how-have-done","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/jan/07/midterm-review-how-have-done","fields":{"headline":"Midterm review: how have they done?","bodyText":"The economy The elimination of Britain's structural budget deficit, which has fallen by 3% since the general election, remains at the heart of economic strategy. The review says the overall deficit has been cut by a quarter and the coalition's fiscal mandate is to \"balance the current budget adjusted for the economic cycle\". The review glosses over chancellor George Osborne's promise to eliminate the structural deficit by 2015-16. David Cameron said at the launch of the review that it was \"inevitable\" there would be difficulties along the way because of the broken public finances. Easing the burden of regulation on business – a key Tory demand – and raising the personal tax threshold to £10,000 by the next election – a Liberal Democrat demand – are highlighted. Verdict The review confirms what George Osborne said in his autumn statement – he will fail to meet his original fiscal mandate on the deficit and debt. The focus on measures to encourage business shows the coalition knows the economy must have picked up by 2015 if it is to fight Labour charges that its deficit reduction plan sucked demand out of the economy. Europe and foreign affairs The review was notable for what it did not say on Europe. There was no mention of the Tory plans to repatriate powers from the EU which have been dismissed by Lib Dems. These will form the central theme of an imminent speech by David Cameron in which he will outline plans for the Tory manifesto for the next general election. The Anglo-French mission that led to the eventual overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya tops the list of the coalition's foreign policy achievements. It says that Britain will end its combat role in Afghanistan by the end of 2014, with a withdrawal of 5,200 troops this year. On Trident the review simply says the coalition has \"maintained\" Britain's nuclear deterrent and will publish a review into alternatives. The Liberal Denocrats are opposed to a like-for-like replacement. Verdict There is a mixed report card for the coalition on Europe and wider foreign affairs. Cameron can point to tangible achievements such as the eventual overthrow of Gaddafi and the promotion of British trading links in previously neglected markets. But on Europe the prime minister is constrained because Britain's most Eurosceptic party in the commons is in coalition with the most pro-European party. Crime and justice Ministers are to press ahead with the modernisation of police pay and conditions despite a series of bitter clashes between police and ministers. But the review says simply that it will \"consult\" on the controversial second stage of the review of police conditions by the former rail regulator Tom Winsor. This raised the prospect of a ban on compulsory redundancies and the introduction of annual fitness tests with pay cuts for officers who fail. The review pledges to speed up the \"rehabilitation revolution\" in which private companies and some charities are paid for their success in reducing re-offending rates by finding work for ex-prisoners. It also says the government will test weekend and night courts after the success of \"swift justice\" after the August 2011 riots. Verdict The coalition is undergoing what is politely described as a shift in emphasis in criminal justice policy. Chris Grayling, the new justice secretary, is abandoning the approach of his predecessor Kenneth Clarke who arrested the rise in the prison population. Grayling says he wants hardened criminals to spend longer in prison. Climate change and transport Pledges to electrify more railway, build new road lanes and press ahead with new London rail links and a \"national high-speed rail network\" – helped by debt guarantees for £40bn of private investment and relaxing planning rules. For users, regulated (often peak) fares will rise by 1% over inflation rather than 3%, and fuel duty rises have been scrapped. There are no further promises on climate emissions, but various incentives to get others to invest more in renewable energy, nuclear power and a big increase in gas. Verdict Promises rely almost entirely on private investors spending their money, so there are no guarantees. On road building, for example, it is hard to see how they will succeed without dropping opposition to tolls. Welfare, pensions and children Benefits will continue to be cut, two-year-olds from the poorest families will get an early start in education, parents get more flexible leave to look after new children, firms will continue to enrol more workers into pensions, while public-sector employees will see their pensions cut back. Verdict The promise for the rest of this parliament is more of the same. There are two fundamental problems: one, that much of the success of the \"making work pay\" pledge on benefits depends on the success of the huge new IT project that is universal credit, to start in April; the other, that repeated studies show the majority of people losing benefits already work. Public services Schools and health reforms have been among the most visible coalition actions, and will continue, Cameron and Clegg promised. There will be extra money to help poorer and struggling pupils catch up, and another £1bn will be found for more academies and free schools out of local government control. The health budget will continue to buck the cuts trend withreal-terms increases, restructuring the NHS to give GPs more control will continue, and there will be a strong focus on holding staff and institutions to account. Verdict The government has moved fast on promised schools reform and kept its headline promise to protect NHS spending, but ministers repeatedly upset teachers and almost every medical profession – a potential threat to further reforms, and certainly professional morale."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/jul/20/edf-french-nuclear-reactor-delays","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-20T19:49:34Z","webTitle":"EDF admits French nuclear reactor delayed but says UK projects on target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/20/edf-french-nuclear-reactor-delays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/jul/20/edf-french-nuclear-reactor-delays","fields":{"headline":"EDF admits French nuclear reactor delayed but says UK projects on target","bodyText":"EDF, the French company at the heart of plans to build a new generation of nuclear plants in Britain, has admitted that a similar plant being constructed in France is going to take almost twice as long and cost nearly twice the anticipated price. The European pressurised reactor (EPR) at Flamanville, in north-western France, is now expected to open in 2016 and cost €6bn (£5.2bn) instead of the original starting date of 2012 and a cost of €3.3bn. EDF said last year that Flamanville had fallen behind its original schedule but insisted it would be ready to generate electricity in 2014 and cost €5bn. A spokesman for the French company said a 2018 start date for new British plants could be adjusted but there was no reason to assume the £20bn plans for Sizewell, Suffolk, and Hinkley Point, Somerset, would be hit by similar problems as those seen in France. \"The experience at Flamanville is invaluable as we progress in the UK. Each time EDF builds the EPR, our expertise increases. We are already seeing the benefits of the experience from existing projects,\" he said. But Friends of the Earth (FoE) said the latest delays to nuclear would only make wind and other greener technologies more competitive. \"Britain's energy future is definitely renewables,\" said Simon Bullock, FoE's economy campaigner. EDF blamed \"structural and economic reasons\" for the latest delays at Flamanville 3, pointing out that it is the first nuclear power plant to be built in France for 15 years. The company said progress had been slowed by two serious accidents that forced it to suspend civil engineering work and by changes that may have to be incorporated as a result of the Fukushima nuclear plant explosion in Japan. There had also been rising material costs. But the same story has been played out in Finland, where another French company, Areva, has been hit by delays on the construction of a similar designed reactor. EDF is building two plants of this design in China and believes the collective experience can only help when it comes to the construction of four EPRs in Britain. The French company has expressed optimism that British government initiatives to fast-track planning for large energy plants and introduce a floor to the carbon price will put its newbuild in Britain on track. EDF has applied for a licence for its EPR in the UK and has already started preliminary site work in Suffolk and Somerset. But it admits that the 2018 start date for electricity production could be adjusted backwards this autumn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/may/22/un-nuclear-chief-iran-deal1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-22T09:46:22Z","webTitle":"IAEA chief says Iran nuclear inspections deal is not far off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/22/un-nuclear-chief-iran-deal1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/22/un-nuclear-chief-iran-deal1","fields":{"headline":"IAEA chief says Iran nuclear inspections deal is not far off","bodyText":"The head of the UN nuclear agency, Yukiya Amano, has said an agreement would be signed \"quite soon\" with Iran to allow an investigation into claims it had tried to develop nuclear weapons. Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was speaking on his return to the agency's Vienna headquarters after a day of talks in Tehran. He described the talks as an \"important development\" and said he and the chief Iranian negotiator, Saeed Jalili, were determined to reach a deal, but it was also clear a final agreement had not been reached. \"The decision was made by me and Mr Jalili to reach agreement on the structured approach. An agreement will be signed quite soon,\" Amano said, but did not give a date. Amano had flown from Vienna to Tehran at short notice on Sunday in the hope his presence would seal an agreement on a framework for a long-running IAEA investigation into evidence that Iran may have carried out research and development work on warhead design. The investigation had been stalled for four years, but Iran has in recent years shown willingness to consent to site visits and interviews with its scientists as long as the investigation followed what it called a 'structured approach'. In particular, Tehran wanted assurances the investigation should not continue indefinitely but should have a timetable and end point to aim for. For his part, Herman Nackaerts, the chief IAEA inspector, had insisted his inspectors should be able to follow leads wherever they led without tying their hands in advance. Amano was seeking a compromise and it remains unclear how close he has come. Nackaerts, who accompanied Amano to Tehran, has made his first priority to visit a military site at Parchin, south-east of Tehran, where the IAEA says it has been given evidence that, at some point after 2000, Iranian scientists may have tested the high-explosive elements of an implosion device needed for the construction of a warhead small enough to put on a missile. Iran has denied carrying out such an experimentation, or any work on weaponisation. Tehran had said access to Parchin was dependent on reaching a agreement on the 'structured approach' framework. If an agreement is signed and leads to broader Iranian co-operation it could be seen as a vindication of Amano's tougher approach to Iran compared with his predecessor, Mohamed ElBaradei. Amano has published more evidence collected by his inspectors pointing towards Iranian work on nuclear weapons, and has been more outspoken in his criticism of Tehran for its reluctance to co-operate with the investigation. It is unclear what effect the outcome of Sunday's talks will have for negotiations due on Wednesday in Baghdad between Iran and representatives from six world powers on the broader issue of Tehran's uranium enrichment, which the UN security council has demanded be suspended. Western officials said an IAEA deal could improve the atmosphere in Baghdad, or conversely, damage prospects for those negotiations if Iran presents progress on an IAEA inspections framework as its sole concession. The six-nation negotiating group (comprising the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and Germany) wants Iran to stop production of 20%-enriched uranium, which lies between the low-enriched uranium for use in nuclear power stations and highly enriched uranium used in warheads. The west also wants a deeply buried enrichment plant called Fordow to be taken out of operation. In return, Iran could be offered nuclear fuel for its research reactor in Tehran and safety advice and equipment for the Tehran reactor and its nuclear power station at Bushehr, on Iran's Gulf coast. \"If Amano's presence in Tehran can produce something, it will play into this week's talks in Baghdad,\" a senior European diplomat said. \"If Iran can indicate it is ready to respond to international concerns over its nuclear programme, that will be positive. But there will be no reward for simply turning up and the key issue for building confidence is still uranium enriched to 20% … If we are going to continue talking in good faith, there has to be something put forward by Iran.\" The acting US representative at the IAEA in Vienna, Robert Wood, issued a statement on Tuesday urging Iran to do more to co-operate with the IAEA investigation. \"We urge Iran to take this opportunity to resolve all outstanding concerns about the nature of its nuclear programme,\" Wood said. \"Full and transparent co-operation with the IAEA is the first logical step.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/sep/07/green-politics-green-party","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-07T11:05:18Z","webTitle":"Green party is the only genuine opposition, says Natalie Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/07/green-politics-green-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/sep/07/green-politics-green-party","fields":{"headline":"Green party is the only genuine opposition, says Natalie Bennett","bodyText":"Labour is failing to offer a real alternative to the coalition on the economy and the environment, and the Green party is now the only genuine opposition party to the government, the newly elected leader of the Greens will say on Friday afternoon. Australian-born Natalie Benett, a former Guardian journalist who said there will be a Green councillor in every major town and city within a decade after being elected leader on Monday, will say \"the Labour party has not changed\" in her speech to the party's annual conference. In an attack on Labour's policies on energy, the economy and reform of the public sector, she is expected to say: \"Ed Miliband's Labour party is still championing nuclear power. Still pushing for unsustainable growth. Hasn't moved to support cooperatives and small business against multinational companies. Doesn't support renationalisation of the railways. Isn't speaking out in favour of the minimum wage being a living wage.\" Bennett indicated this week that the Green party would be seeking to win the votes of disaffected Labour and Liberal Democrat voters, in a continuation of tactics by outgoing leader and MP Caroline Lucas, who used her conference speech last year to appeal to Lib Dem voters. The new leader will claim that Labour has failed to provide opposition to the government's cuts agenda and that the Green party has filled that role. \"We have to be the opposition to this disastrous coalition government. We are the opposition. We can do it because we have the vision of a better, more equal, healthier Britain, and we know how to get there.\" The Green party would strengthen trade unions, restructure the economy in favour of low-carbon industry, cut emissions and increase renewable energy, and make society more equal, Bennett will argue. Despite being disadvantaged by the current first-past-the-post electoral system, she will say that while pushing for proportional representation is still a Green party campaign, the party cannot wait for it \"to bear fruit\". Under Lucas's leadership, who was elected as the party's first leader in 2008 and in May announced she would not run for another term, the party beat the Liberal Democrats to come third in the London mayoral election contest this year, Lucas herself became the first Green MP in England, and the party has doubled its membership. In her final speech as leader today, Lucas is expected to say: \"New leader Natalie Bennett has all the passion, the commitment and the inspiration needed to lead the party forward. There are huge opportunities for us in the years ahead. On so many of the big issues of our time, Greens are winning the battle of ideas. \"From 20mph speed limits in residential areas and introducing a living wage to lift people out of poverty, to nationalising the railways and replacing the failed policy of austerity with investment in jobs and the green economy, our policies are coming into their own.\" On Thursday, Miliband criticised the coalition's green record, saying Labour would not pose \"the environment and the economy as alternatives as the current Chancellor does\", apparently referring to remarks by George Osborne last year. Miliband's intervention followed a cabinet reshuffle by David Cameron this week that saw the appointment of a new environment secretary and energy minister who have both spoken out against wind power subsidies in the past, and the removal of Justine Greening as transport secretary, widely seen as paving the way for the government's backing of a third runway at Heathrow, which Greening opposed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jun/07/green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-07T09:43:27Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: the Ecologist, buzzards U-turn and windfarm 'bribes'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/07/green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jun/07/green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: the Ecologist, buzzards U-turn and windfarm 'bribes'","bodyText":"Environment news • Tesco supplier accused of contributing to Amazon rainforest destruction • Rio+ 20 Earth summit could collapse, WWF warns • Zac Goldsmith sells the Ecologist for £1 • Zac Goldsmith: climate change pushes other issues off the agenda • Super farms are needed in UK, says leader of National Farmers Union • Leaked documents reveal UK fight to dilute EU green energy targets • Tory MP calls for countryside windfarm 'bribes' On the blogs • Giving power to the people can solve the wind farm stand-off • Around the world by bicycle?

The Nuclear boy character was created by Japanese artist Hachiya Kazuhiko. He posted it to Twitter, where one follower turned it into a comic strip that a third person then animated, according to reports. The story is quite simple: Nuclear boy is sick and people are worried he is going to have a really big poo (as the translation puts it).

The good news, you would think, in the case of nuclear power plants is that you can replace worn, corroded or cracked parts with new ones. But an impressive year-long investigation into the US nuclear power industry by Associated Press reveals how the regulators and the industry have repeatedly found a much simpler solution to ageing: weaken the safety standards until the creaking plants meet them. On yesterday's post, some commenters argued the engineering safety issue is not unique to nuclear power, meaning it is unfair to criticise the nuclear industry for failings that pass unnoticed elsewhere. I disagree for the simple reason that the stakes are so vastly higher for nuclear reactors: safety standards have to be far more stringent because the consequences of serious accidents have such huge economic and social costs. Remember, the pact you sign when you build a reactor is to control that atomic inferno for decades and then look after the waste for thousands of years. That leads to the point that underlies the AP investigation. The incentive to maintain costly safety regimes runs entirely counter to the primary incentive of the nuclear power plant operators, which, perfectly reasonably, is to make money. The problem comes when, as years roll by without serious incidents, that heavy, expensive regulation starts to look like an unnecessary burden. And that's exactly what AP's reporters found: Federal regulators have been working closely with the US nuclear power industry to keep the nation's ageing reactors operating within safety standards by repeatedly weakening those standards, or simply failing to enforce them. Time after time, officials at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have decided that original regulations were too strict, arguing that safety margins could be eased without peril, according to records and interviews. Examples abound. When valves leaked, more leakage was allowed — up to 20 times the original limit. When rampant cracking caused radioactive leaks from steam generator tubing, an easier test of the tubes was devised, so plants could meet standards. Failed cables. Busted seals. Broken nozzles, clogged screens, cracked concrete, dented containers, corroded metals and rusty underground pipes — all of these and thousands of other problems linked to ageing were uncovered. And all of them could escalate dangers in the event of an accident. Yet despite the many problems linked to ageing, not a single official body in government or industry has studied the overall frequency and potential impact on safety of such breakdowns in recent years, even as the NRC has extended the licenses of dozens of reactors. The problem of ageing is another where the incentive to close old reactors down in favour of newer, safer reactors is easily overwhelmed by the incentive to keep it running. The plant exists and the capital costs are paid off, so as long you can sell the electricity for more than the maintenance costs, you have a money-printing machine. At the time, the 30 to 40 year licences granted to nuclear power plants were seen as the absolute maximum period for which they would run: the period matched their design lifetimes. Now, AP found, 66 of the 104 operating units in the US have been relicenced for 20 extra years, with applications being considered for 16 more. Globally, the oldest operational nuclear power plant is in the UK: the 44-year-old Oldbury reactors, 15 miles north of Bristol on the bank of the river Severn. Of the 440 reactors in the world, 22 are older than 40 years, and 163 are older than 30 years. AP quote NRC chief spokesman Eliot Brenner defending the licence extensions: \"When a plant gets to be 40 years old, about the only thing that's 40 years old is the ink on the license. Most, if not all of the major components, will have been changed out.\" But a former NRC head, Ivan Selin, has a different view. \"It's as if we were all driving Model T's today and trying to bring them up to current mileage standards.\" So here's the choice. You can back nuclear, an industry far more inherently dangerous than its rivals, with a history of capturing its safety regulators and dumping its costs on taxpayers. Or you can do all you can to back energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy storage plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/may/07/european-elections-centre-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-07T22:47:08Z","webTitle":"European elections: life drains from the centre right | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/07/european-elections-centre-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/may/07/european-elections-centre-right","fields":{"headline":"European elections: life drains from the centre right","bodyText":"It was not as if there were wild celebrations in France on Sunday night – certainly nothing to match the euphoria that accompanied François Mitterrand's election in 1981. But a miserable morning after the night before arrived on cue nonetheless – Greek shares crashed as its parties scrambled to form a new government; Spanish and Italian bond yields were once again on the rise; there was talk of an impending shakeup in the Spanish banks. It does not take much for the crisis started by over-leveraged banks and financial speculation to come leaping back to centre stage. The fact that the policy for dealing with it has been such a disaster – sending unemployment figures through the roof and magically increasing budget deficits – only hastens the final act of this drama: the possibility that Greece will default, leave the euro and increase the contagion in Spain and Italy. Faced with turmoil on this scale, arranging the place settings for François Hollande's first tête à tête with Angela Merkel will shortly pale into insignificance. The two leaders will soon have bigger things to talk about. As things stand, the two will have little difficulty forming a common agenda. Ms Merkel does not do U-turns. She does handbrake ones – as she has already performed on military intervention in Afghanistan, state subventions and nuclear power. Even if it's already sown into the fabric of EU legislation, Ms Merkel's fiscal pact will not have much meaning unless it has France's backing too. So whether it is renegotiated, modified or supplemented with a growth pact is a matter of words. The European Central Bank's response will have to change, and change radically. For his part, Mr Hollande is a pragmatist, who has given himself room on the specifics of the deal that has to be cut. Almost a year after she stopped her nuclear programme, Ms Merkel has done nothing about ensuring how the power gap will be filled. Mr Hollande will close one nuclear power station in Alsace, but open another in Normandy. A deal is there to be done on investment in alternative energy supply and making French and German buildings energy efficient. The two leaders would not be so much be pushing at an open door, as falling through one. This is not to deny the existence of deep ideological differences on debt. It will take an earthquake to overcome German fear of inflation and its resistance to increasing consumer spending. Yet these are both ways of averting a European-wide depression. Germany's export boom is dependent on its European market. There is only so long that Germany can be the only economy in Europe cracking open the champagne, while its customers drink from a standpipe. In any case, the inflationary pressures are mounting. The German car unions, which fear two more plants may close in Europe, are already champing at the bit for increased wage rises. All these factors, and not least the shifting sands on which Ms Merkel's own coalition rests, will push the German and French leaders into each other's arms. The larger question is whether all this is too late. Mr Hollande could jump through all the hoops he has to go through in the next few months, including securing a working majority in parliament in June, and still face a crisis to save the euro, from which the weakened French economy would be unable to insulate itself. Once again it comes back to Greece, Ms Merkel's achilles heel and the nemesis of all fiscal consolidation measures. There is still a large Greek majority for staying within the euro, even if the parties who put their name to the bailout will now be hard pushed to form a government. What that contradiction means is that the EU-IMF programme will have to be renegotiated. Mr Hollande may have arrived at the right moment. If he fails to turn the policy around, austerity will lead not just to economic collapse but, in parts of Europe, a social one too. The arrival of a pragmatic pro-European socialist could be the last chance to save the euro and the European project from neoliberal dogma that would have buried both."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2012/nov/04/stephen-salter-tyre-hurricane-sandy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-04T00:04:00Z","webTitle":"The man who would stop hurricanes with car tyres","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/04/stephen-salter-tyre-hurricane-sandy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2012/nov/04/stephen-salter-tyre-hurricane-sandy","fields":{"headline":"The man who would stop hurricanes with car tyres","bodyText":"Devastating tropical storms of the kind that battered the US last week could be weakened and rendered less deadly using a simple and cheap technology based on a surprising component – old car tyres. One of Britain's leading marine engineers, Stephen Salter, emeritus professor of engineering design at Edinburgh university and a global pioneer of wave power research, has patented with Microsoft billionaires Bill Gates and Nathan Myhrvold the idea of using thousands of tyres lashed together to support giant plastic tubes which extend 100m deep into the ocean. Wave action on the ocean surface would force warm surface water down into the deeper ocean. If non-return valves were used, he says, the result would be to mix the waters and cool the surface temperature of the ocean to under 26.5C, the critical temperature at which hurricanes form. According to Salter, who has written to the government's chief scientific officer setting out his scheme, harnessing energy from the waves to cool the surface temperature of the ocean makes ecological sense. The naturally working pumps would be located in \"hurricane alley\", the warm corridor in the Atlantic through which the most damaging storms typically develop and pass. Salter claims that the hydrological problems have been solved but that research funding is urgently needed. \"If you can cool the sea surface, you would calm the hurricanes. I estimate you would need about 150-450 of these structures. They would drift around and send out radar signals so that no one would collide with them,\" he said. The idea of what is now known as the \"Salter Sink\" was first presented to the US government in 2007 at a post-Katrina US Homeland Security meeting on hurricane suppression. It was picked up and developed by Intellectual Ventures, a Seattle-based new tech company run by Myhrvold and backed by Gates which buys and licenses patents and inventions. \"The Salter Sink concept is delightfully simple and singularly gargantuan,\" the company said in a statement posted on its website . \"It has captured our imagination here in the lab. We have done some experiments and computational modelling work to validate this idea, but a lot more research needs to be done by experts in related fields such as climate science and oceanography, and we need partners to pursue the project further.\" Research into hurricane suppression is considered urgent by the US government because seven of the 10 costliest hurricanes to hit the United States have struck since 2004. Hurricane Sandy has caused approximately $30bn of damage, taking the economic costs of hurricanes in the US and Caribbean since 2002 to more than $200bn. Salter's research is unlikely to be funded by the British government, which is traditionally shy of paying for \"blue sky\" marine technologies, and Salter's own wave devices in particular. In 1982 Salter invented the idea of a mechanical \"duck\" which bobbed on the ocean and generated electricity. But the government shut down the UK Wave Energy programme, arguing that his invention would be too expensive to develop further. It emerged later that civil servants in the nuclear power division of the energy department had \"miscalculated\" by a factor of 10 the estimated cost of energy production, possibly setting back British wave energy research by 20 years. Salter, with John Lathan of the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research, has also developed the idea of using hundreds of ships spraying very fine seawater droplets high into the sky to reflect sunlight and thus counter global warming and suppress hurricanes. The UK government was asked to assess the technology research, but declined to back it financially. Hurricane suppression ideas go back more than 100 years but attempts have mostly proved tragicomic, said Jim Fleming, author of a new history of geo-engineering. Ideas have included setting up rows of cannon on the Florida coast to shoot them down; using laser beams from space; and \"seeding\" them with silver iodide. The results have proved at best uncertain. One hurricane \"manipulated\" by the US government in the 1940s veered off course and struck Georgia, causing $20m of damage and killing two people. In 1962, just after the Cuban missile crisis, Fidel Castro complained that the US had \"modified\" a hurricane which, remarkably, lingered over the island for four days after exercising a U-turn. Many countries, including the US and Russia, have tried to militarise weather research, trying to divert hurricanes and storms into the path of their enemies. Salter was inspired to invent his device after seeing the damage wrought by Katrina."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/nov/22/david-cameron-brussels-eu-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-22T15:01:56Z","webTitle":"David Cameron sparks fury in Brussels with raid on EU growth fund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/22/david-cameron-brussels-eu-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/22/david-cameron-brussels-eu-growth","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron sparks fury in Brussels with raid on EU growth fund","bodyText":"David Cameron is pressing for tens of billions of euros in cuts to the EU's next seven-year budget as the price for Britain's agreement at the Brussels summit, which could run into Saturday morning. The prime minister, who declared on arrival in Brussels that he would be \"negotiating hard\" on behalf of British taxpayers, has identified European commission plans to promote economic growth as a key area for cuts. The prime minister's move has sparked a furious backlash in Brussels. One EU official said: \"David Cameron lectures us all on the need to draw up a budget for growth. And yet he now wants to cut the very part of the budget that will build up transport, energy and broadband infrastructure.\" The prime minister found himself under fire after he told Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, that Britain would like to see cuts for the 2014-2020 EU budget in: • The \"Connecting Europe\" project, which is designed to connect the continent through transport and energy infrastructure projects. The European commission has proposed increasing this by 350% – from €8bn (£6.5bn) to €36bn. Britain believes this should be merely doubled to €16bn. • The new EU external action service and the wider EU administration budget. The European commission has proposed increasing this from €56bn to €63bn. Van Rompuy has proposed a trim to €62.63bn. Cameron told Van Rompuy that the EU should follow the example of Whitehall which has imposed cuts of between 25%-30% in administrative costs. One British official said: \"We can save tens of billions compared with what is on the table.\" Cameron's decision to target the growth budget and administrative costs for cuts shows Downing Street has accepted that Britain will not win any further cuts in the two highest areas of expenditure. These are the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and structural funds that help build the infrastructure of poorer areas, notably in eastern Europe. Van Rompuy pleased No 10 when he proposed cutting the original European commission budget from €1,053bn to €973bn. This represents a cut on the last seven-year budget, which ran from 2007-2013, and which is worth €994bn. But No 10 said this did not go far enough because it only covered the \"commitment ceiling\" – the absolute cap on expenditure. Downing Street instead demanded details of the \"payment ceiling\" – the amount of money that would be distributed. Van Rompuy is understood to have suggested this would be set at €940bn which is €2bn lower than the €942.8bn \"payment ceiling\" in the last budget. British officials had suggested that they would like to see the budget set at €886bn. EU officials now expect Britain to accept the new Van Rompuy ceiling of €940bn. François Hollande, the French president, and Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, rejected Van Rompuy's compromise proposal out of hand. France benefits from CAP funding while Spain benefits from structural funds. Aides to Hollande said Paris was in no hurry to strike a deal this week. \"France has time until 2014,\" they said. Paris's biggest issue is a proposed cut of around €60bn in the common agricultural policy compared with the seven years until 2013 and that fact that France now funds around a quarter of the UK rebate. \"The United Kingdom is paying less than its wealth, France more,\" said a senior French official. \"France pays a billion of the 4bn cost of the British rebate.\" Both the Germans and French appear sanguine about the prospects of stalemate and failure over the next few days, with Paris incensed at being the biggest contributor to the British rebate and the Germans anxious about having to pay more to finance the EU. \"Germany will stay the biggest net contributor by some distance. We know that,\" said a senior German government official. \"But that must stay in reasonable relation to the other net contributors. We will retain the UK rebate, but it must be bearable for the other net contributors.\" He added that it would \"not be crippling\" if the EU's national capitals \"need a few more months\". The Germans currently get a €2bn rebate and the Dutch €1bn, both of which are due to expire at the end of next year and which both governments insist must stay. Any cuts to \"Connecting Europe\" will hit the Germans. The modernisation project is being used by Germany to revamp its domestic energy market as it turns away from nuclear power. Britain appeared to be making less of a fuss over its rebate amid signs that Van Rompuy is to back away from plans to make every EU member state – and therefore Britain – make a contribution. As he arrived in Brussels for the crucial summit, Cameron said: \"These are very important negotiations. Clearly at a time when we are making difficult decisions at home over public spending it would be quite wrong – it is quite wrong – for there to be proposals for this increased extra spending in the EU. So we are going to be negotiating very hard for a good deal for Britain's taxpayers, for Europe's taxpayers, and to keep the British rebate.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/sep/04/reshuffle-all-you-want-westminster-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-04T13:00:10Z","webTitle":"Reshuffle all you want – it won't make any difference | Daniel Hannan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/reshuffle-all-you-want-westminster-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/reshuffle-all-you-want-westminster-minister","fields":{"headline":"Reshuffle all you want – it won't make any difference","bodyText":"Reshuffle? What reshuffle? Westminster professionals work themselves up about political personnel changes but, believe me, no one else much cares. As always, Shakespeare expresses the nation's mood: \"We'll hear poor rogues talk of court news, who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out.\" It's not that voters are apathetic or indifferent or lazy. It's that they know from long experience that the identity of the minister in charge makes only the slightest dent in the policy of the department. Take what seems to be the main talking point for journalists: the replacement of Ken Clarke by Chris Grayling as justice secretary. It's a \"lurch to the right\", say pundits, excitedly. (Why, incidentally, to parties only ever \"lurch\" to the right? When did you last hear of someone \"lurching\" to the centre?) No one outside Westminster, though, will expect anything to change. The supremacy of the European convention on human rights, like the preference for non-custodial sentences, is regarded as an intrinsic part of the system, something beyond the capacity of any minister to alter. Every home secretary comes to office promising to deport dangerous fanatics, just as every foreign secretary promises to stand up to Brussels, every business secretary to \"cut red tape\", every chancellor to keep taxes down. It never happens. And the reason it never happens is that the minister is encased in a bureaucratic machine bigger than he is. There is little question that he wants these changes to occur – he can read opinion polls as well as anyone else – but he is stabbing at buttons that are disconnected, tugging at levers that have worked loose. In real life, Sir Humphrey will almost always get the better of Jim Hacker. Where Hacker has a single special adviser, Sir Humphrey can call on hundreds of full-time professionals. Where Hacker is passing through – and already half-thinking of his next job – Sir Humphrey is there to stay. Where Hacker is distracted by Commons votes, constituency casework and after-dinner speeches, Sir Humphrey is in the department full time. With enough patience and tenacity, Hacker can eventually make changes – but it takes years to overcome the inertia of his permanent officials. Michael Gove is reforming education, and Iain Duncan Smith, like James Purnell before him, is reforming welfare. Both men, understanding how the system works, knew they had to stay at their posts to complete their work. Some Comment is free readers might at this stage be thinking that Sir Humphrey is a useful ally. Well, on some issues, he is, notably penology and education. On other issues – public spending, the American alliance, nuclear power, airport expansion – he is more of a nuisance to the left. And on quite a few, he is at odds with almost the whole country: it was a civil servant, for example, not a minister, who committed Britain to bailing out the euro, despite our non-membership. The problem is not this or that policy outcome; it's the delegitimisation of representative government. A minister is supposed to be there to remind his permanent officials that they work for the rest of us. If, instead, he becomes the cabinet champion and public spokesman for his department, democracy is vitiated. In consequence, the system loses its legitimacy, elections become devalued. \"What's the point in voting, nothing ever changes?\" people say. And, by and large, they're right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2012/feb/17/britain-france-syrian-opposition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-17T16:20:21Z","webTitle":"Britain and France urge Syrian opposition to unite","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/17/britain-france-syrian-opposition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/feb/17/britain-france-syrian-opposition","fields":{"headline":"Britain and France urge Syrian opposition to unite","bodyText":"Britain and France urged the Syrian opposition to uniteon Friday as David Cameron admitted he was not satisfied the international community was doing enough to support the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Cameron and the French president Nicolas Sarkozy, meeting at an Anglo-French summit in Paris, which also saw deals on the development of civil nuclear power and military drones, announced a modest food programme for the Syrian opposition. But they admitted that the quality of the opposition leadership in and outside Syria is hampering efforts to provide support. No 10 officials have met the divided Syrian opposition in London and came away unimpressed by comparison with the Libyan opposition. Sarkozy said: \"We cannot bring about a Syrian revolution ... if the Syrian revolution does not make an effort to rally together and organise so that we can better help them. \"The principle obstacle ... is not just the blockage at the UN. In Libya we couldn't have had the revolution without the Libyans and we won't be able to have a Syrian revolution without the Syrian opposition making enough effort to unite that we can support them more.\" \"We will not accept that a dictator massacres his people, but the revolution will not be led from outside. Like in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, it must be led from the inside.'' British officials have said the Free Syrian Army, \"is neither free nor an army\". \"What is happening in Syria is appalling,\" Cameron told a news conference. \"I'm not satisfied that we are taking all the action we can.\" In a joint statement, Cameron and Sarkozy pledged that their countries \"will continue to increase their engagement with the Syrian opposition, including encouraging the opposition to work together and to support the vision of an inclusive, prosperous and free Syria\". Efforts will be made to unite the opposition at a meeting in Tunis convened by the Friends of Syria Group under French foreign minister Alain Juppé and his Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu. Cameron said Britain is sending food rations for 20,000 people and medical supplies for those affected by fighting in Homs and elsewhere in Syria. The Franco-British summit, delayed from last year, focused on agreements to co-operate on civil nuclear power and on an unmanned drone that could be launched in 2020 – joint research will be led by Dassault and BAE. On nuclear power, Cameron and Sarkozy announced details of a £500m investment at Hinkley Point in Somerset as part of the Anglo-French nuclear export drive, especially to China. Cameron endorsed Sarkozy's efforts to be re-elected president this spring. He also said Franco-British co-operation was at its highest since the second world war, some of it driven by the need for the two countries to reduce defence costs. Sarkozy is trailing behind his socialist rival Francois Hollande, and is due in London soon.It is not normal but not unprecedented for a British prime minister to endorse a candidate in an overseas election. Cameron privately believes that Sarkozy's campaigning style will win through. Cameron said: \"(The summit) has given me the chance to wish my friend well in the battle he has ahead.\" He joked he was not sure his presence on the Sarkozy campaign trail would have a positive effect. Cameron added: \"I believe it is a relationship that is easily strong enough to survive the odd bump or bounce that we sometimes have when we have a disagreement. That is what politicians do and it is what friends do as well.\" Sarkozy said Cameron was \"a very brave man and there are worse things than working with a very brave man\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/03/smog-alert-very-high-air-pollution-levels-spread-across-england-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-03T14:29:04Z","webTitle":"Smog alert: 'very high' air pollution levels spread across England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/03/smog-alert-very-high-air-pollution-levels-spread-across-england-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/03/smog-alert-very-high-air-pollution-levels-spread-across-england-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Smog alert: 'very high' air pollution levels spread across England","bodyText":"Here's a summary of today's events: Record levels of air pollution have continued to hit the UK. Pollution levels reached level 9 early on Thursday morning in the south-east, Greater London and eastern England, the department for environment, food and rural affairs (Defra) reported on its website. Very high levels of pollution were also forecast later on Thursday for the east midlands. The government sent out conflicting public health information about what to do in the smog. Defra's helpline said \"everyone is advised to reduce physical exertion particularly outdoor,\" in areas where the air pollution is rated as \"very high\". But Public Health England said it is only those with heart and lung conditions and old people who should avoid strenuous physical activity. Alarm about poor air quality turned into a political row after David Cameron said the smog cloud was a \"naturally occurring weather phenomenon.\" He made light of the problem by saying he had skipped his morning run. The Green party accused him of trying to shirk responsibility for the government's failure improve air quality. London mayor Boris Johnson has been urged to impose a series of emergency measures including bans on schools car runs and restrictions on the most polluting vehicles. The call was made by former deputy mayor Jenny Jones who accused Cameron and Johnson of being \"bystanders during a public health emergency.\" Some ambulance services have reported an increase in respiratory related call outs. Chemists also said there had been an increase in customers complaining of breathing problems. Amazon reported an increase in face mask sales, and 30% of people with asthma said they had suffered an asthma attack since the smog alerts were issued. South westerly winds will not bring better conditions until Friday. Rain is forecast to wash away a cloud of Saharan dust coating more cars with a film of sand. The government continues to send out conflicting public health information about what to do in the smog. Defra's helpline said \"everyone is advised to reduce physical exertion particularly outdoor,\" in areas where the air pollution is rated as \"very high\" (see earlier). But Public Health England said it is only those with heart and lung conditions and old people who should avoid strenuous physical activity. Jenny Jones, the Green London assembly member and former deputy mayor, has accused Boris Johnson and the government of being \"bystanders during a public health emergency.\" In a blogpost on Left Foot Forward she said: \"Both Boris Johnson and the government continue to stand idly by while millions of Londoners are exposed to pollution that can permanently damage their health.\" Jones set out five specific emergency measures that mayor should consider: Imposing restrictions on vehicles that are the most polluting and restricting non-essential personal car journeys. Electric, hybrid vehicles and those carrying at least 3-4 passengers would be exempt. Encourage business to avoid peak times journeys and more out of hour deliveries. Along with employees being encouraged to work from home. Partly as a result of working with businesses the 2012 London Olympics were the least polluted of recent times. Sending Mayoral pollution alerts to the 1,148 schools in London that are within 150 metres of roads carrying 10,000 plus vehicles per day and a total of 2,270 schools within 400 metres of such roads. The mayor’s airtext service could be adapted for this purpose. Ban school runs during pollution episodes. Encourage schools in high pollution risk areas with the help of police community officers to enforce school run bans. Alongside more rigorous adherence to school travel plans with information for children and parents to avoid pollution exposure. Regional weather updates should include information about harmful to human health particulate and nitrogen dioxide levels. Dave Throup, the environment agency's manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, warns that more Saharan dust is heading our way. He said rain forecast for Thursday night meant that it would be deposited on England. Bad air quality is primarily a result of road transport, according to the environment campaign Stephen Tindale. In a blogpost for the Fabian Society, Tindale, who is also Labour activist, writes: Diesel is worse than petrol for air quality (though less bad for the climate). Diesel engines can be relatively clean if well maintained. But good maintenance is not always a strong point of white van men (or indeed white van women), or of cab drivers. Instead, cars and vans should run on electricity. That would dramatically improve air quality. It could also reduce climate pollution, if the electricity was generated by renewables, nuclear power or fossil fuels with CCS. So central and local government must use all available levers to promote electric vehicles. Buses and HGVs should run on gas. This produces lower greenhouse gas emissions than petrol or diesel, and much lower toxic emissions. All buses in Delhi have to run on gas. Some European cities (including Madrid) use gas buses. Labour local councils should introduce gas buses; though they will be hard pressed to do so because of the deep cuts in grants that the coalition government has made – surprisingly enough – to Labour authorities. Gas buses are cheap to run, but the conversion has to be paid for and infrastructure provided. Nevertheless, gas buses are less expensive than hydrogen buses, which Ken Livingston promoted while London mayor. Together with electric cars, they could clean up Britain’s air dramatically. Friends of the Earth has urged the government to do more to improve air quality. Its airpollution campaigner Jenny Bates said: We can’t just rely on a change of weather or wind direction to tackle the deadly air pollution incidents which regularly hit Britain – strong Government action is needed to tackle the underlying problem too. Ministers, local authorities and the London Mayor must get much tougher on the causes of air pollution – especially traffic fumes. Without urgent action to tackle this national scandal, thousands of people in the UK are likely to die prematurely again this year. Schools should decide for themselves whether to keep children with asthma indoors, according to Asthma UK. The government's clean air adviser, Professor Frank Kelly, told the Guardian that all children in polluted areas should be kept in during break time. Some schools have heeded this advise. But Asthma UK said it should be for individual schools to make their own decisions on what action, if any, they should take. Emily Humphreys, its head of policy and public affairs, said: \"Our advice is to make sure every child who has asthma has access to a reliever inhaler. That goes for all the time, but particularly now when there is this additional high level of risk.\" The charity reported that 30% of asthma sufferers have experienced an attack since the poor air quality alerts were issued. Humphreys said: \"It does highlight the impact that poor air quality can have on people ... We are keen to see improvements to air quality. But the main focus for us today is dealing with asthma - making sure that people know what to do in an attack and aren't panicking.\" Online retail giant Amazon told my colleague Josh Halliday that it has seen a 15% rise in sales of its face masks. West Midlands Ambulance Service, which covers Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, is also reporting a noticeable spike in call-outs linked to breathing problems and chest pains, PA reports. Daily figures for calls reporting breathing or chest problems were largely level at around 460 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday last week. But the corresponding figures for the first three days of this week were 547, 510 and 501. But hospitals in areas with the highest air pollution reported business as usual, according to PA's ring round. Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn said there had been no noticeable impact on admissions. And Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, said there had been no increase in admissions. GuardianWitness users continue to share their images and experiences of the smog. One said \"Horrible feeling of someone sitting on my chest,\" said Vanterhyden. More than 80% of Asthma sufferers have reported using their inhalers more than usual in the last two days, according to a snap poll by Asthma UK. It also showed that 30% of respondents have had an asthma attack as a result of the pollution, and more than half of people said they had avoided going outside. Kay Boycott, Chief Executive of Asthma UK said: This new data demonstrates that the current high levels of air pollution are having a significant impact on the health and quality of life of people with asthma and that they need to take urgent action to stay safe. Asthma can be very serious, it takes the lives of three people every day so we want to do everything we can to help people minimise their risk of a potentially life threatening attack. Debby Waddell, lead nurse at Asthma UK, advised sufferers what to look out for. She said: We suggest that people keep an eye on their symptoms and know what to do in an asthma attack. You know you’re having an asthma attack if your reliever isn't helping, your symptoms are getting worse (cough, breathlessness, wheeze or tight chest) or you're too breathless or it’s difficult to speak, eat or sleep. Children may complain of a tummy ache. The London Ambulance Service saw a 14% rise in 999 calls for patients with breathing problems yesterday, according to PA. The service said it is still experiencing higher volumes of calls for people with breathing difficulties, asthma and heart problems. Before we get too alarmed by the current smog alert it is worth remembering how bad it got in the Great Smog of 1952. The week-long pea-souper caused the deaths of at least 4,000 people, and eventually led to the Clean Air Act. Katy Stoddard, from our research department, looked at how the Guardian reported the Great Smog, in a blog post to mark its 60th anniversary. Discover Medical London digs out a great photo from the time. Pharmacists are reporting an increase in customers reporting breathing problems, according to the chain LloydsPharmacy. Anthea Lacey, one of its pharmacist at Virginia Water in Surrey, said: We’ve seen lots of people presenting with symptoms related to the smog cloud. As well as those experiencing breathing difficulties, we’ve had customers come in with inflamed eyes, which I suspect is from the sand. In particular, we’ve had people with chronic asthma in need of support - we have helped them with an asthma check-up, where we can make sure they are using their inhalers effectively. If anyone is worried or experiencing symptoms that they think may be related to the smog, they can speak to their local pharmacist for support. A government helpline is advising \"everyone\" to cut down on physical exertion in areas hit by \"very high\" levels of air pollution. The advice is part of a robotic sounding helpline set up by the government about smog levels and how it may affect health. The number 0800 55 66 77, spells out what precautions people should take depending on the different levels of pollution. It says: \"At very high level pollution levels everyone is advised to reduce physical exertion particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as cough or sore throat.\" The Guardian's environment commentator, George Monbiot, is one of the many people who feel they are suffering because of the smog. People who are experiencing breathing problems are being urged to call a helpline set up by the British Lung Foundation. The foundation reports an increase in calls from members of the public complaining of breathlessness. Neil Anderson, a member of the British Lung Foundation’s local ‘Breathe Easy Norwich’ support group, said: Today in one of our group meetings a number of people were already reporting that they were feeling under the weather, including myself. We couldn’t nail down a particular illness but we were feeling more breathless than usual. This made a lot more sense today when I found out that pollution levels had been on the increase. The medical advice is that it can take a while for pollution to have an impact a person’s health – so if this was what we were feeling like yesterday when the pollution wasn’t as bad, I’m worried about what the impact it will be later in the week, once the impact of today has really taken hold. Already we’re worried to go outside the house. I usually feel much better on warmer days like yesterday so I was quite worried when I didn’t feel well. My feeling is that pollution levels in general in the area have gone down in the last few years, but those periods when levels rise, like today, still have an effect. And you can’t just blame them on the winds coming in from Africa. We need to do more to stop the fumes coming out of lorries and buses – that’s what’s doing the real damage. Until we stop it, people will keep getting ill. Deputy prime minister appears to be taking the smog problem more seriously than his coalition partner, writes Peter Walker. Nick Clegg was asked about the smog on his weekly LBC radio phone in, Call Clegg. Slightly oddly, his co-host Nick Ferrari introduced the issue with the caveat, “Obviously, we can’t blame the government for this,” something others might disagree with. Clegg said his youngest son, Miguel, had been up much of the night coughing, though he did not know if this was smog-related. He said: “I think one needs to be a bit careful, particularly with the very young, the very old. Listen carefully to what the heath professionals say.” “I was walking the kids to school yesterday and showing them this brown film on the cars. My youngest boy, as it happens, was up most of the night coughing, which is why I probably look a bit bleary-eyed. I don’t know whether that’s associated with it.” The Green Party has accused David Cameron of trying to shirk responsibility for the smog by blaming the problem on natural causes. In his interview with BBC Breakfast the prime minister described the smog as a \"naturally occurring weather phenomenon\". The comment was seized on Keith Taylor, a Green MEP for south east England who said Cameron's \"flippant\" remark was \"utterly disgraceful\". He said: In the last 10 years nearly 300,000 people have died because of air pollution in the UK, that’s the equivalent of a city the size of Newcastle. Yet, despite the ongoing threat of air pollution and the fact that the EU is taking legal proceedings against the UK on this issue, the Prime Minister has the audacity to lay the entire blame for the smog on Saharan dust. We know that the dust was a contributing factor, and one which we have no control over. But the Government also know that 80 people die every day in the UK because of air pollution, and that we simply aren’t doing enough to tackle the smog coming from our cars and factories. The Prime Minister’s flippant response to this invisible killer is utterly disgraceful. Officials from his own Government are saying that local air pollution is part of the reason for the smog we’re breathing in, yet he’s blaming it all on Saharan Dust. The reason the EU is taking legal action against the UK is that the government simply isn’t doing enough to tackle the problem. We need urgent action on air pollution. That means cutting down the diesel fumes in our towns and cities, and investing in clean, affordable public transport options. David Cameron needs to stop shirking responsibility and start taking action now on air pollution. To wilfully ignore this threat to our health is unforgivable. The areas worst hit so far by pollution are the south-east and London, according to the latest data from a 130 monitoring sites released by Defra. \"Very high\" levels were recorded in both regions. The worst of the poor air is forecast to hit East Anglia and parts of the Midlands today. David Cameron dismissed the smog as a natural event. In his BBC Breakfast interview the prime minister said: It is unpleasant, and you can feel it in the air. The advice I would give to people is listen very carefully to what the Met Office is saying about the weather. Public Health England's website, you can look at that. Or just go to gov.uk, which is the Government's website, which will give you the latest in terms of medical advice. I didn't go for my morning run this morning. I chose to do some work instead. You can feel it. But it's a naturally occurring weather phenomenon. It sounds extraordinary, Saharan dust, but that is what it is. It is difficult to tell whether dust on cars in the UK comes all the way from the Sahara desert or just a nearby building site. But there's a lot of it about. John Curtin, the Environment Agency's director of incident management and resilience, reckons a bit of the Sahara has made it to his car in Leamington. Air pollution from vehicles, factories and homes is now so bad, that when it is exacerbated by a storm in the Sahara 2,500 miles away, or by high pressure over northern Europe, it can leave millions gasping, their skin itching and eyes watering, experts told Ian Sample and John Vidal. When, as has happened this week, all three factors coincide, the outcome is a \"perfect storm\" for air pollution, says Helen Dacre, a meteorologist at Reading University. First, emissions from British traffic and industry have steadily built up in the air. Then gentle easterly winds have brought more pollution from the industrial centres of continental Europe. To make matters worse the dust that has blown in from the Sahara has been whipped up by a storm that produced gale force winds in north Africa. The pollution seen in the milky white air that has blotted out the sun and shrouded half of Britain for much of the past few days, is mostly made up of tiny particulates, such as nitrates and sulphates, mixed with fine desert dust. The particulates come from partially complete combustion processes, but diesel engines are a big culprit, and wear and tear from brake pads and tyres, as well as construction sites, all add to the problem. Saharan dust is blown in all directions. Much is dumped in the seas. But several times a year strong southerly winds bring dust clouds as far north as Britain, mostly during spells of dry weather in Europe, which stops the dust being washed out by rain along the way. The size of particulates is directly linked to their potential to cause health problems. The smallest particulates, those less than 2.5 micrometres, called PM2.5s, are the most dangerous because they penetrate deep inside lungs. Long-term exposure to particles is linked to higher levels of fatal heart and lung disease, including lung cancer. It is not just England that is being hit by smog. As the corner of that Met Office map shows air pollution is also hitting Holland and Belgium. Here's the view in Amsterdam: Twitter users have been sharing smog images from all over England. Here's a selection of the latest: Norwich Doncaster Chesterfield London Huddersfield Cambridge Here's a Met Office map of the latest smog warning. The pollution is forecast on a scale of one to 10. The purple area shows the places that score 10 on scale where \"very high\" levels of air pollution are forecast. High levels of pollution are marked in shades of red from 7 to 9 on the scale. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the smog alert in the UK as more areas of England are warned to expect \"very high\" levels of air pollution. Here's a summary of the latest developments: Millions more people have been warned to expect \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of air pollution. East Anglia and parts of the Midlands are worst affected, according to the Met Office. Cleaner south westerly winds will not bring better conditions until Friday. David Cameron said he didn't go for his morning run because of the smog. Politics Homes quoted the prime minister telling BBC Breakfast: “It's unpleasant and you can feel it in the air...I didn't go for my morning run this morning\" Schools in areas affected by severe air pollution should keep pupils indoors at lunchtime to avoid them having asthma attacks and potentially lifelong lung damage, a key government adviser is urging. Prof Frank Kelly said children should be stopped from using the playground during school hours to reduce their exposure to the smog that is affecting south-east England and is expected to spread to the Midlands and East Anglia. Government advisers are putting out conflicting messages about the health risks, according to the Telegraph. It said Public Health England admitted that the “vast majority of people” would feel no effects and independent experts said there was “no need” to stay indoors. And that a similar alert was put out three weeks ago, when pollution levels were higher in London than on Wednesday. Defra has summarised the government's advice in a table. The Met Office has admitted that it overstated the threat from air pollution yesterday and said that people had been panicked partly because it had just introduced a new forecasting system, according to the Times. On Tuesday the Met Office forecast that there would be high or very high levels of air pollution across southern England and the Midlands yesterday.However, results from 130 monitoring sites showed that it remained low or moderate for most of the day over most of the country. Air pollution is the world's single biggest environmental health risk and yet it is being played down by UK authorities, according to the Guardian's environment editor John Vidal. Don't expect ministers to admit this is a public health emergency. And certainly don't expect local or central government to take action, such as reducing car numbers in the streets or closing down factories. That's what the Chinese and French governments do when the air in their cities is unbreathable and their people are choking.

It makes you wonder where else in energy policy he might consider enough to be enough: the accumulation of hazardous, long-term radioactive waste from nuclear power, for example, or the build-up of life-threatening greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels? Why pick on wind, and in particular, now, is it really such a threat? No country has yet been invaded to annex its windfarms, and no terrorists or foreign powers are known to be fiendishly acquiring wind turbine technology with which to hold the world to ransom. Hayes' intervention raises eyebrows for several reasons. Timing is one. Attacking renewable energy, which is part of the answer to solving climate change, just as a massive extreme weather event – the kind set to worsen in a warming world – is ripping through north America leaving carnage in its wake, amounts at best to questionable political judgment. A much worse, perhaps unpardonable sin, for a Conservative minister is to demonstrate ignorance of your own nation's rich heritage. His ire is raised against the possibility of 4,000 new wind turbines being \"allowed to spread\" through the country and be \"imposed on communities\". This he sees as a shocking attack of the new from the \"bourgeois left\". But, for someone of Hayes' political persuasion, one which prides itself on a sense of history and tradition, he seems unaware that as long ago as the seventeenth century an estimated 90,000 windmills quietly turned up across the landscape of Britain. It's a matter of taste, of course, but I find the aerodynamic elegance of a modern wind turbine rather more attractive than ubiquitous giant meccano of electricity pylons which march about the country without apparent complaint from the energy minister. I wonder if his concern about things being \"imposed\" on communities stretches back to Conservative transport and planning policy that saw roads carve through countryside and out-of-town superstores kill high streets? Hayes is, of course, another example of a broader, creeping retreat from reason on energy policy that includes the appointment of Peter Lilley MP – an oil company executive and global warming sceptic – to the select committee on climate change and energy, and the new environment secretary himself, Owen Paterson. Their antipathy toward the economic potential of environmental action seems cruelly to deny Britain a vital route out of its industrial torpor, not to mention the chance of building real energy security, and creating countless job opportunities by cashing in on the fact that, according to Deutsche Bank, pound for pound of investment, energy efficiency and renewable technologies deliver anywhere between two- and four-times the number of jobs compared to the old, conventional energy sources. A week ago I spoke at a conference to launch a national initiative on the transition to a low-carbon economy in the Belgian city of Ghent. A few hundred tickets had been sold in the run up to the event, and then, suddenly, it sold out with hundreds turned away by the box office. What happened? Just days before came news that the Ford motor works in Genk was going to close. More than 10,000 jobs depended on it. A speech, more properly a eulogy, that was made in Belgian parliament by a young MP left hardened politicians and commentators in tears. Yet such events shouldn't really shock us. The past tells us that change is inevitable. At the end of the cold war, for example, employment in military industries fell dramatically. New work had to be found elsewhere, and largely it was. Today, driven by a combination of economic, natural resource and environmental factors, rich countries inescapably face an era of industrial change and reorganisation. The worst thing we can do is go into denial about it and cling to an economic model not only whose age is passing, but which would make the necessary changes even harder when circumstances become more demanding, and which, worst of all, where the shift to green energy is concerned, denies people potential jobs, the country greater energy security and solutions to cold homes and energy poverty. Of course, as every good Tory knows, some things about the past were very, very good. Bring back the windmill, I say (or at least its modern equivalent).

You will pay for the £200bn investment needed to transform the UK's dirty and ageing energy infrastructure into something clean, secure and fit for the 21st century. But the people delivering that are the energy companies and developers and so to get clear idea of how they view the current energy shambles, I sat down with a senior executive from a major energy investor. I won't name him or the company, for reasons that will become obvious when words like \"horrified\" and \"uninvestable\" come up, but they are right at the heart of the action. We started with the additional costs being piled on consumers by what the executive called the \"totally unnecessary bunfight over gas versus renewables.\" That, as I wrote in March, is because the cost of capital – i.e. the price paid for borrowing money to invest – shoots up as political rows stoke uncertainty over government policy. \"It is absolutely an outcome,\" said the executive. \"Banks are horrified about how risky all this has become.\" Charles Hendry, recently sacked as energy minister, told the FT on Monday that, without a ceasefire, there was a risk that energy bills will \"go through the roof\". He suggested consumers might bear \"a totally unnecessary extra cost\" of £1bn a year. The executive told me: \"The whole justification of the government's electricity market reform (EMR) was to reduce the cost of capital, but the effect has been the opposite.\" He added, darkly: \"What the government forgets is that no one has to invest.\" \"We have very unclear and contradictory narratives,\" he said. One of the most astonishing things he told me was that, despite the energy industry's huge size and importance to the nation, the chancellor simply doesn't talk to them. \"The problem with Osborne is that you never hear direct from the horse's mouth what he thinks. You rely on hearing rumours. He does not engage with the industry.\" The specific row over onshore wind farms between new energy minister and wind-sceptic John Hayes and his supposed boss, energy secretary Ed Davey, also beggars belief, said the executive. \"The obvious tension between Davey and Hayes is quite unprecedented.\" Unprecedented or not, David Cameron's refusal to grant Davey's request and remove responsibility for renewable policy from Hayes shows clearly the prime minister has prioritised the demands of some backbench Tory MPs over the national interest, which requires all the low-cost, clean energy it can get. \"The economic rationale behind this [opposition to onshore wind] makes no sense at all,\" said the executive. The ironic result of all this infighting is that investment is stalling badly in not only renewables but also gas-fired electricity generation, which Osborne sees as preferable. \"The energy bill is so much later than it was supposed to be,\" said the executive. \"The hiatus of investment could go on for years.\" It didn't help that Cameron's impromptu pledge on energy bills delayed the bill even further, as ministers scrabbled to make his busking into reality. But, even when the energy bill finally sees the light of day, the executive was gloomy on its prospects. \"It is in no-one's interest to push through something unworkable and uninvestable, but the government is pressing on regardless.\" He also regretted the opportunities being lost for jobs in the UK. \"The sorry thing for the UK is that we had the opportunity to build up a supply chain in onshore wind power, and we blew it.\" he said. Now, because of the delays and uncertainty, \"we are doing our level best to blow the opportunity to build up an offshore wind supply chain.\" One of the key, if rather technical, issues being fought over in government is whether the energy bill should set a target that electricity generation should be virtually carbon-emissions-free by 2030, a so-called decarbonisation target. The executive was unequivocal about the importance of this, saying the industry faced deep uncertainty after 2020, when legal targets for renewables need to be met. In the following decade, without a decarbonisation target, there is nothing to reassure energy investors that low-carbon investments will be good ones. He finished with another dark warning, about the difficulty of keeping the lights on as old coal and nuclear power stations shut in the next few years. \"The energy crunch is coming much sooner than the government expected. Coal stations are using up their hours now, before they are forced to close down, because coal is cheap and to avoid the carbon floor price in 2013.\" The lights will not go off, of course. Instead, energy will become even more expensive. The prime minister's failure to end the war by reining in his unforgivably-badly informed chancellor will mean energy bill payers will be roasted, whichever tariff Cameron's new law has forced them onto."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jan/10/doomsday-clock-ticks-closer-to-midnight","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-10T21:47:00Z","webTitle":"Doomsday Clock ticks one minute closer to midnight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/10/doomsday-clock-ticks-closer-to-midnight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jan/10/doomsday-clock-ticks-closer-to-midnight","fields":{"headline":"Doomsday Clock ticks one minute closer to midnight","bodyText":"The world tiptoed closer to the apocalypse on Tuesday as scientists moved the Doomsday Clock one minute closer to the zero hour. The symbolic clock now stands at five minutes to midnight, the scientists said, because of a collective failure to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, act on climate change, or find safe and sustainable sources of energy – as exemplified by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The rare bright points the scientists noted were the Arab spring and movement in Russia for greater democracy. The clock, maintained by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, has been gauging our proximity to global disaster since 1947, using the potent image of a clock counting down the minutes to destruction. Until Tuesday afternoon, the clock had been set at six minutes to midnight. \"It is five minutes to midnight,\" the scientists said. \"Two years ago it appeared that world leaders might address the truly global threats we face. In many cases, that trend has not continued or been reversed.\" The Bulletin was founded by the scientists who helped build America's atomic bomb, and the primary focus of their concerns remains the danger of a nuclear conflagration. But a number of the scientists who took part in the deliberations said they were also dismayed by a growing trend to disregard science. \"A cross-cutting issue through the entire discussion is the worrisome trend to reject or diminish the significance of what science says is the characteristic of a problem,\" said Robert Socolow of Princeton's Environmental Institute. \"There is a general judgment among us that we need the political leadership to affirm the primacy of science.\" The scientists also noted how Republicans seeking the GOP nomination were trying to outdo each other in denying climate science. Their greatest disappointment, however, was the failure of international leaders to rid the world of nuclear weapons, exemplified by what they called \"ambiguity about Iran's nuclear power program.\" Even when Russia and America ratified a new nuclear treaty in 2010, there were still nearly 20,000 nuclear weapons in the world. They warned that the Fukushima meltdown once more exposed the dangers of nuclear power – not just because of technology but because of management failures. After Fukushima, governments also need to think far more carefully about siting nuclear power plants. The stricken plant was too close to the coast and in a seismically active region. \"A major question needs to be addressed: \"How can complex systems like nuclear power stations be made less susceptible to accidents and errors in judgment,\" the scientists said in their statement. On climate change, the scientists warned the global community may be reaching a point of no-return unless there is a push to begin building alternatives to carbon-heavy technologies within the next five years. The Fukushima disaster, the painfully slow pace of the UN's international climate negotiations, and the growing hostility to science punctured the optimism of earlier pronouncements from the Bulletin scientists. In 2010, the scientists set the clock back from five minutes to six minutes to midnight, amid hopes that the international community was prepared to act on nuclear weapons and climate change. \"We all had a sense when we moved the clock in 2010 that we might have a breakthrough,\" said Kennette Benedict, executive director of the bulletin. \"Today there was a real sense that we really need new thinking and we don't have new thinking.\" Twenty years ago, with the break-up of the Soviet Union bringing the end of the cold war, the scientists moved the clock back farther than ever to 17 minutes to midnight. But the scientists have also set the clock as close as two minutes to midnight in 1953, after America tested its first hydrogen device."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/blog/2013/feb/26/women-power-revolution-rising-expectations","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-26T15:32:17Z","webTitle":"Women and power: the revolution of rising expectations | Michael White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/blog/2013/feb/26/women-power-revolution-rising-expectations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/blog/2013/feb/26/women-power-revolution-rising-expectations","fields":{"headline":"Women and power: the revolution of rising expectations","bodyText":"Today's papers are again full of allegations about sexual harassment in the workplace. There's the Lib Dems and Chris Rennard (though the Tory media's real target is increasingly Nick Clegg) and there's that even older, revered institution, the papacy (though the Tory media care less about ex-Cardinal Keith O'Brien and are more interested in the pope). Where will the spotlight fall tomorrow? Sexism in the City? In the BBC (again) or the trades unions? In sport, as it was during the Olympics? What's going on here? Is it a pandemic of sexism in British society, which campaigners routinely claim on doubtful evidence is so much worse than neighbours like France? Or is it something deeper going on? The latter, I think. One feature of most current exposés of institutional failures is pressure for greater transparency and accountability. It comes from many quarters, including good governance campaigns and social media, and is highly desirable. But it takes a corrosive toll in terms of public trust. Is it better that we know all these dreadful things about the way some people – that's some people – with power and opportunity behave when they think no one's looking? Now that we know the true cost of the nuclear power industry since the 1950s or the greedy, irresponsible and corrupt ways some bankers have behaved since the 1990s, are we better off? Ditto the highly leveraged management of Premier League football and its pampered stars? On balance, the answer must be yes. But the danger is obvious. Our widespread rejection of the nuclear option may leave us vulnerable to power blackouts in the foreseeable future as other energy sources falter. Hack-handed attempts to tame the excesses of the bankers may cripple our capacity for economic growth, the jobs and prosperity that go with it. Premier League footballers may decamp elsewhere, though probably not to the Cayman islands or Switzerland like the bankers. Populist responses are easy (I plead guilty on several counts), but they don't keep the lights on or the ATM machines working. Politicians too deserve much of the collective stick they get, not least over the MPs' expenses scandal, but not all of it. Much of the stick is cynically orchestrated by media moguls whose interests are not aligned with Britain or its electorate, not least because they neither live nor pay income tax here. You can see it in the papers any day of the week – if you can overcome the personal prejudice and distraction to which the headline is appealing. The other force at work which constantly catches my attention is the working through of what I was taught decades ago to call the revolution of rising expectations. People get restless and angry when things are getting better overall, not when they are reduced to a struggle for survival as things get worse. It may be what drove the Arab spring and similar cataclysmic upheavals over the centuries. Closer to home it is driving demands by women for equal shares in society's good things – power and money along with freedom from groping. It comes almost a century after they first got the vote (1918), almost 150 years after the Married Women's Property Act of 1870 allowed them to keep the money they earned or inherited, even longer since the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 allowed hundreds of women to seek divorce from bad husbands. Kate Summerscale's Mrs Robinson's Disgrace offers a fascinating insight into that world, based on a wife's private diary. Other \"minorities\" (yes, I realise women are the majority) are also pressing their claims after centuries of neglect or oppression based on race, sexual orientation, disability and the like. But let's stick to women for the moment. I got into trouble at a seminar the other week when I told an audience of impatient educated women that they should bear in mind that they're winning this battle, a battle moreover in which there are also losers: most conspicuously ill-educated boys at the bottom of the social pile for whom jobs and prospects are often quite bleak. But race and gender have displaced class on the inequality agenda. Just look at Sunday's Observer profile of Facebook's Superwoman of a boss. When a well known public figure told the same seminar that things are as bad for women as they were 50 years ago, I got quite cross. Oh no, they're not. Didn't women once have to resign as teachers when they got married, let alone pregnant? Things are much better in countless ways, but it's in the nature of the revolution of rising expectations that people want them to get better even faster. It's easy to see why, very understandable, but it undermines a sense of perspective. So today's Guardian carries an article by Vera Baird, former Labour MP and solicitor general, currently Northumbria's elected police commissioner, explaining how sexist parliament still is. Baird is a seriously smart and tough woman, Mo Mowlam's successor as MP for Redcar (2001-10), whose testimony should be taken seriously. Yet from a longer perspective – mine – the Lords and Commons are far more feminised in so many ways than they were in my youth there. Better or worse? Both. Let's just say it's different, though I do miss chips on the cafeteria menu. Politics attracts some big egos; bullying, favouritism and harassment happens – as it does in many walks of life – but it's not all confined to women. Nor are hurt feelings or personal insecurity. Robin Cook, to cite one complicated example of a family friendly male MP, felt horribly defensive about his looks, felt they held him back (No Robin, it was you). I know such sentiments, however mildly expressed, will annoy some readers. Yet older women politicians, some of them feminists who fought their way to the top (or had to settle for the unelected Lords) in the male-dominated jungle of yesteryear, would share them. As Commons Speaker, Betty Boothroyd, who fought six elections before getting a seat, could be scathing about the sensibilities of the \"Blair babes\" generation. Not kind, I agree, but you can see her point of view too. So when I read Yvonne Roberts's Observer account of the number of women holding top jobs in industry, politics, the judiciary, banking, the arts (etc) – they are culled from Sex and Power 2013: Who Runs Britain? produced by the Counting Women coalition – I don't think: \"Oh my God, we're slipping back\"; I look on the stats as steady, relentless progress over my lifetime. It may slip back here and there, but it won't be reversed. Excellent! More women on the board may provide a better cure for macho bankers than tighter rules from Brussels. It's worth a try. Meanwhile, mere numbers are a useful guide, but too crude a benchmark to be the sole test of change. If François Hollande's government has gender parity and David Cameron's doesn't we shouldn't feel as badly as we're invited to feel. We didn't nearly elect Dominique Strauss-Kahn as president either, though we did once elect Lloyd George (he was a Liberal too)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/aug/19/viv-groskop-lottery-winners","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-18T23:04:17Z","webTitle":"Lottery win: a newly minted millionaire?

Last Tuesday, music shop owner Adrian Bayford and his wife, Gillian, from the Suffolk town of Haverhill won £148m with a lucky dip EuroMillions lottery ticket. Within 24 hours, it was being reported via a third party that Bayford's best friend and business partner, Richard Hudspith of the Suffolk Music Centre, had turned down an offer of a significant share of the jackpot. Turned down? What? This was the stuff of fairy tales. In my dreams, it's not usually a friend who makes the generous offer. And I don't have a business partner who plays the lottery. Maybe I need to get one. With me, it's usually a complete stranger. A large, suited bald man (and Adrian Bayford fits this description) sidles up with a giant cigar in his mouth and says in a comedy Bronx accent, a diamond-studded gold sovereign ring winking from his pinkie finger: \"Lemme make you a millionaire.\" But disappointingly Hudspith later clarified in the Sun that this was \"nonsense\". No such encounter occurred and Adrian Bayford never took on the form of an imposing, Bronx-dwelling mafioso lurking in the xylophone section of the Suffolk Music Centre. (I hope they have an extensive xylophone section. If they don't, they will soon.) \"Adrian and I have never even discussed the money. I'd never talk about it.\" He didn't say anything about the giant cigar. This is how they do things in Suffolk. Sensibly. It's for the best. The writer Elizabeth Gilbert has written about the dangers of an \"over-giving bender\". When her book Eat, Pray, Love made her into a multimillionaire, she paid off friends' credit card bills, bought them plane tickets, tuition, therapy, gym memberships, vehicles. \"Sometimes (well, twice), I even bought them houses.\" In the process, she says, she became what she calls a \"destiny disruptor\". She lost friends – \"and now we cross the street to avoid running into each other\" – by sweeping into their lives with \"my big fat cheque book\". Gilbert contends that there is a fine line between generosity and over-giving. The first is laudable and selfless. You just want to help and share your good fortune. The second is dangerous and, sometimes, self-serving. You risk playing God, trying to control people's lives. Leave that to the experts, she counsels. Give it to charities. They have plenty of experience in navigating this moral minefield and will happily bear the ethical burden for you. The Bayfords' best friend Richard added: \"I genuinely believe they will be the same people they have always been.\" Just to reiterate: this friend is an admirable, principled man who has done absolutely the right thing not to solicit any cash. I, however, have no similar qualms and can be contacted via the Observer. I have the Montecristo ready.

Shares in Invensys surged 26.6% to 257p on Wednesday on the back of rumoured interest from Emerson, but the company statement went some way to paring back those gains as Invensys stock closed down 14% at 220p. However, the stock's failure to give up its gains entirely indicated that investors remained optimistic of further approaches emerging. Tintin Stormont, an analyst at Singer Capital Markets, a brokerage, said the group's £426m pension fund deficit would not be a deal breaker, with a break-up the most likely scenario. \"A break-up is likely to generate the highest value for each division,\" said Stormont. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said that while Emerson may be barred from a further approach for the next six months under UK takeover rules, it did not preclude other bidders coming forward. \"This does not prevent any third party from opening talks in the meantime,\" the bank said. \"This may stop the shares giving up all their gains.\" Despite the claim that Emerson is interested in the whole group, the American suitor's main focus was reportedly on Foxboro, part of the operations management unit, whose software monitors major industrial plants such as nuclear power stations. The operations management business is the biggest part of the group, generating half its revenue. Siemens was reportedly interested in the rail business, which accounts for 31% of Invensys revenues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/29/gas-energy-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-29T12:11:09Z","webTitle":"The dash for gas is a dangerous gamble | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/29/gas-energy-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/29/gas-energy-protest","fields":{"headline":"The dash for gas is a dangerous gamble","bodyText":"So, are the \"No dash for gas\" protesters perched atop the cooling towers of the new West Burton gas-fired power station in Nottinghamshire right? They argue: The new 'dash for gas' will leave us dependent on a highly polluting and increasingly expensive fossil fuel for decades to come. It would make even our modest carbon reduction targets impossible to hit, and cause household energy bills to soar even further. The answer is mostly yes, for reasons I'll explain below. So why is the new dash for gas now sprinting out of the starting blocks? For two reasons, one justified and one not. The first is that some new gas will be needed in the UK, as ageing and dirty nuclear and coal power plants are phased out. The second is that the chancellor George Osborne has been captured by a small but influential group of fracking fanatics who have convinced him that shale gas will bring a game-changing bonanza of cheap gas. It won't. But let's start with the basics and the most independent source we have, the government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. They are charged with setting out the lowest cost, lowest risk path to meeting the nation's legally binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Their \"Plan A\" allows for 10GW of new gas-fired electricity generation, about 10 new power stations. For the energy policy geeks out there, that leads to a carbon intensity of about 50g of CO2 being emitted per kWh of electricity in 2030. But, if the renewable energy or nuclear power envisaged in Plan A does not materialise in a big way, then says the UK will need a Plan B: 20GW of new gas power and about 100g of CO2 per kWh in 2030. That doesn't mean the nation will have given up on its carbon targets, says the CCC, but the balance of cost and risk is better for Plan A. The 20GW goal is what ministers are now pursuing, so according the CCC they have chosen a more risky and more expensive path. How so? First, no-one outside the shale gas lobby thinks fracking will deliver cheap, plentiful gas for the UK and so make a big dash for gas sensible. \"Look at European gas price projections ... they all agree on the direction – up. European shale will help, but not on a US scale.\" says the CBI's boss John Cridland. He later added: \"An over reliance on new gas would leave us exposed to global price and supply fluctuations and jeopardise our carbon targets.\" It's worth contrasting that with Osborne's comment, when he shoehorned himself into the dash for gas announcement made by energy secretary Ed Davey in March. \"Gas is a reliable, affordable source of energy,\" said the chancellor. Very few agree with him, not least people facing soaring gas and electricity bills, mainly due to rising gas prices over the last few years. Another risk comes from the duty to meet carbon targets. The 20 big new power stations will apparently have licences to operate to 2045 without cutting their carbon emissions. I can't see how that tallies with cutting emissions by the amount needed, but let's say it somehow can be made to do so. That means we'll need carbon capture and storage technology operating at full scale, yet that seems as far off as ever thereby creating another risk. A final risk was set out recently by a report commissioned by consultants E3G, which found that a gas-heavy electricity system in the UK created a much greater risk of soaring energy prices than a renewables-based system. So, what one might call a \"stroll for gas\" is needed - roughly 10 new plants - and even a dash for gas does not necessarily blow the UK's carbon budgets, according to the CCC. But the dash increases the risk of both higher price rises than already predicted and the risk of busting those budgets. Unless you don't believe climate change is a threat, or you do believe in the UK shale gas fantasy, the dash for gas looks dumb. Osborne appears to be winning the energy policy battle, which is expected to come to a head next week with the publication of the energy bill. He \"has different facts\", according to a senior source, taking advice from only a very small circle. If he really cares about the economy, he should get out more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/15/plutonium-stockpile-carbon-targets-david-king","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Use nuclear waste to power UK, says top scientist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/15/plutonium-stockpile-carbon-targets-david-king","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/15/plutonium-stockpile-carbon-targets-david-king","fields":{"headline":"Use nuclear waste to power UK, says top scientist","bodyText":"It will be impossible for the UK to meet its long-term carbon reduction target without reusing the nation's stockpile of plutonium, the former government chief scientist has warned. He predicts that global supplies of uranium will begin to run out in 2023 so the UK will need to rely on a domestic supply of nuclear fuel. Sir David King told the Guardian: \"You have to look at our stretching long-term targets, and we will need to generate more electricity while reducing emissions – you will need to look at plutonium in order to do that. I don't see any other way.\" Greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by 80% by mid-century, according to the UK's long-term goals. More than 100 tonnes of plutonium are currently in storage, the waste products of nuclear energy generation, and no future has yet been decided for it. While renewable energy – wind, solar, tidal power and others – should also be pursued, King said that experience so far showed that these forms of energy would not be enough by themselves to produce the energy needed to meet future electricity demand, which is expected to rise strongly as road transport and heating are electrified. He called for the government to take a more forceful role in directing the UK's energy provision. \"We need a long-term view of the UK's energy future, and that has got to be the government's job – we can no longer say the market will sort it out,\" he said. \"The market works well in the short-term arena, but can deal with the long-term only with proper government measures.\" Plutonium, from being regarded as a waste product, is starting to be regarded by the government as a resource. King said it would be needed to fuel new power stations, because stocks of uranium are being rapidly depleted, and only a fraction of the mined supplies are suitable for use in generating power. According to a new report from King, if all the nuclear power stations that are planned around the globe are built, then the world will start to run out of uranium by 2023. In the report, entitled Towards a Low Carbon Pathway for the UK, published by the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment on Thursday, King sets out ways in which the 102-tonne plutonium stockpile – the residue of nuclear power generation – could be recycled to keep generating power, in a process he said could generate more than 40,000 jobs. Reusing the plutonium would also render it safe from use by terrorists, King said. He said the idea of reusing the fuel had been until recently overlooked – the UK's nuclear policy is decided by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), which takes its advice from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the body charged with dismantling the UK's nuclear legacy. \"There is no Nuclear Commissioning Authority – that is part of the problem,\" said King. King favours a Mox – mixed oxide – plant, which would reprocess the plutonium into usable fuel, and generate electricity. \"This would be the most efficient way,\" he said. But his views are controversial. Last year, the government said the UK's only Mis plant was a money-wasting failure. Richard George, energy campaigner for Greenpeace, said: \"Mox plants have already failed, and one report isn't going to do anything to change that. The government just closed our only Mox plant because it was eye-wateringly inefficient and succeeded only in hoovering up almost one and a half billion pounds of taxpayers' money.\" King said there had been problems in the way the previous Mox plant was set up and run. He said the UK's approach to nuclear power had been piecemeal and inefficient, and should be overhauled. The government has also said it favours the Mox option, but there are a handful of other suggestions for how the plutonium could be used. One comes from General Electric Hitachi, which has technology called Prism that could reuse the fuel to generate power. However, although the technology has been developed on paper for decades, it is not yet in commercial use. GE Hitachi said on Wednesday it was \"continuing to progress its proposal with the NDA\", and said it would host a nuclear industry suppliers' conference in Cumbria on 4 April, to meet with potential UK business partners in support of the project. The company's partners including engineering firms Costain, Arup and Pöyry will also be present. A rival proposal is to use the plutonium to fuel a thorium nuclear plant. This technology has also been in development for decades, but work was discontinued by governments focused on developing nuclear technology that would also have a military use. However, thorium development has recently been revived and proponents say the plutonium stockpile could be safely used for this. But King warned that the UK should not rely on untested technology. \"We should not be guinea pigs here,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/25/chris-huhne-court-nuclear-cancer-children","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Chris Huhne faces legal challenge over nuclear link to cancer in children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/25/chris-huhne-court-nuclear-cancer-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/25/chris-huhne-court-nuclear-cancer-children","fields":{"headline":"Chris Huhne faces legal challenge over nuclear link to cancer in children","bodyText":"The government has ordered an expansion of the UK's nuclear programme without properly factoring in evidence that nuclear power stations cause an increase in cancer cases in children living nearby, according to a legal challenge in the high court. The case alleges that the energy and climate secretary, Chris Huhne, did not properly review the evidence on cancer when giving the go-ahead for the expansion last year. Lawyers claim the action could delay, or even stop, the programme of new reactors. Rory Walker, a 24-year-old community worker from Lancaster, has won legal aid to launch the unprecedented case. Walker lives close to Heysham where two new reactors are planned, and says he is worried about having children who could suffer an increased risk of leukaemia. \"It is folly beyond belief, and almost genocidal, to build new nuclear power stations,\" he said. \"Nuclear power is unsafe, uneconomic and a dangerous distraction.\" Walker's decision to go to court predates the Fukushima nuclear crisis following the Japan tsunami, though Walker said it has reinforced his fears. He is an active member of the Heysham Anti-Nuclear Alliance, and works on a project to help local people grow more food on a community allotment. Under legal aid rules, he has agreed to contribute 10% of his income towards the cost of the legal action. Walker alleges that evidence from government-sponsored studies in Germany was not adequately taken into account by Huhne. It suggests that young children who live close to nuclear power stations are twice as vulnerable to developing leukaemia. The studies, known as KiKK (Kinderkrebs in der Umgebung von KernKraftwerken), prompted an investigation by the UK Department of Health, which has not yet been published. Ian Fairlie, a consultant on radiation in the environment, is acting as an expert witness in support of Walker's court challenge. \"If the risks found following the KiKK study were applied to Heysham, infants and young children under five living within 5km would be exposed to increased risks of cancer, especially leukaemia,\" he said. Huhne is accused of breaching a 1996 directive from Europe's nuclear agency, Euratom. Andrew Lockley, a partner with Irwin Mitchell, said: \"The fundamental purpose of the Euratom directive is to make sure that a comprehensive and detailed assessment is made before new nuclear reactors are built.\" \"It does not permit an approach which appears generalised, generic and deferred. Justification requires that the health detriments should be considered and balanced against the economic, social or other benefits which may occur – but this doesn't seem to have happened here.\" The lawyers want a judicial review to rule that Huhne acted unlawfully, and to quash his decisions. A spokeswoman for Huhne at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said: \"We are confident that the decisions were rightly and properly made. The safety of our nuclear power stations is the government's number one priority and the UK has one of the most rigorous and robust regulatory systems anywhere in the world.\" She added: \"The government have asked the chief nuclear inspector, Dr Mike Weightman, to produce a report on the implications of the unprecedented events in Japan and the lessons to be learned for the UK nuclear industry.\" A spokesperson for the Nuclear Industry Association, which represents nuclear companies said: \"This matter is now part of the legal process and we are not therefore in a position to comment.\" The government has until the end of the month to make a formal response to the legal action, which will then go to a judge, who may order a hearing in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/blog/2012/jul/25/personalisation-web-making-leadership-tougher","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-25T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"Why the personalisation of the web is making leadership tougher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/jul/25/personalisation-web-making-leadership-tougher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/jul/25/personalisation-web-making-leadership-tougher","fields":{"headline":"Why the personalisation of the web is making leadership tougher","bodyText":"There are two pivotal and powerful drivers towards personalisation of the internet. The first and most obvious concerns being \"user centred\". As Amit Singhai, one of the architects of Google search puts it: \"I want my search engine to be the expert who knows me the best.\" The second and probably more powerful driver is advertising. One reason that Google and Facebook are now two of the world's biggest companies is that they have developed a system for highly targeted advertising. Making this advertising system work well depends on collecting as much data on the user as possible to target adverts effectively. What has this got to do with public leadership? Quite a lot. A cornerstone of any public leadership, especially over the tougher and often more important issues, such as deciding whether to fund nuclear power or cut highly sensitive areas such as social care or the military, is working with a diverse range of public opinions to inform decisions and build solid civic legitimacy for any decisions. In the past, the traditional broadcast media have played an important role in helping both public leaders and interest groups be heard and, critically, for all those involved to hear one other. Public debate, in other words. But now that many of us have our information mediated by social media, the nature of public debate is changing. The news people receive through Facebook or Google is not simply a reflection of what other people think is important, it tends to reflect a narrow group of people. Eli Pariser, the founder of MoveOn and Avaaz, has explained how we are effectively creating online echo chambers, where we tend to be insulated from views different from our own. This is a potential problem for the public leader who depends on the public's ability to appreciate views different from their own, to accept decisions which may be in the greater good but don't serve their personal interests. Many of the most important decisions for society as a whole depend on the majority taking responsibility to protect a vulnerable minority. This can include decisions such as social care for people with disabilities and action on climate to protect low-lying communities or future generations. The problem with personalisation is it appears to be eroding the \"bridging\" relationships and mutual understanding necessary for good public leadership; and more importantly our ability as a society to understand those who are different from us. Only by understanding people different from ourselves can we take action together on the big issues we all face.

Ahead of January's polls, nationalist Kuomintang incumbent Ma Ying-jeou and chief rival Democratic Progressive party chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen have ditched the traditional Taiwanese political playbook and gone for support from aboriginal, landowner, gay, women, animal and environmental rights groups. New policies on nuclear power and tougher stances on industrial polluters, unheard of a few years ago, have been promised in a bid to win an election that is likely to be decided by a few percentage points. \"Taiwan has a strong democracy. We can protest, when, where, and how we like, and the activism community has taken advantage of that,\" says Pan Han-shen, founder of Green party Taiwan. \"But while we win some successes at election time, we do need to build a stronger platform overall, so we don't get marginalised by the two big political parties.\" For the time being, rights groups have won concessions from political parties that previously championed economic development at all costs. Ma, under pressure from an electorate that saw disturbing similarities between Japan's Fukushima and Taiwan's nuclear power industry, vowed to shut down three ageing reactors by 2025. Under the plan, a fourth reactor, currently under construction near Taipei, will only open if stiffer safety, management and maintenance requirements are met. It was a marked departure from the Kuomintang party line of quietly expanding nuclear generation on this energy-hungry island 180km off China's shores. Tsai, 55, a former vice-premier who holds a PhD from the London School of Economics and is the first female candidate for top office in any modern Chinese state, vowed to scrap nuclear power altogether. \"The KMT is playing catch-up. When they ruled for over 50 years they didn't pay any attention to these issues. But Ma is seeing how useful they can be, come election time,\" says DPP spokesman Lin Chun-hsien. \"But it isn't just the votes. A stamp of approval from these groups is highly beneficial for the image of either party or candidate.\" Ma has already done substantially more for social causes than his KMT predecessors, who were driven by the need to prop up the economy's GDP and export growth numbers. In June, he ordered the closure of much of a Formosa Plastics Group petrochemical plant after a series of highly toxic fires broke out. The fires happened after protests against the plant and a report that found that cancer rates in the local community were five times higher than the national average. In April, he announced that a long-planned proposal to build another petrochemical plant, the $21bn Kuokuang complex on Taiwan's west coast, would not go ahead after environmentalists complained that it would destroy the island's largest wetlands, home to the critically endangered Taiwanese pink dolphin. \"For us, the decision to stop Kuokuang going ahead was one of the biggest in recent years. Before that the DPP was supposedly the environmentalist party. However, President Ma realises that today's context is very different and we need to strike a balance between social and economic development,\" says KMT spokesman Yin Wei. Both candidates have promised Taiwan's aboriginal communities economic and land rights benefits for their support. Animal protection activists have been told that animal cruelty laws will be strengthened. Women's groups will have representation quotas raised in political arenas, and gay groups will see anti-discrimination laws improved. Sex workers were acknowledged when a bill was passed legalising the establishment of red-light districts. \"Four years ago, Ma came in on a landslide and didn't need minority or fringe groups to get elected. But this election's going down to the wire and the public's better understanding of social issues has prompted both candidates to reach out,\" says Yeh-lih Wang, chair of political science at National Taiwan University. \"While this is a new phenomenon in Taiwan, if one of them wins on the back of fringe- element support, future campaign managers will be paying much more attention to activist groups.\" With all the promises being made, some members of Taiwan's activist community are concerned that the winner at the ballot box may eventually renege on pledges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/01/local-opposition-onshore-windfarms-tripled","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-01T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Local opposition to onshore windfarms has tripled, poll shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/01/local-opposition-onshore-windfarms-tripled","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/01/local-opposition-onshore-windfarms-tripled","fields":{"headline":"Local opposition to onshore windfarms has tripled, poll shows","bodyText":"Local opposition to onshore windfarms has tripled since 2010, a new Guardian poll reveals, following a series of political and media attacks on the renewable technology. However, a large majority of the British public (60%) remains firmly in favour of wind power, while also opposing the building of new nuclear or coal power plants in their local area. The poll shows that the national debate over wind energyis becoming sharply polarised, with the percentage of Britons strongly supporting the building of a new windfarm in their area going up by 5%, and the percentage strongly against rising by 14%. The government has firmly backed wind power, along with nuclear power and gas when the carbon emissions are captured and buried, as the mix needed to provide secure, affordable energy over the coming decade and beyond, while reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change. \"A responsible energy policy for this country is one that rules in all of the key low-carbon technologies to help us keep the lights on and emissions down,\" the energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, told the Guardian. \"Ruling any of them out would be folly. It would mean one less way of cutting our dependence on imported gas, one less way of cutting our carbon emissions. And it would hit consumers where it hurts.\" But the government is being increasingly attacked over the cost of renewable energy subsidies and the impact on the British landscape of onshore windfarms. \"Onshore wind is the cheapest of the renewables – in fact we've already proposed cutting the subsidy to reflect falling costs,\" said Davey. \"Built in the right places, and with the benefits for local communities we're introducing, onshore wind has a crucial role to play.\" The UK's leading expert on nimbyism, Prof Patrick Devine-Wrightfrom the University of Exeter, said that those promoting windfarms were failing to win the public debate. \"In terms of the policy implications of the quite dramatic polarisation, it is quite worrying for the government as attitudes are hardening on both sides. This suggests it will be hard to reach any kind of societal consensus.\" The ICM/Guardian poll shows 60% of Britons would now support the building of a windfarm within five miles of their home, compared to 73% of those asked the same question in an Ipsos Mori poll in early 2010. Those opposed to such a development rose from 16% to 27% of people. But the acute polarisation of the debate is clear, with those strongly in favour rising from 30% to 35% and those strongly opposed also rising from 7% to 21%. People aged over 65 were far more likely to oppose a new windfarm (43%) compared to 18 to 24-year-olds (16%), and Conservative voters were twice as likely as Labour voters to be opposed (41% versus 20%). Devine-Wright said other countries had handled the issue much better: \"There is a growing presumption in the UK that onshore wind is dodgy, but there is no reason why it should be that like that. The vast majority of the population are in favour of local renewables projects, so we are starting with goodwill but ending up in a mess.\" He highlighted the far greater community ownership of wind and other renewable projects in other countries, compared to Britain where most are owned by large energy companies. \"Denmark and Germany have been far better able to mobilise projects with communities at the centre of the project, rather than on the periphery. \"In the UK, there is often an emotional response. When you talk to local objectors, they feel their sense of place is being violated [by outsiders] and you need to avoid that at all costs. You need to harness that emotion in a positive way and the government has to take a more proactive stance to address that.\" Other recent, unpublished Ipsos Mori and YouGov polls seen by the Guardian also show: • there is no significant difference in the attitude to increasing renewable energy generation in England between rural communities (88% in favour) and urban communities (85%); • gas is far far less favoured as a source of electricity (56%) than wind power (82%) and solar (88%); • twice as many people think the government is right to subsidise wind power (60%) as think they are wrong to do so (26%). Another key aspect of the energy debate has been the cost of the levies applied to bills to support new renewable technologies. An unpublicised poll result from August 2011 showed that people are willing to pay an extra £3.64 a month on their energy bills to ensure their electricity comes primarily from renewables. That sum is more than double the amount they currently pay on their bills, but just £1 a month less than the government's estimated levy figure on consumer bills to support renewables in 2020. In contrast, consumers were willing to pay an average of £1.75 a month extra to ensure their electricity came primarily from nuclear power. The government's official independent advisers have pointed out that rises in global gas prices have caused 85% of the rise in bills since 2004. The new Guardian/ICM poll showed that support for building a nuclear power station near people's homes has fallen markedly since 2010, before the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Those favouring a new nuclear power station fell from 24% to 14%, with those opposed rising from 60% to 72%. Opinions concerning a new coal power station sited within five miles of British homes have, as with wind power, become significantly more polarised. Those strongly opposed strongly rose from 29% to 51%, while those strongly in favour rose from 3% to 12%. However, Devine-Wright warned against labelling those opposed to local energy developments as nimbys. \"Nimbyism is not a particularly helpful concept in the debate: it is a simplification and it is pejorative.\" He said there are many factors that result in opposition, including the size and type of the development, the identity of the developer, the degree of local involvement and whether the scheme has local environmental advantages. \"I think some of the developers are waking up to these factors, but mainly they are the smaller ones.\" • The ICM poll for the Guardian was based on the weighted responses of 1,013 British adults aged 18 and over. The Ipsos Mori poll which asked precisely the same question was conducted from 6 Jan to 26 Mar 2010 on 1,822 British adults aged 15 and over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/dec/18/tim-yeo-energy-bill-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-18T11:59:00Z","webTitle":"Tim Yeo energy bill speech: 'dash for gas would be a gamble'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/18/tim-yeo-energy-bill-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/dec/18/tim-yeo-energy-bill-speech","fields":{"headline":"Tim Yeo energy bill speech: 'dash for gas would be a gamble'","bodyText":"Two hundred and fifty years ago, Britain sparked the first industrial revolution. By harnessing the force of fossil fuels like coal, enterprising British engineers were able to deliver astounding innovations in industry and travel, creating huge wealth and prosperity as they forged the modern world. In the first half of the 20th century, Britain built the first integrated national electricity grid in the world, powering millions of homes and factories by connecting them to network of enormous coal burning power stations. Forward-thinking legislation had laid the framework for a cutting-edge nationwide electricity system that would be copied the world over. In the eighties, Britain led Europe in liberalising its energy markets by breaking up the out-dated nationalised utilities and introducing competition. The government created an electricity market that, for all its imperfections, still delivers cheaper energy prices than on much of the continent. In those days Britain was not afraid to lead. Now, in the 21st century, tremendous technological changes are again sweeping the world. Information technology and social media is revolutionising the way we do business and organise our lives. Exciting new energy technologies could bring equally radical changes to the way we power our homes and businesses. But instead of being out in front again, leading the green industrial revolution, Britain risks being left behind. Our competitors – China, Japan, Germany and the US – are pushing ahead on clean new technologies. Only last month, the UK fell from fifth to sixth place in the renewable energy attractiveness rankings globally. China is at the top and shows no signs of slowing down its low-carbon investment. When my committee visited China earlier this year we saw the incredible innovations they are making in this area first-hand. Its current five-year plan is reducing the carbon intensity of its economy, delivering a new climate law and introducing carbon trading. Germany – the industrial powerhouse of Europe – now gets 25% of electricity from solar, wind and biomass and has set a target to get 80% of its power from renewables by 2050. In Germany last year, there were around 380,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector, and this is expected to increase to 500,000 or 600,000 by 2030. By contrast, both the last UK government and the present one have been dithering and indecisive on energy and climate change policy. Despite a decade of chatter and promises not a single new nuclear power station has been started. Incentives for low-carbon renewables have been chopped and changed, sometimes with little warning. The step change in energy efficiency that even climate change skeptics support has been the subject of more rhetoric than action. Setting a target for emissions from electricity generation as recommended by the Climate Change Committee has been put off until 2016, prolonging the political and regulatory uncertainty that is killing investment. The choice we face The government's new energy bill presents parliament with an opportunity to put an end to this uncertainty and set the UK on course to become a true world leader in clean technology. Worryingly however, the chancellor's new gas strategy is being interpreted by some as being at odds with this aim. If this interpretation gains credence it could undermine the confidence of clean energy investors and make the government's commitments on climate change hard to fulfill. As chairman of the Commons Energy Committee, I think the choice facing Britain is clear. We can embrace the technology of the future, set a target to reduce our present heavy dependence on fossil fuels and upgrade our electricity system. Or we can cling to the combustion-based technologies of the past, gamble the future on assumptions about the availability of abundant cheap gas and slow down the process of decarbonising our economy. Britain must look forward, or risk getting left behind. The argument Lumbering the UK economy with a centralised power system largely reliant on gas, would be like running an office using a fax machine in the age of the iPad. Gas does have a significant role to play as we make the transition to a low-carbon economy, but it would be rash to bet the future on one fuel or energy source. It is time to upgrade our electricity system to 2.0 super-efficient solar cells, anaerobic digestion, wind power, new nuclear reactors, wave and tidal power and carbon capture and storage – these are the technologies of the future. Smart meters, new grid technology and increased interconnection across the continent will lead to a new \"energy internet\", decentralising electricity generation, giving consumers much more control of their use of energy, and empowering people and businesses, both large and small, to produce and sell electricity back to the grid themselves. The dynamic demand management allowed by these new technological developments will help to address the problem posed by increasing proportions of intermittent generation in the system, gradually reducing the amount of gas back-up that is needed. And, as wider deployment of low-carbon technologies enables economies of scale to be achieved, the up-front capital costs of many of these systems are expected to come down. In contrast, the dash for gas would be a gamble, because it is by no means certain that gas prices are going to come down. Let us be clear here. My committee was one of the first to call for Britain to exploit its shale gas reserves. Personally I welcome anything which reduces our growing dependence on imports. It is possible also that if the recoverable reserves are sufficiently large, we may be spared some of the effect of the likely upward pressure on the gas price. My committee is currently examining the impact that shale gas could have on energy markets. Abundant shale deposits in America have pushed US gas prices down, but it remains to be seen whether there are enough reserves in the UK and Europe for it to be a game-changer on this side of the Atlantic. A robust regulatory framework and a clear system of community benefit will also be needed to make fracking publicly acceptable and politically viable in a country like Britain where population density is much greater than in those parts of the US, where the most rapid expansion of shale gas development is occurring. In reality therefore, prudence suggests we should avoid staking the game on one particular energy technology. To be fair, DECC has ensured that the energy bill does not do this. It is designed to deliver a diverse energy mix that lowers carbon emissions. To put Britain at the forefront of this new industrial evolution however, the bill should be more ambitious and set a clean energy target to cut dependence on fossil fuels for electricity generation by 2030 – as the government's own independent climate advisers have recommended. Arguments against Some people believe that we should simply exploit the cheapest forms of energy available to us – regardless of the consequences in terms of climate change. They complain that: Low-carbon energy needs subsidies that increase bills. We should forget a target to phase out fossil fuels from electricity, because exploiting our gas reserves will bring gas prices crashing down. In answer to the clean energy skeptics: Financial support for low-carbon technologies is needed to accelerate their development and deliver the economies of scale that will bring costs down. What many forget is that these costs will not continue indefinitely. Giving these technologies a short-term boost will soon lead to costs coming down. The energy bill will provide guaranteed prices for low-carbon technologies, but the price given to future projects should come down over time as technology costs become more competitive. What is more, if we focus more on saving energy and cutting waste, then we can offset the cost of short-term green investment and rising fossil fuel prices. The argument that we should not set a target to clean up our electricity – and instead make a dash for gas – is short-sighted. Gas is a cleaner fuel than coal, so it does have a role to play in bringing down our emissions while we develop other forms of energy. But if all the 37GW of new gas-fired power stations envisaged by the government's new gas strategy are to operate at more than one-third of their capacity after 2030, without the application of carbon capture and storage, then Britain would wave good bye to any chance of meeting the carbon targets advocated by the Climate Change Committee. I hope CCS will be available in due course, but basing long-term policy on the assumption that it will be would be extremely risky. The Climate Change Act was passed – with the backing of nearly every MP in the House of Commons – to demonstrate British leadership in the international effort to avoid a global temperature rise of 2°C. Exceeding this rise is widely regarded as a dangerous potential tipping point for the climate. Although we are talking about seemingly abstract percentages, targets and degrees here, we must remember that the ultimate cost of failing to keep temperature rises below 2°C could be measured in floods, mass migration and economic disruption. And that it will be vastly more expensive to try to adapt to climate change later on. Investing in clean energy and climate change mitigation is likely to be the cheapest option in the long-run. If the energy bill does not set a target to decarbonise the electricity sector by 2030, then the UK may miss a big opportunity to create a low-carbon economy relatively cheaply. Because we are closing so many power stations, there is a need for at least 27GW new capacity between 2021 and 2030. Crucially, the cost of reducing carbon-intensity in the power sector is generally lower than doing so in many other sectors, so the cheapest way to tackle climate change is to clean up our electricity supply. Without a clear target in the bill to clean up the electricity sector, investors may lack sufficient confidence to deliver the huge sums needed to build the capacity needed. Setting a target for emissions from electricity generation has been put off until 2016, raising doubts about the depth of the government's commitment to accepting the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee. There is a danger that confusing and contradictory messages are being sent out by different parts of government – on the one hand backing a big new dash for gas, and on the other insisting that it can still cut carbon emissions. This is a problem because the more uncertainty there is about the future direction of energy policy, the higher the perceived risk will be for investors. This could push up the cost of capital, increasing electricity prices and could even potentially undermine our energy security if projects are pulled as a result. Conclusion We face a choice. We can either upgrade our energy system or we can stay largely dependent on fossil fuels. Shale gas seems to have seduced some in government into premature confidence that it is an energy panacea; a golden calf that can meet all of our energy needs cheaply and even revive lost manufacturing industries. But we must remember: the scale of recoverable reserves is not yet known and gas power stations are considerably more polluting than the cleanest forms of renewable energy currently available. The price of most fossil fuels, including gas, may continue rising as global energy demand increases and other countries like Japan and Germany turn their back on nuclear power. Gambling on gas could be costly. History will not look kindly on those who would have us fossilise our energy system by relying too heavily on gas. I will not stand by and watch the wrong decisions being made on energy policy. This legislation is far too important for Britain's future to get wrong. Today, on the eve of the first parliamentary debate on the energy bill, I am announcing that I will be seeking to amend the legislation to include an emissions target – that will clean up the power sector by 2030. This amendment will introduce a target range, that requires power plants to produce less than 100g of carbon dioxide per kWh of electricity. I believe that Britain should aspire to lead the world in energy reform again – just as we did when creating the national grid or privatising our energy utilities. The energy bill is an opportunity for us to create a world-leading, clean and advanced electricity system that is fit for the 21st century. But without a target to phase out fossil fuels, it may fail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2011/nov/04/corporations-powerful-tool-against-governments","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-04T17:05:25Z","webTitle":"Legal weapon gives corporations the edge on governments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/nov/04/corporations-powerful-tool-against-governments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2011/nov/04/corporations-powerful-tool-against-governments","fields":{"headline":"Legal weapon that gives corporations the edge on governments","bodyText":"Swedish energy giant Vattenfall will take advantage of an \"extraordinarily powerful legal tool\" now available to the world's corporations to sue the German government for phasing out nuclear power, it was confirmed this week. Vattenfall will demand compensation for the millions it says it has invested in factories in Germany that will be lost with the phase-out of nuclear power. If Vattenfall wins, the German government may have to pay up to €700m (£601m). The investor state dispute mechanism (ISDM) is also being used by Philip Morris to sue the Australian government over its plans to discourage smoking. And it could be used by investors in the event of a default by Greece on its sovereign debt. There is growing concern among legal experts and the countries hit by these legal cases that the investment regime, made up of a patchwork of bilateral investment treaties and multilateral agreements, favours corporations over the public interest, puts sovereignty at stake, is chronically lacking in transparency and accountability and has been mis-sold to many developing countries that only realise exactly what they have signed up for when they get sued. The amounts involved can be gigantic, and must come out of the taxpayer's pocket, even though the case may be heard in secret and the award never publicly disclosed. Dr Lauge Poulsen of the London School of Economics says a case brought against the Czech Republic led to more than $350m (£219m) in damages, \"which was equal to the entire health budget of the Czech government and effectively doubled the public sector deficit for that year. It is an extraordinarily powerful legal mechanism.\" \"It's safe to say the main object of these treaties is to protect investors, and so there is a bias in favour of the investor and against the regulating state,\" says Cambridge law professor Lorand Bartels. Stories are rife of developing countries that have signed bilateral investment treaties (BITs) containing the ISDM with no idea of the potential legal implications, though most cases are brought by corporations in the developed world against governments in the developing world. When Société Générale de Surveillance announced plans to sue Pakistan, for example, the attorney general was so unfamiliar with the ISDM he had to look it up on the internet. Randall Williams of the South African trade department talks candidly of taking up his position and reading the BIT with increasing horror. \"The BIT places all the obligations on the host state and it gives all the rights to the investor,\" he told an LSE audience in May. \"This highlights a problem in developing countries, that negotiators are not properly informed or capacitated to deal with such specialised agreements. In many instances I have come across negotiators who negotiate these agreements without the presence of a lawyer.\" In the last 15 years multinational corporations have increasingly recognised the potential of the ISDM, and this area of law – in which lawyers and arbitrators can command fees of $500 an hour and more – has seen a rapid expansion. A UN report in 2010 noted that 57% of all known cases have been brought in the last five years, with growing numbers of law firms opening large, dedicated sections. Now governments are increasingly concerned about the leverage the ISDM gives corporations public policy. In recent years cases have been brought against governments when they banned certain chemicals, revised their energy policy or tried to bring in more effective anti-smoking policies – and even against countries that defaulted on their debt. Corporations that have pursued this legal path include Philip Morris, Enron Creditors, Total, Mobil, Shell, Dow Chemical, Chevron, Siemens and Cargill. Australian politicians, due to vote next week on their plain packaging bill, have had to debate the bill under threat of a multimillion-dollar lawsuit from Philip Morris, for example. They announced earlier this year that they would no longer sign agreements containing the ISDM. In Greece, parallels have been drawn between the eurozone crisis and the Argentine default in 2001-2 where bondholders used the ISDM to bring $4bn claims against the Argentine government after it defaulted. It is thought by some that similar action may follow if if Greece defaults. Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, has long been a critic of the BIT system. She told the Guardian; \"In many cases, bilateral investment treaties seem to exist solely to protect and promote the private interests of multinational corporations over the public interest in host states – and as such, represent a significant threat to national sovereignty. \"It is scandalous that companies can make deals behind closed doors to undermine multilateral trade rules and secure the right to sue governments if they feel that regulations to safeguard the environment, workers' rights or social provisions in any way inhibit their activities.\" But Charles Brower, the judge described by one American law magazine as the world's \"busiest arbitrator\", argues that companies have a right, when a country has signed a BIT, to hold them to their legal obligations. He believes the system is a good one, \"although there have been some notoriously horrible decisions,\" and adds that \"no one is going to go into less developed countries without having certain legal protections.\" \"You know what offends me the most?\" says van Harten. \"It's that the whole system is based on the premise of getting taxpayers in developing countries to fork over huge amounts of money that they can't afford to big companies. Without that premise none of this would exist.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2011/jun/20/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-20T19:38:00Z","webTitle":"UK government's Fukushima crisis plan based on bigger leak than Chernobyl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jun/20/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2011/jun/20/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-japan","fields":{"headline":"UK government's Fukushima crisis plan based on bigger leak than Chernobyl","bodyText":"The British government made contingency plans at the height of the Fukushima nuclear crisis which anticipated a \"reasonable worst case scenario\" of the plant releasing more radiation than Chernobyl, new documents released to the Guardian show. The grim assessment was used to underpin plans by the British embassy in Tokyo to issue protective iodine pills to expats and visitors. It also prompted detailed plans by Cobra, the government's emergency committee, to scramble specialist teams to screen passengers returning from Japan at UK airports for radioactive contamination. The UK government's response to the unfolding crisis is revealed in documents prepared for Sir John Beddington, the chief scientist and chair of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), and released to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act. The 30 documents include advice from the National Nuclear Laboratory on damage to the plant, public safety assessments from the Health Protection Agency (HPA), computer models of the radioactive plume from Defra's Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network (Rimnet), and the worst case scenario that might unfold at the plant. A substantial number of documents were withheld on grounds that they contained \"information which, if disclosed, would adversely affect international relations,\" the government's civil contingencies team said. The earthquake and tsunami, which hit Japan in March, knocked out critical cooling systems at the Fukushima plant, prompting immediate fears that nuclear fuel in the reactors could melt through their pressure vessels and drop onto the concrete floor beneath, causing a \"corium explosion\" and a major release of radiation. There were similar concerns over hundreds of spent fuel rods packed into storage pools above the reactors. To avert nuclear meltdown, Japanese emergency teams worked frantically to rig up mobile power supplies and pump water into the reactors, while the storage ponds were doused with water from helicopters, military fire trucks and an enormous remote-controlled concrete pump. The documents reveal how the British government scrambled to build up a clear picture of the crisis and the danger it posed in the days and weeks after the earthquake struck. In the first week, advisers wrestled with conflicting information on the amount of spent fuel at the Fukushima site, but settled on a figure of 4,500 fuel rods in six ponds, or enough to power eight reactor cores. A separate fuel pond, known as the common pool, was \"full to the gunnels,\" one unnamed adviser wrote. A fear raised in one document was that spent fuel rods might overheat, melt and slump to the bottom of their storage pools where enough could gather to \"go critical\", that is, restart nuclear reactions. The likely result of that, the paper states, would be releases of fresh radioactive material, \"which could continue for some time\". In further statements, government advisers admitted insufficient expertise to work out how high an explosion might blast radioactive material, but warned that an explosion at one reactor or fuel pond could trigger a domino effect as other reactors and the spent fuel ponds became too dangerous to deal with. The \"reasonable worst case scenario\" envisaged ruptures at all three reactors in operation before the earthquake, and radiation leaks from six spent fuel ponds at the Fukushima site. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate estimated this would release 10% of the radioactive caesium-137 and iodine-131 in the cores and one third of the caesium-137 in the spent fuel ponds. Under that scenario, wind currents carried the plume directly towards Tokyo at a speed of five metres per second. Had the event happened, it could have released the equivalent of 9.92 million terabecquerels of radiation from iodine-131 into the open air, nearly double the 5.2 million terabecquerels released by the fire at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine in 1986. Even in this worst case scenario though, the accident was expected to cause less harm than Chernobyl, where the reactor's burning graphite core threw radioactive material high into the atmosphere, and local populations were not evacuated quickly or barred from consuming contaminated milk and other products. The documents show how seriously the risk to Britons in the Japanese capital Tokyo and Sendai, a major city 70 miles from the stricken plant, was taken. A week into the crisis, the British embassy distributed iodine pills as a contingency measure. Meanwhile, the HPA prepared advice to be published in case a major leak occurred. It explained what time the radioactive plume would reach either Tokyo or Sendai, depending on the wind direction and stated: \"When the Japanese authorities instruct you to shelter you should take the first dose, or if the UK government gives you additional information.\" On 25 March, two weeks after the tsunami struck, the government's emergency Cobra committee asked the HPA to draw up detailed plans to monitor air passengers for radioactive contamination as they arrived from Japan. The agency proposed monitoring all passengers if a major leak arose that could cause \"some health concern\", and limited monitoring to reassure the public at the government's request. HPA documents show it had a team ready to monitor passengers landing at Heathrow within 24 to 36 hours of Cobra's request. The agency expected to start passenger screening if a major radiation leak from the plant led to predicted doses of more than six milliseverts in people beyond the 80km exclusion zone. But the agency warned it would struggle to monitor all passengers arriving from Japan at more than two airports, even if it borrowed detectors from the Atomic Weapons Establishment in Berkshire. In April, the Fukushima incident was upgraded to a level seven, the maximum, on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale. According to Japan's Nuclear Safety Commission, the accident led to a release of radiation equivalent to 630,000 terabecquerels of iodine-131. That month, a joint paper to Sage from the Office of Nuclear Regulation, the Met Office, the HPA and Rimnet stated: \"The mechanism that could lead to a serious release remains unchanged, ie molten fuel coming into contact with the concrete base of a pond or reactor causing an explosion.\" Other papers prepared for Sage outline the possible long term impact of the accident, which could see restrictions on food supplies in place for years and some regions around the plant ruled permanently out of bounds. Workers at the site are still facing high radiation levels and contaminated waste water to keep three reactors and several ponds of spent fuel under control. Report lists safety flaws Protection added to Japan's nuclear plants after a 2002 review of tsunami risks fatally underestimated the hazards that emerged in the Fukushima disaster, the first independent assessment of the has found. A report published on Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency also found that: • Regulators had failed to review or approve the improved defences. • Accident plans could not cope with multiple plant failures. • Sites have no seismically robust buildings to shelter emergency teams. • Instruments essential to monitoring reactors were not sufficiently \"hardened\" against accidents • The risks of hydrogen explosions was underestimated. • There were \"dedicated and devoted\" workers available but in the crisis \"complicated structures and organisations\" resulted \"in delays in urgent decision making\". Launching a four-day ministerial summit on nuclear safety in Vienna, the IAEA's head, Yukiya Amano, urged a worldwide review of measures to prevent future disasters. But he added: \"Even the best safety standards are useless unless they are actually implemented.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/sep/14/nuclear-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-14T15:43:55Z","webTitle":"Without nuclear, the battle against global warming is as good as lost | Mark Lynas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/nuclear-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/sep/14/nuclear-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"Without nuclear, the battle against global warming is as good as lost","bodyText":"A madness is taking hold. In the same week as Arctic ice cover is recorded at its lowest ever extent, two major countries decide to reduce or eliminate their use of the only proven source of low-carbon power that can be deployed at sufficient scale to tackle our climate crisis. Japan plans to phase out nuclear entirely by 2030, its prime minister announced today. The French president has just revealed a plan to dramatically reduce the country's reliance on nuclear, which currently gives France some of the cleanest electricity in the world. Let me be very clear. Without nuclear, the battle against global warming is as good as lost. Even many greens now admit this in private moments. We are already witnessing the first signs of the collapse in the biosphere this entails – with the Arctic in full-scale meltdown, more solar radiation is being captured by the dark ocean surface, and the weather systems of the entire northern hemisphere are being thrown into chaos. With nuclear, there is a chance that global warming this century can be limited to 2C; without nuclear, I would guess we are heading for 4C or above. That will devastate ecosystems and societies worldwide on a scale which is unimaginable. Given the trauma the Japanese people have suffered since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March 2011, it is understandable that major questions are asked of domestic politicians. But we must never forget that Fukushima has killed no one. More people in Japan recently died from an E coli outbreak due to eating contaminated pickles. Scientists also agree there will never be an observable cancer increase in the Japanese population attributable to Fukushima. But in response to the nuclear shutdown, oil and gas imports to Japan have doubled, and carbon dioxide emissions soared by more than 60m tonnes. Any environmentalist who celebrates this outcome is not worthy of the name. Japan is already backing away from its own climate change targets. As a participant in the UN climate negotiations last year, I watched this happen. Under the 2009 Copenhagen accord, Japan pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 25% by 2020. The plan was to increase nuclear to half of national electricity in order to facilitate the carbon cuts, supported by an increase in renewables to 20% by 2030. To reach the same targets without nuclear is impossible; wind and solar combined meet barely 1% of electricity production today in Japan, and there is no way they can be deployed at sufficient scale to meet the gap. So the climate targets will be dropped, as Japan re-carbonises its economy. It is nothing short of insane that politicians around the world, under pressure from populations subjected to decades of anti-nuclear fearmongering by people who call themselves greens, are raising our collective risk of catastrophic climate change in order to eliminate the safest power source ever invented. More people die each day from coal pollution than have been killed by nuclear power in 50 years of operation, and that is even before factoring in the impact on global warming. That such populist irrationality should guide public policy in so many countries – and on such an important issue as energy – is nothing short of a disaster. All is not yet lost. 2030 is a long way away, and as Japan watches its heavy industry shut down and relocate offshore due to rising energy costs and supply shortages, there may be a rethink. France may decide to keep its nuclear stations as it watches Germany's much vaunted dash for solar dissolve in a cloud of coal smoke. But ultimately energy policy must be responsive to public opinion, and as long as people across the world get it so wrong on nuclear risk and continue to ignore the real and rising risks of climate change, the planet is in very serious trouble."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/22/isle-of-wight-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-22T11:25:58Z","webTitle":"Can the Isle of Wight start a power revolution?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/22/isle-of-wight-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/22/isle-of-wight-energy","fields":{"headline":"Can the Isle of Wight start a power revolution?","bodyText":"Energy minister John Hayes gets on the internet, clicks a mouse and instantly turns off the electricity being used to charge up an electric car 15 miles away. At the same time, he can shut down a fridge and a water heater in a house three miles away. History may record his activation this week of a rudimentary smart grid of two buildings on the Isle of Wight as the start of a power revolution which its advocates hope will spread across Britain and vastly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption. If the final pieces of a complex financial jigsaw can be put in place, then within 10 years the island can expect to have not only a smart grid to manage the energy used in tens of thousands of homes and businesses, but it could also be self-sufficient in renewable energy generated from waste, wind, solar and marine sources. The £300m initiative aims to turn the islanders from some of the heaviest to some of the lowest energy users in Europe. It comes via Ecoisland, a small, not-for-profit partnership of local environmentalists seeking to reduce emissions by generating renewable energy, backed by a group of giant technology companies including IBM, Cable and Wireless and Toshiba who want an ambitious testbed to roll out and develop their technology ahead of other regions. Together they are confident that the island of 130,000 people can be turned into one of the world's largest \"smart communities\" - using possibly 40% less electricity and paying \"significantly\" lower bills. The internet-based grid tested by Hayes at Cowes this week is central to the wider island plan of developing a variety of renewable energy systems. The island has some of the best tidal and solar power potential in Britain and there are plans for a waste to energy plant and an anaerobic digestor. But by managing energy demand, the companies believe they can effectively build a \"virtual\" power plant. They estimate that they can reduce peak capacity demand to 120MW from the present 176MW and also allow the islanders to trade and profit from real and \"saved\" energy electricity. \"It's not the size of the plan but its diversity which makes it so ambitious. It would be a living laboratory,\" says Andy Standford-Clark, IBM's chief technology officer for energy and utilities who is working with the Ecoisland to develop the system. Any surplus renewable energy generated would be exported, he says, and any energy saved by householders via the smart grid, could be traded as hypothetical negative energy, or \"negawatts\", to be converted into cash or benefit in kind. \"We'd probably start small, perhaps with 1,000 houses. We'd try a pilot for around a year. By 2020 we would hope to have enough 'kit' in place to make the island self-sufficient. We could probably be trading our first units of electricity within a year. People would be able to choose to participate or not. There would be no compulsion,\" says Stanford-Clark. The key to sustainability, say the companies, is to get the smart grid technology to manage renewables better. \"By their very nature, wind and solar power are intermittent and unpredictable with long periods when they produce little electricity followed by other spells when they can generate too much. This means that at times of peak demand, companies have little option but to use dirty coal or oil-fired power stations,\" says a spokesman for Toshiba. How exactly the smart grid managers would encourage people to switch consumption of electricity to different times of the day and night, has not been made public. But because the grid allows pinpoint monitoring of demand and supply, it is expected to involve a complex set of sticks and carrots, like raising electricity prices at some times and lowering it others to encourage people to use more or less during peaks and troughs of supply and demand. Hayes hailed the project as the \"most advanced sustainability project of its kind in the world\" and argued that the proposed smart grid system could help shift the debate over how the UK can best reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. \"We need to drive smart grids that are about getting more out of our energy assets so consumers pay less,\" he said. \"Too much of the debate has been focused on generation and not consumption – we must think more about demand management.\" • An erroneous reference to nuclear power in the quote by the Toshiba spokesman has been removed from this article."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/gallery/2011/mar/16/japan-earthquake-tsunami-nuclear-pictures","type":"gallery","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T11:48:00Z","webTitle":"Japan tsunami and nuclear crisis – in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/mar/16/japan-earthquake-tsunami-nuclear-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/gallery/2011/mar/16/japan-earthquake-tsunami-nuclear-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Japan tsunami and nuclear crisis – in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jun/13/french-finance-minister-pay-cap-moral-issue","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-13T22:16:30Z","webTitle":"French finance minister says cap on top pay is 'moral issue'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/13/french-finance-minister-pay-cap-moral-issue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jun/13/french-finance-minister-pay-cap-moral-issue","fields":{"headline":"French finance minister says cap on top pay is 'moral issue'","bodyText":"France's finance minister has declared a crusade against executive pay at state-controlled companies, describing a wage cap of €450,000 (£365,000) a year for bosses as a matter of \"justice and morality\". Pierre Moscovici said the pay squeeze would come into effect over the next two years and deliver on a campaign promise by France's new Socialist president, François Hollande, who sought to tap into widespread public anger over executive salary packages \"Earning €450,000 a year doesn't seem to me a deterrent if we want to have quality men and women at the head of our companies,\" said Moscovici. He added that the measure was needed to \"make state companies more ethical\" and respond to \"the demands of justice and transparency\" at a time of economic crisis. The government expects to publish a decree on the pay cap next month. Turning the screw on executives, it will then introduce a bill in parliament later in the year to address stock options, so-called \"golden parachute\" clauses and other components of executive salary packages. The limit will apply to all companies in which the state holds majority ownership, including the postal service, nuclear power giant Areva, electric utility EDF, railway company SNCF and public transport operator RATP. Hollande set clear limits on executive pay on the campaign trail, saying no executive at a state company should earn more than 20 times the lowest-paid worker's salary. Fewer than 20 executives currently have salaries over the limit, the finance ministry said. \"I'm convinced the strict salary framework at public companies will inspire the stabilisation of certain practices in the private sector,\" Moscovici said, promising that all salaries for top executives at state firms would now be made public. The UMP, the party of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, dismissed the cap as political posturing. \"It's a campaign promise. They're pretending to fix our problems by reducing executives' salaries.

Growing uncertainty over the state of the stricken reactor prompted the government to tell people living within a 12-19 mile (20-30km) radius of the plant to consider leaving their homes temporarily. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said 130,000 residents in the area had been encouraged to leave to improve their quality of life, not because their health was at risk. The nuclear emergency, 150 miles north of Tokyo, has caused severe disruption to business, supply routes and other services in the area. On Thursday, three workers were exposed to radiation after stepping in contaminated water in the turbine building of the No 3 reactor. They were trying to cool the crippled reactor when the accident occurred. \"The contaminated water had 10,000 times the amount of radiation as would be found in water circulating from a normally operating reactor,\" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency. \"It is possible that there is damage to the reactor.\" Two of the men received possible beta ray burns to their legs. All three have been transferred to a special radiation treatment facility. Edano said the source of the leak remained unknown. \"We are exploring every possibility, but we don't think this is a new situation, rather that a certain amount of radiation may have leaked from the reactor. This is a possibility that we have been mentioning for some time. \"But at this point we don't know if the radiation is coming from the reactor itself or from another source.\" Nuclear officials say the leak may have come from pipes or the reactor's pool for storing spent fuel rods, which workers have been struggling to cool off since the plant was badly damaged in the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. Officials were preparing themselves for the possibility that the reactor core was damaged in an explosion three days after the disaster that destroyed its containment building. The reactor contains 170 tonnes of radioactive fuel in its core, and is the only one of the facility's six reactors that contains the potentially more dangerous plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel. Thursday's accident forced a temporary halt to work on two reactors while technicians check radiation levels. \"We should try to avoid delays if at all possible, but we also need to ensure that the people working there are safe,\" Nishiyama said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2012/sep/07/bed-and-breakfast-somerset-watchet-swain-house-review","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-07T21:44:00Z","webTitle":"B&B review: Swain House, Watchet, Somerset","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/sep/07/bed-and-breakfast-somerset-watchet-swain-house-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2012/sep/07/bed-and-breakfast-somerset-watchet-swain-house-review","fields":{"headline":"B&B review: Swain House, Watchet, Somerset","bodyText":"As soon as I've slung the car into a parking spot, I'm following holidaymakers, beachbag-toting parents and children swathed in multicoloured towels, flip-flopping towards the harbour. Just as the marina comes into view, so does a big, green steam engine, heaving and sighing its way into Watchet station. You've probably heard of Minehead – home to Butlin's and a wide sandy beach – and also Hinkley Point, the nuclear power plant about 20 miles east of the resort, but you might not have come across Watchet. The pint-sized harbour town is poised on the rocky coastline between the two, the Bristol Channel ahead of it, Exmoor behind. The river Washford flows between cottages towards the sea, the heritage West Somerset Railway runs down to the port, which dates back 1,000 years, and the tiny main street is a Victorian gem. Get to the point … where's the B&amp;B? In the middle of that high street – an old shop, by the look of things. I ring the bell. Here's Jason Robinson at the door to let me in. He and his wife, Annie, discovered the town while searching for a wedding venue. Former creatives at Disney, they fell in love at work, and then with Watchet. On that wedding-plan trip they ended up buying a holiday house, then, when the old bric-a-brac shop next door came up for sale they bought that too. Jobs were chucked and renovation began just after last Christmas. This is their B&amp;B's first week in business. Jason tells me all this in the flagstoned \"shopfront\", perched at a wooden table large enough to seat all eight guests (so a place for sociable types). The vibe is industrial-luxe, the walls dark slate – a shade I liked a lot more before this washout summer – and at the far end is a fat (grey) sofa, cast-iron fireplace, a Mickey Mouse figure in a glass case and shelves of design books. As guest sitting rooms go, it's compact. I predict sunlounger-style sofa bagging at wine o'clock when all four rooms are full. These are on the first and second floors: larger rooms at the front, smaller ones overlooking pretty courtyard gardens at the back. My monochrome bedroom faces a quaint-looking chemist's over the street and has a dressing area and bathroom with slipper bath, walk-in shower and full-size REN products (but hey, REN, those smells are a decade old, it's time for something new). The only splash of colour is a picture wall, but attention to detail comes in spades. Water in a stoppered bottle, a tea tray has sugar tongs and muffins in a paper bag, the black wardrobe contains iron and board and the TV is subtly placed. The shower has a recessed shelf and, joy, controls I can reach before stepping under the shower head. Gripes? Dark roman blinds mean I have to choose between privacy or daylight, and the extractor fan goes on for ever. A quick blast up on to Exmoor, and dinner at The Culbone, a pub serving Brixham fish and moorland beef, then sleep. Mmm, bed's wonderful. Herby mushrooms and poached egg on toast, and fresh carrot and ginger juice go down very nicely in the morning. Never had breakfast sitting in a shop window before … gosh, the Quantock Pharmacy is busy. \"Wish you were here,\" I scribble in my notebook, thinking of London friends, because Swain House is a rather chilled place to be. • Accommodation was provided by Swain House.

Appearance: Sunny. Smiley. Resurgent. It does look familiar. Where have I seen it before? It's the logo, designed in 1975 by two activists in the Swedish Organisation for Information on Nuclear Power, that became a uniting symbol for anti-nuclear protesters everywhere. It was particularly popular in the 80s. Oh yes, I remember now! It's the one that wasn't the CND sign and it has \"Nuclear power – no thanks\" written under it in whatever language is most useful under the banner-waver's particular circs, yes? Yes/oui/si/ja/da/igen etc. Why am I seeing it again? Thousands of Germans have been sporting the logo while forming a 45km-long chain between Stuttgart and the Neckerwestheim nuclear plant in protest at government's plans to extend (again) the life of the country's nuclear reactors. Oh, honestly! Why are people so mindlessly against nuclear power? It's the only way to meet our increasingly gargantuan energy needs and it's the greenest of all providers! Split one little atom and the equivalent of hundreds of trees falls out, but you can use them without creating any CO2 at all. Hardly. And it's safe. Except when your country's hit by an earthquake of magnitude 8.9. I'll admit, the exposed reactor rods of the Fukushima plant probably aren't doing the pro-nuclear argument any favours right now . . . I kind of imagine them as two radioactive fingers being stuck up in the argument's face, actually Well, whatever. But the fact remains, actual danger from nuclear plants is rare. Even from Sellafield? What about Chernobyl? Ancient history. Things are, you know, much better now. The Thorpe plant leak five years ago? I wish your memory had a shorter half-life. The problem of disposing of radioactive waste – that's never really been solved yet, has it? \"Out of sight, out of mind\" has lasted down the ages for a reason, you know. It works.

Due to the Algerian crisis, the prime minister has been forced to delay it. But that makes little difference: much of the content is already known, and it is no surprise. He would like to stay in Europe, but only if British demands are met. Earlier, Cameron had bottled out of his crude plan to speak next Tuesday, on the 50th anniversary of the Elysée treaty that founded the EU and celebrated an end to a century of three Franco-German wars. The ineptitude of his diplomacy has not helped his cause. Country after country has warned against demanding special British opt-outs instead of negotiating change together for all. The Finns put it best: pick currants out of the bun and he'll come away only with crumbs. Blackmail won't work, said others. How could it when Cameron stands at the exit door with a gun pointed at his own head? They'll shout \"Shoot!\". His posturing provokes a rattling artillery of heavyweight opposition. Obama sent an emissary with a stern warning that the US needs Britain in Europe, or else the special relationship is a bridge to nowhere. That shot Liam Fox's fox, with his coterie advocating a virtual 51st state alternative to the EU. Nick Clegg and Vince Cable were bound to put the boot in, as were Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine. But the CBI's kicking was less expected: \"It's essential that we stay at the table to bang the drum for businesses and defend our national interest.\" Another knee to the groin came in a letter from 20 big beasts of business, including British Telecom, Sir Martin Sorrell and Sir Richard Branson, reprised this week in the FT. So who has Cameron pleased? Not even his own fruitcakes who want an in/out vote now: the Bruges Group damns his plan as \"deliberately disingenuous\". Which it is. Cameron's rash promise of an undeliverable \"new settlement\" may give him a brief mini-bounce, but Ben Page of Ipsos Mori says Europe – at around 3% – is nowhere a prime public concern. If asked, people say they want referendums, though in five years it's unknowable what they would be voting on or why. Peter Kellner of YouGov delivers a devastating analysis showing the fear factor already swinging voters away from the exit. Cameron may be making a monumental blunder, looking weak and opportunistic at the helm of a riven party, instead of decisive. To outsiders and to history his position will look intellectually incomprehensible. If he really wants to stay in, he risks voters using a mid-term 2018 referendum to take revenge, heading for the exit willy-nilly. Whatever the question, \"no\" will mean out. Anti-EU rhetoric sits oddly with Cameron's role as president of the G8 where he hopes to pull off an important EU-US trade deal that shows the value of operating as a block. How odd, too, that he should pick on the justice and home affairs brief, just because it's easy to quit as it's up for review – for most people the European arrest warrant to catch criminals and terrorists is one of the best reasons for EU co-ordination. A Labour MP reminded Cameron that 39 paedophiles have been sent back to the UK for trial. What about \"punching above our weight\", a Conservative creed? We waste billions on Trident pointlessly patrolling the seas to cling to an anachronistic UN security council seat, yet once outside the EU that seat would soon be gone. But most eccentric of all, why leave now when Europe is in the grip of German-led neoliberal austerity, a perfect political match for the policies of Cameron and George Osborne? That shows how the Tory dance on Europe takes them to another universe of fantasy politics. That's what the electorate in the real world, where jobs and growth determine their votes, will see. Take just one industry: construction. This week the National Audit Office delivered a stern warning about the lack of public funds for construction in energy, waste and rail: relying on private money will see consumers paying needlessly high prices for decades ahead – those very debts to our children Cameron and Osborne warn against in justifying their cuts. Construction lost another 60,000 jobs last year, with 20% public housing cuts, road building cuts, and government promises of investment from foreign sovereign wealth or pension funds nowhere to be seen. Simon Storer, of the Construction Products Association, speaks for the £50bn industry manufacturing bricks, tiles, aggregates and everything for building. Even the threat of leaving the EU fills him with alarm, at a time when government dithering on a south-east airport and nuclear power is already causing serious damage. His industries are heavy energy users, most foreign owned with no commitment to stay: Pilkington glass is Japanese, cement makers are French and Mexican, Worcester Bosch is German and so on. Would they stay if we left the EU? \"Absolute madness to risk it,\" he says. Neither EU working rights nor planning restrictions hold back his companies: \"It's money, pure and simple.\" State investment, not an EU exit, is needed to kick-start work – which could begin in a month if local authorities were handed cash to start road repairs now, leading to a virtuous circle of employment, taxes paid and benefits reduced. I first met Storer at a fringe meeting on construction at the Conservative conference, holding his head in his hands as a rightwing ideologue on the panel said the answer to roads was to rip out cycle and bus lanes and the answer to overcrowded rail was to make everyone stand. This frequent clash between the real world and the Conservatives' imaginary world is increasingly dawning on voters. Labour's grip on reality will look all the stronger as long as Tory Europhobia fires burn. The shadow cabinet discussion on Europe this week should, said a member, have been YouTubed as an exemplary sight of a party expecting to be in power seriously analysing Britain's future role. Labour has difficulties: refusing a referendum risks looking elitist and \"Westminster knows best\" in an anti-politician era. Immigration is feared. Of course the EU needs reform – along with a release from failed austerity squeezing the breath even out of German growth. Ed Miliband held pretty firm this week, refusing a meaningless referendum. He left the door open a crack: in these crisis days, who knows the state of the EU five years hence. But his refusal to flirt with a British exit should see statesmanship better rewarded than blowing with the breeze of public opinion that doesn't care that much anyway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/mar/18/science-policy1","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-18T15:24:00Z","webTitle":"The Big Bang Fair: a depressing vision of science and engineering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/mar/18/science-policy1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2013/mar/18/science-policy1","fields":{"headline":"The Big Bang Fair: a depressing vision of science and engineering","bodyText":"Sitting in the pub with some friends last year, one of them pulled out a toy submarine they'd picked up at a science education event. It was one of those squishy stress reliever things, and had BAE's logo on the side. BAE make a range of products, including real nuclear submarines, not just toys. And drones, fighter planes. That sort of thing. We passed it around the table, poking at it, slightly aghast. The very idea of a nuclear submarine stress reliever felt wrong, let alone that it was used to entice young people into careers in science and engineering. The education event in question was the Big Bang Fair, an annual event promoting science, engineering and maths careers to 7-19 year olds. It's the largest of its kind in the UK, with more than 50,000 visitors last year. Led by Engineering UK it's supported by a range of charities as well as the government and industrial sponsors including not only BAE but Shell, Thales, General Dynamics, Rolls-Royce, British Gas and E.ON (full list for 2013 on their site). As you might have spotted, some of these are quite expert in making some very serious bangs out of science and engineering. Rolls-Royce have the contract for Trident, for example. It's worth noting that sponsors have stalls at the event, it's not just about giving money. I've been haunted by that weird little nuclear sub toy. I'm also haunted by a meeting about public engagement with science and technology I attended last year, where someone high up in engineering education joked that working with BAE was like \"running an arms fair for kids\". I nearly walked out. I wish I had. It's not something to joke about. But a lot of people I respect are involved in the Big Bang Fair too. I wanted to see the 2013 event for myself. It's just finished a four-day run at the ExCeL centre in East London. I visited on Saturday, and this is my review. Let me first say what I liked, because there was a lot of good there. UCL's \"Laughter Lab\" and the University of Leeds' musical quarries stall were both charming. Unusual too, and clever. I had a brilliantly geeky chat with someone from the National Grid about pylons and adored CIWEM's simulated sewage and water management activities. GCHQ may have had to hide the details of their current work behind a stall largely rooted in the archives of Bletchley Park, but in doing so, managed to bring a bit of much-needed history of technology to the event. I was also impressed with the E.ON stall, whose staff seemed genuine and dedicated. The best bits were maybe the displays of work from kids themselves, and in that respect Big Bang differs from similar events like the Royal Society summer show, which tends to be more about what scientists have to say. Big Bang reflects something of the American idea of a science fair (in a good way, I thought). But it wasn't all good. Not by a long way. Admittedly, no squishy subs at the BAE stall this year. Instead they were showing off \"bedflex\", designed to help recovering amputees. Obviously it's great that arms manufacturers do work supporting the recovery of amputees, but it is only a very partial view on their much more diverse portfolio of products and seemed well, simply a bit crass as the only poster about their work. Otherwise, their space was largely games with their mascot robot (play online yourself) or highly decontextualised hands-on maths activities with jars of mints as prizes. Aside from being a distraction from the main focus of their work, I wondered more simply about the point of this stall. You could do all these activities at home. Saudi Aramco explained drilling for oil with an animation which made the process look like it was topped with a sparkly engagement ring. \"They have to use diamond because it's the only thing that can cut the rock.\" I mumbled that I thought it was a bit more complicated than that, before clocking a PR rep handing out guides on teaching petrochemicals to teenagers, stressing \"these are great to take into school too\". The woman I spoke to at the Shell space said she was studying primary education and had volunteered after they'd run science workshops as part of her course. Sellafield seemed to follow BAE in their \"do a puzzle, have a sweetie\" approach, literally sugar-coating their message with chocolates and sticks of rock to give out to visitors. Arguably, nuclear power has a positive message about energy futures to offer; why couldn't they trust young people with that? There were also lollipops from Heathrow and Kit Kats from Nestle, though the latter did relate to the exhibit. The National Grid had pens with flashing bulbs at the end. Other stalls had giveaway of Rubik cubes, yo-yos, logobug stickers, canvas bags, and lots and lots of leaflets. It never really shook the feel of a trade fair. Despite the spaces devoted to presenting kids' work, I felt we were being sold a very surface experience of industrialised science and engineering, not invited to meaningfully participate. It was a bit like we were shopping for science, in a rather dystopian mall. At the centre of the \"Energise\" section was a \"Green STEM\" node surrounded by the oil, gas and nuclear brands. The staff at Green STEM emphasised they were government funded, there to promote careers supporting a low carbon economy. They had leaflets inviting you to make a model of a wind farm, but it lacked specifics about how their message might (or might not) link to the energy companies there, or other members of the industry. I found it hard to shake the feeling that the stall served more than greenwash. At the very back of the fair was a stall from the Royal Academy of Engineering covered in \"engineers save lives\" badges and activities showing off the ways in which engineers could and are working to find practical solutions to some of humanity's biggest problems. It's a lovely message, one I wholeheartedly believe in. But there was an element of pathos about it. Last week, Stuart Parkinson from Scientists for Global Responsibility wrote that Big Bang presents a distorted view of the value of science. Beverley Gibbs, who researches science fairs at the University of Nottingham, replied that it wasn't really distorted at all, but nearer a mirror of what science and engineering really is. Except it didn't seem like a very clean mirror to me. Many stalls at the Big Bang Fair obfuscated or, at times, literally sugar-coated the truth. Moreover, education can be about more than what currently is, it can be about changing the status quo. Science and engineering education should invite young people to part of a global, multi-generational conversation about the world they want to build, not just the one they've been given. I think the logos of Shell and BAE should be on the floors of such exhibitions, but so should critics like Friends of the Earth and the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, along with academics, teachers, journalists and other voices which would help young people critique and contextualize all sides of the debate, and speak up for themselves. If we trust young people with the technologies of war and climate change, we should trust them with the associated politics too. They deserve honesty. Scientists and engineers should question whether this event is really something they're happy to be involved in, as should teachers and parents. Schoolchildren should feel patronised. We should all be worried that science and engineering education has such a limited view of itself. Because the Royal Academy of Engineering is right: Their members do save lives. And that is precisely why they shouldn't swaddle this vitally important message in the PR fluff of arms manufacturers and oil companies. Let's hope the 2014 event has more vision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/may/11/syria-russia-nuclear-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-11T17:15:14Z","webTitle":"Syria and Russia in talks on nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/11/syria-russia-nuclear-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/may/11/syria-russia-nuclear-talks","fields":{"headline":"Syria and Russia in talks on nuclear power","bodyText":"Syria and Russia have discussed nuclear energy co-operation as Moscow seeks to boost its position in a region dominated by the US, Israel's principal ally. Speaking after talks with Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said today that Russia could build reactors in Syria, but gave no further details. Assad told reporters they had discussed \"oil and gas co-operation, as well as constructing conventional or nuclear-powered electricity stations\". In 2007 Israel bombed what it claimed was a nuclear site in northern Syria – still the subject of an investigation by the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Syria said it was an ordinary military installation. Medvedev's two-day state visit to Damascus was the first by a Russian or Soviet president. The USSR was a strategic ally of Syria but the relationship cooled after the cold war ended. The visit came amid tensions over Israel's accusations that Syria has been transferring long-range Scud missiles to the Lebanese militia Hezbollah – a claim denied by the Syrian and Lebanese governments and the UN. In Israel, the office of President Shimon Peres said Medvedev had agreed to tell Assad that Israel had no intention of attacking its northern neighbour. The Russian president said he wanted the US to play a more active role in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Russia is a member of the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers and the only one not to shun contact with Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. \"In essence, the Middle East peace process has deteriorated,\" Medvedev said. \"The situation is very, very bad. It's time to do something.\" Assad said that \"incentives\" granted by \"superpowers\" to Israel encouraged it to evade the requirements of peace – an apparent reference to its annual $3bn of US aid. The Russian and Syrian leaders issued a joint call for a nuclear-free Middle East – a coded attack on Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal. \"Any other development will mean a regional and probably global catastrophe,\" Medvedev warned. Assad, a close ally of Iran, said: \"It is every country's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\" A Russian-built nuclear power station in Iran is due to start operating later this year. Russian officials made clear before the visit that no arms deals would be announced. Syria is rumoured to be interested in acquiring Russian-made Iskander surface-to-surface missiles, to which Israel would object. The warm reception for Medvedev contrasted with the chill in relations between Washington and Damascus after US president Barack Obama said last week he was renewing economic sanctions against Syria because it posed a threat to US interests. Obama accused Assad of \"supporting terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programmes and undermining US and international efforts with respect to the stabilisation and reconstruction of Iraq.\" The US Senate is also delaying the dispatch of a new ambassador to Syria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2012/apr/02/nuclear-dreams-economic-reality-blog","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-02T09:58:10Z","webTitle":"Nuclear industry dreams dashed by current economic reality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/apr/02/nuclear-dreams-economic-reality-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2012/apr/02/nuclear-dreams-economic-reality-blog","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear industry dreams dashed by current economic reality","bodyText":"The news that nuclear giants RWE and E.ON are dropping plans to build any new UK reactors has sent a toxic cloud not only over Wales, but over the nuclear industry itself. Of course, everyone knows nowadays, post-Chernobyl, post-Fukushima, that nuclear power plants are not really safe. Even if there are a few noisy die-hards, arguing that the resulting radiation is harmless, and that \"hardly anyone\" dies as a direct consequence of atomic meltdown, that old canard just won't wash any more. Other nuclear myths, though, have lingered on. Atomic energy, unveiled by Her Majesty with grand aplomb at Calder Hall half a century ago, still has a hi-tech glamour, an aura of somehow being \"the future\". The reality that atomic plants are basically steam engines staffed by thousands of casual workers who would otherwise be picking strawberries or digging up roads somehow never impinges. Perhaps one of the most shocking images post-Fukushima, was of unskilled workers hosing sea water on to the smouldering wreckage. Not here the calm, fatherly figures in their white lab-coats in front of consoles worthy of the Starship Enterprise. But there are solid, practical reasons why nuclear power relies on casual staff using dustpans and brushes to sweep up radioactive dust, or hoses to cool down spent fuel. Best of which is that it's cheaper. An enlightening fact about Fukushima, where the tsunami swept over the safety wall, was that at this point on the coast, the land is well above the level of any waves, tsunami or otherwise. It required considerable ingenuity to bulldoze the cliffs down to sea-level to construct a plant that was then potentially at risk. However, the plant operators knew that nuclear electricity is not actually \"too cheap to meter\", whatever Eisenhower may have said, and the additional cost of pumping seawater up to the top of the cliffs would have eaten into their bottom line. Hence, the small, if ever so slightly risky, strategy of situating the complex at sea-level. So the torpedo that has just been launched at the majestic British nuclear ship by the sneaky German energy corporations has hit the most vulnerable part of the nuclear industry - its economic credibility. Among the wreckage, the unpalatable fact is that the electricity produced is not economic and that the scheme has only been kept going by increasingly exotic public subsidies and finance packages (read sub-prime crisis). That's not even to mention other economic tricks the industry excels in, such as putting off decommissioning and waste disposal costs into a far distant future and hiving off its disaster and insurance liabilities by, er … basically, ignoring them. The promise of nuclear was that if its plants were expensive, surely, over time, industry costs would drop, both due to economies of scale and new technology, and that sooner or later, the electricity it produced would become commercial, rather than merely a useful by-product of plutonium enrichment. (The military dimension that even the official programme for Calder Hall acknowledged.) But even as rival energy technologies have dropped steadily in price, nuclear has done the reverse. Nowadays, a typical scheme involving multiple reactors on one site, puts you back $25bn! The money was not to be produced up-front, of course, but created by complex financial packages based on debt, not equity. The sums involved, the \"paper\" floating on the underlying asset – the nuclear complex – run into the trillions. Even well-run German multinationals have trouble coping with that, unaided by the state. And evidently, RWE and E.ON are sceptical about the long-term ability of the UK's \"here today, gone tomorrow\" coalition government to prop up their nuclear plans. • Martin Cohen is a writer on philosophy and social science issues, including green economics.

The test, which took place in the north-east of the country just before noon local time, could bring North Korea closer to developing a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a long-range missile and possibly bringing the west coast of the US within striking distance. The authorities in Pyongyang said scientists had set off a \"miniaturised\" nuclear device with a greater explosive force than those used in two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009. \"It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment,\" the KCNA announced. China joined the US, Japan, South Korea and other countries in condemning the test. China, whose patience with the unpredictable state appears to be wearing thin, summoned the North Korean ambassador and delivered a stern protest. The Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed\" to the test and urged the North to end its bellicose rhetoric and \"or acts that could worsen the situation, and return to the right course of dialogue and consultation as soon as possible\". Analysts said the test had embarrassed China, the North's only ally and its biggest aid donor. \"The test is hugely insulting to China, which now can be expected to follow through with threats to impose sanctions,\" Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies told Reuters. North Korea's diplomats blasted UN resolutions, calling on it to abandon its nuclear weapons programme, and blamed Washington for the \"gloomy\" prospects for denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. \"The US and their followers are sadly mistaken if they miscalculate [North Korea] would respect the entirely unreasonable resolutions against it. [North Korea] will never bow to any resolutions,\" Jon Yong-ryong, first secretary of North Korea's mission in Geneva, told the Conference on Disarmament. The agency said the test had been in response to \"outrageous\" US hostility that \"violently\" undermined the regime's right to peacefully launch satellites – a reference to the condemnation and tighter sanctions that greeted Pyongyang's successful rocket launch almost two months ago. Barack Obama said Tuesday's test was a highly provocative act that violated security council resolutions and posed a threat to US and international security. The US president called for \"further swift and credible action by the international community\" against North Korea. The test was also condemned by the UN general secretary, Ban Ki-moon, who said it was \"deplorable\" that Pyongyang had defied international calls to abandon it, adding that it was a \"clear and grave violation of the relevant UN security council resolutions\". William Hague, the UK foreign secretary, warned North Korea faced further isolation if it did not stop developing its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. Diplomats said the UN security council was convening an emergency meeting in response, although with so many sanctions in place against the regime after previous nuclear tests and rocket launches it is not clear what options remain open to the international community. The US, South Korea, Japan and European nations are expected to call for further sanctions. A UN body that monitors nuclear tests said earlier it had detected an \"unusual seismic event\" in North Korea. \"The event shows clear explosion-like characteristics and its location is roughly congruent with the 2006 and 2009 [North Korea] nuclear tests,\" said Tibor Tóth, the executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation in Vienna. The agency said it constituted \"a clear threat to international peace and security, and challenges efforts made to strengthen global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, in particular by ending nuclear testing\". Seismic activity had been picked up by the US geological survey and monitoring stations in South Korea. It appeared to be a more powerful blast than the North's two previous tests. Experts in South Korea, the US and Japan put the quake at magnitudes of between 4.7 and 5.2. Earthquakes of magnitude 3.9 and 4.5 respectively were detected in the North's 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. The US geological survey said Tuesday's seismic activity had been magnitude 4.9. The South Korean government raised its military alert level, while Japan was preparing to dispatch military aircraft to look for signs of atmospheric radiation. Tensions have been running high in the region since North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test in protest at fresh UN sanctions imposed after the regime successfully launched a satellite into orbit in mid-December. The North again raised the diplomatic stakes when its most powerful military body, the National Defence Commission, warned its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes were targeted at the US. Any progress the North makes in its missile and nuclear programmes is a cause for concern, although it is thought to be some way off having the ability to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to mount on a reliable long-range missile. North Korea has enough plutonium to build between four and eight nuclear weapons, according to Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear scientist who visited the country's main Yongbyon nuclear complex in 2010. Other reports suggest the country has enough fissile material for about a dozen plutonium warheads. In 2009, the regime said it would begin enriching uranium, giving it another means of building a nuclear arsenal. Speculation had been mounting that this third test could involve a uranium device – a clear signal that North Korea's scientists have mastered the ability to produce highly enriched uranium. In October 2012, a spokesman from the North's national defence commission told state media the country had built a missile capable of striking the US but did not provide further details. A missile featured in an April 2012 military parade appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile but its authenticity has not been verified by foreign experts. Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group in Seoul said: \"The question is whether things could spiral. I agree there should be some costs and consequences, but as far as believing the consequences should deter them – I think that's wishful thinking. \"The [North Koreans] view the world as hostile and menacing; and if even China is hostile, then even more so. Other people might think OK, they will be more cautious and have second thoughts because even China will take action. But, from their point of view, it reaffirms why they need [a nuclear programme]. When the world is like this, do you not want to be a nuclear power?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/12/japan-ministers-ignored-warnings-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-12T18:51:42Z","webTitle":"Japan ministers ignored safety warnings over nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/12/japan-ministers-ignored-warnings-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/12/japan-ministers-ignored-warnings-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Japan ministers ignored safety warnings over nuclear reactors","bodyText":"The timing of the near nuclear disaster at Fukushima Daiichi could not have been more appropriate. In only a few weeks the world will mark the 25th anniversary of the worst nuclear plant disaster ever to affect our planet – at Chernobyl in Ukraine. A major core meltdown released a deadly cloud of radioactive material over Europe and gave the name Chernobyl a terrible resonance. This weekend it is clear that the name Fukushima came perilously close to achieving a similar notoriety. However, the real embarrassment for the Japanese government is not so much the nature of the accident but the fact it was warned long ago about the risks it faced in building nuclear plants in areas of intense seismic activity. Several years ago, the seismologist Ishibashi Katsuhiko stated, specifically, that such an accident was highly likely to occur. Nuclear power plants in Japan have a \"fundamental vulnerability\" to major earthquakes, Katsuhiko said in 2007. The government, the power industry and the academic community had seriously underestimated the potential risks posed by major quakes. Katsuhiko, who is professor of urban safety at Kobe University, has highlighted three incidents at reactors between 2005 and 2007. Atomic plants at Onagawa, Shika and Kashiwazaki-Kariwa were all struck by earthquakes that triggered tremors stronger than those to which the reactor had been designed to survive. In the case of the incident at the Kushiwazaki reactor in northwestern Japan, a 6.8-scale earthquake on 16 July 2007 set off a fire that blazed for two hours and allowed radioactive water to leak from the plant. However, no action was taken in the wake of any of these incidents despite Katsuhiko's warning at the time that the nation's reactors had \"fatal flaws\" in their design. Japan is the world's third largest nuclear power user, with 53 reactors that provide 34.5% of its electricity, and there are plans to increase provision to 50% by 2030. Unfortunately its nuclear industry is bedevilled with controversy In 2002 the president of the country's largest power utility was forced to resign after he and other senior officials were suspected of falsifying plant safety records. Nor is the nature of its reactor planning inducing much comfort. The trouble is, says Katsuhiko, that Japan began building up its atomic energy system 40 years ago, when seismic activity in the country was comparatively low. This affected the designs of plants which were not built to robust enough standards, the seismologist argues. Since then, Japan has experienced more serious quakes as tension has built up on tectonic plates, culminating in Friday's devastating earthquake, the worst in Japan for more than 100 years. The result was an incident that came perilously close to triggering a nuclear meltdown. Starved of coolant, the reactor would have heated up dangerously until its fuel rods melted and released a cloud of highly radioactive material. Not surprisingly, the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced it is now urgently seeking details of what happened at Fukushima. The rest of the world – which includes many countries, including Britain, that are preparing significant nuclear expansion plans – will be looking very closely at what it finds. • This article was amended on 14 March 2011.

Chubu Electric had been asked to close the Hamaoka nuclear plant in Shizuoka prefecture, central Japan, which is thought to be the country's most vulnerable nuclear facility. The firm's executives agreed to halt the plant's working reactors as soon as possible at an emergency board meeting, according to Japanese media. Located 125 miles (200km) west of Tokyo, Hamaoka sits near a major fault line in a region which seismologists say has an 87% chance of an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher in the next 30 years. Fears are growing in the wake of the Fukushima crisis that another large quake and tsunami could cause radiation leaks that, depending on wind direction, could have a serious impact on the capital. The issue of the Hamaoka plant was raised as concern grew over a dramatic rise in the temperature inside a reactor building at Fukushima, scene of the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The temperature inside the pressure vessel of the No 3 reactor rose to 217C on Sunday evening from 163C on Saturday morning. But the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said that was still lower than the 286C observed during normal operations, adding that it would continue to monitor the unit. The No 3 reactor is of particular concern because it contains plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel – or Mox – and would release highly toxic plutonium in the event of a meltdown. Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, has bowed to pressure from the public and key scientific advisers and asked Chubu Electric to immediately shut down Hamaoka's two working reactors. A third reactor has been shut down for inspection and two others are being decommissioned. The plant is expected to remain closed while a tsunami-resistant wall is built and emergency backup generators installed to improve its ability to function after a natural disaster. Company officials estimate it will take two to three years to build a 12-metre-high tsunami wall stretching nearly a mile along the Pacific coast. At present the plant is protected by sand hills high enough to withstand an 8m tsunami. The waves that knocked out the power at Fukushima were at least 14m high. About 79,800 people live within a six-mile radius of the Hamaoka plant. Kan's order was not legally binding, but few expected Chubu Electric to resist, despite concerns that the closure of its only nuclear plant could cause power shortages in central Japan this summer. The three functioning reactors at Hamaoka, which supplies power to 16 million people, including the nearby headquarters of carmakers Toyota and Suzuki, account for more than 10% of its power supply. Chubu Electric estimates peak demand this summer will run at about 26m kW, with output at 30m kW provided the reactors are running. The firm is examining the possibility of boosting output from gas, oil and coal fired plants, as well as buying in power from other utilities. Chubu Electric's chairman, Toshio Mita, is in Qatar to discuss the possible provision of liquefied natural gas to help cover the shortfall. The government indicated over the weekend that Japan was committed to nuclear power, despite the Fukushima accident and growing public disquiet. Kan said the proposed Hamaoka shutdown was an exceptional case given its vulnerability to quake and tsunami damage. \"If an accident occurs at Hamaoka, it could have serious consequences,\" he said, adding that there were no plans to shut any more of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors. \"Our energy policy is to stick to nuclear power,\" Yoshito Sengoku, the deputy chief cabinet secretary, said. Tepco, meanwhile, appears to making progress in reaching its self-imposed deadline of between six and nine months to stabilise the Fukushima plant and achieve \"cold shutdown\". Workers could soon be able to enter the No 1 reactor building to install new cooling systems, the company said, after readings showed a drop in radiation levels. Contamination levels inside the building have fallen sufficiently to allow workers in protective clothing to enter for short periods, the country's nuclear safety agency said, adding that the doors to the building were opened Sunday night to promote ventilation. Workers entered early Monday morning to check radiation levels ahead of a decision on whether to proceed with work to install cooling systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/15/nuclear-earthquake-tsunami-energy-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T12:06:25Z","webTitle":"Fukushima blast shows nuclear is not the answer | Brahma Chellaney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/15/nuclear-earthquake-tsunami-energy-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/15/nuclear-earthquake-tsunami-energy-industry","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima blast shows nuclear is not the answer","bodyText":"The troubles of the Fukushima nuclear-power plant – and other reactors – in earthquake-hit Japan have dealt a severe blow to the global nuclear industry, a powerful cartel of less than a dozen major state-owned or state-guided firms that have been trumpeting a nuclear-power renaissance. But the risks that seaside reactors like Fukushima face from natural disasters are well-known. Indeed, they became evident six years ago, when the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 inundated India's second-largest nuclear complex, shutting down the Madras power station. Many nuclear-power plants are located along coastlines, because they are highly water-intensive. Yet natural disasters such as storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis are becoming more common, owing to climate change, which will also cause a rise in ocean levels, making seaside reactors even more vulnerable. For example, many nuclear-power plants located along the British coast are just a few metres above sea level. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew caused significant damage at the Turkey Point nuclear-power plant on Biscayne Bay, Florida, but, fortunately, not to any critical systems. All energy generators, including coal- and gas-fired plants, make major demands on water resources. But nuclear power requires even more. Light-water reactors (LWRs) like those at Fukushima, which use water as a primary coolant, produce most of the world's nuclear power. The huge quantities of local water that LWRs consume for their operations become hot-water outflows, which are pumped back into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Because reactors located inland put serious strain on local freshwater resources – including greater damage to plant life and fish – water-stressed countries that are not landlocked try to find suitable seashore sites. But, whether located inland or on a coast, nuclear power is vulnerable to the likely effects of climate change. As global warming brings about a rise in average temperatures and ocean levels, inland reactors will increasingly contribute to, and be affected by, water shortages. During the record-breaking 2003 heatwave in France, operations at 17 commercial nuclear reactors had to be scaled back or stopped because of rapidly rising temperatures in rivers and lakes. Spain's reactor at Santa María de Garoña was shut for a week in July 2006 after high temperatures were recorded in the Ebro river. Paradoxically, then, the very conditions that made it impossible for the nuclear industry to deliver full power in Europe in 2003 and 2006 created peak demand for electricity, as use of air-conditioning increased. During the 2003 heat wave, Électricité de France, which operates 58 reactors – the majority on ecologically sensitive rivers such as the Loire – was compelled to buy power from neighboring countries on the European spot market. The state-owned EDF, which normally exports power, ended up paying 10 times the price of domestic power, incurring a financial cost of €300m. Similarly, although the 2006 European heatwave was less intense, water and heat problems forced Germany, Spain, and France to take some nuclear power plants offline and reduce operations at others. Highlighting the vulnerability of nuclear power to environmental change or extreme-weather patterns, in 2006 plant operators in western Europe also secured exemptions from regulations that would have prevented them from discharging overheated water into natural ecosystems, affecting fisheries. France likes to showcase its nuclear power industry, which supplies 78% of the country's electricity. But such is the nuclear industry's water intensity that EDF withdraws up to 19bn cubic metres of water per year from rivers and lakes, or roughly half of France's total freshwater consumption. Freshwater scarcity is a growing international challenge, and the vast majority of countries are in no position to approve of such highly water-intensive inland-based energy systems. Nuclear plants located by the sea do not face similar problems in hot conditions, because ocean waters do not heat up anywhere near as rapidly as rivers or lakes. And, because they rely on seawater, they cause no freshwater scarcity. But as Japan's reactors have shown, coastal nuclear-power plants confront more serious dangers. When the Indian Ocean tsunami struck, the Madras reactor's core could be kept in safe shutdown condition because the electrical systems had been ingeniously installed on higher ground than the plant itself. And, unlike Fukushima, which bore a direct impact, Madras was far away from the epicenter of the earthquake that unleashed the tsunami. The central dilemma of nuclear power in an increasingly water-stressed world is that it is a water-guzzler, yet vulnerable to water. And, decades after Lewis L Strauss, chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Agency, claimed that nuclear power would become \"too cheap to meter\", the nuclear industry everywhere still subsists on government subsidies. While the appeal of nuclear power has declined considerably in the west, it has grown among the so-called \"nuclear newcomers\", which brings with it new challenges, including concerns about proliferation of nuclear weapons. Moreover, with nearly two-fifths of the world's population living within 100km of a coastline, finding suitable seaside sites for initiation or expansion of a nuclear-power programme is no longer easy. Fukushima is likely to stunt the appeal of nuclear power in a way similar to the accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979 did, not to mention the far more severe meltdown of the Chernobyl reactor in 1986. If the fallout from those incidents is a reliable guide, however, nuclear power's advocates will eventually be back.

For weeks after the meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant last March, Sasaki believed her brewing business had met the same fate as her hometown, Iitate. The farming village lies just outside the 20km (12-mile) evacuation zone surrounding the plant, but was evacuated two months after the accident after independent monitors discovered dangerously high levels of radiation there. Sasaki, along with 7,000 Iitate residents, left the home she shared with her husband, son and grandson, and said a quiet farewell to her brewery, restaurant and the fields where she once grew organic rice and vegetables. \"When I think about my old house, I get a headache and can't sleep,\" she said. \"I took out millions of yen in loans to build my old brewery and restaurant, and I was on the verge of paying them off when the accident happened. \"Then I had to borrow more money to open this place. Tokyo Electric Power [the operator of the plant] has paid me some compensation, but it's a drop in the ocean.\" Almost a year and half later, Iitate's residents, now scattered around the region in temporary shelters and private accommodation, still don't know when they will be able to make a permanent return, although many are now permitted to visit during daylight hours. The uncertainty, and boredom with life as a nuclear evacuee, drove Sasaki, 66, to resurrect her business making unrefined doburoku sake at her new premises just outside Fukushima city. Standing in her way was a web of red tape. Japan's brewing laws are weighted in favour of large-scale producers, and Sasaki had only been given permission to brew the doburoku, which requires a special license, after Iitate was granted special economic status in 2006. As soon as she was evacuated, she effectively lost her right to work. Under pressure from the Iitate council, the authorities compromised, and Sasaki began brewing again with the last batch of the village's rice harvest from 2010. Last year's crop was never harvested due to fears over radiation, but what little was left of the previous year's supply went towards the production of six large barrels of sake, with the final product going on sale in May. From this year, she will use rice grown by relatives living in another part of Fukushima prefecture. \"I made far less than I used to,\" she said. \"I used to sell huge amounts for New Year's celebrations, summer festivals and social events. But now my old neighbours are scattered all over the place.\" Sasaki has returned to her old routine of visiting her brewery three times a day to monitor the sake's temperature. But her enthusiasm is tempered with resentment at the hand the nuclear accident has dealt her and her family. She visited her former home last winter to find that the bath, sink and toilet had cracked irreparably, and layers of ice on the floor where water had leaked through the roof. There were signs that wild animals had invaded the property. \"I can't think about the future at all,\" she said when asked about official promises that parts of Iitate could be inhabitable within two years. But after word spread about her sake venture, Sasaki quickly found herself running out of stock as old neighbours and new customers indulged their love of her cloudy, slightly fizzy tipple. \"If this can help lift people's spirits even just a little, then I'm happy to do whatever I can to help.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/feb/17/sellafield-activity-nuclear-pollution-promise","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-17T12:18:08Z","webTitle":"Sellafield activity 'will ensure UK breaks nuclear pollution promise'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/17/sellafield-activity-nuclear-pollution-promise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/feb/17/sellafield-activity-nuclear-pollution-promise","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield activity 'will ensure UK breaks nuclear pollution promise'","bodyText":"Britain is on course to break an international agreement to reduce radioactive pollution of the seas, because of an increase in activity at the Sellafield nuclear site, according to a report from a campaign group that monitors the plant. Discharges of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plants at Sellafield, Cumbria, are set to double over the next few years because of a \"crash programme\" of reprocessing planned by the government's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). Critics say this would put the government in breach of its commitment to \"progressive and substantial reductions of discharges\" under the Oslo-Paris (Ospar) convention, which seeks to limit pollution of the north-east Atlantic. The convention's agreed aim is to bring levels of artificial radioactivity in the environment down to \"close to zero\" by 2020. Breaching the convention, which brings together 15 governments from across Europe, would be politically embarrassing for Britain and could expose ministers to legal action from other countries or environmental groups. Ospar's radioactive substances committee is due to meet on Monday in Monaco. The report, by anti-nuclear group Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment (Core), estimates that discharge of plutonium into the sea from Sellafield will rise from 120 gigabecquerels a year to more than 250. There will be similar increases in the levels of radioactive isotopes caesium-137 and cobalt-60 compared with the past five years, it says. Core's spokesman, Martin Forwood, accused the NDA of \"breathtaking complacency\" and demanded an end to reprocessing. \"Officialdom is sleepwalking towards a situation which, unless avoiding action is taken now, will see commitments broken and a further trashing of the marine environment courtesy of Sellafield reprocessing,\" he said. When Britain signed up to Ospar commitments on radioactive discharges in Portugal in 1998, the then deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said that it had shed the tag of \"dirty old man of Europe\". Now the country will regain the label, claimed Forwood. The NDA, however, insisted that it remains committed to \"full compliance\" with the Ospar convention. \"Sellafield discharges are well within authorisations and doses from discharges are very much below the legal limit,\" said an NDA spokesman. \"Increases in productivity will not, and cannot, be to the detriment of the environment. As such it is incorrect to suggest that the NDA will in any way prejudice our commitments to Ospar.\" But when questioned at a stakeholder meeting last year, the NDA admitted that it needed a \"contingency plan\" if it failed to meet Ospar obligations. One option was \"agree not to meet OSPAR deadline\", it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/12/japan-opens-fukushima-plant-journalists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-12T12:30:03Z","webTitle":"Japan's Fukushima plant opened to journalists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/12/japan-opens-fukushima-plant-journalists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/12/japan-opens-fukushima-plant-journalists","fields":{"headline":"Japan's Fukushima plant opened to journalists","bodyText":"Conditions inside the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan remain grim and shambolic eight months after the site was devastated by an earthquake and tsunami, according to the first journalists allowed inside since the disaster. Officials showed reporters around the plant for the first time since March when the natural disasters triggered a meltdown in three of the plant's reactors, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl 25 years ago. Martin Fackler, the New York Times' Tokyo bureau chief, said the site was strewn with piles of rubble virtually untouched since the tsunami struck. He said: \"There's debris all around where the reactors are – twisted metal, crumpled trucks, large water tanks that have been dented and bent. \"You can see that this stuff has been strewn around and it has not been picked up and it's been there for eight months. \"So I think that more than anything is a testament to how difficult a time they've had in trying to get those reactors under control.\" Radiation levels were still \"very high\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The visitors all wore full protective suits, double layers of gloves and plastic boot covers and hair nets, and carried respiration masks and radiation detectors, as the site remains highly radioactive. The tour was aimed to show that the situation at the plant was slowly improving. The Japanese authorities have previously denied media requests to visit the site, on the grounds that radiation levels were too high and it could hinder the clean-up operation. The reporters, mostly from the Japanese media, were accompanied by the environment minister, Goshi Hosono, who is in charge of the clean-up operation. They were not allowed near the reactor buildings. \"I think it's remarkable that we've come this far,\" Hosono said. \"The situation at the beginning was extremely severe. At least we can say we have overcome the worst.\" Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), which runs the plant, has succeeded in bringing down the temperatures at the three damaged reactors from levels considered dangerous. \"From the data at the plant that I have seen, there is no doubt that the reactors have been stabilised,\" Masao Yoshida, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant, told the reporters. But while it was now possible for workers to enter the reactor buildings, Yoshida said conditions for those working there remained dangerous. Tepco hopes to complete a \"cold shutdown\" – when temperatures are stable below boiling point – of the damaged reactors by the end of the year. But Hosono warned it could take more than 30 years to completely decommission the plant. Hiroaki Koide, a nuclear physicist at Kyoto University, said he doubted the decommissioning process will go as smoothly as the government hopes. He said pools for spent fuel remain highly volatile, and cleaning up the three reactor cores that melted down due to a failure of the cooling systems will be a huge challenge. \"Nobody knows where exactly the fuel is, or in what condition,\" he said. \"The reactors will have to be entombed in a sarcophagus, with metal plates inserted underneath to keep it watertight. But within 25 to 30 years, when the cement starts decaying, that will have to be entombed in another layer of cement. It's just like Russian Matryoshka dolls, one inside the other.\" Four of the six reactors at Fukushima were badly damaged by the tsunami. There were also explosions caused by a build-up of hydrogen gas. Large quantities of radioactive material also leaked into the surrounding countryside, prompting the government to declare a 12 mile no-entry zone that is likely to be in effect for years if not decades. Officials admit that about 80,000 evacuated residents may never be able to return home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/oct/31/fukushima-nuclear-plant-30-years-cleanup","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-31T08:14:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear plant could take 30 years to clean up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/31/fukushima-nuclear-plant-30-years-cleanup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/oct/31/fukushima-nuclear-plant-30-years-cleanup","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear plant could take 30 years to clean up","bodyText":"Experts in Japan have warned it could take more than 30 years to clean up the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. A panel set up by the country's nuclear energy commission said the severity of the accident meant it would take decades to remove melted fuel rods and decommission the plant, located 150 miles north of Tokyo. The commission called on the facility's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), to begin removing the fuel rods within 10 years. The damage to Fukushima is more difficult to repair than that sustained at Three Mile Island, where fuel removal began six years after an accident in 1979. Work to decommission four of Fukushima's six reactors could start this year if Tepco brings the plant to a safe state known as cold shutdown. The utility will begin by removing spent fuel from storage pools within three years of making the reactors safe, before beginning the more difficult task of removing melted fuel from the three reactors that suffered meltdown. While radiation emissions have dropped significantly since the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, workers continue to operate in highly dangerous conditions. Towns near Fukushima have responded cautiously to plans to build temporary storage sites for massive quantities of radioactive debris generated by the accident. Almost eight months after the start of the crisis the government says the facilities will not be ready for at least another three years. In the meantime, towns will have to store the contaminated waste locally, despite health concerns. To reach its target of halving radiation levels within two years the government will have to remove large quantities of soil. Scraping 4cm of topsoil from contaminated farmland in Fukushima prefecture would create more than 3m tonnes of waste, says the agriculture ministry, enough to fill 20 football stadiums. Once completed, the storage facilities would hold soil and other contaminated waste for up to 30 years, local reports said. \"We have been aiming to start cleaning up as soon as possible,\" Toshiaki Kusano, an official in Fukushima city, told Reuters. \"To do so we need to talk about where to store the waste, but we have not been able to answer the question residents are asking: how long it was going to stay there?\" Fukushima city, 35 miles from the nuclear plant, contained enough radioactive waste to fill 10 baseball stadiums, he said. The government has so far earmarked 220bn yen (£1.75bn) for decontamination work, with an additional 460bn yen requested for next year. But according to one estimate the operation could end up costing 1.5tn yen. Much of the early decontamination work has been performed by local authorities and volunteers, although neither has found a satisfactory means of storing the waste. The central government is not expected to take control of the cleanup operation until a decontamination law is passed in January. The decommissioning report was released as another government panel set up to determine the cause of the accident said it would invite opinions from three overseas experts early next year. The panel has already come under fire after it emerged that of the 340 people it has interviewed so far, not one was a politician involved in the handling of the crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/13/japan-fukushima-nuclear-power-station-explosion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-13T18:54:00Z","webTitle":"Japan's nuclear crisis: the causes and the risks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-fukushima-nuclear-power-station-explosion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-fukushima-nuclear-power-station-explosion","fields":{"headline":"Japan's nuclear crisis: the causes and the risks","bodyText":"What caused the nuclear crisis? Problems began when Friday's massive earthquake knocked out electricity at the Fukushima No 1 power station. Back-up generators kicked in to pump coolant around the reactor cores to prevent the fuel rods from overheating. The generators worked for a short time, but were damaged by the ensuing tsunami, forcing a scramble by engineers to fit mobile battery power units. These were insufficient to cool all of the reactors properly. Why did the building explode? The makeshift attempt to cool reactor 1 at the power station failed. Heat from the fuel rods in the reactor core led to a build-up of superheated water inside. On Saturday, engineers released water vapour – which contained radioactive caesium and iodine – from the pressure vessel as an emergency measure. Superheated water can split into hydrogen and oxygen, and it appears that hydrogen escaped during the venting procedure and exploded. What damage was caused? The blast tore the roof off the building and damaged surrounding walls. Four workers were injured. Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Authority that the explosion happened outside the reactor's primary containment vessel, which appears to be intact. What is the radiation risk? Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (Nisa) reported higher levels of radiation around the power station over the weekend and the presence of caesium-137 and iodine-131 in the air. These are radioactive isotopes produced in fission reactions. The isotopes were released when steam was vented from the reactor. Monitors around the site recorded a radiation level of 500 microSieverts per hour on Saturday afternoon, a quarter of the annual dose the general population is exposed to due to natural background radiation. The level of radiation at the power station's main gate fell on Sunday to a very low level of 3.2 microSieverts. Have people been exposed to radiation? At least nine people have tested positive for radiation exposure near Fukushima, but a Nisa official said that number could rise to between 70 and 160. Radioactivity can cause a variety of health problems, from a reddening of the skin and increased cancer risk to fatal radiation sickness. Health officials distributed potassium iodide pills, which protect against thyroid cancers, to residents near the power station. Those unable to leave were advised to limit their exposure by staying indoors and switching off air conditioning or wearing a protective mask if outside. Are the other reactors safe? On Sunday, engineers vented steam from reactor 3 and began pumping in sea water after its cooling system failed.Authorities said there was a risk of an explosion similar to that in reactor 1. Sea water was being readied to pump into reactor 2. A separate state of emergency was announced at the nearby Onagawa nuclear power station amid increased levels of radiation, but Japanese officials said this had been carried on the wind from Fukushima. When will the power station be safe? The strategy of pumping sea water into nuclear reactors is untested. It could take several days to bring the temperature and pressure of the reactor cores down to within safe limits. If the cooling fails, the reactors could overheat and cause a total meltdown of the radioactive fuel rods in the core. This would only lead to a major release of radiation if the reactor's containment vessel was breached. The Japanese authorities have classified the situation as a level 4 \"accident with local consequences\" on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.The scale runs from zero for a deviation in normal operations to seven for a major accident. The Three Mile Island incident in 1979 was a five and Chernobyl in 1986 was a seven on the scale."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/dec/20/white-cliffs-dover-buyout","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-20T19:52:59Z","webTitle":"White cliffs of Dover: locals repel buyout by the French","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/20/white-cliffs-dover-buyout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/dec/20/white-cliffs-dover-buyout","fields":{"headline":"White cliffs of Dover: locals repel buyout by the French","bodyText":"Dame Vera Lynn can relax. The white cliffs of Dover, the most famous symbol of Britain's indomitable wartime spirit, have been saved from the prospect of falling under French control. The Port of Dover, which has sat at the foot of the cliffs since 1606, will remain forever England after the government scrapped plans to sell it off to the highest bidder – rumoured to be the local authority of Calais. On Thursday thetransport minister Simon Burns bowed to public pressure and withdrew Dover from the auction, saving Europe's busiest passenger port – which handles 13 million passengers and 5m vehicles, including lorries carrying £50bn of goods a year – for the nation. The port had been destined for sale as part of the government's mass sell-off of trophy assets, including the UK's air traffic control system, the student loans company and the Tote bookmaker, to help cut the nation's record £1.1tn debt. The government had been hoping the port would fetch up to £290m for the Treasury but Burns withdrew the privatisation plans after warning that the scale of local opposition could jeopardise the sale price. \"The secretary of state also noted the strength of local opposition to the proposed sale and that this might create uncertainty about a sale at this time,\" Burns said in a letter explaining the decision. \"It is uncertain what price would be achieved in the current climate.\" More than 770 people and organisations had made formal representations opposing the sale, and more than 6,500 had signed three separate petitions against the privatisation of one of Britain's most well-known landmarks. It also noted that in a local parish vote that 97.5% of residents opposed the sale. The letter said key concerns were \"security, immigration and its historic significance\". In order to avoid the port falling into foreign hands some of the local residents had clubbed together to propose buying it for the community. More than 12,000 people have bought a £10 share in the People's Port Trust, which it said would see Dover \"owned by people who love our country\". The trust has a string of celebrity supporters – including Lynn, who made Dover famous with her second world war song The White Cliffs of Dover. Neil Wiggins, chairman of the trust, said he was \"very, very pleased\" with the decision that would \"ensure Dover remains forever England\". He said: \"If you don't own it, you can't control it or the border. Private equity foreign ownership is not good for the UK. \"If it is lost to private equity it can be bought and resold, and who will answer for the history? What will happen to the white cliffs in the nation's psyche?\" Dover's Conservative MP, Charlie Elphicke, said the town's \"magnificent victory\" saving the port for the nation was the \"best Christmas present the people of Dover could have\". He said: \"The port of Dover is the gateway to our nation and should be forever England as much as Stonehenge and Buckingham Palace. The whole community is absolutely delighted that it won't end up owned by the French or the Chinese or anyone else. \"Think of the port and the white cliffs and you think of freedom and victory over tyranny.\" However, the chief executive of the Port of Dover, Bob Goldfield, said local people would end up the biggest losers from the scrapping of the sale because it would have injected many millions of pounds into the community. Goldfield said privatisation would have seen local people collect a £10m windfall, a guarantee of £1m a year for five years and £20m worth of shares in the port. The port, which has been owned by Dover Harbour Board since it was formed by royal charter in 1606 by James I, needed to be privatised to fund its development. \"We're the busiest ferry port in Europe. At the end of the day we've got to be able to invest in infrastructure,\" he said. \"I'm surprised and disappointed, but life goes on.\" Goldfield said NM Rothschild, the investment bank the government appointed to advise it on the sale, had received \"a lot of interest\" from \"a lot of international money\" keen to buy it. Rumoured buyers included Pas-de-Calais, the French local authority that owns France's biggest port, 21 miles away across the Channel, far and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and US and European private equity firms. \"I can't name names, but it's all academic now anyway,\" Goldfield said. French conquest The French might have lost out at Dover, but the commercial invasion has been successful in Ipswich, Glasgow and pockets of central London. A host of British brands have fallen for that Gallic charm – or at least cash – the latest being Hamleys, which runs the world's biggest toy shop in Regent Street, London. Groupe Ludendo has just spent £60m buying the 250-year-old company, which has eight stores in the UK and outlets as far afield as Mumbai in India and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Other luxury brands in London, such as Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen, maker of the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress, are also at least half owned by the French – in their case the diversified conglomerate PPR. Another Paris-based luxury goods group, LVMH, spent £300m chasing off competition from local rival, Pernod Ricard,to secure control of Glenmorangie, one of the best-known single malt scotch whisky producers. And it is not just companies in the more glamorous parts of the economy that have opted to move ownership to the other side of the Channel. France Telecom, which already owned a stake in UK cable operator NTL, bought the UK mobile phone company Orange from Vodafone in 2000 for an eye-watering £25bn. And the nuclear power generator British Energy, based in East Kilbride near Glasgow, was bought three years ago for £12.5bn and subsumed into EDF Energy. The combined Anglo-French firm is now the UK's biggest producer of electricity and together the two companies provide power to a quarter of the country's population. Even more humble UK businesses, such as the East Anglia-based pharmaceutical maker, Fisons, have been acquired by the French, in this case Rhône-Poulenc. Ipswich may have fallen, but Dover remains defiant – for now.

But the towns of Okuma and Futaba, located in the shadow of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, have shown that civic life must go on, even in the wake of a major nuclear accident. In one of the more surreal episodes of world democracy, tens of thousands were eligible to vote on Sunday for regional assemblies and mayors in towns that have all but ceased to exist. Fukushima is the last of the three hardest-hit prefectures to go have gone to the polls since elections were postponed after the 11 March tsunami. Elections in Japan are usually characterised by early-morning speeches outside railway stations and last-ditch appeals for support from candidates perched atop campaign vehicles. Their faces, accompanied by pithy slogans, stare out from numerous billboards. But none of that was evident in the 11 cities, towns and villages that lie inside the 12-mile exclusion zone imposed around Fukushima Daiichi in March. Residents of Futaba and Okuma, which were electing mayors and assembly members on Sunday, have only been permitted brief visits home since the disaster to survey the damage and retrieve valuables and heirlooms. Of the 80,000 people evacuated from the no-go zone, 58,000 are reportedly living in other prefectures, creating a logistical nightmare for officials who have had to oversee candidacy applications in temporary offices far from the election battlegrounds. The absence of polling stations created a spike in the number of absentee ballots, forcing officials to extend the official campaign period by several days to give displaced residents time to size up the candidates and submit their ballot papers. The campaign has been dominated by the slow pace of decontamination efforts and financial aid for the tens of thousands of people whose lives have been put on hold since March. All of the parties and groups involved in the Fukushima assembly election said last month that they wanted nuclear power to be phased out. That degree of consensus may have kept voters away, however. As of 11am, the turnout was below 13%, according to Kyodo news agency. For as long as they remain uninhabitable and their residents dispersed, the future of the contaminated areas will be clouded by uncertainty. According to a recent poll by Fukushima University, 27% of people living in the Futaba district said they had no intention of returning home. More than half of those aged below 35 said they planned to stay away. That bodes ill for the area's survival, the Mainichi Shimbun said in a recent editorial: \"The results have demonstrated that many younger residents, who are supposed to play a key role in restoring their disaster-ravaged communities, have given up on returning to their neighbourhoods for fear of radiation contamination.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/may/13/lib-dems-nuclear-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-13T18:28:31Z","webTitle":"Lib Dems perform U-turn on nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/13/lib-dems-nuclear-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/may/13/lib-dems-nuclear-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dems perform U-turn on nuclear power","bodyText":"The Liberal Democrats have ditched one of their most distinctive election pledges and will approve a new generation of nuclear power stations, the new energy secretary, Chris Huhne, made clear today.

The chancellor's Christian Democratic Union party, or CDU, had ruled the region's state legislature for almost 58 years, but found itself on the wrong side of the nuclear debate following Fukushima. Even before the Japanese earthquake, the party was unpopular locally for sanctioning a multibillion euro project to build a railway station in Stuttgart. Support for the CDU slumped from 44.2% in the 2006 state election to 39%, according to official results. The state parliament's new leader would be Winfried Kretschmann, 62, a spiky-haired former science teacher. He is likely to become the Green party's first regional \"minister president\" after his party gained 25% of the vote; enough, when combined with the 23.1% for the centre-left Social Democratic party, to form a coalition. Minister presidents are powerful on a national as well as a regional level, because they have a vote in Germany's upper house, the Bundesrat, and can veto legislation. It would mark a historic win for the minority party, which polled 11.7% in Baden-Württemberg in 2006. Even when the Greens were in government in a coalition with Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats between 1998 and 2005, and had Joschka Fischer as foreign minister, the party never managed to win a regional \"Landtag\" election. \"We have written history,\" said Claudia Roth, joint leader of the Green party, speaking in Berlin after polls closed. Dressed head-to-toe in green, including glittery emerald ballet pumps, she said the result would have repercussions far beyond the borders of Baden-Württemberg. It was, she said, \"a resounding slap in the face\" for Merkel's coalition. Commentators have suggested that a dramatic CDU defeat makes Merkel's position untenable. It would be \"the beginning of the end\" for her, wrote one on Spiegel Online on Friday. Others suggest the leader known as Iron Angie will plough on until the general election in 2013. Also voting on Sunday was Rhineland-Palatinate state, where an ARD exit poll saw the Social Democrats retain power but only by agreeing to a coalition government with the Greens. The SPD fell 10 percentage points to 35.5%, while the Greens appeared to have more than trebled their vote, with 17%, according to the exit poll, and will send representatives to that regional parliament for the first time. The Christian Democrats are seen gaining 1.2% to 34%. But this did little to numb the pain in Baden-Württemberg; though the CDU did win more votes than any other single party, its preferred coalition partner, the pro-business Free Democratic party, performed abysmally. The FDP were at 5.3%, down from 10.7% in 2006. In Rheinland-Pfalz, the FDP failed to get the 5% minimum necessary to gain any seats in the state parliament. This poor showing poses difficult questions for the FDP's leader, the unpopular foreign minister Guido Westerwelle. It could also call into question the national CDU-FDP coalition in power since autumn 2009. Within half an hour of the first exit poll, Daniel Bahr, an FDP politician from Nordrhein-Westfalen, told ARD his party needed to consider a \"change of personnel\". The Green vote was helped by the argument in Germany over its 17 nuclear power plants, heightened by the Fukushima disaster. In the aftermath, Merkel performed an 180-degree policy change by announcing the closure of seven stations built before 1980. She also said she was committed to speeding up total withdrawal from nuclear power. This was six months after she had ignored public opinion by extending the life of the 17 plants by an average 12 years; in this, one of her most vociferous supporters was Baden-Württemberg's minister president, Stefan Mappus; he paid the price for his loyalty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2011/mar/31/double-standards-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-31T10:34:24Z","webTitle":"The double standards of green anti-nuclear opponents | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/mar/31/double-standards-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/mar/31/double-standards-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"The double standards of green anti-nuclear opponents","bodyText":"The accusations have been so lurid that I had to read my article again to reassure myself that I hadn't written the things that so many of my correspondents say I wrote. So, before I begin the counter-attack, here's what I didn't say about nuclear power. I did not claim that there is no alternative to atomic energy, or any such thing. Nor did I suggest that nuclear should replace renewables, or produce any higher proportion of our electricity than it does already. But I did point out that most of the countries that might abandon nuclear power are likely to replace it not with renewables but with fossil fuel, and that this is a major change for the worse. Environmentalist Mark Lynas has shown how phasing out planned nuclear programmes in a number of countries as a result of the Fukushima disaster could add another degree to global warming. Author and blogger Chris Goodall estimates that if the planned construction of new nuclear power stations in the UK stalls in response to the crisis, the result will be an increase of 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide for every year we delay. Replacing the current generation of nuclear power stations when they reach the end of their lives is a tough decision. So is not replacing them. Not replacing them is a decision to do one of two things: A. To switch to coal or gas, which means greatly increasing the rate of industrial deaths and injuries, levels of pollution and the impacts of climate change. B. To add even more weight to the burden that must be carried by renewables. Response A is far more likely, and appears to be taking place already: for example in Germany. Like most environmentalists, I want renewables to replace fossil fuel, but I realise we make the task even harder if they are also to replace nuclear power. I'm not saying, as many have claimed, that we should drop our concerns about economic growth, consumption, energy efficiency and the conservation of resources. Far from it. What I'm talking about is how we generate the electricity we will need. Given that, like most greens, I would like current transport and heating fuels to be replaced with low-carbon electricity, it's impossible to see, even with maximum possible energy savings, how the electricity supply can do anything other than grow. All the quantified studies I have seen, including those produced by environmental organisations, support this expectation. Ducking the challenge of how it should be produced is not an option. Nor have I changed my politics (and nor for that matter am I an undercover cop, a mass murderer, a eugenicist or, as one marvellous email suggested, \"the consort of the devil\"). In fact it's surprising how little the politics of energy supply change with the mass-generation technology we choose. Whether or not there is a nuclear component, we are talking about large corporations building infrastructure, generating electricity and feeding it into the grid. My suspicion of big business and my belief that it needs to be held to account remain unchanged. Nor is the Fukushima crisis anything other than horrible: dangerous, traumatic and disruptive. I'm urging perspective, not complacency. OK, that's the record-setting done. Now for the counter-attack. Here is a list of what I believe are the double-standards that some of us who have opposed nuclear power (I include myself in this) have used when arguing against it. Double standard one: deaths and injuries We rightly lament the horrible consequences of industrial exposure to radiation. Two workers at Fukushima have so far received radiation burns and 17 have been exposed to levels of radiation considered unsafe. This is and should be a cause for serious concern. It is also worth remembering that no one has yet received a dose of radiation that is known to be lethal as a result of the Fukushima disaster. But if we are concerned about industrial injuries, why do we say nothing about the deaths and injuries in the industry most likely to replace nuclear power? In China alone, the government estimates that 2,433 people died in coal-mining accidents last year. That's not injuries or exposures. It's deaths. Human rights activists believe that official figures might have been underestimated by a factor of four. What this means is that, in the normal course of operations, at least six people are killed in Chinese coal mines every day. Even if you accept the official figure, Chinese coal mining alone kills as many people every week as the worst nuclear power accident in history – the Chernobyl explosion – has done in 25 years. And this is to say nothing of the far larger number of injuries that coal mining inflicts, in particular the hideous lung diseases which plague so many miners and cause long, lingering and terrible deaths. When was the last time you heard an anti-nuclear campaigner drawing attention to this daily carnage? Double standard two: the science We emphasise, when debating climate change, the importance of the scientific consensus, and reliance on solid, peer-reviewed studies. But as soon as we start discussing the dangers of low-level radiation, we abandon that and endorse the pseudo-scientific gibberish of a motley collection of cranks and quacks, who appear to have begun with the assumption that it must be killing thousands of people every year, and retrofitted the evidence to match it. Such people exist in every field, especially those that are politically contentious. We should, by now, have learned to be wary of them. But it seems that the temptation, for people hoping to make the case against nuclear power, is overwhelming. For a good summary of the scientific consensus on the effects of exposure to both high and low levels of radiation, see the new post by Chris Goodall and Mark Lynas: two environmentalists who have kept their heads in this crisis. Double standard three: radioactive pollution If low-level radiation really was the problem that some environmentalists say it is, the focus of their campaign should be coal plants, not nuclear power. As Scientific American notes: \"The fly ash emitted by a power plant – a by-product from burning coal for electricity – carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy.\" This is because coal contains trace amounts of uranium and thorium, which are concentrated in the ash. Not only does this expose people living around coal plants to higher doses of radiation than people living around nuclear plants; but the regulations for disposing of fly ash are far weaker than the regulations for disposing of low-level nuclear waste. You may remember the controversy about RWE npower's plan to dump the fly ash from Didcot power station into a lake between the villages of Radley and Abingdon. Where were the anti-nuclear campaigners then? Can you imagine what the outcry would have been if a corporation had planned to fill it with low-level waste from a nuclear plant? Double standard four: mining impact Anti-nuclear campaigners emphasise the damage and pollution inflicted by uranium mines. They are right to do so. Some of these mines are hideous, and they are one of the many reasons why we should urgently develop new reactor technologies which sharply reduce the need for fresh supplies. But the impacts of coal mining are massively greater. There are hundreds of times more coal mines than uranium mines, including opencast sites, and a lot of them of them are many times bigger and more destructive than the largest uranium operations. This doesn't make uranium mining right, but it makes the likely switch to coal even more wrong. Double standard five: costs One of the most frequent arguments against nuclear power is that it costs too much. Many environmentalists claim that, when all the hidden costs, especially the massive decommissioning liabilities, are taken into account, electricity from atomic plants could cost as much as 5p per kilowatt hour or even more. The highest figure I have come across was the top end of the range of estimates produced by the New Economics Foundation – 8.3p. If this is correct – and I should emphasise that it's an extreme outlier – it suggests that nuclear is an extravagant means of generating low-carbon electricity. So why do the same people support a feed-in tariff scheme under which we pay 41p per kilowatt hour for rooftop solar electricity? Double standard six: research Last week I argued about these issues with Caroline Lucas. She is one of my heroes, and the best thing to have happened to parliament since time immemorial. But this doesn't mean that she can't be wildly illogical when she chooses. When I raised the issue of the feed-in tariff, she pointed out that the difference between subsidising nuclear power and subsidising solar power is that nuclear is a mature technology and solar is not. In that case, I asked, would she support research into thorium reactors, which could provide a much safer and cheaper means of producing nuclear power? No, she told me, because thorium reactors are not a proven technology. Words fail me. Double standard seven: timing Anti-nuclear campaigners point out that it takes 10 years or so to build a new nuclear power station, and we haven't got that long, if we are serious about preventing climate breakdown. They are of course quite right: it's too little, too late. But the same problem affects every significant move to decarbonise the energy supply. By the time it has gone through the planning process, a major new grid connection to support an offshore windfarm will take roughly as long to develop as a new nuclear power station. The same goes for the pumped storage facilities required to support a largely renewable power system and for the carbon capture and storage required to reduce the impacts of fossil fuels. As for growing trees … My point is that we have to take responsibility for every component of our energy supply and the consequences it carries; not just the section of it that's produced by nuclear reactors. And we should apply the same standards to all generating technologies. Otherwise, in the name of reducing risks to people and the planet, we will unwittingly increase them. www.monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/feb/02/floods-disaster-waiting-to-happen","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-02T09:00:26Z","webTitle":"Floods: a disaster waiting to happen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/02/floods-disaster-waiting-to-happen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/feb/02/floods-disaster-waiting-to-happen","fields":{"headline":"Floods: a disaster waiting to happen","bodyText":"On the night of 31 January 1953, a high tide was expected, but what came with it was something no one had predicted. A storm was gathering over the North Sea, with low atmospheric pressure sucking up the waves, raising the sea level dramatically, and high winds whipping the waves to fury. When it hit the UK's east coast, the waters broke high over seawalls and surged as far as 10 miles inland. There was no warning and, with primitive communications, little ability to tell people of the danger when it became apparent. Sixty years on, survivors of that night remember the events vividly. Jenifer Baker was at her ninth birthday party when the mother of one of the guests came running in. \"She said, 'The water's knee deep at Chapel Corner.' We didn't know what was going on. Then someone said, 'There's water coming through the letterbox.'\" The children were packed up the stairs, watching the flood advance step by step until it nearly reached the top, while the adults gathered the remains of the party food. \"We were allowed only one spoonful of blancmange each because they didn't know how long it would have to last.\" Pamela Burton was 15, an usherette at the Savoy cinema near the seafront at Sutton-on-Sea in Lincolnshire. It was a Saturday and the Savoy was crammed with excited children eager for the afternoon show. At about 5pm, she remembers, water started pouring in. She and the other older children started moving the younger ones from the stalls. \"We got the little ones and gave them piggybacks. We took them all up to the balcony and watched the water coming in below.\" There they had to stay until 3.30 the next morning, when boats, lorries and amphibious vehicles came to rescue them. Outside the cinema was a scene of devastation. One house had been split in half. \"I watched a chalet floating past. I'll never forget it.\" For the children of Sutton, it felt like an adventure, but the adults were desperately trying to save their neighbours. Opposite Gordon Brooks's house, in the village of Mablethorpe, an elderly couple died, trapped in their home. Others were crushed by debris or swept away and drowned. A family of seven, including an infant, all perished in one house, recalls John Monk. A woman carrying her newborn opened the door of her house to be rescued, only to have the baby snatched from her arms by the rising waters. When rescuers came – police, the army and American airmen from a nearby base – they could tell where the roads were only by the tops of the telegraph poles. They commandeered what boats and lorries they could, and took children to safety first. Monk, then aged five, was taken away clutching his teddy bear. \"I remember the sound of the wind and the waves,\" he says. \"It was so loud, howling. You've never heard anything like it.\" Around the UK, 307 people were killed that night. It was one of the country's worst peacetime disasters. Holland suffered far worse, with more than 1,800 dead. Thousands of people were displaced for many months – Baker remembers having Christmas dinner upstairs that year because the ground floor was still uninhabitable. The loss of life and destruction, which in today's terms cost billions of pounds to repair, were a lesson the government of the day vowed to learn. Could it happen again? It very nearly did, just five years ago. In November 2007, low pressure over the North Sea and high winds coincided with peak high tides. Thousands of people were evacuated and the seawalls were breached in dozens of places along the East Anglian coast. Barbara Young, chief executive of the Environment Agency at the time, described how narrow the escape had been: \"The flooding event in East Anglia came within a whisker of widespread flooding, with tides in Great Yarmouth the highest since 1953.\" Only luck saved us from a disaster. \"We dodged a bullet in 2007,\" admits Richard Benyon, the minister with responsibility for flooding. Since then, the country has seen more deluges, from the 2009 torrents in Cockermouth to last year's flash floods that struck all over the UK from Yorkshire to Devon, Wales to the Tyne, and that overwhelmed more than 8,000 homes and businesses after one of the wettest years on record. The warning is very clear – another flood as serious as 1953 is not only possible, but likely. Flooding is the UK's second highest natural disaster risk, after a flu pandemic, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In the next two decades, more than 600,000 homes will be at serious risk. Yet last year spending on new flood defences fell to £259m from £354m. Lord Krebs, a government adviser on climate change, warns that the gap between what needs to be spent and what is being spent is approaching £1bn. Just as alarming are the failures of the UK's commercial sector to face up to our increased flooding risk. Today's infrastructure – power grids, water and sewage pipes, mobile phone masts, roads and railways – is more complex than ever, and we are more reliant on it. In 2007, nearly half a million people were left without drinking water for days and more than 50,000 without electricity as water networks were overwhelmed and an electricity substation at Castle Mead nearly inundated. We know that flooding devastates. We know that, due to climate change, flooding is more likely than ever. So why are we doing so badly? The Met Office in Exeter operates one of the world's foremost research centres on climate change, running complex computer models to predict the consequences of global warming. Vicky Pope, a founding member of the centre, is quite clear on the likely impact on the UK's weather. \"Flooding is the real risk. We are seeing rainfall patterns changing, heavier rainfall coming in strong bursts.\" Coastal storm surges are also an increased risk. Sea level rises mean waves are more likely to breach sea defences. As we warm the Earth, we are, in effect, putting more energy into the atmosphere. That makes storms more powerful, and may make them more frequent. \"Floods that occur once in 100 years on the UK's east coast today may happen once every 10 years by the end of the century,\" the Met Office has warned. As Superstorm Sandy proved in New York last year, when such powerful tempests strike major cities, their destructive power is immense. Sandy is estimated to have cost $80bn. When our modern infrastructure falters, social chaos and breakdown can soon follow – as was vividly demonstrated after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. An often-quoted estimate is that we are just four foodless days away from anarchy, and a few days of electricity blackout away from widespread looting. That makes it even more vital to ensure that our essential infrastructure is resilient to the floods we know are going to hit us. In 2007, the lack of contingency plans for the water networks meant the army had to be called in to distribute bottled water and beer tankers pressed into service to carry water. Acting under emergency conditions in this way is stressful and very expensive. Yet little seems to have changed in the past five years. \"There is not yet a lot of tangible action,\" says Krebs, author of last year's Committee on Climate Change report. \"There needs to be partnership on this between the public and private sector.\" Brian Collins, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, is an expert on infrastructure. He is quite clear that the UK is in serious danger of losing vital services to flooding, with potentially disastrous consequences. \"There is no obligation on companies to protect this infrastructure against flooding,\" he says. \"Companies can choose not to.\" The Environment Agency insists that it is taking action, with \"local resilience forums\" that bring together emergency services, infrastructure providers and local government. But Collins is sceptical: \"Utilities have to produce contingency plans for how they would continue in a crisis, but these do not include having to build in resilience to flooding. They should do. That should be part of the regulation.\" But there is evidence that the coalition is pulling back from stricter regulation. Sebastian Catovsky, an expert on adapting to the effects of global warming, at the Committee on Climate Change, says the obligation for key infrastructure companies to set out reports on the risks they face and how they plan to deal with them is being downgraded to a voluntary measure. \"With a voluntary approach, you have no stick to ensure the companies are looking at this.\" In 1953, atomic power was still in its infancy. Today, there are nine nuclear power stations around the UK's coastline, and plans for up to twice as many. Flooding is one of the most serious hazards for nuclear plants, as Fukushima in Japan demonstrated. Greenpeace commissioned a report from Colin Green, of the flood hazard research centre at Middlesex University, into Hinkley Point, likely to be the site of the first new nuclear plant to be built in the UK for decades. It concluded: \"From a flood risk management perspective, Hinkley Point is not an ideal site for a nuclear power station; the material presented by EDF is inadequate; and it is not possible, on the basis of the material presented, to reach a rational decision as to whether Hinkley Point can be made to work from a flood risk management perspective.\" EDF says it has thoroughly examined all the risks and that the plans are watertight. It is the infrastructure companies themselves that will ultimately suffer when their assets are damaged by adverse weather. They ought to have a vested interest in protecting their investments. But so far the power companies, water utilities and railways have failed to do so, according to Collins. The reason? Privatisation. \"All these services used to be in public hands, but when you privatise them you turn them into companies that put profit first – that is what companies do. But markets do not handle extreme events very well.\" Protecting against flooding requires large upfront investments. For instance, shoring up railways to prevent the ballast under the tracks from being swept away is a mammoth job, costing millions. In the face of that upfront cost, waiting until the flooding happens, then repairing it afterwards can look more attractive. But that does not take into account the knock-on costs to the country in the travel disruption this creates. Collins wants government to take a longer-term view. He points to the Thames Barrier. A direct response to the floods of 1953, the Thames Barrier was one of the single biggest civil engineering projects ever undertaken in the UK. Two decades in planning, 10 years in construction, it cost more than £500m when it was opened in 1984. According to Collins, it should continue to protect London adequately for several decades, perhaps to 2050. But the existing barrier took 30 years to put in place. He believes work should be starting now on a possible addition or replacement. Another key area for government is planning permission, stopping people and companies from building in high-risk areas. Yet there are few constraints. In fact, the Commmitttee on Climate Change found that not only are we continuing to build homes on flood plains, but we are building them faster than ever. This is putting more and more people at risk of the sort of misery retired architect Jeff Clarke suffered when his Tewkesbury home flooded in 2007. It was the loss of his childhood encyclopedia that brought home the heartbreak. \"It was given to me by my Welsh grandmother, and she'd written in it 'To Jeffrey on his fourth birthday'. As a book, it wasn't worth tuppence, but I'd had it all these years. It's silly little things like that that make you feel your loss.\" He remembers having to throw away his crockery. \"They insisted we destroy it, as it couldn't be decontaminated of the pollution\" – a polite way of saying that the tea service had been covered in sewage. That is one of the dirty secrets of flooding in Britain. While images of flooding are often quite jolly – men wading down the high street, kids getting a kayak to school – what you don't see is that the muddy waters invading these houses are filled with sewage. The smell alone is hard to forget, according to survivors. \"The whole experience was absolutely devastating,\" Clarke says. It took him nearly a year to make his house habitable again. Insurers ought to be key players in protecting against these catastrophes. But here, too, the story is one of failure. The recent spate of flood disasters, from 2007 on, has spooked the major insurance companies. They are now threatening to break with the \"gentlemen's agreement\" that has operated since 1961, under which all UK householders – or at least those whose homes were built before 2009 – are guaranteed access to flood insurance even if they are at serious risk. That agreement with government will run out in June and as yet there is nothing to replace it. Benyon, whose responsibility for the issue has been subsumed by the Cabinet Office, will say little except that progress is expected \"soon\". The Association of British Insurers is less confident, however. A spokeswoman for the ABI showed how badly the talks have broken down, saying: \"If you find out anything from the government, do let us know, because they're telling us nothing.\" In the absence of information, more than 200,000 households are in limbo, not knowing whether they will be insured after June. It is possible to protect houses against flooding with simple measures such as airbrick covers and sandbags. Clarke has installed a system of guards that can be slotted in place around his home: \"It's very effective.\" But most people in flood-prone areas are failing to do anything to protect their homes. In part, this is the fault of the insurance companies, which often refuse to pay for such protection. But it is also because people fear that the sight of flood prevention equipment will scare off potential buyers and cut the value of their property. So, despite the warnings, people are just not helping themselves. They should – urban flooding is now more likely than ever, Collins warns. As we build more densely in cities, and pave over a vastly increasing area, the rain has nowhere to go. \"You might be in a house that has never flooded before, but because of all the new building you may suddenly become vulnerable, because the way the surface water flows has changed. At the moment, the only way you will find that out is when you have a flood.\" It doesn't have to be this way, he says: \"They [the construction companies] could look at this, they could work out where the water is likely to go, they could warn people, and you'd have thought they should, wouldn't you? But there is no obligation on them to do so, and so they don't.\" Sixty years after the Great Floods, we know that flooding is not a question of if, but when. The widespread complacency and slowness to act on the part of all the major players – government, infrastructure companies, utilities, builders, insurers, even householders – are deadly serious. \"We are just not facing up to reality,\" Collins says. Our failure now to protect what we value will cost us dear when the worst happens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/apr/04/science-art-advice-john-beddington","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-04T11:30:00Z","webTitle":"John Beddington: The science and art of effective advice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/apr/04/science-art-advice-john-beddington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2013/apr/04/science-art-advice-john-beddington","fields":{"headline":"The science and art of effective advice","bodyText":"There are times when a government knows it needs science or engineering advice. Perhaps most clearly when the physical world asserts itself in dramatic ways: the crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the emergence of the swine flu pandemic, and the volcanic eruption in Iceland being recent examples. Although the issues can be complex, such events are among the more straightforward issues for a government scientific adviser: there are willing recipients of the advice and the challenge is to collate the evidence and present it in the most effective way. What is more difficult is ensuring that science is brought to bear effectively on the questions that policymakers know matter but which don't present a single decision moment, or where it is less obvious that science can help. These include \"wicked problems\" that cross departments, cross disciplines and have timescales longer than the lifetimes of governments. Obesity, mental health and flood risk are examples. This is the challenge in the role of the government chief scientific adviser: to ensure that the best science and engineering advice is brought to bear effectively on all government policy and decision-making. It requires navigating strategic long-term advice on the one hand and the responsive marshalling of evidence for immediate questions on the other. Foresight is perhaps the most high profile and sustained programme to draw government attention to what science has to tell us about long-term challenges. Foresight projects aim to provide new research where it is most needed, giving policymakers clear and accessible advice, helping them to keep pace with technological change, and creating links across departments and across disciplines. To give one example, for the Foresight project on Migration and Global Environmental Change, we brought together around 350 leading experts and stakeholders from 30 countries to look 50 years into the future. We examined how profound changes in environmental conditions such as flooding, drought and rising sea levels will influence and interact with patterns of global human migration. The report revealed that we have so far underestimated the major challenges associated with migration in the context of environmental change and that millions will be \"trapped\" in vulnerable areas and unable to move, particularly in low income countries. Whereas Foresight projects each take one to two years to publication and engage with several hundred academics and experts over that time, much advice has to be provided much more rapidly. On a timescale of three to nine months, I introduced the \"Blackett\" reviews, named after Patrick Blackett, the physicist and one of the founders of operational research. These typically tackle a more immediate challenge, often in the security or defence arena. Sometimes, of course, the challenge is so immediate that we have minutes or hours to provide advice. During pandemics, the disruption to air travel caused by volcanic ash, and the emergency at Fukushima Dai-Ichi after the tsunami, I have relied on the immediate advice of small groups of experts forming the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). SAGE reports to the Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) committee, chaired by the prime minister. We have linked these experiences with the increasingly strong use of science as part of risk-based assessments underpinning the National Risk Register. Effective advice on both long-term issues or in response to emergencies begins with having the right people in the right place when they are needed most. For the first time we now have departmental Chief Scientific Advisers (CSAs) covering all government departments. In 2012, a House of Lords Select Committee report confirmed the immense value of this network and the government's response consolidated it. Between them, the CSAs have expertise in physical, life and social sciences, and engineering. They bring senior academic, business and Whitehall experience to the table. None of them has exactly the same role. What they each do reflects the scientific and policy needs of their department, along with its structure, history and provision of all forms of analysis. It is a network that is greater than the sum of its parts. Meeting regularly, CSAs have been able rapidly to exchange the latest intelligence, provide deep specialist science and engineering expertise and provide advice and impromptu problem-solving support to each other. Over the last few months alone, they will have discussed subjects as varied as ash die-back, growing threats from antibiotic resistance, the implications of the West Coast rail franchise affair, and how the UK can benefit financially from the science of the sea floor. Many leading scientists also work in or closely with business. As the government's chief scientific adviser (GCSA), I have had the privilege of co-chairing the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology, which now includes more senior representatives from R&amp;D-intensive businesses such as Rolls Royce and IBM. Drawing on this academic and private sector membership, the CST has presented on the science of genomics to the PM and contributed strongly to the development of the Life Sciences Strategy. Dialogue with the national academies has also reached a new level. Last year's joint report by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering on the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing to access shale gas illustrates how a relatively rapid response by the academies to a well posed question can directly inform government decision-making. Sometimes it is not enough to consider issues and take action in the UK in isolation. I'd like to see the benefits of science advisers networking in the UK extended much more strongly abroad. A small number of other countries have a GCSA-equivalent, most notably the USA but also Australia, the Czech Republic, India and Latvia, for example. Last year the EU, after many years of deliberation, appointed Professor Anne Glover to the role of European Commission CSA. Many other countries have mature and independent science advisory systems that are not based on a single GCSA-type role. Clearly, each country has to develop a model that works with the grain of its unique political and academic system. But it will help to ensure that we all get the best value from science advice if it becomes easier for scientists to work together across boundaries. Sometimes it helps just knowing who to call in a crisis. CSAs depend on a wide range of scientists and engineers working at every level in the public sector. When I arrived in post one of my biggest surprises was that, although I was formally head of the science and engineering profession, no one knew how many scientists and engineers were actually working in government departments. Whitehall doesn't collect information like that. So I invited scientists and engineers to step forward and form the Government Science &amp; Engineering community. From a standing start, we now have over 3,500 members. During the past year, I have led a group including representatives from the policy and analytical profession, the unions and professional bodies, to review what government will need from that profession in the future. The review shows scientists and engineers come from a huge range of disciplines, work across all areas of the civil service, and are proud to be doing so. Some 91% of the thousands surveyed for the review were positive about declaring themselves to be scientists or engineers, and 61% felt influential in their current role. Open policymaking is still a fluid term, but it creates opportunities to further strengthen the provision of good science in government. On a daily basis, members of the Government Science &amp; Engineering community are working with those who develop and deliver policy to ask questions, to be curious and innovative. They develop networks that reach into academic, NGO and business communities. They know how to call on these networks at a few hours' notice, and how to engineer new insights and solutions to complex issues over the longer term. The key point, and a fitting one to conclude on as I leave government, is that ensuring government is properly informed by science is something that all scientists should be involved in. The role of a government scientific adviser, whether on long-term issues or in a crisis, is to act as a conduit of advice rather than a single expert opinion. It is that ability to draw on the ever-developing knowledge of the wider scientific community that ensures the best advice possible is brought to bear.

The two leaders have a sometimes stormy relationship, and hope to downplay difficult issues such as the future of the euro and the European treaty. Friday's summit has been delayed from November, a postponement caused by the recurring crises afflicting the euro. Since then relations have dipped, with Sarkozy, trailing in the polls for the presidential elections, deriding the lack of British industry and promising a \"France forte\". Cameron has vetoed the European treaty on fiscal co-operation, forcing France and Germany to forge a pact outside the EU, a move that infuriated Sarkozy. On Wednesday, Sarkozy formally announced his his re-election bid in front of a massive TV audience. Cameron insists he admires Sarkozy and thinks that as a formidable campaigner he will haul himself from behind in the polls, and beat his socialist rival François Hollande in elections in the spring. He is not, however, expecting to be asked to join Sarkozy on the campaign trail along with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has agreed to help out. The prime minister will be accompanied by the foreign secretary, William Hague, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, the energy secretary, Ed Davey, and the defence secretary, Philip Hammond. They are likely to recall the high watermark of their partnership last year by celebrating the anniversary of the battle to topple Colonel Gaddafi. The two countries dominate European defence spending and will mark the next stage in defence co-operation by agreeing in principle to build unmanned drones by 2020. The Europeans, taking the dominant forward role in the Libyan air campaign, were struck by their lack of unmanned aerial surveillance capability, leading to a heavy reliance on US drones. Britain and France will sign a preliminary statement of intent and plan joint research to be led by Dassault and BAE. They will also sign £500m worth of deals on civil nuclear energy, including agreements for further joint research, paving the way for a new generation of nuclear power plants and creating 1,500 jobs. The two countries are trying to develop a joint supply chain capable of providing exports worldwide. Speaking ahead of the summit, Cameron said: \"One year on from the Libya uprising, we are working together to stand up to the murderous Syrian regime and to stop a nuclear weapon in the hands of Iran.\" The two countries want to give some practical advice to the Free Syrian Army, but are not planning to provide arms or any direct support on the ground. The work of special forces or the provision of communications equipment is not discussed by either government. Downing Street officials have met with Syrian leaders in exile and were less impressed by their unity and quality than they were in the case of their counterparts in Libya. The opportunity for practical diplomatic help through the UN is heavily restricted due to the opposition of the Russians and Chinese, so the focus has been on building a Syrian contact group built round Arab nations. Cameron is privately determined that President Assad's removal cannot lead to a worse regime than the one he currently leads, mindful of the dangerous consequences Britain fears this could have for the rest of the Middle East. Britain has also been looking at how it can ratchet up the pressure on key figures in the Syrian regime by warning them they will be indicted for war crimes at The Hague. In the interim it will support any efforts to document human rights abuses. On civil nuclear power, Cameron said ahead of the summit: \"My goal is clear. I want the vast majority of the content of our new nuclear plants to be constructed, manufactured and engineered by British companies. And we will choose the partners and technologies to maximise the economic benefits to the UK.\" The Liberal Democrat Davey described nuclear as \"clean nuclear\" and explained: \"There are plans for new nuclear in Somerset, Suffolk, Cumbria, north Wales and Gloucestershire. Supply chains will spring up too, and extend the reach of economic benefit across the country. This investment could be worth around £60bn and create up to 30,000 jobs.\" Details of the deal include the first agreement between Rolls-Royce and the French company Areva to supply manufacturing and other services for the first EPR reactor at Hinkley Point, Somerset and a commitment for all future EPR building in the UK worth a minimum of £400m. Rolls-Royce will build a dedicated factory at Rotherham and the deal will underpin 600 jobs at Rolls-Royce and more than 600 jobs in the wider supply chain in the UK, supporting 250 companies. The aim is to build a supply chain that should boost exports to China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jan/27/experts-japan-nuclear-plant-tests","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-27T12:36:45Z","webTitle":"Experts cast doubt on Japan nuclear plant tests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/27/experts-japan-nuclear-plant-tests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jan/27/experts-japan-nuclear-plant-tests","fields":{"headline":"Experts cast doubt on Japan nuclear plant tests","bodyText":"Advisers to Japan's nuclear safety agency have said power plant stress tests do not prove that a nuclear plant is safe, as the country faces the prospect of a summer without a single nuclear reactor in operation. Last year, the Japanese government ordered the nuclear authorities to conduct tests on all Japan's reactors after the 11 March meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi raised questions about the safety of nuclear power, particularly in a country prone to earthquakes and tsunami. Earlier this week, a team of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began a review of the safety tests but said it was up to the Japanese government whether or not to approve the restart of idle reactors. Currently only three of Japan's 54 reactors – just over 6% of its total nuclear capacity – are in operation after the Fukushima accident forced the closure of active reactors for safety checks. The latest closure came on Friday when a reactor at a plant near the Japan Sea was shut down for inspection. Without approval for restarts, all Japan's reactors could all be shut by the end of April, boosting the use of fossil fuels and adding more than $30bn (£19bn) a year to energy costs, according to a government estimate. The government is pushing for the early restart of idled reactors, fearing a power crunch in several parts of the country during the long, humid summer. Although the trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, said he believed Japan would be able to cope without imposing power cuts, even if all reactors were offline by the summer. Attention is now focused on a plant in the town of Ohi, western Japan, which could be the first to resume operations since 11 March. Its operator, Kansai Electric Power, has said two of the facility's reactors are able to withstand quakes and tsunami much stronger than those predicted for the area – a view reportedly endorsed by the country's nuclear and industrial safety agency. But Masashi Goto, a former nuclear power plant designer, said the stress tests at Ohi and elsewhere were next to useless. \"It is a misunderstanding to believe these tests prove that a nuclear plant is safe,\" he said. \"The reality is that the inspectors only look at the reactors' design and then factor in possible problems, such as earthquakes and tsunami of a certain size. \"They do not take into account the various malfunctions that can result in a disaster, including human error and equipment failure.\" Hiromitsu Ino, an emeritus professor at Tokyo University and a fellow member of the nuclear safety agency advisory panel, said the tests were flawed because they had been introduced before the full facts of the Fukushima disaster were known. \"The stress tests are being presented as a comprehensive survey of the safety of Japan's nuclear power plants, but the reality is very different,\" Ino said. \"They only look at potential problems in isolation, and the process of testing is exactly the same as it was before the March earthquake.\" No one had presented definitive evidence that the fuel meltdowns in three of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors were caused by the magnitude nine earthquake that struck north-east Japan or the 14-metre tsunami that followed it. Goto and Ino said it would be impossible to appraise the causes and consequences of the Fukushima disaster unless the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, released all the relevant data that could then be used to perform a simulation. Ino said he had little confidence in the IAEA team, which is due to present its latest report at the end of the month. \"I don't view their evaluation as something that is trustworthy or carries any weight,\" he said. \"The last time the IAEA inspectors came to Japan, they simply inspected sites and documents and left saying everything was fine. They submitted a flimsy report, and I fear the same will be the case this time.\" Japan has already abandoned plans to generate more than half its electricity supply through nuclear energy by 2030, but the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has said it needs to retain some nuclear plants until alternative sources of energy are developed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jan/25/japan-first-trade-deficit-12-years-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-25T19:36:29Z","webTitle":"Japan reports first trade deficit in 32 years after tsunami","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/25/japan-first-trade-deficit-12-years-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jan/25/japan-first-trade-deficit-12-years-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Japan reports first trade deficit in 32 years after tsunami","bodyText":"Japan's pride in its export sector has suffered a dent after trade figures for 2011 revealed that a collapse in sales to Europe coupled with the after-effects of the tsunami on the east coast created the country's first deficit in 32 years. The ministry of finance blamed the rising cost of oil and gas and soaring currency for much of the last year's ¥2.49tn (£20bn) deficit. Figures for December showed exports fell 8% from a year earlier, owing partly to weak shipments of electronics parts, while imports rose 8.1%, largely as a result of huge liquid gas shipments to offset the closure of 50 out of 54 nuclear power stations. It marked the third straight month of deficits. The ministry said the high value of the yen, which became a safe haven currency at the height of the euro crisis, was a key factor in pricing Japanese goods out of foreign markets. The tsunami, which hit production for several months, also drove up demand for oil and gas just as prices hit a post recession peak. The governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaaki Shirakawa, supported the ministry's view that trade deficits were unlikely to become a pattern, and did not foresee the country's current account balance tipping into the red in the near future. But analysts warned that Japan's days of logging huge trade surpluses may be over as it relies more on fuel imports and manufacturers move production offshore to cope with rising costs and a strong yen. A fast-ageing population also means a growing number of elderly Japanese will draw on their savings. Without savers to buy government debt, the treasury will be forced to seek support from outside investors, which will raise borrowing costs and in a few years time force Japan into the same over-reliance on international money markets as Europe. Japan has amassed debts worth twice its $5tn economy. Around 95% of the total is owned by Japanese banks, insurers and corporates, which have continued to lend to the government despite low returns. Within the next 10 years the ratio of workers to pensioners is expected to decline from the current 2:1 to 1:1, putting huge pressure on welfare budgets. \"What it means is that the time when Japan runs out of savings – 'Sayonara net creditor country' – that point is coming closer,\" said Jesper Koll, head of equities research at JPMorgan in Japan. \"It means Japan becomes dependent on global savings to fund its deficit and either the currency weakens or interest rates rise.\" David Rea, a Japan specialist at Capital Economics, said the tsunami was a factor in the trade figures, and its effect will likely persist as nuclear power stations remain shut this year, but more fundamental pressures were behind a deteriorating economic picture. He said the high value of the currency remained a persistent problem for exporters. He said: \"Firms have struggled to adjust to a strong yen that has appreciated by around 9% in trade-weighted terms since the start of the year. In the short term, the effect on trade will be small as many Japanese exports are priced in the importers' currency. However, in the medium term it will make production in Japan less competitive, and will lower the value of repatriated profits. This will further encourage firms to shift production abroad.\" High wages and welfare costs are also a feature of Japanese business life, a factor that has spurred many Japanese companies to locate factories overseas in recent years. Goldman Sachs said a more detailed examination of the export figures revealed an especially pronounced falloff in exports to Europe, which declined 13.1% following an 11.2% decline in November. \"This suggests the deterioration in financial conditions in Europe may be having a negative impact on demand there,\" it said. Exports to Asia also slumped while they grew slightly to the US over the year. The chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, said the government wants to closely watch the trend of exports and imports. \"There are worries that the yen's strength is driving Japanese industry to go abroad,\" said Fujimura. \"We have to create new industries … implement comprehensive steps to boost growth. It is important to secure employment within the nation.\" Only four of the country's 54 nuclear power reactors are running due to public safety fears following the March disaster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/aug/13/iran-nuclear-power-plant-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-13T12:34:47Z","webTitle":"Iran to gain nuclear power as Russia loads fuel into Bushehr reactor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/13/iran-nuclear-power-plant-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/aug/13/iran-nuclear-power-plant-russia","fields":{"headline":"Iran to gain nuclear power as Russia loads fuel into Bushehr reactor","bodyText":"Russia will begin to load fuel into the reactor at Iran's Bushehr nuclear power station next week, marking the start of its launch after years of delay, Moscow said today. Russian and Iranian specialists are to begin loading uranium-packed fuel rods into the reactor on 21 August, a process that will take about two to three weeks. This will be a key step towards starting up the reactor, although it will not be considered operational from that date. \"This will be an irreversible step,\" Sergei Novikov, a spokesman for Russia's state nuclear corporation, Rosatom, said. \"At that moment, the Bushehr nuclear power plant will be certified as a nuclear energy installation.\" Novikov said that the head of Rosatom, Sergei Kiriyenko, would travel to Bushehr, in southern Iran, for next week's ceremony. Iran's vice-president, Ali Akbar Salehi, who also heads the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, is scheduled to attend as well. In March, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, on a visit to Moscow, criticised Russia's plans to start up the Bushehr plant, describing them as premature, given western suspicions about Tehran's nuclear programme. In June, the UN security council approved a fourth round of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, including tougher financial controls and an expanded arms embargo, as well as an asset ban on three dozen companies and a travel freeze on individuals. Despite American reservations about the facility, nuclear experts say Bushehr does not contain sensitive technology, which is why it does not figure in any UN security council resolutions. Moreover, Bushehr has no link with Iran's secretive uranium enrichment programme, seen as the main \"weaponisation\" threat, at other installations. \"The Iranians have been able to go ahead with Bushehr because it's clean,\" said a nuclear expert, adding that the light-water reactor in Bushehr was internationally tolerated because of Russia's involvement. The Foreign Office said that Britain respected Iran's right to a peaceful civilian nuclear programme as long as it meets its international obligations. \"The Bushehr reactor, which will use fuel provided by Russia, is separate from Iran's proliferation sensitive nuclear activities that are a clear contravention of six UN security council resolutions,\" the Foreign Office said in a statement. \"Today's announcement underlines the fact that Iran does not need to pursue these other activities to enjoy the benefits of nuclear power.\" Moscow points out that the project has been closely supervised by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and that Iran has signed a pledge to ship all the spent uranium fuel from Bushehr back to Russia for reprocessing, ruling out the possibility that any of it could used to make nuclear weapons. Construction of this, Iran's first nuclear plant, was begun in 1975 by several German companies. They pulled out following a US embargo on high-technology supplies to Iran, after the 1979 Islamic revolution and the subsequent US embassy siege in Tehran. Russia stepped in and agreed to build the 1,000-megawatt reactor 15 years ago, in a project that has been likened to efforts to fix a German engine in a Russian car. Delays have plagued the $1bn (£640m) project, with diplomats saying that Moscow has used it as a lever in relations with Tehran. Iran has had to put up with the long timescale because it has no other potential nuclear partners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/feb/27/chernobyl-new-roof-british-funds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-27T17:53:29Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl, 25 years on: cash plea for new roof to contain deadly remains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/27/chernobyl-new-roof-british-funds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/feb/27/chernobyl-new-roof-british-funds","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl, 25 years on: cash plea for new roof to contain deadly remains","bodyText":"Britain is coming under increasing pressure to provide Ukraine with an extra €50m (£43m) to construct a new contamination shield over the top of the stricken Chernobyl nuclear plant before the old one collapses. Officials from the European commission said governments around the world were being urged to find €750m to help build a more sophisticated roof over the burnt-out reactor and storage for 200 tonnes of highly radioactive fuel. Jean-Paul Joulia, from the commission's nuclear safety unit, admitted the cost of just this aspect of the Chernobyl clean-up was running at €1.5bn – double the original estimate – partly due to \"some delays\" to some projects. But he said he was confident that foreign governments would stump up the money needed for the shield, even in today's financially difficult climate. \"I am optimistic the international community is committed to this. It is important for a number of reasons,\" he said. The disaster at Chernobyl, on 26 April 1986, is recognised as the world's worst nuclear accident. One of the power station's reactors exploded and the subsequent fire spewed a radioactive cloud across Europe. The accident claimed the lives directly of at least 50 people, mainly fire crews and nuclear workers who tried to fight the fire on the fateful night. Radioactive fallout is believed to have caused many other deaths from thyroid cancer and related illnesses, with an eventual death toll estimated at anywhere between 4,000 and 200,000. The disaster also triggered the relocation of tens of thousands of local people, some of whom have never been allowed back to the contaminated towns. The accident and its aftermath have resonance currently as new nuclear plants are being planned in Britain and other parts of Europe. Nuclear power was heavily discredited for some time after Chernobyl because the accident pointed to the enormous dangers associated with it. Ukraine and foreign contributors have already spent more than €750m trying to make safe the nuclear plant. The UK has so far provided €53.1m to help build the new shield and is under pressure to stump up a further €50m, although Ukrainian sources said no money had yet been promised. With the 25th anniversary approaching, the European commission is encouraging governments to make public new cash commitments in advance of a \"pledging\" conference scheduled for one week before the April anniversary. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has been overseeing the spending of the money at Chernobyl, admitted squeezing out more money at this time was a \"big challenge\". Vince Novak, a director of the nuclear safety department of the EBRD in London, said the design life of the temporary shield thrown up by the-then Soviet Union in the immediate aftermath of the accident in 1986 \"runs out\" in 2016. A new moveable barrier would be one of the world's biggest engineering feats due to its size and innovative features. The work will be done by a consortium involving Bechtel, the US firm which has worked on the London Underground and the Channel tunnel. The current shield has been propped up by a series of new steel columns but experts working on the project accept that the structure is barely adequate and needs replacing as quickly as possible. The barrier is sitting over the top of what remains of a deeply radioactive reactor core, but also covers the vast bulk of the fuel from the plant which has seeped into the concrete floor. A new permanent shield would prevent rain from getting into the old plant but also allow more work to be carried out on dismantling the remains of the equipment and the fuel without creating more escapes of hazardous dust and particles. Fallout over UK Nuclear workers in Sweden were the first to detect the radioactive material that was thrown into the atmosphere from Chernobyl. The fallout from the accident in the early hours of 26 April 1986 crossed over Europe, and deposited the radioactive isotope caesium-137 in mainly upland areas of Wales, Scotland and England. The disaster, which released at least 100 times more radiation than the atom bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, forced the government to put 9,700 farms and 4.2 million sheep under restriction across the UK. Restrictions were lifted in Northern Ireland in 2000. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed yesterday that the last time the government updated the public on the restrictions was in 2009 when the then health minister Dawn Primarolo revealed 369 farms and 190,000 sheep were still affected. Of those farms, 355 are in north Wales, with nine in Cumbria and seven in Scotland. Farmers in these areas must have their livestock scanned before they are able to move them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/sep/08/germany-little-growth-few-babies","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-07T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"Suddenly Germany may be in trouble – too little growth, two few babies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/08/germany-little-growth-few-babies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/sep/08/germany-little-growth-few-babies","fields":{"headline":"Suddenly Germany may be in trouble – too little growth, two few babies","bodyText":"On the edge of deep green mountain forests in the centre of Germany – where east once met west – lies Germany's \"toy town\". As in every corner of Germany right now, smiling election candidates beam out from posters tied to lampposts in Sonneberg with snappy slogans promising \"safe jobs\" and to \"keep Germany strong\". There is little mention of looming problems that many experts predict will send Germany tumbling down the economic league tables over coming years. Instead, they are playing on the strengths of Sonneberg's mix of small and family-owned companies – the kind that dominate the buoyant German business landscape. Toy town is, for now, enjoying the latest of many resurgences through the centuries. \"Sonneberg and the area around it has one of the highest employment levels in Germany,\" says Christian Dressel, who runs the local job centre. \"Businesses have set up here … we have car industry companies, electronics firms making vacuum cleaners and TVs, toymakers and a training school for toymakers.\" In its heyday at the turn of the 20th century, Sonneberg was the world's leading toy producer. Mothers and fathers, son and daughters, crammed into home workshops and, with their neighbours, made up production lines that churned out every fifth toy in the world. One house would make dolls' wigs, the next along stuffed the bodies and another would craft their faces. When Sonneberg was swallowed up into the German Democratic Republic, the communist authorities merged its many toymakers into powerful co-operatives that made up 95% of the country's toy industry, exporting dolls, building blocks, trains and plastic trucks far and wide across the Soviet bloc and beyond. Little of that is left today. Rows of majestic villas and teddy-bear-shaped statues in the town square are testament to centuries of export might, but only a handful of toymakers remain. \"After the reunification those giant toymakers were no longer sustainable and collapsed very quickly,\" says Reinhild Schneider, director of the German Toy Museum in Sonneberg. \"If you look at the massive scale of production in the past and the renowned toymakers, what we see is a story of decline. You have to accept it. The world is changing.\" But in the place of Sonneberg's toymakers are industrial estates almost full to capacity with car parts manufacturers, mechanical engineering plants and plastics specialists. These are the sorts of small businesses that make up 99% of all German firms, and generate more than half the country's economic output. Sonneberg, and its transformation after the fall of the Berlin wall into a base for such Mittelstand (small and medium-sized) companies, encapsulates the wave of economic success that chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking to ride into the elections in two weeks' time. These companies, like many across Germany, have been enjoying growing exports as the eurozone finally emerges from recession. At 4.2%, Sonneberg's unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country and has halved in the past five years. Merkel's placards here promise more of the same for workers. But rivals to her centre-right Christian Democrats seize on growing disquiet in Germany about the value of all those jobs and what many see as rising inequality. Germany has one of the largest proportions of low earners in Europe – a quarter are on less than €9.54 (£8.15) an hour – and for those at the bottom of the pay scale, wages have failed miserably to keep pace with inflation. Merkel's main challenger, Peer Steinbrück of the Social Democrats, is promising top-ups for families on low incomes, while the leftwing Die Linke party is calling for a national minimum wage and a tax on millionaires under the slogan \"It's fun to share\". Sonneberg and its neighbouring towns also offer glimpses of a longer-term problem facing Germany. Europe's growth engine is grappling with the costs of one of the lowest birth rates in the world, and here at its heart the resulting skills shortage is already being felt. This is the biggest issue for more than 500 local Mittelstand bosses gathering for their Industrie- und Handelskammer (chamber of commerce and industry) gala, a short dash up the recently extended motorway in the town of Suhl. The chamber's latest survey showed a record number of businesses on good form, and there are high spirits at the annual knees-up, which features speeches, dance routines by a troupe draped in locally made LED lights, a prizegiving and a buffet of potato salad, schnitzels and sausages. But there are nods of recognition when the chamber president for South Thuringia, Dr Peter Traut, highlights a worsening labour crunch. \"When I started in this role 10 years ago there were 2,200 young people finishing their exams. Now there are 1,000 fewer. The maths is easy: it has virtually halved.\" The drive to attract young trainees is something Karl-Heinz Sladek has been working hard at. He is general manager of HPT Pharma Packaging, based in Sonneberg, and says the tables have been turned on German employers. While their counterparts in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece are inundated with applicants for every job, German bosses are left wondering where to find young people to meet the rising demand for their car parts, biotech innovations and other exports. \"It is no longer a case of young people applying to us; it's us applying for future trainees,\" he says. Companies are wooing school leavers with golden hellos, petrol vouchers, gym memberships and help with childcare. But the numbers are not in the employers' favour. The regional employment agency in Suhl has just reported a record August for trainee demand. There were 869 unfilled training slots but just 336 applicants still looking for a placement. At Sonneberg's job centre, Dressel has been trying to bring more workers into the area. He recently ferried a busload of potential Sonneberg settlers to a jobs fair from other, less buoyant parts of former East Germany. With his colleagues, he scouts around for companies elsewhere in Germany that are cutting staff or closing and then goes after the workers with brochures expounding the job opportunities and vaunting the quality of life in \"toy town\", with its vast forests, mountain-bike tracks and ski slopes. The shrinking pool of school leavers is a worrying trend for a country that has long prided itself on a tradition of apprenticeships and skilled work in a specific Beruf, or trade. That and a push towards innovation have kept Germany competitive in an increasingly global economy, according to Stefanie Spanagel, who runs an engine parts plant in Sonneberg for manufacturer Mann+Hummel. \"There is a pride in skilled crafts,\" she says. \"People don't just say I work at Mann+Hummel, they say I work as a tool maker at Mann+Hummel.\" Her plant – the biggest industrial employer in Sonneberg, with 500 staff – keeps 95% of the apprentices it takes on. Others battling in the increasingly cut-throat market for youngsters are not so lucky. Peter Stahlhut manages production at Glaswerk Ernstthal, on the edge of the town of Lauscha in the nearby Thuringia mountains. Workshops here have been crafting glass since the 16th century and claim to be the birthplace of the Christmas bauble. Lauscha is to Christmas decorations what Sonneberg is to toys. Stahlhut's factory now produces decorative glass bottles for the spirits industry, more than a third of them for export. The plant has 30 trainees among its 500 staff. But holding on to them is tough. \"In our industry you need experience to do the job well… that means years of learning and doing,\" says Stahlhut. \"But a glass works isn't the sexiest place to work. It's hot. It's noisy. You have to expect to lose 50% of the people you start training.\" Economists say the skills shortage will become more acute as the German population continues to fall. The official projections are for drastic ageing: in 2060, every third person will be 65 or older. Not only are people living longer, but when it comes to having children, Germans lag well behind most other OECD countries. There is anecdotal evidence among women that combining a job and a family is still frowned on. There is also research, including by the OECD, suggests that finding childcare remains a barrier to starting a family for some. This demographic time bomb has received too little attention in the election campaign, say many economists. \"They are not concentrating on structural reform, and that is what you need for women to have more kids,\" says Laurence Boone, chief European economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Analysts say that Germany also faces mounting pension and healthcare costs as the population ages and its advantageous economic position starts to crumble away. \"There are big implications for trend growth,\" says Boone. \"The more people who work, the more you grow. And if you have to choose between kids and working, you take women out of the workforce. You need children being born and women working. Not only is Germany's trend growth going to be lower than it was before the crisis five years ago, it's going to be closer to Italian trend growth and below Spanish, UK and French trend growth.\" Combining motherhood and work is an area where some western German states could learn a lesson from the former East Germany. Sonneberg's deputy mayor, Dr Heiko Voigt, recalls a time when things were different. \"In the old East Germany we had a very high female participation rate,\" he says. \"We had excellent childcare, and the birth rate was much higher.\" Sonneberg now offers care for every child that needs it. A full-time place with meals costs about £120 a month, with discounts for siblings. And toy town's family-friendliness is part of a wider push for business-friendliness in a place that initially suffered badly from the Wendeschock, when East and West Germany were reunited. \"After the wall came down, industry and business collapsed here,\" says Voigt. \"Firms with 3,000 workers went down to 300; some closed altogether. It was akin to what happened in British mining.\" Business groups and local authorities responded by renewing pre-second-world-war links with neighbouring towns in Bavaria. They also lobbied for new transport links and created industrial estates, including on the \"death strip\" where the border once stood. Voigt thinks the town's rebirth as one of the most economically active in Germany could be copied by struggling European neighbours. \"The toy industry is one of many legs that we stand on but not the most important one. You should always have several irons in the fire, be flexible, try unconventional ways of getting results.\" CASE STUDIES Krebs Glas Lauscha In the little German mountain town of Lauscha it is Christmas 365 days a year. Glassblowers have been crafting their wares here for 400 years. They began with simple round windowpanes and over the generations went on to supply bottles to pharmacists, festive baubles to department stores and glass eyes to doctors' clinics. Lauscha's steep high street is lined with a mix of Christmas shops, lampmakers and surgeries offering prosthetic eyes. But it is for its decorations the town is known in foreign markets. Krebs Glas Lauscha sends out 6m decorations from here every year and distributes tens of millions more. It sells to Selfridges and Harrods, and also distributes to France, Japan and north America. But as mass production has swept through the Christmas decorations market, the number of baubles handcrafted in Lauscha on the firm's order books has suffered. In 2011, Krebs Glas Lauscha closed its production plant here and now buys from workshops in the town for those customers who still want to spend big on Christmas. Rich Russians are buying the handmade and painted baubles, says manager Gerd Ross. \"In Russia, it's like it was in America in the 1960s,: you decorate a tree to show who you are.\" Demand is also rising in Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. But Ross, whose father and grandfather made decorations in Lauscha, has seen drastic changes in most places. \"The market for quality products has become quite small … People now get Christmas decorations in DIY stores and general stores. It is a shame that things developed that way but we couldn't stop that,\" he says. \"People's habits have changed too. There was a saying in Lauscha: when things are not working out for people, Christmas tree decorations work. People always decorated their trees, whatever. Today at Christmas … people eat well, they travel, they go to places where snow is guaranteed or perhaps even sunshine, and so the demand for Christmas decorations falls.\" Piko Jens Beyer is under no illusions about the image of his industry. \"People don't out themselves as model railway enthusiasts,\" says the manager at Piko, one of Germany's biggest manufacturers of model trains. And yet, sales growth has been close to double digits in the last few years for Piko, one of the few toymakers left in Germany's one-time toy capital, Sonneberg. Exports are strong, customers are loyal and its plants in Sonneberg and south China are serving a growing share of the market, he says. Exports have always been important here. Set just over the Bavarian-Thuringian border in what was East Germany, Piko was made into a major toymaker under communism and became known to model buffs around the world as the go-to supplier for Soviet townscapes and trains. Today it still enjoys a strong following in the US, where it has a distribution centre, as well as rising demand in Russia. But model trains are a labour-intensive business and pressure on margins is high. Against a backdrop of stiff competition and stagnating disposable incomes for many of its customers, Piko opened its Chinese plant five years ago and the 300 workers there now easily outnumber the 170 assembling trains and running the machines in Sonneberg. The German toy town is still the workshop for 150 different PIKO products, which range from miniature cargo wagons to larger scale outdoor train sets. It is a market that thrives on new releases. \"We have to invest in new technology but especially in new products,\" says Beyer. PIKO pays €150,000 for a set of moulds for a single locomotive. Where possible it will use that mould for a number of variations by changing the plastic colour or logos to represent the variety of real-life rail operators. \"Rail privatisations have been good for us,\" says Beyer. Like most other manufacturers, Piko's bosses worry about skilled labour shortages and there is pressure too from rising energy costs – a constant point of tension between German business and the state since the government vowed to phase out nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/aug/22/bhp-billiton-olympic-dam-china","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-22T09:08:17Z","webTitle":"BHP Billiton scraps $20bn Olympic Dam project as China slowdown bites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/bhp-billiton-olympic-dam-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/aug/22/bhp-billiton-olympic-dam-china","fields":{"headline":"BHP Billiton scraps $20bn Olympic Dam project as China slowdown bites","bodyText":"BHP Billiton has scrapped plans to build the world's biggest open pit copper and uranium mine in Australia amid fears about the impact of the slowing global economy on demand for resources. The Anglo-Australian miner said it was shelving its $20bn plans to expand its Olympic Dam to cover 30 square kilometres of South Australian bush because of falling commodity prices meant it no longer made economic sense. Slumping demand in China, the world's biggest consumer of metals, has led to a 25% drop in the copper price over the last 18 months. The price of uranium has also fallen sharply as governments globally have slowed nuclear power plant development in the wake of the Fukushima disaster last year. The $20bn (£12bn) Olympic Dam \"mega project\" would have transformed the mine 550km (350 miles) north of Adelaide into a massive open pit capable of producing 750,000 tonnes of copper and 19,000 tonnes of uranium a year. But Kloppers said the failing prices of its important commodities including iron ore and coal, meant BHP was being forced to \"live within our means\". The company, which on Wednesday reported a 26% fall in pre-tax profits to $23bn, had put a freeze on signing off any big new projects. These could include $19bn plans to expand its iron ore harbour in western Australia. Last year the world's biggest miner said it planned to spend $80bn on growth projects over five years. BHP has already committed $22.8bn to projects under way this financial year. The shelving of the Olympic Dam project was attacked by the Australian government, which was relying on the mine to create thousands of jobs and boost the local economy. \"We've been given to understand that BHP were proceeding with an expansion once; we've been given to believe that BHP will proceed with an expansion twice,\" said South Australian premier Jay Weatherill. \"If they come to us and seek permissions and approvals on a third occasion, we will be taking a different approach to the negotiations. That's a prudent and natural approach to take, given our experience, and I think we would be unwise not to.\" Kloppers said politics was not a factor in BHP's decision to scrap its expansion plans but he did point out that the high value of the Australian dollar made development projects and wages more expensive than in other countries. \"This about capex [capital expenditure] escalation,\" he said. \"This is an escalation driven by a tight labour market, a tight supplier market, a high exchange rate and high diesel prices, which has made a concept that we thought would work, unviable. \"As we finalised all the details of the project in the context of current market conditions, our strategy and capital management priorities, it became clear that the right decision for the company and its shareholders was to continue studies to develop a less capital intensive option to replace the underground mine at Olympic Dam.\" The scrapping of the project was welcomed by analysts. Tim Schroeders, a portfolio manager at Pengana Capital in Melbourne, said it was \"pleasing to see that there's some capital discipline\" and BHP was not \"ploughing ahead irrespective of current difficult economic conditions\". Kloppers said he expected commodity prices to remain volatile in the near term, but was more optimistic in the longer term. \"We expect supportive economic policy and a broad growth bias, particularly in China, to lead to measured improvement in the external environment beginning in the first half of the 2013 financial year,\" he said. Growth in China, the world's biggest user of metals, has declined to the slowest pace in three years as the European debt crisis stalls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/19/anti-nuclear-campaign-british-legal-challenge","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-19T15:11:29Z","webTitle":"Anti-nuclear campaigners plan legal challenge to new British power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/19/anti-nuclear-campaign-british-legal-challenge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/19/anti-nuclear-campaign-british-legal-challenge","fields":{"headline":"Anti-nuclear campaigners plan legal challenge to new British power stations","bodyText":"A group of politicians and environmentalists are trying to block the building of new nuclear power stations in Britain by submitting a formal complaint to the European commission. The challenge has been prepared by lawyers acting for a new campaign group, Fair Energy, and is focused on what they claim are seven subsidies potentially on offer to EDF and others. One of the largest incentives is the cap on liabilities for nuclear accidents but Fair Energy also points to the fact that uranium is exempted from wider taxes on fuels in the UK, and that government will help with the costs of dealing with nuclear waste. The campaign, which is supported by Green party MP Caroline Lucas, Keith Taylor MEP, French pressure group Sortir du Nucléaire and others, says the complaint \"may\" be followed by legal action in the courts. \"The European Union has opted for opening up the energy market and is vigilant about creating a level playing field,\" said Dörte Fouquet, the lawyer who has been leading the preparation of the complaint. \"In this regard, the commission over the last years repeatedly underlined that distortion of the market is to a large extent caused by subsidies to the incumbents in the energy sector. \"This complaint aims to shed some light on the recent shift in the energy policy of the United Kingdom where strong signals point to yet another set of subsidies to the nuclear power plant operators,\" she added. Lucas, who is MP for Brighton Pavilion and leader of the Green party in England and Wales, said she had no doubt the government's planned electricity market reform is set to rig the energy market in favour of nuclear, with the introduction of a carbon price floor likely to result in huge windfall handouts of around £50m a year to existing nuclear generators. She added: \"Despite persistent denials by ministers, it's clear that this is a subsidy by another name, which makes a mockery of the coalition pledge not to gift public money to this already established industry. If these subsidies are found to be unlawful, I trust the European commission will take action and prevent the UK's nuclear plans from seriously undermining the shift towards new green energy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2015/jan/27/east-coast-blizzard-cities-awake-to-travel-bans-as-snowfall-records-stand-untouched","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-27T23:24:13Z","webTitle":"Blizzard 2015: New England buried in snow as coastal towns fear flooding  – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/jan/27/east-coast-blizzard-cities-awake-to-travel-bans-as-snowfall-records-stand-untouched","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2015/jan/27/east-coast-blizzard-cities-awake-to-travel-bans-as-snowfall-records-stand-untouched","fields":{"headline":"Blizzard 2015: New England buried in snow as coastal towns fear flooding  – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Here’s a summary of where things stand: The governor of Massachusetts announced he will lift the state’s travel ban at midnight. Boston’s Logan International airport is expected to re-open on Wednesday morning; the state’s public transportation will also resume service. Earlier in the day, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut’s governors lifted the travel bans in their states, and the New York City subway system resumed service after a rare pause. Snow continues to fall in Massachusetts, which saw more than 30in of snow in some areas. Crews there are still working to restore power to the flooded island town of Nantucket while residents living near the coast prepare for storm surges with the evening high tide. Snowfall failed to approach anywhere near the “historic” levels predicted in New York City, with fewer than 10in recorded on Manhattan. Governor Andrew Cuomo and mayor Bill de Blasio defended their travel bans, with Cuomo saying “I don’t know that this wasn’t the more prudent course of action in any event.” Meteorologists downgraded the predicted levels of snowfall, after re-evaluating mistaken forecasts from Monday. The director of the National Weather Service defended the agency’s forecasts but admitted meteorologists need to improve how the present uncertainty around their predictions. A journalist asked the governor Charlie Baker, “Is it possible we’re going after the wrong Olympics?” Boston is pursuing the 2024 summer Olympics. This is the governor’s first brush with mother nature since being sworn in earlier this month. One journalist asked how he feels about mother nature: “She’s a big powerful lady ... I’ve been incredibly impressed with the collaboration, coordination and professionalism with everyone involved.” Overall, the governor appeared happy with the states’ response, though he said there still work to be done with respect to clearing the roads and restoring power to residents in Nantucket. “Things worked as we hoped and anticipated they would ...we’re in pretty decent shape to begin to start to turn the corner tomorrow. But I’d certainly encourage everyone to use best judgement here.” Earlier in the day, Baker and Pollack drove around the state to asses the storm impact and clean up response. The governor said: “The main streets were ploughed, mostly not down to the asphalt, but passable. The sidewalks almost everywhere need a tremendous amount of work ... There’s a ton of work that would need to happen between then and tomorrow for people to really feel comfortable [being on the roads].” Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker is speaking now. Watch live here. The governor announced that he is lifting the travel ban in the state of Massachusetts at midnight. “This is a very significant storm and in many parts of Massachusetts I think you could call it historic...It’s clear we have a pretty good handle on what’s going on out there.” Taking to the podium, the incoming secretary of transportation, Stephanie Pollack, said Logan International Airport will also re-open tomorrow at 6am,and the state’s public transit services will also resume service, with full service expected by Thursday. Bus service will depend on the roads. The governor said between 2in and 6in of snow are still expected to fall in parts of the state throughout the night. Here are some of the latest snow totals from the National Weather Service: Worcester, Massachusetts: 33.1in Framingham, Massachusetts: 31.5in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts: 28.4in (west of Boston) Boston, Massachusetts: 26in West Glocester, Rhode Island: 24.4in Providence, Rhode Island: 15in Hartford, Connecticut: 21.5in Residents of Plum Island, off the northeast coast of Massachusetts, are bracing for powerful waves, and possible costal flooding during the next high tide, scheduled for 5.05pm, the Boston Globe is reporting. The Island received about 17in of snow. Blizzard warnings are still in effect for Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts until 8 pm tonight and eastern Maine until 4 am tomorrow. Boston mayor Marty Walsh said there has already been more than 2 feet of snow so far in Boston with more snow on way. He also said the emergency declaration will not be lifted until sometime tomorrow, and said there is a possibility schools may close for a third day, on Thursday, depending on how the storm progresses through the night. The mayor said it’s a decision he’ll make tomorrow. He also put a definitive end to this simmering debate. Uccellini said eastern Massachusetts could still see “historic” snow levels. The phrase was first used in a header of a report, he said, and was recycled in just about every newspaper headline that followed. Defending the use of the term “historic” he said that while it certainly won’t be true from NYC, it could still be true for some cities in parts of New England. “That phrase could still verify, so let’s not be premature here.” “Everybody’s focused on where it didn’t snow, but let’s bring your attention to where it actually did snow - Long Island, southern New England, and eastern Massachusetts, where the same header was used - the amounts there could actually be historic in nature, in the top five snowfalls in those areas.” “We all know in this business you’re only as good as your last forecast ... there are going to be errors in a forecast. There were aspect of this forecast that were very good. There were aspects of this forecast that were not good. The point is that’s true with any system.” In that regard there’s nothing new here with respect to this particular storm, Having stated that, given the sensitivity of exactly where the forecast uncertainties were, and choices made that affected, I’d say, on the order of 10-15 million people, this one had more consequences.” Dr Louis Uccellini, National Weather Service director, said the best possible science was used to predict the storm’s impact. “We need to make these uncertainties clearer so decision makers can asses the risk, take action or do nothing knowing the level of uncertainty for each forecast. During national interviews I gave yesterday I attempted to convey this uncertainty for the western boundaries of the area. That it would be a pivotal factor for the amount of snowfalls in those areas. But, clearly this is not enough and we have many challenges facing us in ensuring that the uncertainty is included in all of our forecast parameters ... “What we’ve learned from this storm is that we all need to improve how we communicate forecast uncertainty. And the National Weather Service moving forward will certainly be more aggressive in addressing this particular component of the forecast.” If you have cabin fever from being inside all day, WNYC put together this handy map of the best places to sled in NYC. All we ask is that you share yours pictures of sledders zipping through Central Park with the Guardian Witness. ... And if you’re happy - or stuck - inside, we’ve complied a definitive guide of what to watch, read and listen to here. The Guardian caught up with Mark Roderick, who is studying atmospheric science at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, just as he finished digging his car out from under the snow. My day started at about 7.30am, I woke up, checked the radar, satellite images, [National Weather Service] discussions and my fav professional meteorologist’s [social media] accounts. I then put on my snowboard gear and started digging out. Roderick said he heeded forecasters’ warnings and stocked up before the storm hit so he could relax and enjoy the snow day(s). I did prepare by topping off my gas tank, and buying water, deli meat, milk, crackers, hummus, and spaghetti and beer :) All stuff I needed anyway. I will probably spend the next couple days helping friends, doing some homework and relaxing. Roderick said the storm was bad, but he’s experienced worse. I went to high school in Watertown, New York and dealt with lake-effect snow, so this storm isn’t bad to me but it is significant for some ... We typically experience a big storm every few years and a few “smaller” storms each winter. Before this storm, we had only received around 10 inches, our seasonal average is around 41 inches. So was it over-hyped? With social media, I can see how this storm was overhyped, especially for Philly and NYC not getting the amounts some had forecast. To that I would say, our atmosphere is very complex and predicting the weather is still incredibly difficult. If you look at totals in NYC, east to Montauk, you will see a steep gradient over a short distance. All forecasts have a margin of error. Here in Massachusetts, we have areas who have already received 30in, as well as folks on the coast getting heavy snow, high winds, flooding from storm waves, and currently without power, to them the storm wasn’t under-hyped. Up to 30in of snow has clobbered New England and especially Massachusetts, where the governor shut down Boston’s Logan International Airport. Crews raced to restore power to the flooded island town of Nantucket while others prepared for likely storm surges with the high tide at evening. Thousands of people lost power in the Boston area as high winds and floods barraged the coast, and governor Charlie Baker kept a travel ban in place over the eastern half of the state. Emergency personnel are working clear huge snowdrifts and provide shelter while most of eastern Massachusetts has stayed paralyzed by the heaping snow. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut’s governors lifted the travel bans in their states, and the New York City subway system resumed service after a rare pause. Snowfall failed to approach anywhere near the “historic” levels predicted in New York City, with fewer than 10in recorded on Manhattan. Governor Andrew Cuomo and mayor Bill de Blasio defended their travel bans, with Cuomo saying “I don’t know that this wasn’t the more prudent course of action in any event.” Transit slowly returned to normal, as inspectors cleared rail lines, cars followed plows onto highways, and flights south of Connecticut resumed service with delays. Meteorologists downgraded the predicted levels of snowfall, after re-evaluating mistaken forecasts from Monday. Heavy snow continues to fall in New England, and may break records in Boston, Massachusetts and Connecticut. New York’s leaders have come under fire for their decisions before and during the snowstorm that hammered into New England but left Manhattan and the boros with a mild frosting, my colleague Nicky Woolf (@nickywoolf) reports. On Tuesday, with the benefit of hindsight, many New Yorkers criticised state and city government for its reaction to the storm, which included shutting down the subway – for the first time in response to snow – and imposing a travel ban after 11pm. Other than bridges, there was no travel ban when the city was hit by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. José Holguín-Veras, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, said the response had been “on the cautious side”, but said that while putting the city effectively under house arrest might sound extreme, it was part of a calculation of risk. “Of course, it’s hard to explain to the public why they have to go through all these inconveniences,” Holguín-Veras added. “But … the general public have to understand that in cases like this, randomness plays a role. It’s better to be safe than sorry.” Nicky’s full story, which you can read here, did not cover a few more creative complaints from a city that has won 29 World Series and five Super Bowls between its baseball and football teams. Massachusetts is bracing for high tide later this afternoon, when storm surges could cause more flooding on the coast. Boston’s station of the National Weather Service warns of “renewed coastal flooding of shores; severe beach erosion; comparable impacts to [this morning’s] high tide”. The Weather Channel’s Michael Lowry has tweeted a chart that estimates how much water could pour into vulnerable cities due to the snowstorm. And for a more illustrative take on how bad it can get, here’s a photo from this morning in Marshfield from NBC’s Alexander Smith. There are now 28in of snow in Lowell, Massachusetts, just north of Boston, and 20.8in at Logan International Airport in Boston. Floods have overwhelmed much of the Cape and the towns lining the bay. The details of governor Charlie Baker’s changes to the travel ban in Massachusetts: Governor Charlie Baker has announced that the statewide travel ban has been lifted for Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden Counties for local and I-91 traffic only, effective immediately. The travel ban remains in effect for the entire length of the Massachusetts Turnpike, Interstate 90, and for Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, Essex, Middlesex, Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester Counties with only essential workers, healthcare and human service professionals and others specifically exempted, permitted to travel. The travel ban will be lifted based on road conditions and the advice of emergency response officials. Baker has exempted the following people from the ban. Essential emergency response professionals Medical, healthcare and human service workers, including shelter personnel Essential public transit and support workers Public and private personnel supporting public works and utility operations Essential state employees Those traveling for essential medical procedures Vehicles and personnel delivering essential supplies to healthcare facilities. Other exemptions, depending on the circumstances, can include public safety and works vehicles, news media, healthcare personnel, and private companies helping to clear the snow and ice. Noaa with a satellite shot of the blizzard near its peak last night: Then incoming secretary of transportation, Stephanie Pollack, takes the podium, saying that the Massachusetts Transportation Department spent “nearly $20m on the big storm in 2013”, a figure that does not include what local governments budget for winter weather. A police colonel then says that “compliance with the travel ban has been quite high,” although “we have had several instances of citations or summonses.” “People have been handling this very very well, and I think we’ve gotten exceptional compliance.” Finally, a fire marshall asks that people keep vents clear of snow to prevent any dangers of carbon monoxide, and also to clear fire hydrants for firefighters to reach if nessary. Pollack sums up the message from the officials: “if you’re home stay home, there’s really nothing to get out to.” Governor Baker retakes the podium and says there have been “widespread examples of moderate coastal flooding” and that the state is preparing for another high tide due at 4pm ET. “There was a sea wall that breached in Marshfield that took out a house that nobody was in,” Baker says, and when asked to assess the damage in general, he says, “I don’t think anyone think’s its much beyond what would be reasonable for this type of event.” “The news on Nantucket is good in just the last little while,” a Massachusetts emergency management official says, after the governor calls him over to the podium. But floods and power on the island town remain “an issue” the state is trying to resolve, especially with another high tide due at 4pm. “A good part of Nantucket is now with power,” the official says, “but it’s being driven by generators on Nantucket.” For emergency services, he says, there’s a shelter on Nantucket that has capacity “if people need to get out of their cold homes,” and the Nantucket hospital is operating. “Things look promising over the next 24 hours that we’ll get power back to the island.” Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker is giving an update press conference on his state, saying “for now the eastern Mass ban needs to remain in place”. The storm is “putting down as much snow as it has at any point since it started at midnight last night,” Baker says, and people in eastern and central Massachusetts “can fully expect to get an extra 5-10in of snow.” “There’re areas of Massachusetts you’d probably describe as being in a whiteout situation,” he says, and “drifting continues to be an issue. There’re drifts as high as four, five, six feet.” Baker lifts the travel ban on western Massachusetts, but that “we’d ask people to continue to cooperate with respect to the travel ban and let our emergency personnel do the work that they’re doing.” “We’ve also been in touch with many of the hospitals … and their workers have been able to get in and out of their institutions.” He also asks that people “who can and have the opportunity to look in on their neighbors, to do so, especially if they live alone.” Connecticut governor Dan Malloy just gave an update on conditions in his state simultaneous to de Blasio’s press conference. Malloy said the statewide travel ban will be lifted at 2pm, although “we still encourage residents to limit travel and use common sense.” He said that thanks to the cooperation of citizens who kept off the road, there have only been 15 accidents in the past 24 hours caused by the storm. He also reminds people that Massachusetts and Rhode Island still have statewide travel bans. Finally, Malloy says that although “nonessential state employees” don’t have to report to duty tonight, Connecticut plans to have its state government and transit systems all back in order on Wednesday morning. Officials are now coming out – sanitation, parks, etc – and asking that people be cautious on streets and in the parks, and to help cleanup workers do their job by getting out of the way when possible. The parks official says that if children want to know the best spots for sledding in New York, they can check out the parks website “so they can enjoy themselves in the snow”. New York’s mayor is delivering a statement that begins by saying it’s “a blessing” that the city “missed the worst of the storm”. “We got a much better result than the original projections portrayed. Just 20-30 miles east of the city border in Long Island they got exactly what was originally projected for here. Obviously our friends in Boston got what was projected for here.” “This storm was real, and it was big as it was projected to be,” de Blasio continues, “but it moved eastward, and thank God for that. But a lot of other people in the metropolitan area are going through a tough time, and in the north-east are going through a tough time.” He tries to frame the storm as a bullet the city just narrowly missed, illustrating that point with the short distance between Queen, which had 10in of snowfall, and Long Island, which had more than 20in: “so just literally 18 miles they got twice as much snow.” “So there’s no question of how this serious this is, how serious it was projected to be and the kind of precautions we had to take.” He goes on to praise the sanitation department for their work clearing the city, saying that they were so “extraordinarily effective” because people got out of the way. “It’s still very cold out there, it’s still very slippery,” he warns: “people need to be careful, and the farther east in the city the more careful you need to be.” He says schools will re-open as usual tomorrow, and MTA service will be back in weekday workday order tomorrow. Up to 30in of snow has clobbered New England, especially in the Boston area, where the governor shut down Logan International Airport. Crews struggled to reach the flooded island town of Nantucket, and Maine and Connecticut endured whiteout conditions into the morning. Thousands of people have lost power and emergency personnel are working clear huge snowdrifts and provide shelter. New York and New Jersey’s governors lifted most of the travel bans in their states, and Connecticut partially lifted its ban in areas where heavy snow is not still falling. The New York City subway system resumed service after a rare pause. Snowfall failed to approach anywhere near the “historic” levels predicted in New York City, with 10in recorded in Central Park. Governor Andrew Cuomo and mayor Bill de Blasio defended their travel bans, with Cuomo saying “I don’t know that this wasn’t the more prudent course of action in any event.” Transit slowly returned to normal, as inspectors cleared rail lines, cars followed plows onto highways, and flights south of Connecticut resumed delayed service. Schools in Boston will stay closed through Wednesday, while students and government workers in Washington DC will have to report for duty. Meteorologists downgraded the predicted levels of snowfall, after re-evaluating mistaken forecasts from Monday. Heavy snow continues to fall in New England, and may break records in Boston. The latest updates from the National Weather Service: Framingham, MA: 30in Littleton, MA: 28in Shrewsbury, MA: 26.2in Worcester, MA: 25in Hampton, CT: 22.5in Mattituck, Suffolk, NY: 24.8in Boston: 18.2in Plainview, Long Island, NY: 17in LaGuardia, New York, NY: 11in This will almost certainly be one of the top 10 biggest snowstorms in Boston’s history, and has a chance of breaking the city’s snowfall record of 27.5in. Not far away in Nantucket, the Weather Channel’s Dave Malkoff relays an alarming shot of the floods and where there are still sustained winds of more than 50mph – that’s the force of a tropical storm. Cape Cod has also been hit hard. “I’m ready for another round,” says a New Yorker of the storm, “and as soon as this is over, don’t talk to me.” Laurence Mathieu-Leger hit the streets for the Guardian to see how underwhelmed people are about the storm that did hit New York. Philadelphia’s mayor Michael Nutter says it would have been “’completely unfair’ and nearly impossible” to reverse the shutdown last night after it became clear that the blizzard had skipped the city, the Inquirer’s Julia Terruso reports. Terruso points out that by 7am – just an hour after the state of emergency was declared over – only an inch of snow had fallen at the Philadelphia International Airport. The city salted 1,000 miles of roads, but Nutter doesn’t know what cost all that salt and Philadelphia’s preparations will have, Terruso says. There’s also bad news for Philly’s public school students, delivered by Inquirer reporter Kirsten Graham. New York has now lifted its travel ban throughout the state, including Suffolk County, governor Cuomo announced. Governor Charlie Baker has announced that no flights will depart or arrive at Logan International Airport today, which has already received more than 11in of snow, and the Boston’s public transport – the T, buses, and the steamship authority – will all remain shut down. The snow continues to plummet there and flood damage is becoming increasingly clear as the waters start to recede. Police in Marshfield, near Plymouth, say that a “major” breach has caused damage to at least one home there. Why did it all go so wrong for weather forecasters, who en masse predicted a New York blizzard to rival that of 1888? Here’s the take of Harry Enten (@forecasterenten), friend of the Guardian and forecasting obsessive: “Snow is a tricky business… This was a bust, but thanks to wide ranges not a huge one. “In this situation, it’s fairly clear that the National Weather Service and almost everyone else got had by the Euro” – Harry means a forecasting model, not the currency of the EU or some European person trusted who felt a blizzard in her bones. “There were some meteorological reasons behind it, but let’s be clear: the Euro saw it, so we thought it… The most accurate model was clearly wrong.” Many of the models, including the GFS, Canadian mid- and short-range models, UK model and HRRR and RAP models also didn’t have the same scale storm, Harry says. “Perhaps though, the biggest warning side was the SREF – this a bunch of models run with tweaking the initial conditions because it’s impossible to precisely measure the initial conditions of the atmosphere. I don’t think more than half the members ever supported the big snows. “The writing though was mostly on the wall by [Monday] afternoon. Once the Euro went east and the others stayed steady, it should have been the key sign that something was wrong. For whatever reason, forecasters didn’t jump off the boat.” Harry is not exaggerating. Meteorologists and TV weather people did not underplay this storm. Back to Harry: “There’s nothing wrong with changing a forecast. In fact, it should be encouraged as more data becomes available. Additionally, I don’t think enough was done to communicate the model differences, and it’s also a reason for averaging models rather than just taking the best one.” The short version: Amtrak train service is still suspended indefinitely, Connecticut governor Dan Malloy has said, meaning the trains cannot run father than New York state. New York’s MetroNorth train service, on the other hand, will open on all three lines with a Sunday service schedule. Limited MetroNorth service on the New Haven line will reach the Connecticut city, with normal operations expected tomorrow. A five-hour timelapse of New York’s Times Square being covered in a layer of snow last night, courtesy the Guardian’s video desk Good news, snowy news and bad news for Massachusetts. Winds seem to have clocked their maximum speeds, between 60-70mph. But the state is still buried. And homes still don’t have power. New York and New Jersey’s governors lifted most of the travel bans in their states, and Connecticut partially lifted its ban in areas where heavy snow is not still falling. The New York City subway system resumed service after its rare pause. Heavy snow, coastal flooding and whiteout conditions have battered New England, especially in the Boston area, where more than two feet of snow have fallen. Thousands of people have lost power and emergency personnel are working to get people to shelter and clear huge snowdrifts from the roads. Snowfall failed to approach anywhere near the “historic” levels predicted in New York City, with 10in recorded in Central Park. Governor Andrew Cuomo and mayor Bill de Blasio defended their travel bans, with Cuomo saying “I don’t know that this wasn’t the more prudent course of action in any event.” Traffic and rail service will operate with delays up and down the north-east, as inspectors clear lines for service and slowly return to a normal schedule. Schools in Boston will stay closed through Wednesday, while students and government workers in Washington DC will have to report for duty. Forecasters have downgraded the predicted levels of snowfall to around a foot in New York City and 6in in Philadelphia. Delaware’s governor announced a normal return to work, but in parts of New England can still expect more than a two foot total. Flights around the region are disrupted but airports slowly returning to service, as crews open runways and airliners alert passengers of delays depending on airports. More than two feet of snow have fallen in towns west of Boston, the National Weather Service reports in its tallies of the latest snow totals, a couple of which anon. Shrewsbury, Massachusetts: 26.2in (west of Boston) Worcester, Massachusetts: 25in Baltic, Connecticut: 20.5in (south-east of Hartford) Portland, Maine: 14.8in Boston, Massachusetts: 14.5in Providence, Rhode Island: 11in LaGuardia Airport, New York: 11in The Bronx, New York: 10in Central Park, New York: 10in New Haven, Connecticut: 7in Brooklyn, New York: 6in Trenton, New Jersey: 4in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: 1in Got photos of the blizzard that both was and wasn’t? Share ‘em here at Guardian Witness. As New York eases back into normality, so does its symbiotic partner New Jersey. Per MTA chief Tom Prendergast, one of the world’s largest and oldest underground train systems has begun to restore 24-hour service after a very rare closure for weather. “Sunday-level service” should be functioning by noon, he said, meaning that about 60% of service ought to be running by that time. There is also limited bus service restored via the Port Authority. The snow continues to pour down near Boston, Massachusetts. Connecticut governor Dan Malloy is lifting the travel ban for some local roads in a Fairfield and Litchfield counties, effective 8.30am, but the ban remains in place for most of the rest of the state. He says the snow remains falling at a serious rate in eastern Connecticut, and thanks people for staying off roads. Malloy asks that people help clear storm drains to prevent flooding and clear the area around fire hydrants so that firefighters can reach them if necessary. Of power outages, he says “we only have eight.” “I think we can be up and running tomorrow on a normal basis.” He credits the compliance with the travel ban for helping avert a more deadly disaster: “Under normal circumstances we would have expected hundreds of travel accidents [last night]. We had 11.” “There’s no bad news in not everyone getting three feet of snow.” Connecticut was also hit extremely hard in some parts last night, and governor Dan Malloy is set to speak in a few minutes to give an update on the state’s plan. As day breaks over Massachusetts severe flooding continues and the snow falls at a steady clip. Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker has told citizens to call 211 for emergency information, and to help get people in need to the state’s 77 shelters. “People should take precautions, it does not mean people should go rush rush,” mayor Bill de Blasio told local New York CBS news. “We had a meteorologists across the spectrum saying this thing could’ve been two feet or more. In light of that we needed people to clear the roads. … We missed the bullet this time.” Like Cuomo, he says that it was better to be cautious based on the information available yesterday than not to err on the side of safety. In a press release he too announced that all city roads will be open for driving this morning. “We had no issues overnight in policing. New Yorkers were great,” a police representative says (his name obscured by the camera’s angle). He says people cleared the roads and let plows do their business. “The LIRR service is comign online slower in Suffolk,” Cuomo says, although they are slowly lifting the travel ban. “The roads are more significantly affected there” than anywhere else, he adds. “I also want to thank Governor Christie and Governor Malloy of Connecticut,” Cuomo says. “No one state can do this alone.” Cuomo says he’ll go out to Long Island today to deliver a briefing from Suffolk County this afternoon. Asked about the cost attached to the emergency response preparations, he says he doesn’t have an estimate at this point. He again refers to the severe Buffalo storm as a comparison, using it as a counter example of where preparations were not in place and the cost was very high. The New York subway will reach a “Sunday level service” by noon, the head of the MTA, Tom Prendergast, tells reporters. What lines exactly will be running, then, is to be determined. “You’re only as good as your last snowstorm,” Prendergast adds. “No human life was lost as far as we know” due to any transit accident, another official says, trying to put the storm in perspective of other bad storms, such as the one that struck Buffalo last year. “It is still weather, that is the nature of the beast. There is a certain imprecision,” Cuomo says, as he cautions people about still slippery road conditions and likely heavy traffic. Cuomo again defends the decision to clear the roads and shut down train service, framing it as a choice to lean toward “one way or the other”. “I would lean toward safety, because I’ve seen the consequences the other way and it gets very frightening very quickly. “We’ve had people die in storms. I’d much rather be in a situation where we say’ we got lucky’ than be in a situation and say ‘we didn’t get lucky’ and somebody died.” If you don’t have to travel today, don’t do it, Cuomo stresses. A reporter asks him about the state’s extreme caution in the face of the storm, and Cuomo talks about the storm that hit Buffalo, New York, several weeks ago, which was not forecast as particularly major and dropped many feet of snow on the city and the area around it. “You act on the information that you had at the time. … Obviously in this region there was less snow than anticipated.” Cuomo then argues that emptying the roads and keeping trains off the tracks may help clear away snow faster than to allow normal transit: “I don’t know that net didn’t wind up saving us time; because the roads were empty we could actually plow the roads.” “What very often happens is you get a couple of cars stuck on the highway,” he says, and that prevents plows “from doing their job.” “The system got back online much faster than it would have if the trains were exposed to conditions and had to shovel out this morning.” “If you tally it up I don’t know that this wasn’t the more prudent course of action in any event.” “But I do not criticzed weather forecasters. I learned.” New York governor Andrew Cuomo is giving an update about the storm. “The storm in general I think it’s fair to say was less destructive than predicted so far, but there were variances in what the storm actually did. In the New York City area about 4-6 inches of snow, in the mid-Hudson, the snow was also less than had been originally been predicted, with variations.” It was “less than predicted, which was good news,” he says. “Long Island was much harder hit than the New York City area.” “Suffolk County is still getting hit very hard, in Suffolk County is where we have serious issues.”(Suffolk County is the far end of Long Island.) He says Long Island had as much as 14in of snow. “We’ll be redeploying much of the equipment from the New York City area … to Long Island. We’re lifting all the travel bans on the road at 8 o’clock. … We coordinated that with the governor of New Jersey.”” “Obviously you can’t open the traffic ban on one state unless you’re coordinated with the other state.” “MTA is in the process of bringing the trains back out of subway and rail … They are now redeploying as we speak, service will begin at 9 o’clock. By noon, the system will be back to Sunday service, which is roughly 60% of weekday service.” Bridges and tunnels will open and PATH will open at 9.30am, he says. New York and New Jersey’s governors lifted most of the travel bans in their states, with residents of only one county still under an emergency ban. Bans remain in effect in Connecticut and Massachusetts, where much more snow fell than near New York City. Heavy snow, coastal flooding and whiteout conditions havebattered New England, especially in the Boston area, where high tide has pushed flooding into towns along the sea and some officials are evacuating. More than a foot of snow has fallen in Boston and parts of Connecticut, and swirling wind have kicked up dangerous snowdrifts in Maine. Snowfall failed to approach anywhere near the “historic” levels predicted in New York City, with little more than 6in recorded in Central Park, and 10in in Jamaica, Queens. States imposed wide ranging travel bans throughout affected regions, with the New York City subway, rail service and bridges all still affected. Forecasters have downgraded the predicted levels of snowfall to around a foot in New York City and 6in in Philadelphia. Delaware’s governor announced a normal return to work, but in parts of New England can still expect as much as 18-24in as snow continues. Around 6,500 flights in the region were cancelled, with many not expected for rescheduling until Wednesday. National Guard troops were also deployed around the north-east to assist first responders. Despite the late start the Post was premature. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has allowed cars back on the road, joining the Twitter blitz of announcements from officials that life is in fact returning to normal after a night of mild snow (south of Connecticut). There are qualifications to the statements from governors Christie and Cuomo. A travel ban remains in effect for Suffolk County, New York, Cuomo says, and Christie has said that NJ Transit won’t resume until line-by-line inspections are carried out by federal workers. New Jersey governor Chris Christie has lifted the ban for all 21 counties in his state, effective at 7.30am. From Christie: “NJDOT still has 2,500 plows and salt spreaders working to clear the roadways this morning. I am asking everyone in NJ who doesn’t have to drive this morning please don’t. And those that do, please drive slow.” New York governor Andrew Cuomo has also given a bit more detail on the state of affairs in the Empire State. Schools will open two hours late in Washington DC, NBC’s Eun Yang reports, a city that historically has struggled time and time again with even the lightest frosting. Federal officials will also have to work today, though they can do so from home. Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced the ban will lift in approximately one minute. He and other officials will provide more details at a press conference scheduled for 8am. Thousands of people and a nuclear plant don’t have power in Massachusetts, the Boston Globe and Boston local news are reporting, with some 3,500 homes reporting outages in Nantucket alone. Massachusetts’ Emergency Management Agency (Mema) has shut down the Pilgrim nuclear power plant “due to loss of offsite power”, but hastens to assure us there is “no public safety hazard”. The National Weather Service has measured 11.8in at Boston’s Logan International Airport; CBS Boston measured 18in in Oxford; and Boston’s public schools have cancelled classes for Tuesday and Wednesday, the city has announced. Mema director Kurt Schwartz has warned residents to stay out of flooding areas, and especially not to attempt drive through them. The New York station of the National Weather Service has lowered its Tuesday snow forecast by several inches, down to 2-4in for the day. Governor Chris Christie has announced that his state will start to return to work as usual. *Update: Christie has lifted the ban in toto as of 7.34am ET. But services will be spotty at best as the rest of the region still treads cautiously over icy and snow conditions. The New York Stock Exchange will open today, Reuters reports, with trading as normal now that the blizzard warning has lifted for New York. New York City schools are closed, as are most businesses. Reuters did not report how Wall Street traders who do not live in the financial district might reach the Stock Exchange, considering the closed subways and city travel ban. When will the travel ban on New York be lifted, my colleague Nicky Woolf (@nickywoolf) has asked the NYPD. “The determination has not been made. It will be made based on conditions.” Asked who had final say on the determination, the press officer told him: “the mayor’s office makes that determination.” Asked if they’ve heard from the mayor’s office this morning: “that’s not something we’d discuss.” Meanwhile local New York news has been told by the MTA: “there is no plan in place to get people back on the roads or any of the rails.” With the north-east waking up to a little snow south of Connecticut and a lot of it to the north, a quick summary of the first major snowstorm of 2015: Heavy snow, coastal flooding and whiteout conditions have battered New England, especially in the Boston area, where high tide has pushed flooding into towns along the sea and some officials are evacuating. More than a foot of snow has fallen in Boston and parts of Connecticut, and swirling wind have kicked up dangerous snowdrifts in Maine. Snowfall failed to approach anywhere near the “historic” levels predicted in New York City, with little more than 6in recorded in Central Park, and 10in in Jamaica, Queens. Governors in states including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts imposed wide ranging travel bans throughout affected regions, with the New York City subway, rail service and bridges all still closed. All vehicles were banned from roads in 13 counties in New York, with drivers facing $300 fines if caught in violation of the restrictions. Forecasters have downgraded the predicted levels of snowfall to around a foot in New York City and 6in in Philadelphia. Delaware’s governor announced a normal return to work, but in parts of New England can still expect as much as 18-24in as snow continues. Around 6,500 flights in the region were cancelled, with many not expected for rescheduling until Wednesday. Train routes between New York and Boston were also cancelled. National Guard troops were also deployed around the north-east to assist first responders. Blizzard warnings and travel bans remain in place throughout much the region as heavy snowfall is forecast to continue into Tuesday. If you’re just waking up this brisk Tuesday morning and trying to figure out whether life as you know it has been consumed in a wintry snowpocalypse in the order of Dante or Hoth – this is the list for you.

Meteorologist at large Eric Holthaus tells New York that it has in fact reached 10in of snow… just that you won’t see that much unless you’re in Jamaica, Queens. Statistics and meteorology guru Harry Enten of FiveThirtyEight has shifted forecasting gear: where he once hoped for snow he now sees awkward officials. In New York concerns are far more mundane as the clock strikes 6am. The earliest of birds are checking out streets deserted of all but emergency personnel (and delivery trucks for the New York Post). Subways and rail service are still shut down, even though plows have even reached as far as the side street where this reporter lives in Brooklyn. Governor Andrew Cuomo does not seem particularly eager to get the city rolling again, taking time to gaze at a desolate bridge, courtesy New York public transportation. Massachusetts may be suffering the worst of 2015’s first major winter storm, as high tide has started pushing into towns along the coastline. CBS Boston’s Eric Fisher quotes an official of Scituate, near Plymouth, as saying that authorities are trying to evacuate people from their homes due to the flooding. Gusts are over 60mph in some towns, Fisher says. The Boston area still expects several hours of heavy precipitation, and could end up with a storm as massive as predicted. In Maine, meanwhile, there are whiteout conditions. The National Weather Service no longer has a blizzard warning in effect for New York’s five boroughs, the lower Hudson Valley and east New Jersey, though it has a winter storm warning in place until midnight Tuesday. The NWS also warns of strong winds and biting snow coming off those gusts, but final snowfall totals are far below what forecasters predicted even 12 hours ago. In Philadelphia and central New Jersey, forecasters are now calling for about 6in; about an hour ago, about 6.3in had fallen in Central Park on Manhattan, and 7.6in at LaGuardia Airport in Queens. In New York City, meanwhile, the subway and most services are still shut down, despite Manhattan receiving only about a third of the predicted snowfall. The snowstorm had an uneven effect along the coast, failing to approach anything close to New York’s blizzard of 1888, but still proving extremely dangerous for New Englanders. Delaware, on the other hand, has received very little snowfall, and is already back on track for a normal Tuesday morning, the governor has announced. Another shot from Boston, courtesy the National Weather Service. The Weather Channel reports winds gusting more than 60mph on Nantucket, and puts snowfall in Plymouth, Massachusetts (a town south of Boston along the coast) at an accumulated 15.8in so far. Marlborough, Connecticut, now has more than 13in, the Channel reports. In other words Massachusetts and Connecticut are on track to have very serious storms, even as New York City, Delaware and the states to the south seem to have largely escaped. Meteorologist Jim Cantore and the Weather Channel’s Steve Petyerak are in Boston, where very serious weather continues. Nearby Nantucket police are reporting “significant flooding” on the island south of Cape Cod, as high tide and high winds continue to batter the Massachusetts coast. Good morning and welcome to our continuing coverage of the storm that has so far delivered far less than the historic amount of snow predicted for much of the US east coast, but continues to pummel Boston and parts of New England. Snowfall has not reached the record-breaking levels predicted in New York City and across the north-east US, with little more than 6in recorded in Central Park, 10in in Marlborough, Connecticut, and reports of coastal flooding and power outages in Boston, where forecasters still think more than a foot total could fall. Governors in states including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts imposed wide ranging travel bans throughout affected regions, after forecasters had earlier predicted snowfall as deep as three feet. In New York City the mayor Bill De Blasio took the drastic step of closing the subway system, one of the largest and oldest in the world, at 11pm as the travel ban came into play. All vehicles were banned from roads in 13 counties in New York, with drivers facing $300 fines if caught in violation of the restrictions. By 1.30 ET, however, some forecasters appeared to have downgraded the predicted levels of snowfall to around a foot in New York City. Predictions were still as high as two feet in Boston, Massachusetts. Around 6,500 flights in the region were cancelled, with many not expected for rescheduling until Wednesday. Train routes between New York and Boston were also cancelled. National Guard troops were also deployed around the north-east to assist first responders. Blizzard warnings and travel bans remain in place throughout the region as heavy snowfall is forecast to continue into Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/22/ed-miliband-labour-decarbonisation-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-22T17:20:24Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband commits Labour to 2030 decarbonisation target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/22/ed-miliband-labour-decarbonisation-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/22/ed-miliband-labour-decarbonisation-energy","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband commits Labour to 2030 decarbonisation target","bodyText":"Ed Miliband has intensified the pressure on the coalition and its troubled energy plans by committing Labour to delivering a virtually carbon-free electricity system by 2030. The future of UK energy has been at the heart of a row within the government described as \"unholy war\" by one senior participant – with the energy secretary, Ed Davey, backing a decarbonisation target but the chancellor, George Osborne, implacably opposed. A broad range of industry, campaigners and even former Tory ministers have warned that the policy row is unsettling major investors and leading to uncertainty that could send energy bills soaring. \"Britain's growing green industry is facing a crisis of the government's own making, caused by scepticism at the heart of government. It is a policy shambles,\" Miliband told the Guardian. \"But it is not just an embarrassment for the government, it is a crisis for the UK.\" Speaking at the country's biggest onshore windfarm, Whitelees, near Glasgow, the Labour leader said investment in renewable energy had halved between 2009 and 2011, echoing warnings from senior industry figures that the coalition row had stopped investment. The windfarm, which spreads out across low, heather-clad hills, currently has 140 turbines and will add another 75 turbines soon, giving it a capacity equivalent to more than half a nuclear power station (about 550MW). The government's problems over its energy policy were an \"appalling shambles\", Miliband said. \"It beggars belief as it was the thing Cameron picked out as the symbol of his modernisation. It now looks like total hypocrisy.\" Miliband said he understood some people opposed onshore turbines and that sensitivity was required in siting them. \"But onshore wind has to be part of the plan. You can't say no to everywhere. We have an urgent imperative to tackle climate change.\" Tim Yeo, the Tory MP who chairs the influential energy and climate change select committee, said Miliband's commitment was important. \"It is significant because the issues are very long-term ones that require policies in place for several parliaments. I hope it will influence the government's decision on the energy bill.\" There has been fierce disagreement within the coalition over whether the much-delayed energy bill, now due next week, will contain a target for decarbonising the nation's electricity by 2030. This is despite the government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), recommending the target. If Osborne's opposition prevails, it will be the first time a government has rejected a CCC recommendation, a decision Yeo said would be \"brave\". \"Investors are questioning whether the government knows what its own policy is,\" he said. Because political uncertainty makes funding investment more risky and expensive, \"the absolute consequence is that electricity bills will be higher than they need to be,\" Yeo said. On Tuesday, Davey said he was \"acutely aware\" of investors' concerns. David Kennedy, the CCC chief executive, said: \"It is important to set [a 2030] target because investors need a signal of the direction of travel beyond 2020, without that we will not get investment now that we need. There is a high degree of policy uncertainty at the moment and that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.\" Charles Hendry, recently sacked by Cameron as energy minister, said this week that without a ceasefire in the coalition energy row, there was a risk that energy bills would \"go through the roof\". He suggested consumers might bear a totally unnecessary extra cost of £1bn a year, a sentiment also found among senior energy industry leaders. \"It is absolutely an outcome,\" one executive told the Guardian. \"Banks are horrified about how risky all this has become. We have very unclear and contradictory narratives.\" Hendry's replacement, John Hayes, has twice contradicted Davey by claiming \"enough is enough\" in relation to onshore wind turbines. Cameron refused Davey's request to relieve Hayes of that responsibility. Miliband said: \"Cameron is allowing Hayes free rein but he needs to be brought into line.\" He added: \"The most important challenge is to tackle the Osborne fallacy, that you can have a good economy or good environment, but not both. He is disproving his own argument by dragging his feet on the environment and hurting the economy. \"The early commitment [to a 2030 target] is a way to help keep energy bills down. The CCC is very clear: we cannot afford not to do this. If the coalition does not do it, that's absolutely what we will do.\" Miliband said he would also push forward with amendments to the energy bill if the target is absent. He added: \"Furthermore, the green economy is already a big jobs generator and could be a massive jobs generator.\" Government data shows the green economy is one of the few fast-growing sectors and employs almost one million people, more than teaching. Matthew Spencer, director of Green Alliance, said: \"Ed Miliband has demonstrated a good understanding of the UK's energy infrastructure challenge.. Government has to provide certainty beyond 2020 so that companies can invest in British factories to supply the next generation of low-carbon power stations. There are already around 10,000 British jobs promised in new offshore wind turbine assembly alone, but they will be at risk if the coalition delay the decision on decarbonisation until after the election.\" Friends of the Earth's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: \"With coalition promises to champion the environment rapidly evaporating it's more important than ever for Labour to show real political leadership. Ed Miliband played a key role in passing the UK's ground-breaking Climate Change Act – with his strong backing for a decarbonised power sector he's showing the long-term vision that Cameron's government lacks.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2012/aug/17/house-prices-rise-faster-wages","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-17T09:15:38Z","webTitle":"House prices rise three times faster than wages over a decade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/17/house-prices-rise-faster-wages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2012/aug/17/house-prices-rise-faster-wages","fields":{"headline":"House prices rise three times faster than wages over a decade","bodyText":"Many aspiring homeowners feel like they have to \"win the lottery\" to buy a house, as the price of the average property in England has soared by more than three times the rate of average salaries over a decade, according to a report. In 2001 the average price of a home in England was £121,769, and the average salary was £16,557. In 2011 the price of the average home was £236,518 – an increase of 94% – while wages had risen by just 29% to £21,330, the National Housing Federation said. The disparity is even greater in some areas. People living in Copeland in the Lake District, where according to the local borough council about 50% of the working population is employed by the Sellafield nuclear power plant or reliant on it for related employment, have seen the biggest increase in the gap between average house prices and wages: house prices have risen by 145% and incomes by just 5% over the past 10 years. In Watford the average house price is up 76% to £246,455, while the average salary has fallen by 13% to £15,272, and in Corby in Northamptonshire the gap has also widened markedly. There, the average house price has more than doubled from £60,594 to £132,381, while a local salary has increased only marginally from about £17,000 to £18,522. Across the country, those who earn enough to buy a house will have to put down a far bigger percentage of the property price than they did in 2001. In 2001 the deposit for a typical 90% mortgage was £12,177, about nine months' salary, according to the NHF, which has compiled its data from Land Registry and ONS figures. Now, because banks and building societies have tightened their lending criteria, a buyer can typically expect to put down a 25% deposit at £59,129, almost three years salary. For someone in Copeland, this means they would now typically have to find a deposit of more than £32,000 compared to the £5,000 they could have put down in 2001. David Orr, chief executive of the NHF, said: \"With the gap between income and house prices growing ever wider, people can often feel like they have to win the lottery to be able to buy in their local area. \"A shortage of homes means the price to buy them is being pushed ever higher by the market, and out of reach of millions of hard working families. Unless we start building more homes people can truly afford to match the demand, this will only get worse.\" Last Thursday, figures released by the government showed that the number of new house builds started in the three months between April and June this year was at a three-year low. Commenting on the NHF report, housing minister Grant Shapps said: \"We are pulling out all the stops to help people across the country realise their dream of homeownership. We've introduced the NewBuy Guarantee, enabling aspiring homeowners to buy with just a fraction of the deposit they would normally require; the FirstBuy scheme, offering a valuable alternative to the bank of mum and dad; and Funding for Lending, to make mortgages cheaper and easier to get.\" The problem of saving for a deposit while renting was highlighted by a separate report from LSL property services, which owns estate agency chains such as Your Move and Reeds Rains, showing that rents in England and Wales reached a record high in July. Tenants are now paying an average of £725 a month, 2.9% more than in July 2011. In response to LSL's research, the head of Britain's biggest housing charity, Shelter, said \"out of control\" rents were having a devastating impact on ordinary families who are having to cut back on food and other essentials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2012/nov/16/fukushima-food-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-16T14:55:21Z","webTitle":"Fukushima's food champion fends off taint of nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/fukushima-food-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/nov/16/fukushima-food-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima's food champion fends off taint of nuclear disaster","bodyText":"The laughter coming from diners in a corner of Kenji Suzuki's restaurant is flowing as effortlessly as the beer. The chatter cuts through the steam drifting from a nabe, or hotpot, in the centre of the table. There is talk of work, and praise for the chicken, vegetables and tofu being transferred to bowls from the bubbling stock. Their exuberance is unusual, not just because the working week is only a day old, but because every dish is made with produce many Japanese have spent the past 20 months doing everything possible to avoid. In an age when serious diners insist on knowing the provenance of their food, the example set by Suzuki's restaurant is hard to beat. About 80% of his menu – from perilla-infused pork to daikon pickles and sake – is from Fukushima. When it opened on a quiet street in the Takaido neighbourhood of Tokyo in June last year, 47 Dining's prospects were decidedly gloomy. Suzuki's business plan defied logic: to offer dishes made with ingredients sourced mainly from his hometown of Iwaki, just over 20 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, then still in a perilous state after three of its reactors suffered meltdowns in the 11 March triple disaster. \"We were supposed to open in April that year, but then the tsunami and nuclear accident changed everything,\" Suzuki, 30, said as he prepared for a busy evening. As soon as he knew his parents had been found safe after being swept along by the tsunami in their car, his thoughts returned to his business, which began in 2009 with a van selling Fukushima produce around Tokyo. \"The day after the disaster, I thought this place was never going to open,\" he said. \"In the weeks after, nothing from Fukushima was going on the market and all our restaurant promotion events were cancelled. \"But then I saw how the tsunami had ruined ports, destroyed seafood and agricultural produce, and I thought 'what can I do to help?'\" What had started as a straightforward business venture became a mission to help the fishermen and farmers of Fukushima prefecture. \"The biggest problem was the nuclear accident,\" Suzuki said. \"Most people seemed to think that everything from Fukushima had been irradiated.\" His plans were not helped when, a month after the restaurant opened, tests found that beef cattle from Fukushima containing abnormally high levels of caesium had been processed and eaten. Confidence in Fukushima produce was shaken again last November, when rice samples from some parts of the prefecture were found to contain caesium levels exceeding government limits. Fukushima, once a byword for some of Japan's finest beef, fruit and seafood, had become indelibly associated with nuclear contamination. Anonymous callers told Suzuki he was bringing that contamination to Tokyo, while posters on online forums accused him of poisoning his customers. Within weeks of the restaurant opening, bookings had plummeted as nervous diners stayed away. \"People watched the news and decided it was not worth the risk, even though we have never served anything that hasn't been tested and cleared as safe,\" said Suzuki, who moved to Tokyo 10 years ago. The restaurant buys produce only from markets where the produce has passed stringent government regulations on radioactive isotopes. At 47 Dining, the chicken, pork, beef and horse meat is all from Fukushima, as is the rice and most of the vegetables. Lining the counter are bottles of sake made from rice from around the prefecture. One glaring exception is the seafood. Octopus and whelks were declared safe this summer and, after trial sales at supermarkets in Fukushima, are once again on sale at Tokyo's Tsukiji market. But fishermen are still banned from operating in large areas of the Pacific off the Fukushima coast, and last month, a study in the journal Science found that radiation levels remained elevated in waters near Fukushima Daiichi, warning that large and bottom-feeding fish could be inedible for a decade. For now, Suzuki buys fish from Miyagi and Iwate prefectures – where most of the 19,000 people killed by the tsunami had lived – and from Hokkaido in the far north. Seafood aside, radiation levels in other produce have fallen. Of 105,000 or so food items from the disaster area checked between April and September this year, about 1,360 – half of them from Fukushima – exceeded the caesium limit, according to the health ministry. They included mushrooms, wild game and other produce sourced from forests, rivers and lakes, where radiation tends to be higher, and are all subject to bans. Armed with those reassurances, public concern over the safety of Fukushima produce slowly diminished, and people started coming to Suzuki's restaurant in droves. \"I eat here regularly because the food is fantastic,\" said diner Mika Matsumoto. \"I'm not worried about radiation because we know that everything has been tested, and tested again. The farmers and fishermen who lost their businesses are doing their best to get back on their feet. If we are helping them by coming here, then that's a plus.\" But Suzuki, who recently helped launch a scheme to use restaurants to rejuvenate the economy in Iwaki – home to about 20,000 people evacuated from the nuclear exclusion zone – concedes it will be some time before Fukushima shakes off its association with tainted food. \"I'm sure some people will never eat Fukushima produce,\" he said. \"At the same time there are plenty of others who already are. But people eat here not because of where our dishes come from – they come because they know they're going to get great food.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/13/fukushima-reactor-meltdown-flooding-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-13T11:23:38Z","webTitle":"Plan to flood Fukushima reactor could cause new blast, experts warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/13/fukushima-reactor-meltdown-flooding-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/13/fukushima-reactor-meltdown-flooding-warning","fields":{"headline":"Plan to flood Fukushima reactor could cause new blast, experts warn","bodyText":"Experts have warned of a potentially dangerous radiation leak if Japan proceeds with plans to flood a damaged reactor containment vessel at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The facility's operator has admitted uranium fuel rods in the No 1 reactor partially melted after being fully exposed because of the 11 March tsunami. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said water levels had fallen to at least one metre below four-metre-long fuel rods inside the reactor core and melted fuel had slumped to the bottom of the reactor's containment vessel. The damage is more severe than Tepco had previously reported and is almost certain to frustrate its quest to bring the plant under control within six to nine months. Officials said the leaked fuel was being kept cool and there was no risk of an explosion of the kind that blew the roof off the reactor in March. The discovery was made after engineers were able to enter the reactor building, where they adjusted water gauges, for the first time since the plant was crippled by the earthquake and tsunami. Officials said initial findings indicated a large leak in the pressure vessel but temperatures remained well below dangerous levels. \"There must be a large leak,\" Junichi Matsumoto, a general manager at the utility, told reporters. \"The fuel pellets likely melted and fell, and in the process may have damaged the pressure vessel itself and created a hole.\" Nuclear safety official Takashi Sakurai said: \"The situation in the core hasn't changed [since early in the crisis] and the fuel rods are being cooled by water continuously being injected into the core.\" Japan's nuclear safety agency said it believed partially melted fuel had fallen to the bottom of the pressure vessel, which holds the reactor core together, and may have leaked into its concrete base, known as the dry well. Greenpeace has urged Tepco to abandon plans to flood the container with water, given the likelihood that melted fuel has damaged it. Shaun Burnie, nuclear adviser to Greenpeace Germany, said: \"Flooding a reactor that has fuel [that has fallen] through the pressure vessel is not a good idea.\" Outlining a worst-case scenario, Burnie said very large amounts of cold water hitting the melted fuel could cause an explosion, trigger substantial damage to the reactor and create a \"high risk of atmospheric release running for days, if not weeks.\" He added: \"I think [the flooding option] will now be scrapped.\" Greenpeace said problems could escalate rapidly if the fuel melted through the reactor vessel. \"As the fuel rods were fully exposed and subsequently melted, it is highly likely that the core's integrity is compromised and that there is larger amount of melted fuel at the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel.\" John Large, an independent nuclear engineering consultant in London, said Tepco's plan to flood the reactor was riddled with \"potential risks\". It appeared not to have factored in the extent of damage to the fuel rods and the structural state of the containment vessel, including whether it was watertight. \"It seems to be poorly thought through,\" he said, adding that the firm had not demonstrated that the strategy could work. Matsumoto ruled out a possible explosion but said: \"We have to revise the flooding method. We can't deny the possibility that a hole in the pressure vessel caused water to leak.\" The use of water to keep the reactors cool has led to the build-up of about 70,000 tons of contaminated water at Fukushima Daiichi. Tepco is pumping the water into a nearby storage building while it sets up a decontamination system. Cooling water has leaked from the cores of reactors 2 and 3. One other unit at Fukushima Daiichi did not contain fuel rods at the time of the earthquake, while another two have achieved \"cold shutdown\" – their cooling water is below boiling point. The permanent or temporary shutdown of reactors at Fukushima Daiichi and other nuclear plants could leave only a third of Japan's 54 reactors in operation by the end of the month, NHK has reported. The public broadcaster said the disaster had prompted the suspension of 14 reactors, while 19 others were offline for inspections. Two reactors at Hamaoka nuclear plant in central Japan are to be shut while a tsunami wall is built. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, has ordered the temporary closure of Hamaoka, which sits on an active fault line, amid warnings that it could be crippled by another huge earthquake expected to hit the region in the next 30 years. In all 35 reactors – or about two-thirds of Japan's total – will have been shut down by the end of May. Officials are hoping to achieve a 15% cut in energy use during the summer to avoid rolling blackouts. The government has decided to use taxpayers' money to help Tepco compensate tens of thousands of people affected by the Fukushima accident. Total damages are expected to run into trillions of yen, equating to tens of billions of pounds. Reports said the government would issue special-purpose bonds worth 5tn yen (£37bn), with other utilities asked to pay into a newly established fund. Tepco would be required to contribute annual premiums and allow monitoring of its management by a government-appointed commission. Analysts said the scheme would ensure Tepco's status as a listed firm and prevent market instability, although there are fears that the costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher electricity bills. \"This scheme will help alleviate concerns of financial market turmoil because holders of Tokyo Electric shares and bonds will be protected,\" Yasuhide Yajima, a senior economist at the NLI Research Institute, told Reuters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2014/dec/12/lima-climate-talks-final-day-live-coverage","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-12T22:23:59Z","webTitle":"Climate talks: summit chief warns 'we need to work' as deadline passes – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/dec/12/lima-climate-talks-final-day-live-coverage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2014/dec/12/lima-climate-talks-final-day-live-coverage","fields":{"headline":"Climate talks: summit chief warns 'we need to work' as deadline passes – as it happened","bodyText":"As negotiators haggle and night descends on Lima, we’re going to wind the blog down for now. Here’s a summary of the key events as talks ran into overtime. Talks are expected to continue long into the night, although the summit’s president says he’s “optimistic” a climate deal will be struck today. Some negotiators expect no resolution until sometime Saturday. Key passages, pertaining to renewable energy commitments and how developing and wealthy nations will split the cost of climate change action, exposed deep rifts among negotiators. An influential NGO advocating for developing countries has called the current draft text “a disaster for the planet and the poor”. Germany’s environment minister, Barbara Hendricks, says that bilateral meetings with countries including the US and China leave her hopeful that stumbling blocks can be overcome between now and a crunch summit in Paris next year. A draft text revealed what Oxfam called a “choose your own adventure” of climate change action. US secretary of state, John Kerry, has warned that countries must take action because climate science is “screaming” at the world. Oxfam press officer Ben Grossman-Cohen has released a brief statement with its assessment of the talks’ major debates: Separate discussions are proceeding to overcome sticking points on the approach to finance in the time pre-2020, which is oddly referred to as ‘long-term finance’. Compromise proposals are floating around among negotiators but these have yet to be made public. The current state of play is that the outcome will likely be very weak. Proposals to create a roadmap for reaching the $100bn promise have been watered down to merely “inviting” developed countries to provide further information on this goal. This makes it very unlikely that developing countries will get the clarity, predictability and support they need to boost climate action in the next few years.” Deep distrust rankles some representatives at the talks, especially among small nations and the US and China. Ahmed Sareer, negotiator for the Maldives, has succinctly expressed to my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji): “How many CoPs will it take for us to really see any tangible results? We have been going from CoP to CoP and every time we are given so many assurances, and expectations are raised, but the gaps are getting wider,” he said. “There has been a clear commitment of $100bn a year but how are we really being offered? Even when they make those pledges how do we know how much is going to materialise? There is no point of knowing that behind the wall there is a big source of funds available unless we can reach it,” he said. “We are told it is there in a nice showcase, but we don’t get to meet it. We don’t get to access it. These are difficult issues for us.” Check out the Suzanne’s full piece on the state of the talks here. “Ridiculously low” commitments from rich nations to help pay for climate change efforts are frustrating powerful players such as India, my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji) reports from Lima. It was also unclear how industrialised countries could be held to an earlier promise to mobilise $100bn a year for climate finance by 2020, negotiators from developing countries said. “We are disappointed,” said India’s Prakash Javadekar. “It is ridiculous. It is ridiculously low.” Javadekar said the pledges to the green climate fund amounted to backsliding. “We are upset that 2011, 2012, 2013 – three consecutive years – the developed world provided $10bn each year for climate action support to the developing world, but now they have reduced it. Now they are saying $10bn is for four years, so it is $2.5bn,” he said. You can read the full piece here. Several Latin American have chosen to dramatically increase oil production recently, putting them in the crosshairs of other nations and environmental groups at the summit, Reuters reports. Brazil is going full speed with investments in areas off its coast that could hold up to 35bn barrels of oil. Scrambling for energy as a severe drought depletes hydro power plants’ reservoirs, the country has just approved new coal-fired plants that would be partially financed by the government. Mexico has recently approved new legislation that would allow foreign investments in oil production, breaking up local company Pemex’s monopoly. The country estimates it has some 27bn barrels of unexplored oil. Ecuador, Colombia and Peru all have similar plans in place. Mexico and Peru are in controversial junctures. The former simultaneously “approved an ambitious climate change law [and] reformed energy legislation to increase oil investment,” Gabriela Nino, a coordinator at the Mexican Center for Environmental Rights told Reuters. Peru’s government is debating whether to exempt certain oil companies from environmental reviews, a decision that would accelerate exploration projects. Guy Edwards, a climate expert at Brown University called the countries out to the news wire: “If you take the domestic policies of many of these countries, the rhetoric is still much ahead of the action.” Vidal’s update on the state of the talks has had a predictable effect on journalists covering the summit, which looks poised to keep up its marathon pace late through the night and into the morning. Vidal concludes by saying he won’t open the floor: “We need to work.” “I will probably reconvene some time tonight a new stocktaking plenary, and [say] how we’re going to move this process forward … Thank you very much, let’s go to work.” Vidal, the summit chief, says that today’s talks have been productive, but his optimism is tempered. “We still need more time. We don’t want to create a process that won’t allow all the parties to express their position on the document that the co-chairs released last evening.” He asks the ADP chairs to continue talks for two hours, and adds that he’ll personally help mediate negotiations. “We are almost there. We just need to make a final effort. … We are almost there. There is no reason to stop this process, there is no reason to postpone our decision. … We will find solutions.” “What do we expect? We want to have a very clear decision, here in Lima as part of the strong outcome of the COP20 text. … We want to have the Lima draft text with the elements of the negotiating text as a way to give input to this process, but also as a way to show to the world that we are building this process step by step.” The co-chair of the ADP just gave a few brief remarks. “Some parties indicated where their red lines were, what were their preferred options, and assured their indication where their flexibilities may lie. “We continued till 1pm as you instructed this morning, but then learning you had been further flexible … we continued our negotiations. He says that at 3pm there were at least 20 parties still on the floor trying to raise concerns when they finally convened, but that they’ll have a chance yet. The summit update is finally underway, with Pulgar Vidal, the president, beginning: “As you remember, I instructed [last event for everyone] to produce a new text. That text was released at 10.30pm, so the co-chairs produced a text first that was shorter than the text producer before that one. “Second, [it is] a more focused text, mainly on the issues that we need to go [for] more deeply. “Third, the text [will be based] on confidence and seek consensus.” “Also, this is a text I am sure will move us forward to a very strong outcome by the end of this meeting, I hope today. “So please, I want to give the floor to the co-chairs to brief on the discussion that they have begun on that text. After that, I will give further instruction on the way to go forward.” Negotiators have been asked to choose between three options on almost all of the draft’s major issues, most of which are divided by one question: how will developing and wealthy nations split the bill? My colleague Suzanne Goldenberg (@suzyji) explains a bit of the UN-NGO-climate change jargon: In addition to finance, one of the biggest areas of contentious is “differentiation” in UN parlance – which countries should bear the burden of cutting emissions that cause climate change. Countries are also divided over the initial commitments countries are expected to make on fighting climate change – known as “intended nationally determined contributions”. Meanwhile the nations are also debating just what the draft will set out. The US and other industrialised countries want all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Back to Suzy for what that means: That would be a departure from the original UN classification of the 1990s – which absolved China, India and other developing countries which are now major carbon polluters – of cutting their emissions. Developing countries are suspicious that the text being developed in Lima is an attempt to rewrite those old guidelines. “I am certain that developing countries the majority of them will have a problem with the way they framed responsibility. Most developing countries will be concerned about that,” said Tasneem Essop, head of strategy for WWF. Rich countries, the US among them, only want to commit to carbon cuts. Developing countries want them also to commit financing for climate adaptation, eg renewable energy investment. Friends of the Earth campaigner Asad Rehman has harsh words for the political actors involved. And also an explanation for why this stocktaking session has yet to begin as scheduled: lunch. I’ll be bringing updates in live, but you can watch summit president Pulgar Vidal’s “informal stocktaking” speech online here, via the UNFCCC’s stream. As my colleague Suzy Goldenberg reported earlier, Vidal’s speech was postponed from 1pm to 3pm – after the original plan fell through to announce a deal at 12pm. These signs, along with the history of talks in Doha and Warsaw, all suggest that talks will stretch into the night, with a new goal of reaching a deal sometime this weekend. The auditorium where the speech will take place is just now filling up with reporters, so one more indeterminate delay is already in action … “We’re out of time,” Samantha Smith of the WWF has just told reporters at a press conference, framing the talks in dire – but not impossible – terms. There is a solution to climate change, this is the thing that’s almost unbelievable about these negotiations. There are solution to fossil fuels, which are the main [cause of climate change], in a shift to clean renewable energy.” “It’s just that we’re out of time. Emissions need to peak within the transition and the transition has started. Emissions need to peak within the next five to 10 years, ideally within the next five. “So this is a space where we cannot sit and wait for change to happen, it needs to happen here, it needs to happen in the 12 months to Paris, it needs to happen in Paris.” Sandeep Chamling Rai places the dangers in the context of human lives: “This is an issue of life and death for millions of people in vulnerable countries, like Nepal.” The summit president is scheduled to to deliver an “informal stocktaking” speech in a few minutes, 3pm local time. Peru’s indigenous people want a voice in the conversation, David Hill writes from Lima. Over in the “Indigenous Pavilion” at the Voces del Clima event Roberto Espinoza, from indigenous federations AIDESEP and COICA, is lamenting the lack of indigenous peoples’ participation at the formal negotiations. He told an audience at the pavilion that the original idea was to have it in the COP20 itself, but this was the best they could do. “They’re feeling the pressure of indigenous peoples,” he says, “but want to manage us from a distance. We want to be inside.” Peru’s indigenous groups don’t have an official say in the talks other than indirectly, through the government. The nation is in the midst of a protracted fight over natural resources and protection for its extraordinary range of rare ecosystems where many groups live. Five main issues still need resolving, a negotiator at the summit told Dan Collyns (@yachay_dc) on condition of anonymity. The legal status of the elements draft. The scope of INDCs Information on INDCs. Ex-ante considerations Ex-post assessments of existing commitments Translated (slightly): INDCs are the pledges countries are expected to make by end of next year’s first quarter on a climate deal. Ex-ante considerations are the gritty details concerns; the ex-post assessments mean analyzing how current plans are working out. The negotiator added that the second point, the scope of the INDCs, was proving the biggest sticking point. “We shouldn’t be worried about the window if we’re still building the foundations,” summit president Pulgar Vidal has told Dan Collyns, who’s just filed a bit more from his conversation with Peru’s environment minister. Pulgar said that he has asked delegates to reduce the text from 47 pages to seven pages last night (Thursday) to speed along the process. This is a process which we are building brick by brick we shouldn’t be worried about the window if we are still building the foundations. “I think by assessing the INDCs we are going to know exactly how we are, so that is the next step and then we’re going to move to Paris to try to alleviate the current consequences of climate change. “We have begun this COP with a good atmosphere, we have launched it with the spirit of Lima; it’s not only good weather and good Pisco – it is that Peruvian spirit - but with a good outcome.” Talks are expected to run into overtime tonight. The summit’s president says he’s “optimistic” a climate deal will be struck today but some negotiators expect talks to continue on Saturday An influential NGO advocating for developing countries has called the current draft text “a disaster for the planet and the poor” Germany’s environment minister, Barbara Hendricks, says that bilateral meetings with countries including the US and China leave her hopeful that stumbling blocks can be overcome between now and a crunch summit in Paris next year A draft text shows that negotiators are still yet to agree on key passages of a deal US secretary of state, John Kerry, has warned that countries must take action because climate science is “screaming” at the world I’m handing over the live blog reins to my colleague Alan Yuhas (@AlanYuhas) in the US, so keep this page open for the latest news from Lima. Dan Collyns has just caught up with the summit’s president, Peru’s Manuel Pulgar Vidal. Despite what some negotiators are saying about the talks rolling into Saturday (see 17:32 update), he is still hopeful a deal will come today. He told Collyns: The parties agree that we are not going to leave this COP [Conference of the Parties, the name for the annual UN climate summits] with empty hands, that by of the end of this COP we are going to have a good outcome… and the agreement of a new global text. I am completely optimistic that we can deal with some of the objections and that by the end of today we are going to have a strong outcome, we should avoid for the future, for the next year, a sense of frustration, a sense of anxiety and anguish which we have already suffered in the past, so the best way to do that is to take a decision today. Pulgar Vidal reportedly said earlier in the week that he was looking forward to sipping a pisco sour with delegates at 6pm (Lima time) on Friday night. As the BBC’s Matt McGrath notes, “few believe that the deadline will be met. Mr Pulgar-Vidal may well be sipping his drink alone.” We’ve just published a gallery of photos from week two at Lima. Here’s a taster, but the full thing is worth a look. Further delays. An “informal stock-taking” by the president of the talks, Peruvian environment minister Manuel Pulgar Vidal, has been moved back to 3pm (local time). A “mixed bag” is how WWF describes the current draft text. The head of its delegation, Tasneem Essop, says in a statement: Negotiators are out of time here in Lima and everything is still up in the air. The current draft text contains a mixed bag of options – the good, the bad, and the ‘good enough.’ So we can’t call the outcome quite yet. We are really concerned that the current draft lacks specific actions to address pre-2020 emissions necessary to limit warming to 1.5-2C. It seems that governments in Lima are happy to leave hard decisions on climate change to the governments of tomorrow. This is a recipe for a climate nightmare. We are happy that the current text contains the recognition for elements of a draft negotiating text for Paris and we need to ensure that remains. The text also rightly includes up front information requirements for national contributions due in 2015, but these must be strengthened, especially with regard to review, finance and adaptation. Meena Raman from the influential NGO the Third World Network said at a press conference in Lima: “This bottom-up process [of countries setting their own pledges] which is trying to be locked in at Lima would be a disaster for the planet and the poor.” She added: “We don’t see Lima outcome as fair, equitable, or even balanced.” A deal in Lima today looks unlikely, says our correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg: And some speculation on what the Lima deal will be called (following such previous hits as the Durban Action Platform, the Copenhagen Accord, and the Doha Climate Gateway) At a daily briefing, Ban Ki-moon’s spokesman is asked about the UN secretary general’s view on Greenpeace’s climate talks stunt at the Nazca lines in Peru earlier this week, which it later apologised for. The spokesman said: The preservation of world heritage sites is critically important for the world as its name implies. People who feel they need to demonstrate a particular point need to do so in a peaceful fashion. *This post has been amended; it erroneously included a reference to an errant cellphone ringer not relevant to the spokesman’s other comments. Barbara Hendricks, German minister for the environment, has been giving a press conference. One of the sticking points after Lima, she said, would be the legal form of the climate pact to be agreed in Paris next year (more on that in this story here). On our way to Paris there are still many stumbling blocks remaining. I mention only three of them. Differentiation. How will common but differentiated responsibilities be addressed under the new agreement? Do we continue to divide world into two parts, or will there be a continuum for commitments, both for mitigation and for finance. [see 13:09 update] Balance. How will relationship between the expected mitigation commitments of all countries and of financial support in the new agreement. Legal form. How far do we reach legal bindingness in Paris for the rules applying to our contributions and for the contributions themselves. In addition to the negotiations, I had several bilateral discussions... I gained the impression that there is a great willignness to overcome the stumbling blocks, and find ambitious solutions together that are acceptable to all states. That leaves me confident for the next year but I still think we need more effort and more speed. US secretary of state, John Kerry, says climate science is “screaming at us” and calls on negotiators to set aside old differences between rich and poor countries A draft text released overnight sparks criticism from developing countries that ambition has been watered-down A leaked briefing note from a bloc of countries with a history of ‘blocking’ at the talks says that no climate deal is better than a bad one One of the blocs at the talks, the Like-Minded Development Group, is reportedly saying in private (and now pretty publicly via a leak) that no deal is better than a bad one. The group includes several big oil producers – Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia – and India. “If in the end, no consensus can be reached in time, it is possible to transmit the relevant documents for further work to the next meeting We do not consider this a failure at all. Instead, it is a mark of progress, especially progress in the process,” says a briefing note for the bloc, published by climate news site RTCC. More from the countries on the sharp end of the talks. Suzanne Goldenberg reports from Lima: I’ve been talking to Ahmed Sareer, the Maldivian diplomat who will take over leadership of the Alliance of Small Island States, early next year. It’s a good reminder of what’s at stake for some countries – and of how frustrating they must find the slow pace of these negotiations. As a low-lying string of islands, the Maldives is dealing with multiple effects of climate change – dying coral reefs, ocean acidification, sea level rise and contamination of its water supply, Sareer said. On 4 December, the country’s desalination plane caught fire, knocking out the country’s only source of safe drinking water. It’s still not up and running yet. “How many CoPs [Conference of the Parties] will it take for us to really see any tangible results? We have been going from CoP to CoP and every time we are given so many assurances, and expectations are raised, but the gaps are getting wider,” said Sareer. “Even if you look at the finance, there has been a clear commitment of $100bn a year, but how much are we really being offered? Even when they make those pledges how do we know how much is going to materialise? There is no point of knowing that behind the wall there is a big source of funds available unless we can reach it,” he said. Karl Mathiesen has been talking with the Marshall Islands president, Christopher Loeak. The Pacific island state’s president says that although the Lima talks are tense and difficult, “there is a deal to be done and everyone is getting on board”. What is your reaction to the reports that progress in Lima has stalled? “My team in Lima is reporting that negotiations are tense and difficult, with too much time being spent on procedural haggling. This is disappointing but I am expecting the positive momentum we have seen from Leaders this year to translate into a strong outcome in Lima. It seems that some of those blocking progress have failed to make the leap to seeing climate action not as a threat but as a great opportunity. This is a new world where everyone needs to contribute to the global effort on climate change.” What is your message to countries blocking progress? “Enough is enough: my country’s future is at stake. We expect the world’s biggest emitters to take my peoples’ plight as seriously as they would their own. How can they expect us to leave Lima without a decision to require countries to explain the targets they put on the table next year? Do they expect us to sign an agreement in Paris without knowing what it all adds up to? This is ultimately what will determine my country’s future.” How will the situation in Lima affect the Paris talks? “As my foreign minister said yesterday, Lima must plant the seeds for success in Paris. Following the UN Climate Summit in September, the People’s Climate March in New York, and the most alarming scientific reports we have ever seen, there has never been a stronger mandate for aggressive climate action.” “Paris won’t be another Copenhagen [the 2009 climate summit that floppped] – the world has changed too much. The world’s two biggest emitters – China and the US – are now on the same page and understand the need to act. There is a deal to be done and everyone is getting on board.” Here’s a quick round-up of reaction from Twitter. The current draft text comes in for more flak but gets some credit for progress. Elizabeth May is a Canadian MP who regularly attends the talks – she says developing countries are angry: And here’s Friends of the Earth: (for more on what “loss and damage” is, see 13.29 update). Here’s the view from the US NGO, the National Resources Defence Council, a regular UN talks watcher: And that of Joss Garman of UK thinktank IPPR: The World Bank’s climate expert isn’t impressed, calling the current wording “vapid”. Dan Collyns, one of our reporters at the summit, has an update on India’s thoughts and where the divisions lie: Splits remains on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. While the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, called on Thursday for developing nations not to repeat the mistakes of the past, countries like India, a prominent member of the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group on Climate Change argue they have the right to lift their people out of poverty. “If I have to change my current technology, if I have to look to futuristic things, it is going to cost, and someone has to pay this cost,” Ashok Lavasa, of the Indian government delegation, told the Guardian. “The cost should be born by everybody...but more so by people who have also enjoyed the fruits of their development, and historically have occupied a lot of space with the carbon emissions; this space has to be left for other people to grow.” Despite the criticism of the latest draft text at the summit, Nobel Peace Price winner and former US vice-president Al Gore is pretty boosterish about prospects at Lima. In a video with the conference organisers, he says: I hope when the gavel falls, it will be seen as a truly historic success, in setting the stage for a successful agreement in Paris one year from this week. Already so much progress has been made that it’s obvious that the spirit of Lima has been extremely powerful in bringing people together from every continent, every income group, from every culture and every national background. One of our journalists, Karl Mathiesen, is currently travelling in the Pacific island states, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands. He reports on the view of Lima from there, a region threatened by rising sea levels: “Some people know, but I don’t care,” reckons my taxi driver about the Lima climate talks. Everyone in the Marshall Islands capital Majuro knows about climate change. Every destructive weather event, from drought to king tide, is blamed on carbon emissions. Major inundations in March and October have ensured people are worried about the threat to their homes. Most of the Marshallese who have Facebook have watched videos of Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, the poet who spoke at the UN Climate Summit in New York in September. There is immense pride in her standing up and speaking for them. But crises here tend to be more immediate - like where the next bag of rice is coming from. “I just don’t see climate change as a daily point of conversation here. The whole issue is generally new to people,” says Giff Johnson, the editor of the Marshall Islands Journal. “It’s just in the last couple of years that people are starting to become aware of it.” Many of the same people who laud Jetnil-Kijiner complain that Tony de Brum, the foreign minister so prominent in international climate circles, is a jetsetter who spends public money on overseas trips. There is little recognition of his advocacy, the UN climate process or its relevance to these islands. You can read more from Karl in Kiribati here. The BBC’s Matt McGrath, in Lima, reports on developing country concerns over the draft text. Some countries are suspicious that the text being developed here in Lima is an attempt to get round the concept of differentiation [see 13.09 update], which is embedded in 1992’s UN framework convention on climate change. The issue has become critical as the chairs of the talks introduced a new draft text that many felt watered down the original commitment [see 12.07 update]. A large group of developing nations known as the G77 objected. “This whole exercise is not meant to rewrite the convention, this is a firm basic position of the G77,” said Antonio Marcondes, Brazil’s representative at the talks. “We stand behind the differentiation, we stand behind ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’, these are issues we hold very strong and these are definite red lines.” Even the trade unions, who are usually very supportive of the talks, are not happy with the latest version of the text. The TUC notes that a line from previous climate summit texts, about countries “implementing their policies and measures to promote a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs”, doesn’t appear in the current Lima document. Frances O’Grady, the union’s general secretary, says: The labour movement is increasingly mobilising to support an ambitious UN climate change treaty in Paris next year. We are conscious that all jobs are at risk without a commitment to emission reductions, adaptation, finance and technology. This is why we have always supported the UN process. However, the lack of thought being given to the possible effect on workers, added to the absence of references for the need for a just transition, has raised major concerns among the international trade union delegation in Lima. I just caught up with Philip Pearson, senior policy officer at the TUC. He stressed that unions are right behind the efforts for a climate pact, but the TUC is “really brassed-off” at the lack of a reference at the moment to the dialogue, safety nets for workers and investments that’ll be required as high carbon industries (oil, coal, gas, and attendant mining) theoretically shrink and low carbon ones (renewable energy and nuclear power) grow. “Trade unions are really up for this whole UN climate treaty but we are deeply frustrated by the lack of reference to the effort required,” he said. India’s Down To Earth magazine, which is reporting from Lima, says it looks like the final text will not include the principle of “loss and damage”. This is the idea pushed by some developing countries that they should receive financial compensation for the damage caused by extreme weather which has been exacerbated by rich countries’ historical emissions. Developed countries are unsurprisingly not keen on it, and will point to their $10bn contributions to the separate Green Climate Fund, designed to help poor countries cope with global warming. Karl Mathiesen wrote a good guide for us on loss and damage during the Warsaw talks last year. Some reaction to Kerry’s speech. Samantha Smith, leader of WWF International’s Global Climate and Energy Initiative, seems pleased at his intervention: Negotiators in Lima must not forget that we are facing a planetary emergency. Secretary Kerry is correct in highlighting the science that tells us we are already facing unprecedented impacts from climate change, and that to steer the world’s climate to stay below 2C global warming, we have to act now. We need countries to step up financial commitments and to ensure that we have a strong negotiating text to discuss in Paris. We cannot afford to fail the vulnerable people of the world who are depending on us to ensure that they have a world worth living in. While Friends of the Earth US is unimpressed with what it perceives as the gap between Kerry’s rhetoric and US action. Senior analyst Karen Orenstein said: It is past time to put words into action. The emissions cuts the US has put forward put us on a path for a global temperature increase well beyond the already dangerous 2C level. Secretary Kerry said, ‘If you’re a big developed nation and you are not helping to lead, then you’re part of the problem.’ Regrettably, the US is a tremendous part of the problem, and as the hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Lima and New York have demanded, this must change immediately. The marches she’s referring to are the thousands who marched in Lima on Wednesday, and the hundreds of thousands of people who marched in New York and around the world in September. UK-based blog, Carbon Brief, has compiled a very good jargon-buster explaining the acronym soup that is served up at all the climate negotiations. For example, one of the key principles bandied around is “common but differentiated responsibility”. Mat Hope explains it succinctly thus: Developing countries often talk about ensuring any new global deal respects the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. This basically means designing a deal where those with the greatest historical responsibility for climate change and the means to implement low carbon policies take the biggest and earliest steps to cut emissions. This principle was enshrined in the UNFCCC, which separated countries into three groups: Annex I, Annex II, and non-Annex I. And yes, it even explains what UNFCCC stands for too. Suzanne Goldenberg has been analysing the detail of Kerry’s speech yesterday (see 11.34 update). She writes: John Kerry, in his speech to the meeting on Thursday afternoon, inserted some pointed language that reads as if it were a last-minute addition intended to try and get the talks moving. He called on negotiators to set aside the old divisions between rich and poor countries and recognise that it would take a global effort to fight climate change. “No single country including the United States can solve this problem or foot this bill alone,” he said. “If we somehow eliminated all of our carbon pollution, guess what? That still wouldn’t be enough.” Nor would it be enough if China or India cut all their emissions, Kerry went on. “If even one or two major economies fail to respond to the threat, it will counter-act much of the good work that the rest of the world does.” In a slight at countries such as Australia and Canada which have backtracked on climate promises, Kerry said said industrialised countries in particular had to step up. “If you are a big developed nation and you are not helping to lead then you are part of the problem,” he said. Kerry also said countries should be heartened by the example set by the US and China which jointly agreed last month to cut carbon pollution. “That is a historic milestone and it should send a message to all of us that the road blocks we have had for decades can be removed from our path.” The ‘Adopt a Negotiator’ project has posted a line-by-line analysis of the latest draft deal, which they brand “a lowest common denominator text”. Among other criticisms, they say the text is too vague in its language and the level of ambition too low. According to the UN’s latest timetable, Lima should be all wrapped up by 2pm today. Don’t hold your breath though. The 2011 talks, in Durban, ran nearly two days over... Suzanne Goldenberg reports on the overnight negotiations: Late last night, the heads of the working group went to Manuel Pulgar Vidal and admitted they were stuck. He then instructed them to go back, and give him some kind of text he could work with. They produced the seven-page draft, and they will go on from here trying to produce some kind of outcome. There are “stocktakings” at 10am and 1pm local time that should give a sense of where negotiations are heading. AP has a bit more on the splits behind exactly what a pledge on climate action looks like (see my earlier update about the latest draft text): Rich countries insist the pledges should focus on efforts to control emissions and are resisting demands to include promises of financing to help poor countries tackle climate change. Top carbon polluter China and other major developing countries oppose plans for a review process so the pledges can be compared against each other before Paris. Brazil’s top negotiator, Antonio Marcondes, called the review an “unnecessary effort” that would detract from the main goal of reaching an agreement next year. France, which as host for the crucial summit in Paris next year has a huge vested interest in the success of Lima, has said it’s quite possible some of the key issues will get bumped until 2015. Laurence Tubiana, the top French climate ambassador, told climate news site RTCC: “Some issues will not be resolved here, but it’s fair enough, if they are too big it’s about changing the real ambition of the whole world. But we can have clarity.” RTCC also notes that the atmosphere at the talks so far has been “remarkably happy”, in contrast to Warsaw last year, which saw walk-outs by NGOs and furious clashes between blocs of countries. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body which runs the talks with the Peruvian hosts, has published the latest version of the draft text. A quick look shows huge sections still up for grabs, with multiple options listed for key paragraphs. I’ll try not to bore you too much with excerpts from the text, but take for example this passage. Negotiators are still haggling over just what a pledge to tackle climate change should constitute. In the jargon, a pledge is an ‘intended nationally determined contribution’. Option two is the modestly more progressive one, where countries agree to actually do more than they’re doing already to cut emissions. But there’s also a third, stronger option which some countries are pushing, to have more than just cutting emissions count as a pledge – they want climate financing and adapting to warmer temperatures to also count as a pledge. Oxfam’s not too impressed by the current state of the text. Its policy adviser, Jan Kowalzig, says: This text needs significant improvement. The options presented are like a choose your own adventure novel, some could put us on a barely workable path heading into Paris, while others may doom us to a dangerous future. The ingredients for some progress in Lima are on the table, but negotiators need to have the courage to use them. Unless the text improves, whatever options negotiators choose over the next day will leave many very difficult issues unresolved and keep the world headed down a treacherous road towards extreme warming. Looking through the draft text, it appears the options 1-3 throughout on a scale from 1 being weakest to 3 being strongest. Behind a Peruvian army base near Lima, ministers and officials from nearly two hundred countries are trying today to agree on a draft text to avoid dangerous global warming. The hosts, led by Peru’s environment minister Manuel Pulgar Vidal, say that officially there will be a deal by noon local time (5pm GMT – I’ll use local times from here on in). But judging from previous Conferences of the Parties, as the annual UN climate summits are called, the climate talks could run late into the evening, and quite likely continue on Saturday. As our reporter on the ground, Suzanne Goldenberg, noted last night, progress has been slow. At the time of publishing, negotiators had agreed just a single paragraph of the text, which is to form the basis of climate pact to be formally signed at Paris next year. From our story: “We are going backwards,” said Alden Meyer, who monitors the climate negotiations for the Union of Concerned Scientists. Those at the talks still have every expectation that Lima will produce some kind of agreement by Friday evening, or more likely early Saturday morning – but the paralysis is in stark contrast to the upbeat backdrop to the summit’s opening. “I am not really sure that we will see a clear outcome coming here in Lima,” said the former Mexican president, Felipe Calderón, who addressed the meeting. By Thursday morning the text, which had started at a reasonable six pages, had ballooned to about 50, with negotiators throwing in their objections to almost every single clause. Just one section, paragraph 34, on countries intensifying engagement in the years up to 2020, has been agreed by negotiators. In a successful negotiation, observers say that by this point officials would be whittling down to the final text to a manageable size. “We have seen the laggards throwing in language of all kinds into the negotiating document,” said Tony de Brum, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands. Thursday also saw John Kerry, the US secretary of state, address the meeting. He didn’t announce any new measures or financing, but told delegates the science of climate change was “screaming” at them to act on carbon emissions. Here’s the full speech, and an excerpt: Rest assured, if we fail, future generations will not and should not forgive those who ignore this moment, no matter their reasoning. Future generations will judge our effort not just as a policy failure, but as a massive, collective moral failure of historic consequence, particularly if we’re just bogged down in abstract debates. They will want to know how we together could possibly have been so blind, so ideological, so dysfunctional, and frankly, so stubborn that we failed to act on knowledge that was confirmed by so many scientists in so many studies over such a long period of time and documented by so much evidence. The truth is we will have no excuse worth using. The science of climate change is science, and it is screaming at us, warning us, compelling us – hopefully – to act. Ninety-seven percent of peer- reviewed climate studies have confirmed that climate change is happening and that human activity is responsible. And I’ve been involved, as many of you have, in public policy debates for a long time. It’s pretty rare to get a simple majority or a supermajority of studies to say the same thing, but 97 percent over 20-plus years – that is a dramatic statement of fact that no one of good conscience or good faith should be able to ignore. Now you only have to look at the most recent reports to see in all too vivid detail the stark reality that we are faced with. Scientists agree that the emission of climate pollutants like carbon dioxide, methane, soot, hydrofluorocarbons all contribute to climate change. In fact, basic science tells us that life on earth wouldn’t exist at the heretofore 57 degrees average temperature Fahrenheit which allows life to exist. Without a greenhouse effect, life wouldn’t exist, and if the greenhouse effect is good enough to provide you with life itself, obviously, logic suggests that it’s also going to act like a greenhouse if you add more gases and they’re trapped and you heat up the earth. This is pretty logical stuff, and it’s astounding to me that even in the United States Senate and elsewhere, we have people who doubt it. And here’s the video: As the New York Times notes, a deal announced by China and the US last month on tackling emissions has generated a lot of warmth towards the US at the talks, where it is often painted as the pantomime villain: When it comes to global warming, the United States has long been viewed as one of the world’s worst actors. American officials have been booed and hissed during international climate talks, bestowed with mock “Fossil of the Day” awards for resisting treaties, and widely condemned for demanding that other nations cut their fossil fuel emissions while refusing, year after year, to take action at home. Suddenly, all that has changed. At the global climate change negotiations now wrapping up in Peru, American negotiators are being met with something wildly unfamiliar: cheers, applause, thanks and praise. ... The U.S. is now credible on climate change,” said Laurence Tubiana, the French climate change ambassador to the United Nations, who is leading efforts to broker a new agreement to be signed by world leaders in Paris next year. Veterans of two decades of climate change negotiations called the turnaround in America’s image profound. “Countries got weary of negotiations with the U.S.; it got tough in negotiations, but it didn’t deliver,” said Yvo de Boer, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. “Now the U.S. has policies in place to deliver on its word.” Stay tuned here for the latest news and developments from Lima.

Prof John Schellnhuber, the current adviser to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and previous adviser the president of the European commission and other governments, said the UK was missing out owing to its failure to replicate the successful use of feed-in-tariffs (Fits) to kickstart its renewables industry. Schellnhuber also said that the world's energy system could be transformed to a cleaner and cheaper renewable model for the same expenditure already paid out in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. In 2010, $409bn was given to the oil, gas and coal industry as subsidy, with just $66bn going to green energy. In an interview with the Guardian, Schellnhuber, who heads the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said the cost of transforming the infrastructure to run the world on renewable energy was roughly the same as current subsidies for carbon fuels. \"The money is absolutely available,\" he said. He added that, while up-front investment was needed to create the clean infrastructure, it would be much cheaper to run in the long term. \"Renewables are by definition inexhaustable, so do not lead to the piling up of debts. They are also evenly spread: the wind is blowing almost everywhere, the sun is shining almost everywhere. In the end renewables are the quintessential democratic energy source,\" he said. But he warned: \"The world economy is still locked into the wrong paradigm.\" Energy costs are cut today by bequeathing debts to future generations, he said. \"We are exploiting the future by using the atmosphere as a waste dump.\" This was also the case for the broader economy, he said, where government spending today was dumped on future generations through national debt: \"It is the very simple strategy of governments in the industrialised world to avoid social tensions by providing the so-called lower classes with benefits without taking the money from the rich. You maximise the benefit. It is the dictatorship of the present.\" Schellnhuber said an international deal could not be done at the UN climate change talks, resuming on 28 November in Durban, South Africa, and where he will participate in a high-level policy discussion with the host president, Jacob Zuma, and others. But Schellnhuber said he was confident that the energy transformation was underway, with \"pioneer\" nations such as Germany and South Korea leading the way, probably followed by China. \"The German story is very encouraging,\" he said. The Fits and other policies had led to a \"grassroots revolution on the energy supply\". The big energy companies such as RWE and E.ON are asking themselves, \"will anyone need us in 20 years' time\", he said. In the UK, by comparison, the government is being taken to court after slashing subsidies for solar power by 50% with just six weeks' notice. \"Britain could have a very important role if it reconsidered the role of nuclear,\" Schellnhuber said. \"I am a physicist and not afraid of nuclear power plants but if you factor in all the costs including nuclear waste treatment or dismantling a nuclear plant, it is the most expensive energy source. The myth of a low-cost, safer and easily manageable nuclear alternative [to renewables] is keeping the UK from becoming a member of the fitness club for the 21st century and a real partner for countries like Germany in the third industrial revolution.\" A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"Nuclear will have a role to play in our future energy mix – as it does today – but we've always said that will be as part of a portfolio approach, of which renewables and clean coal and gas will play a key role too.\" He highlighted a statement made by Chris Huhne in October: \"We do what any rational investor does with their own pension fund – we spread our risks, we have a portfolio.\" The end game for climate change and energy is this critical decade, he said, as there will then be evidence of large-scale clean energy in operation and the imperative to make sure emissions start declining globally by 2020. If the clean energy transformation happens fast enough, Schellnhuber believes the global temperature rise can be held to 2-3C. If not, a temperature rise of 5C by 2100 is likely, and more beyond, with impacts rated as catastrophic by scientists. \"My advice is to invest everything we have into a smart and sustainable energy system, despite the financial crisis,\" he concluded. \"And almost as a side effect we will solve the climate crisis.\" Last week, the International Energy Agency warned that unless major changes are made to plans for new fossil fuel power plants in the next five years, it will become impossible to hold global warming to a \"safe\" level of 2C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/fossil-fuels-pension-divestment","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-30T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"Where can investors who worry about climate change put their pension?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/fossil-fuels-pension-divestment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/fossil-fuels-pension-divestment","fields":{"headline":"Where can investors who worry about climate change put their pension?","bodyText":"\"We're going after the fossil fuel industry,\" Bill McKibben tells about 1,800 cheering fans in a Washington, DC, theatre. \"They're trying to wreck the future, so we're going after some of their money.\" Al Gore notwithstanding, McKibben – an author, academic and founder of the grassroots climate group 350.org – is America's leading environmental activist. His 21-city Do The Math tour begins a campaign to persuade colleges, churches, foundations and governments to divest their holdings in coal, oil and natural gas companies. \"It does not make sense,\" McKibben tells the Washington audience, \"to invest my retirement money in a company whose business plan means that there won't be an earth to retire on.\" He's right about that, but the divestment campaign raises a thorny question: where can investors who worry about climate change put their money? Divest for our Future, 350.org's divestment website, recommends \"environmentally and socially responsible funds\". The trouble is, the biggest and best-known mutual funds that call themselves environmentally and socially responsible also invest in fossil fuel companies. They evidently haven't heard McKibben's message. For example, the Parnassus Equity Income Fund (assets: $4.8bn/£2.9bn), which says it takes environmental, social and governance factors into account when investing, holds about 14% of its assets in oil, natural gas companies and electric utilities that burn fossil fuels. The TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund (assets: $1.23bn/£0.77bn) says it seeks out companies that are \"strong stewards of the environment\", but owns shares in dozens of oil and gas firms including Hess, Marathon and Sunoco, and a pair of shale gas giants, Devon Energy (which was named the \"producer of the year\" by Oilsands Magazine) and Range Resources. Then there's the Calvert Equity Portfolio (assets: $2.4bn/£1.5bn), which calls itself \"a leader in sustainable and responsible investing (SRI)\", but has about 10% of its portfolio in fossil fuels. One of its biggest holdings is Suncor, which says on its website that it was \"the first company to develop the oil sands, creating an industry that is now a key contributor to Canada's prosperity\". Finally, the Domini Social Equity Fund (assets: $793m/£495m), which describes its portfolio as \"consistent with social and environmental priorities\". Among its top 10 holdings is Apache Corp, an oil and gas exploration and production company. More fossil fuels than can be safely used None of this can be called responsible if you accept McKibben's math, which he unveiled last summer in a groundbreaking article in Rolling Stone. Using data from the non-profit Carbon Tracker Initiative, McKibben estimated that the earth could burn another 565 gigatons of carbon dioxide and stay below 2°C of warming, a climate target agreed upon by nearly all of the world's nations. But fossil fuel corporations already have 2,795 gigatons in their reported reserves – five times the safe amount. \"It will be burned,\" McKibben said in DC, \"unless we find ways to intervene\". In light of McKibben's numbers – which have not been challenged by the fossil fuel industry – exploring for more oil and gas is folly. The world already has more than it can safely use. Cary Krosinsky, a founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, told me that SRI funds should rethink their support for fossil fuels. \"When one 'Does the Math', you see several possible outcomes. Business as usual is unacceptable – it apparently leads to catastrophe. Incremental change is likely to be insufficient. That leaves radical transformation. Either way, fully owning the most invasive fossil fuel companies will probably turn out to be bad for portfolios as well as society longer term.\" Funds should at least underweight \"the more environmentally invasive sectors,\" he says. I emailed CREF, Parnassus, Calvert and Domini to ask about their oil and gas holdings. Parnassus did not comment, and CREF referred me to a policy saying that it does not \"exclude entire sectors from consideration for ESG (environmental, social, governance) reasons\" because it wants to remain broadly diversified. Instead, it takes a \"best in class approach\", selecting top companies from each sector. By email, Adam Kanzer, managing director and general counsel at Domini, said Domini was reviewing its approach to oil and gas. \"Bill McKibben is absolutely right to focus attention on fossil fuel investment, and I fear his math is correct,\" he said. Domini already excludes nuclear power coal, the integrated oil giants and companies that derive significant revenue from tar sands development. \"Our funds' energy exposure is currently tilted toward natural gas, which we continue to view as a 'transitional' fuel towards a renewable energy future,\" Kanzer said. \"A move away from fossil fuels can't happen overnight, and it's important to support \"better\" sources of energy even as we look to alternatives.\" Bennett Freeman, Calvert's senior vice president for sustainability, said McKibben's call for divesting was valid – \"but there's not just one valid approach\". Calvert, he said, engages actively with companies like Shell, Devon Energy and Anadarko, urging them to recognise and respond to climate risks, and to invest more in renewable energy. \"Doing what we do, which is to challenge and confront these companies, is also valid,\" he said. If nothing else, all this indicates the difficulty of the task McKibben set for himself. He's taking on the industry that undergirds the global economy. Seven of the 10 biggest companies in the Fortune magazine's Global 500 list are oil companies – Shell, ExxonMobil, BP, Sinopec, China National Petroleum, Chevron and Conoco Phillips. By comparison, the 1980s campaign to end investment in apartheid South Africa was small beans. Harvard's students voted recently to divest fossil fuels, but the university's governing body will resist. So will other mainstream institutions. Until the socially responsible mutual funds get out of fossil fuels, can you blame them? Marc Gunther writes about business and sustainability.

France's biggest company is to purchase 60% of SunPower Corporation, the second biggest solar panel manufacturer in America, and use it as a new springboard into a renewable sector struggling for competitive edge. Shares in SunPower surged 40% after it revealed a \"friendly tender offer\" from an oil company that had been expected to put major new investment into nuclear rather than solar or wind, at least until the Japanese earthquake raised new questions about the safety of atomic power. \"The world future energy balance will be the result of a long-term transition in which renewable energies will take their place alongside conventional resources,\" said Philippe Boisseau, president of Total's gas and power division. Total has been raking in enormous profits from oil at $120 a barrel – but is said to see renewables energy as a useful hedge. High crude prices make alternative power sources more attractive but the solar industry has also been hit in places such as Britain, Germany and Spain which have started to cut their public subsidies as part of wider plans to reduce debt levels. Total is not an entire newcomer to renewables. It has held a half share in two solar firms since the early 1980's – Photovoltech and Tenesol. In November Total unveiled plans to build a solar panel manufacturing plant in the Moselle region of France with annual capacity of 220,000 solar panels a year. The oil company will now inject $1bn into SunPower over the next five years allowing the US solar business to \"accelerate our power plant and development business,\" according to its chief executive Tom Werner. SunPower has been hit by mounting competition from lower cost Chinese panel makers but still claims to design, manufacture and deliver the highest efficiency solar products in the industry. BP and Shell made major forays into renewables but have backed off in recent years. BP shut down its stand alone Alternative Energy head office while Shell sold off a major part of its photovoltaic module production to SolarWorld of Germany in 2006 and then disposed of its solar rural business in the developing world. Total had been investing in nuclear having acquired an 8.33% interest, in the consortium commissioned to develop the European pressurized reactor project in Penly, France, with EDF and GDF Suez. The Fukushima plant accident – coupled with the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident – has spread a pall of negativity over nuclear energy business."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-crisis-russia-nato-talks-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-05T23:02:23Z","webTitle":"Ukraine crisis: Diplomacy fails to yield result as Russia stays put in Crimea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-crisis-russia-nato-talks-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-crisis-russia-nato-talks-live","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine crisis: Diplomacy fails to yield result as Russia stays put in Crimea","bodyText":"• A day of diplomacy failed to yield visible result, as Russian forces held their positions in Crimea and impassioned crowds on both sides joined in tense confrontations in multiple cities in Crimea and beyond. • A government building in Donetsk in southeastern Ukraine changed hands from police to pro-Russian demonstrators. In Sevastopol, Russian forces blocked a Ukrainian naval vessel. • A UN envoy to Crimea was ejected by a pro-Russian crowd from Simferopol. The reportedly hostile crowd surrounded the envoy’s car and temporarily cornered him in a cafe. International monitors in Crimea were the target of protests. • Europe announced a $15bn aid package for Ukraine, atop a $1bn aid package announced by the US administration and supported by Congress. • Doubts about the resolve of Europe to put together a sanctions package against Russia were dismissed by diplomats. European Union leaders were to meet Thursday to make a decision on sanctions. More on sanctions here. • The United States failed to bring the Ukrainian and Russian foreign minister face-to-face through a day of meetings in Paris, but US secretary of state John Kerry said “concrete” progress had been made and all sides had agreed to pursue a diplomatic solution. • Nato announced a full review of all cooperation with Russia, suspended planning for a Nato-Russian joint operation to escort Syria chemical weapons and suspended staff-level civilian or military meetings with Russia. • The Pentagon said the US military was doubling its commitment of aircraft to joint NATO-policing missions in the Baltics. And Dostoyevsky makes an appearance. The US state department is circulating 10 recent claims of Russian president Vladimir Putin “justifying Russian aggression in the Ukraine, followed by the facts that his assertions ignore or distort.” The list is introduced with a Dostoyevsky allusion that we have to say is kind of a stretch: As Russia spins a false narrative to justify its illegal actions in Ukraine, the world has not seen such startling Russian fiction since Dostoyevsky wrote, “The formula ‘two plus two equals five’ is not without its attractions.” 1. Mr. Putin says: Russian forces in Crimea are only acting to protect Russian military assets. It is “citizens’ defense groups,” not Russian forces, who have seized infrastructure and military facilities in Crimea. The Facts: Strong evidence suggests that members of Russian security services are at the heart of the highly organized anti-Ukraine forces in Crimea. While these units wear uniforms without insignia, they drive vehicles with Russian military license plates and freely identify themselves as Russian security forces when asked by the international media and the Ukrainian military. Moreover, these individuals are armed with weapons not generally available to civilians. Read the whole list here. The German foreign minister: “not satisfied”: Guardian Europe editor Ian Traynor (@traynorbrussels) and Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) have written up the day in inconclusive diplomacy: Negotiations in Paris between John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, broke up without agreement on Wednesday. The Americans and the Europeans hoped to persuade Moscow to open a dialogue with the new government in Kiev and also to withdraw its forces in Crimea to their bases and allow in international monitors. But while Lavrov accused the Americans of tabling unacceptable ultimatums, Kerry said there were “a number of ideas ” up for discussion. Both men are expected to resume negotiations in Rome on Thursday after consulting their respective presidents, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin. “Things have moved in a good direction,” said Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister. Read the full piece here. Robert Serry, the UN envoy threatened earlier today by a pro-Russia crowd in Crimea, is in Istanbul temporarily but plans to head soon for Kiev, the UN said. Reuters has a newly detailed description of what happened (with, notably, a question as to whether there were weapons involved; Serry’s assistant had said she saw at least one man with a gun in the group): His interpreter, Vadim Kastelli, said Serry was escorted to the airport without being given a chance to pick up his bags from his hotel and placed on the first flight out. Kastelli, who was with Serry at the time, said the incident began when Serry was blocked by a group of men in civilian clothes after a meeting at a Ukrainian military compound. Kastelli said he saw no weapons, although a journalist for Britain’s ITN television said Serry told him at least one of the men was armed. According to U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson, who spoke to reporters in New York by telephone from Kiev, Serry had been visiting the naval headquarters in the regional capital, Simferopol. “On his way out, he was threatened and brought to his car. There were unidentified people, some of them armed, telling him to leave and go to the airport,” Eliasson said. “He refused but his car couldn’t move, and he decided he would depart (on foot).” Eliasson said Serry felt “seriously threatened,” though he dismissed as false earlier reports that Serry had been kidnapped. Kastelli said the men insisted they should take Serry straight to the airport and out of the country, but Serry refused and eventually left his surrounded vehicle on foot. Kastelli said he became separated from Serry when the envoy left the scene. The ITV journalist, James Mates, said Serry, currently the U.N. Middle East envoy and previously Dutch ambassador to Ukraine, later took shelter in a cafe and agreed to leave Crimea to end the standoff. Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko says “it is up to them” [the US and UK] “to choose the methods to stop the aggressor. But they must do it immediately,” the Associated Press reports. Tymoshenko was speaking at her Kiev office. The West must do “everything that will stop the aggressor. Period,” Tymoshenko said, arguing that as the signatories of a 1994 treaty, which guarantees Ukraine’s security in exchange for it giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons, the U.S. and Britain must now deal directly with Russia. A packed diary for the US secretary of state. British prime minister David Cameron spoke with US president Barack Obama earlier today as the latter flew from Washington to Connecticut, Reuters reports. No details were immediately available. Kerry and Deshchytsia are on the same side, but their national soccer / football teams, which have just faced off in Cyprus, aren’t. The Guardian’s lively live blog coverage of that match is here. Here’s a summary of Kerry’s news conference: • Kerry said “All parties agreed today that it is important to try to decide these issues through dialogue”... “today we initiated that process that over the next couple of days, we hope, can bring us to that path of de-escalation.” • Asked why the Ukrainian and Russian ministers had not met, Kerry said that that was never the intention, but that he had flown Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia to Paris on his plane because “This is a Ukrainian decision, and we respect that.” • Kerry denied an EU sanctions package was failing to coalesce. “There’s been no movement away from the possibility,” he said. • Kerry said “concrete” progress had been made: “I personally feel that I have something concrete that I can take back and talk to president Obama about ... and I believe that foreign minister Lavrov is in exactly the same position with president Putin.” • Kerry called on Russia to enter direct dialogue with Ukraine, to withdraw troops in Crimea to bases and to accept international monitors in Ukraine. “Russia’s violation has actually united the world in support of the Ukrainian people,” he said. “I was encouraged today that Russia indicated that they would prefer to see us to be able to find that path” to a diplomatic solution, Kerry said. “That’s the beginning of a negotiation.” He’s done. Kerry denies a European sanctions package is failing to coalesce: “I don’t think it’s been weakened at all by what you call European reluctance,” Kerry says. He cites his conversations with EU leaders and foreign ministers today. “People are very serious about that. There’s been no movement away from the possibility.” “I think today was very constructive. Without promising something that is not defined yet... I want to be realistic. This is hard, tough, stufff, and a very serious moment. I’d rather be where we are today than where we are [sic] yesterday.” Kerry speaks in French with a reporter, who asks whether Russia has moved favorably toward the Western position and then asks about progress on sanctions. “The decisions for the Europeans are the decision for the Europeans, and they’re meeting tomorrow,” on sanctions, Kerry says. “Don’t assume that we did not have serious conversations which produced creative and appropriate ideas and possibilities for how we can resolve that. “I personally feel that I have something concrete that I can take back and talk to president Obama about, ... and I believe that foreign minister Lavrov is in exactly the same position with president Putin. Kerry is asked why Lavrov did not meet with Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia. “I had no expectation, zero expectation, that today that kind of meeting would take place... We did not ask the foreign minister to come here with that purpose,” Kerry says. “We brought him here because we knew it would have been inappropriate for us” to talk with Lavrov without consulting with Deschchytsia, Kerry says. “This is a Ukrainian decision, and we respect that.” Kerry says he’ll be in touch with the Ukrainians later tonight. And tomorrow Kerry is to meet Lavrov again. Kerry says “today we initiated that process that over the next couple of days, we hope, can bring us to that path of de-escalation.” Kerry turns to Ukraine. He says Ukrainians “desperately” want a government of consent of the people. “We agree to continue intense discussions in the coming days with Russia, with the Ukrainians, in order to see how we can help normalize the situation, stabilize it...” he says, and continues: All parties agreed today that it is important to try to decide these issues through dialogue. The United States... is focusing intensely on a remedy. We cannot and will not allow the integrity and sovereignty of the country of Ukraine to be violated... Russia’s violation has actually united the world in support of the Ukrainian people. Russia made a choice. And we have clearly stated that we believe it is the wrong choice, to move troops into Crimea. Russia can now make the right choice... To find the road to de-escalation, the United States is ready to work with all parties.” Kerry asks Russia to talk directly with Ukraine, to withdraw troops to barracks in Crimea and to respect and welcome international monitors: We see today with what happened to ambassador Serry, just how important it is to ensure the safety of those monitors and of those observers. Kerry begins speaking. He is making a statement on Lebanon’s crisis in hosting refugees from Syria, whom he says number “almost a million” but who by some counts, including relatives in Syria forced to stay with family members in Lebanon, are more numerous. While we wait on Kerry, we’d invite you to review our just-published explanatory resource, “Ukraine’s revolution and Russia’s occupation of Crimea: how we got here”, by Alan Yuhas (@AlanYuhas) and Raya Jalabi (@RayaJalabi): The latest developments are the result of a four-month-long deadlock between Ukrainian demonstrators and Viktor Yanukovych’s government. Protests erupted on 21 November 2013 when then-president Yanukovich backtracked on promises made to sign a trade deal with the EU, allegedly at Moscow’s behest. Though protests, set off by the pivot toward Russia, were initially peaceful, things turned violent in January when police tried to break up demonstrations in a violent crackdown. Dozens died before a European-brokered peace deal ended the fighting, but as violence began again, Yanukovych disappeared. He has since surfaced in Russia, claiming to be the legitimate ruler of his country. • How did Ukraine get here (and why do some people say “the Ukraine”)? • Let’s break this out with some maps • Political divisions: Yanukovych v Tymoshenko and EU v Russia • Why Russia is in Crimea • Talks continued in Paris among American, European and Ukrainian envoys on the crisis in Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister left talks without meeting his Ukrainian counterpart. “We agreed to continue those discussions in the days to come,” he said. • Two incidents of hostility against international monitors in Crimea were reported. In one, a UN envoy was trapped temporarily inside a coffee shop by armed men. In another, a testy crowd waited at a hotel for international delegates. • Multiple confrontations between pro-Russia and pro-Kiev groups were reported, in Donetsk, Simferopol and Sevastopol. In Sevastopol, Russian forces blocked a Ukrainian naval vessel. • Nato announced a full review of all cooperation with Russia, suspended planning for a Nato-Russian joint operation to escort Syria chemical weapons and suspended staff-level civilian or military meetings with Russia. • The Pentagon said the US military was doubling its commitment of aircraft to joint NATO-policing missions in the Baltics. • The difficult realities behind threats of sanctions and counter-sanctions began to move to the foreground in advance of a European Union meeting Thursday. • US secretary of state John Kerry just ambled past reporters in Paris eagerly awaiting his version of today’s talks. “We’re going to have a statement in a little while,” he said. The Pentagon has announced plans to more than double its commitment of aircraft to joint NATO-policing missions in the Baltics, Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) reports: The US currently provides four F-15s to fill NATO’s Baltic Air Policing rotation. “This week, the United States will send six additional F-15s and one KC-135 to augment the mission,” the official said. “These aircraft – currently based at Lakenheath in the United Kingdom – will be deployed to Siauliai Air Base in Lithuania.” The Pentagon is also increasing its commitment o joint airforce-training exercises in Poland. “This is a time for wise, steady, and firm leadership,” defense secretary Chuck Hagel told a Senate panel. “And it is a time for all of us to stand with the Ukrainian people in support of their territorial integrity and their sovereignty. And we are doing that.” An unnamed senior US state department official denied the Russian characterization of today’s Lavrov-Kerry talks: “There were no agreements in this meeting, and there never will be without direct Ukrainian government involvement and absolute buy-in,” the official said. Contrast that with the Russian foreign ministry take: German chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken again by phone with Russian president Vladimir Putin to “discuss possible international efforts to help improve the situation in Ukraine,” Reuters reports. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has departed talks in Paris without meeting Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia, Reuters quotes Western diplomats as saying. “We are all concerned at what it is happening there,” Lavrov told reporters on leaving the French Foreign Ministry. “We agreed to continue those discussions in the days to come to see how best we can help stabilize, normalize the situation and overcome the crisis,” he added. Separately, a US state department official denied Lavrov’s earlier claim that Russia and the United States had agreed to abide by the 21 February agreement. Time magazine reports a really warm reception for international observers arriving in Crimea. Earlier today the UN envoy to Crimea was intercepted by 10-15 armed men outside a Simferopol base and pursued to a coffee shop, where he was trapped for a time before leaving in a car as a hostile crowd shouted “Putin! Putin!” Kim Willsher is trailing Kerry in Paris: European sanctions on Ukrainians are developing more quickly than sanctions on Russians. Britain has announced it is freezing the assets of 18 Ukrainians suspected of misappropriating Ukrainian state funds, Reuters reports, pointing to a tweet by the finance minister: Reuters has this context: Last week Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein said they were taking similar steps against 18 Ukrainians. It was not immediately clear whether the same 18 people would be affected by Britain’s move. Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen announces the Atlantic council has decided to place its cooperation activities with Russia under review. The announcement followed a meeting of the Nato-Russia council in Brussels. Rasmussen said he asked the Russian ambassador to advise Moscow on the conclusion. Update: the full Nato statement is here. Rasmussen tweeted the details of the Nato decision: We suspended planning for 1st #NATO-#Russia joint op: maritime escort for US ship Cape Ray which neutralizes #Syria #CW No staff-level civilian or military meetings w/ #Russia for now – decisions to be taken by #NATO #ForMin in April We want to keep door open for dialogue &amp; maintain ambassadors meetings in #NATO-#Russia Council The Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers, plus their American and British counterparts, have arrived at the French foreign ministry, Reuters reports. Update: At no point did Lavrov meet with Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsia, Reuters reports. The apparent new meeting follows bilateral talks between US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. “Speaking to media after talks, Lavrov said the two sides agreed to join efforts to help Ukraine to reach the agreement signed in Kiev on Feb. 21,” Lavrov reports. Update: The US state department denies any such agreement. Protesters in Independence Square in Kiev never accepted the deal, and president Viktor Yanukovich fled the capital the day he signed it. The text of the 21 February deal is here. It arranged for a unity government, early presidential elections, a ban on declarations of martial law, constitutional reform and investigations into violence. Russian president Vladimir Putin has threatened to respond in kind to any Western sanctions, but analysts say that doing so could be ineffective or harm Russia’s own economy, reports Alec Luhn (@ASLuhn) for the Guardian: Russian officials have threatened to write off debts to American banks and even seize the assets of Western companies. But analysts doubted the effectiveness of such measures... “The only way out is to work on diplomacy to prevent sanctions, because in terms of sanctions Russia has a weaker position,” said Investcafe analyst Andrei Shenk. [...] Shenk lampooned asset seizures and debt write-offs as “the action of a third-world country” and said they would ultimately hurt the Russian economy. “It’s basically the nationalisation of property, and nationalisation will scare away all investors,” Shenk said. “It can lead to the Russian economy losing the ability to get money from abroad, including credit resources, which the Russian economy has a dependence on right now”. Putin may not have to worry about it. On the other end, Europe and the United States face steep challenges in cobbling together an effective sanctions package, reports Guardian Europe editor Ian Traynor (@TraynorBrussels): A crisis that started with an EU summit fiasco three months ago may climax on Thursday with an EU summit failure as Putin’s short-term hard power collides with European longer-term soft power and leaves the EU looking weak and feckless. The Italians and the French do not want to punish Putin. The Swedes and the east Europeans take a hard line. The British government is worried about the impact on the City of London and losing big-spending oligarchs in west London. German industry is lobbying strongly against imposing sanctions on Russia. And while Washington talks of isolating Russia because of Ukraine, Berlin is saying the opposite, stressing engagement and keeping channels open to the Kremlin. Read the full piece here. Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) reports that House speaker John Boehner compared the sanctions package that Congress was working on against Russia to the seemingly much broader measures deployed against Iran: “We gave the administration what I’ll call a tool-box of sanctions [against Tehran] that they had the ability to impose as they saw fit,” Boehner said. “The majority leader, and the committee chairs, are working with the administration on that possibility.” We’re waiting to hear from Kerry in Paris. Still no sign of him, Kim Willsher reports. Harriet Salem (@HarrietSalem) has been reporting from Donetsk on a struggle for control of a government administration building. There’s another crowded confrontation playing out in Donetsk, Harriet writes, in Lenin Square, a 5-10 minute walk away.” Around 3,000 people gathered in Lenin Square at 18:00 to rally for Ukrainian unity,” she writes: The crowd chanted, “Glory to Ukraine, Glory to its heroes” and “Ukraine is united”. The unity protesters were separated from around 1,000 pro-Russia supporters by a line of riot police. The pro-Russia group hurled eggs at the other side and chanted “Russia, Russia, Russia,” and “Berkut”. A giant Ukrainian flag was carried by the crowd by the unity protesters. Ukrainian hymns were played over the loudspeaker as people prayed for peace. Harriet spoke with a police academy student named Aleksandar, who told her, “I am here to support and stand for united Ukraine. We want to be united, and no one to enter our territory”. Valentin Brylev, 65, a Ukrainian Cossack, said that Donetsk is not divided. “These people [the pro-Russia supporters] represent a “small minority of idiots” he said. Kim Willsher is reporting for the Guardian on the ongoing Kerry-Lavrov meeting in Paris. The Russian foreign ministry Twitter feed gets literary: That’s a well-hydrated meeting. Mates reports that Serry has escaped, after the path of his “car was [temporarily] blocked by protesters chanting Putin Putin.” Mates concludes: “Very unpleasant incident over. Robert Serry said v happy to leave #crimea if it helped de escalate the situation.” The UN special envoy to Ukraine, Robert Serry, was blockaded inside a coffee shop in Crimea by a militia, according to ITV Europe editor James Mates, who is in the shop with Serry. Mates is narrating the standoff. “With Robert Serry now,” he writes: not kidnapped, but held in a coffee shop. Some men outside prevent him from leaving. Special rep is waiting in coffee shop for help. He’s asked us to stay with him and keep filming #Ukriane UN special advisor Robert Serry had been visiting navy commander when his car was blocked. Stand off followed #Ukraine UN special envoy Robert Serry’s assistant says she saw at least one man with a gun among group who blocked his car. #Ukraine Outside coffee shop are men in combat fatigues blocking the door. Some wear pro Russia black and gold arm band. Not allowing anyone in/out Inexplicably, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson on Wednesday denied reports that U.N. representative in Ukraine Robert Serry was seized by armed men in Crimea. Eliasson treated the situation as resolved, Reuters reports: “He was not kidnapped but he was seriously threatened,” Eliasson told reporters in New York by telephone from Kiev, adding that “this action should be seriously condemned.” • Russian boats blocked a Ukrainian navy ship with about 50 officers aboard at a Sevastapol port and Russian soldiers patrolled the dock. • Pro-Russian demonstrators took a government building in the southeastern city of Donetsk back from Ukrainian police in an ongoing tug-of-war. The demonstrators hoisted a Russian flag. In Simferopol, a group of pro-Russian demonstrators tried to block a military base and clashed with pro-Kiev demonstrators. • Russia declined to withdraw its forces in Crimea to their bases. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov denied the presence of Russians apart from the Black Sea fleet, who he said “are in their deployment sites” and are taking “additional vigilance measures.” • US defense secretary Chuck Hagel said the US military is stepping up joint training through an aviation detachment in Poland and is boosting participation in a Nato air policing mission. • The Nato-Russian council was to meet Wednesday in Brussels. In Paris, European foreign ministers met with Russian and US envoys to discuss Ukraine. • US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Lavrov met one-on-one, briefly, to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. Kerry urged Russia to meet directly with Ukraine, the state department said. • But Russia skipped a meeting the US and UK attempted to convene with Ukraine to talk about the 1994 Budapest memorandum arranging for Ukraine’s security in exchange for nuclear non-proliferation guarantees. • The European Commission approved measures to help Ukraine amounting to at least €11bn in coming years. A US package for $1bn gained support in principle from congressional Republicans. • Russian President Putin said he did not want political tension to detract from economic cooperation with Russia’s “traditional partners.” “We are seeing known political tension, it should not affect our current economic cooperation,” he was quoted as saying. The Ukrainian currency took a slide, meanwhile, and the prime minister warned of worse. • International observers from 18 countries were scheduled to begin arriving in Crimea. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia could not invite them there because only a host can invite and Ukraine is an independent country. Ukrainian prime minister Arseny Yatsenyuk warned that the Russian presence in Ukraine “is having an extremely negative effect on Ukraine’s economy,” Reuters reports: ...the hryvnia currency has been under heavy pressure, hitting a record low of 11.6510 to the U.S. dollar on Monday. But the hryvnia has risen back to 9.40 per dollar because investors increasingly believe Ukraine will secure new loans quickly enough to avoid a default. Kiev must repay a $1 billion eurobond in early June and the government has also guaranteed a $1.6 billion Eurobond issued by state energy company Naftogaz, which falls due in September. Both Ukraine and Russia said Tuesday that Kiev owes Moscow $2bn in gas payments. Republicans in Congress have pledged to work with president Barack Obama to approve a $1bn loan guarantee package for Ukraine. Both House speaker John Boehner and majority leader Eric Cantor expressed support for the aid in statements Wednesday morning. Cantor did add that the aid package should ultimately be offset by other savings, Reuters notes. So there still seems to be plenty of room for them to disagree. On the basis of a leaked conversation between the EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Estonia’s Foreign Minister Urmas Paet, state-funded Russia Today is reporting that: “The snipers who shot at protesters and police in Kiev were allegedly hired by Maidan leaders.” In, the leaked call, Paet repeats some allegations made to him by a woman called Olga and bemoans the fact that they are not being investigated. The Estonian foreign ministry says he was not making any allegations himself about who was responsible for the shots that were fired during the protests against Viktor Yanukovych. In the conversation, the authenticity of which has been confirmed by the foreign ministry, and which took place on 26 February after Paet had returned from a visit to Ukraine, he says: What was quite disturbing, the same Olga told [me] as well, all the evidence shows that people who were killed by snipers from both sides, among policeman and people from the streets [is] they were the same snipers killing people from both sides …she also showed me some photos, she said as medical doctor she can say it’s the same handwriting, they’re the same type of bullets and it’s really disturbing that now, the new coalition, they don’t want to investigate exactly what happened so that there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind snipers it was not Yanukovych but it was somebody from the new coalition. Ashton replies: I think they do want to investigate. I mean I didn’t pick that up, that’s interesting. Gosh. The Estonian foreign ministry said in a statement: Foreign minister Paet was giving an overview of what he had heard the previous day in Kiev and expressed concern over the situation on the ground. We reject the claim that Paet was giving an assessment of the opposition’s involvement in the violence. A spokeswoman for Ashton’s office said: We can’t comment on leaks but our position on violence is very clear - that it should be investigated. Here is the recording of the phone call. The discussion re the snipers starts 8mins 20 seconds in. US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov – who have sat across the table many times before, but not since Russian forces spread across Crimea – have just held a brief one-on-one meeting in Paris to discuss the Ukraine crisis, the state department says. Reuters: “The Secretary urged direct talks between Russia and Ukraine,” a senior State Department official said of the brief “pull aside” on the sidelines of a conference on Lebanon. The meeting followed a meeting in Paris of foreign ministers from the US, UK, France, Germany and Russia. Lavrov and Kerry were scheduled to meet again this afternoon. Harriet Salem (@HarrietSalem) is in Donetsk reporting for the Guardian on the tug-of-war between Ukrainian police and pro-Russian demonstrators for control of a government administration building. The demonstrators retook control this afternoon. US defense secretary Chuck Hagel is scheduled to speak with his Ukrainian counterpart today, he told Congress in testimony on the Pentagon budget. The U.S. military is stepping up joint training through an aviation detachment in Poland and is boosting participation in a NATO air policing mission, Hagel said, in testimony quoted by Reuters. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, testified alongside Hagel. “The world will continue to surprise us, often in unpleasant ways,” Dempsey said. Hagel has presented a Pentagon budget of about $500bn for 2015, down about 17% from the 2012 budget of $600bn. Shaun Walker called me from Sevastopol, where he is beside the Slavutych, one of the Ukrainian naval ships that is being blocked from leaving the port. He told me: I can see about 50 Ukrainian naval officers on the boat and there are these Russians who are patrolling the dock around us. One of them just came up to us and asked us if we had the right to be here, if we had a piece of paper to prove that. We asked him if had had a piece of paper to give him the right to be here and he’s gone off to get his superior ... I heard one of the guys talking to the locals and he was saying that they are here because if things kick off here then Russia will get a whole load of refugees supposedly from Ukraine....this guy said ‘you will be coming to us’. When I started talking to him he suddenly stopped talking about ‘us’ as Russia. Paul Lewis, our Washington correspondent, writes: The US has formally denounced Russia for failing to attend the meeting over the Budapest Agreement in Paris earlier today. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, hosted the meeting with his UK and Ukrainian counterparts, William Hague and Andriy Deshchytsia. In brief remarks earlier, Kerry said the meeting was “regrettably missing one member” - Russia - which was the other signatory to the so-called 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear weapons in return for security assurances from the world powers. The state department said: The United States had conveyed an invitation to the Russian Federation to the meeting … We deeply regret that the Russian Federation declined to attend.” Adding: Ukraine voluntarily surrendered the world’s third largest nuclear weapons arsenal in exchange for these assurances. The three governments treat these assurances with utmost seriousness, and expect Russia to as well. Kerry is scheduled to meet with the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov today. Harriet Salem, reporting from the Guardian, just told me that pro-Russia protesters have reoccupied the regional government building in Donetsk that was taken back by police earlier today (the pro-Russia protesters having originally occupied it on Monday. She said: About 200 supporters were addressed by a women on stage. They surged forward and stormed the building, chanting “Berkut, Berkut [the disbanded riot police]” and “Russia, Russia”. They emerged on the first storey of the building. Russian songs from the Soviet era were played over loudspeakers. There was lots of fist-pumping and cheering. They also announced over the loudspeaker that Russia 24 was reporting that Vladimir Putin has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize for his work to protect Ukrainians and there were cheers in response. Putin is reportedly on the list for the Nobel peace prize but it is believed to be for his role in the deal to rid Syria of chemical weapons. A meeting of the US, Russian, British, French and German foreign ministers to discuss the Ukraine crisis, being held by French President Francois Hollande is underway, a presidential source has told reporters at the Elysee presidential palace. Earlier, foreign ministers for the United States, Ukraine and Britain agreed that direct talks between Kiev and Moscow were crucial to resolving tensions and also called for the immediate deployment of international monitors. They said in a joint statement: The United States, United Kingdom and Ukraine agreed that direct talks between Ukraine and Russia, facilitated as needed by members of the international community, are crucial to resolving the current situation They also agreed that international observers should be deployed immediately in Ukraine, especially in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. In an interview with AP, Ukraine’s new prime minister said that he is afraid that Russia might send troops to occupy Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine outside Crimea. Asked the question, Arseniy Yatsenyuk said: Let me put it bluntly: yes, it’s still a concern and Russia is to realise its responsibility and Russia is to stick to its international obligation, to stop the invasion. Mr President (Putin), stop this mess ... A number of military forces of the Russian Federation are deployed in Crimea. We cannot figure out the reason why Russian boots are on Ukrainian ground. And it’s crystal clear that it was ordered personally by President Putin. This is Ukrainian territory and Russia wants to grab control over Crimea. But I will underline again, we will do our best in order to regain control over Ukrainian territory. The Russian military is to be back in the barracks. What happened in Crimea is unconstitutional and resembles ... a coup supported by the Russian government and the Russian military. The Ukrainian government is legitimate. And let me remind Mr. Putin that this government was supported by the constitutional majority of Ukrainian MPs with 371 votes. We are legitimate and we must fulfill our responsibilities. And we strongly recommend to our Russian partners to build up relations with the new Ukrainian government. Ukraine’s acting foreign minister just tweeted this: The EU Council has frozen the assets of 18 people who “misappropriated Ukrainian state funds”. The press release says: Today’s decision targets 18 persons identified as responsible for such misappropriation whose assets within the European Union will be frozen. The sanctions also contain provisions facilitating the recovery of the frozen funds, once certain conditions are met. The legal acts, including the list of persons subject to sanctions, will be published in tomorrow’s EU Official Journal. The measures will initially apply for twelve months, starting tomorrow. There have been further developments at the port in Sevastopol, Crimea. • The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is due to hold talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov today in Paris. Separately, Russia is due to hold talks with Nato in Brussels. • Russia failed to show-up for a meeting with the so-called Budapest agreement group, which involves Washington, London, Moscow and Kiev. But the UK foreign secretary, William Hague said he was continuing attempts to get the Ukrainians and Russians together. • The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said that 35 unarmed military personnel are on their way to Ukraine to act as observers in response to a request from Kiev. They include observers from the US and UK. • The European Commission has approved measures to help Ukraine amounting to at least €11bn in coming years. The package also includes technical assistance on a number of areas from constitutional to judicial reform and preparation of elections. • Ukrainian police ejected pro-Moscow demonstrators from a regional government building and raised its flag where Russia’s had flown since the weekend, signalling an important shift of control in the Russian-speaking east. Police said they evacuated it peacefully after receiving reports it was booby-trapped with explosives. • Russia said that it had imposed a ban on the transportation of nuclear fuel across Ukraine due to “the unstable situation in the country”. Russia, the main supplier of nuclear fuel to Ukraine, said its neighbour has enough fuel for its power plants to last until the end of next month. Russia, Ukraine’s main supplier, has imposed a ban on the transportation of nuclear fuel across Ukraine due to “the unstable situation in the country”, the Kiev post reports, citing Russia’s deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin. It says Rogozin told a meeting between the president and government ministers today: We have problems with the transit of nuclear fuel through Ukrainian territory to our partners in Eastern Europe, and there are issues related to supplies of fuel to nuclear power plants in Ukraine itself The Ukrainian NPPs [nuclear power plants] have fuel reserves for March and April A ban has so far been imposed on such transportation of fuel due to the unstable situation in the country. Here is a link to details of that EU package agreed for Ukraine today,which the European Commission says will amount to “at least €11 billion over the coming years”. It will also include modernisation of the Ukrainian gas transit system, speeding up the Visa Liberalisation Action Plan and technical assistance on a number of areas from constitutional to judicial reform and preparation of elections. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said that 35 unarmed military personnel are on their way to Ukraine to act as observers in response to a request from Kiev. Eighteen member countries of the OSCE, including the UK, US, France and Germany, have agreed to send up to two representatives each. OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier said: It is my hope that this military visit will help to de-escalate tensions in Ukraine. By providing an objective assessment of the facts on the ground, the OSCE will be better placed to foster a political solution to the current crisis through dialogue. Here are some more comments from the UK foreign secretary, William Hague, on trying to bring Ukraine and Russia together today. What we’re really trying to do here today is to bring the Russians into a diplomatic process. That is what we really want to see, at least the start of that. And I think it’s right to try every diplomatic opportunity, our focus has been very strongly on trying to make diplomatic progress so that Russia and Ukraine work together, can discuss things together. That is the threshold. Adding: In our view a deescalation should include Russia abiding by international agreements that it has signed in the past, such as its forces in Crimea, abiding by the 1997 agreement on Black Sea bases whereby they would only be outside their bases with the agreement with Ukraine. He also said that is it important for the European Council, who meet tomorrow, to demonstrate that there are costs and consequences for Russia’s actions against Ukraine. He added that the most important consequences could be long-term. US secretary of state John Kerry told reporters that “regrettably” Russia had not appeared for a meeting of the so-called Budapest agreement group, which involves Washington, London, Moscow and Kiev. The Budapest agreement group was created to assure Kiev’s security after it renounced nuclear weapons in the 1990s and the US and Britain had hoped to bring the two disputing parties together. UK foreign secretary William Hague said that he will make every effort to bring Russia and Ukraine ministers together later today. Russian President Putin said he did not want political tension to detract from economic cooperation with Russia’s “traditional partners”, according to Reuters. He told cabinet members: We are seeing known political tension, it should not affect our current economic cooperation. He added: It’s not necessary to add to the difficult situation, we need to cooperate with all our traditional partners - while providing for our own interests, of course. It is not necessary to whip things up. The Kiev Post’s Christopher Miller has posted a video from Sinferopol in Crimea where he says a group of more than 50 men with Russian flags and shields who had gathered to block a Ukrainian military base attacked a group of peaceful women who came to protest their action and held signs reading “Love, peace for all” and “Do you love Ukraine? Stop this!” He writes: The men tore the handmade signs into shreds before shoving the women and some of their husbands and sons into oncoming traffic. Meanwhile, police stood nearby, doing and saying nothing. Some of the men attempted to break the cameras of journalists and shoved some of them into the street with the group of women. One man shoved a Kiev Post journalist into the hood of an oncoming car. Asked by the Kiev Post why he had done nothing, despite observing the action, a police officer said only: “We don’t have the authority to investigate this.” The European Commission has approved measures to help Ukraine amounting to €11bn Štefan Füle, the European commissioner for enlargement and European neighbourhood policy, has just tweeted. Ukraine is in dire need of financial assistance. It has said it needs $35bn (25.5bn Euros) over the next two years to survive. A $15bn aid package agreed with Moscow last year after Viktor Yanukovych decided not to sign a wide-ranging association agreement with the EU was frozen after he was ousted. The US embassy in France tweeted this photo: Moscow continues its vigorous denials that Russian forces are occupying Ukrainian bases in Crimea. The German Embassy in London tweeted: The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, says he has agreed in consultations with the US and Ukraine that “there must be costs for Russia if they don’t de-escalate”. Ukraine’s top security official said today that Russian forces have not made any new military gains in Crimea but warned of the danger of new attempts by pro-Russian protesters to take over government buildings in eastern and southern Ukraine. Andriy Paruby, secretary of Ukraine’s security and defence Council, told reporters: Last night there were already fewer emergency situations and fewer conflicts in Crimea. I hope that in the coming days a way will be found to solve everything through negotiations. The Associated Press’s Laura Mills says a mine was found in the Donetsk regional government building occupied by pro-Russia supporters, which was evacuated by police today. BBC reporter Abdujalil Abdurasulov tweeted this photo of a Ukrainian ship being blocked in Sevastopol:﻿ Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has repeated President Putin’s claim that it is not Russian troops occupying military bases in Crimea. Speaking in Madrid in remarks shown on Russian television, he said “self-defence” forces who do not answer to Moscow were occupying the bases and so Russia could not order them to leave. Western states are discussing a potential resolution to the crisis under which Russia would pull back its forces to their bases on the Black Sea peninsula and allow in international monitors. Lavrov said that it was up to the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities whether to invite international observers in. Ukraine has invited observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to go to Crimea. They are tentatively expected to start work today. The Canadian foreign minister John Baird has compared the Russian invasion in Ukraine to the Nazi 1938 invasion of Czechoslovakia. He said in an interview with CBC: The Sudetenland had a majority of Germans. That gave Germany no right to do this in the late 1930s. He added that: “If it’s not war, it’s akin to war” and that the situation was “right out of the Cold War”. Hillary Clinton has also reportedly Vladimir Putin’s actions to those of Hitler. This photo appears to offer confirmation that the Ukrainian flag is back flying above the Donetsk regional government building, where police have reportedly been removing pro-Russia supporters today. Russian forces seized two Ukrainian missile defence battalions in the Crimea region on Wednesday, Interfax news agency quoted a military source as saying (via Reuters). The Ukrainian defence ministry was unable immediately to confirm on the report, which quoted the source saying: We now expect the arrival of Russian missile specialists and pro-Russian activists who will have to persuade the Ukrainian military personnel to carry out joint combat duties. Russian MPs are working on a draft law to allow the confiscation of property, assets and accounts of European or US companies if sanctions are imposed on Russia over Ukraine, RIA news agency reported today. From Reuters: RIA quoted Andrei Klishas, head of the constitutional legislation committee in the upper parliament house, as saying the bill “would offer the president and government opportunities to defend our sovereignty from threats”. He added that lawyers were examining whether the confiscation of foreign companies’ assets, property and accounts would comply with the Russian constitution but said such steps would “clearly be in line with European standards”. Ukrainian police say they are evacuating the Donetsk regional government building, which has been occupied by pro-Russian supporters since Monday, Reuters is reporting. A police statement said the evacuation began after reports that the building was booby-trapped with bombs. It also says, citing witnesses, that the Ukrainian flag has been raised above the building, replacing the Russian flag, which had flown there since Saturday. Sergei Aksenov, the pro-Russian prime minister of Crimea, said his government refuses to negotiate with the authorities in Kiev, Russian state news agency Ria Novosti reports. It quotes Aksenov as telling Latvian radio station Baltcom: We don’t consider this government that proposes talks to us to be legitimate, that is the main issue. Last week, Aksenov appealed to Vladimir Putin for help in “guaranteeing peace and calmness”. European Union leaders holding a crisis meeting on Ukraine tomorrow could impose sanctions on Russia if there has been no “de-escalation” by then, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said. Fabius told France’s BFM TV that such measures could include restrictions on visas, the assets of individuals and existing discussions on economic ties with Russia. He said: Let’s start to initiate the path of dialogue, but at the same time tomorrow there is an EU summit and sanctions could be voted tomorrow if there is no de-escalation. I expect and hope that Russia will today tell us that there is a prospect for dialogue with a contact group. Fabius was speaking before hosting talks between his Russian, US, Ukrainian and other counterparts on the margins of a long-scheduled meeting on Lebanon in Paris. The United States and Russia will hold talks on easing east-west tension over Ukraine today, Reuters reports: US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will meet face-to-face for the first time since the crisis escalated, after a conference in Paris attended by all five permanent members of the UN security council. Nato and Russia will hold parallel talks in Brussels amid concerns that a standoff between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers in Crimea could still spark violence, or that Moscow could also intervene in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. This was presumably on Monday when the rouble crashed to record lows. The central bank releases its interventions in foreign exchange markets only with a two-day lag. The former US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has compared Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine to those of Hitler in the 1930s, the Pasadena Star News, a Californian website, reports: Clinton made her comments at a private event benefiting the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Long Beach. “Now if this sounds familiar, it’s what Hitler did back in the 30s,” she said. “All the Germans that were ... the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they’re not being treated right. I must go and protect my people and that’s what’s gotten everybody so nervous.” Good morning. Welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the crisis in Ukraine. Here is a round-up of the latest developments: • Nato and Russia are due to meet today to discuss Ukraine. Nato announced the extraordinary session yesterday, saying it was requested by Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. • Ukraine has said that observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation (OSCE), which includes Russia, the US and Ukraine among its members, will travel at its invitation to the Crimea region. They are tentatively scheduled to start work today. • Russia and US have traded accusations over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin was dismissive of US “threats” and said Russia was engaged in a “humanitarian mission”. Barack Obama said there was a “strong belief that Russian action is violating international law”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-02T11:19:19Z","webTitle":"UN calls for universal access to renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"UN calls for universal access to renewable energy","bodyText":"The UN has called for a high-profile initiative to promote universal access to power such as electricity in developing countries based on a global advocacy campaign and investments on the ground for clean energy. In its annual Human Development Report, the UN Development Progamme (UNDP) said the time is right for such a drive as the UN has designated 2012 as the international year of sustainable energy for all. Meanwhile, next year's Rio+20 Earth summit will provide an opportunity to define a global approach for universal access to energy – about 1.5 billion people worldwide, more than one in five, lack electricity. On Tuesday, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access, energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy. The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella, the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, and Charles Holliday, chairman of Bank of America. This year's report, Sustainability and Equity, published on Wednesday, focuses on environmental degradation and its potential impact on human development. Environmental trends over recent decades show deterioration on several fronts, the report says, with adverse repercussions for human development (defined by the UN as \"the expansion of people's freedoms and capabilities to lead lives that they value and have reason to value\"), especially for the millions of people who depend directly on natural resources for their livelihoods. The report looks at the national rankings of the UNDP's human development index, which combines measures of health, education and income. Norway, Australia and the Netherlands lead the world in the 2011 ranking, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger and Burundi the least developed. Cuba shows the greatest rise in the rankings and Kuwait the greatest fall. The report puts particular emphasis on the need to empower women as a way of meeting the world's environmental challenges. \"Transformation in gender roles and empowerment have enabled some countries and groups to improve sustainability and equity, advancing human development,\" the report says, citing countries such as Cuba, Iran and Mauritius, which have brought down fertility rates. Making the explicit link between lower birth rates and the protection of the environment, the report says: \"Evidence suggests that if all women could exercise reproductive choice, population growth would slow enough to bring greenhouse gas emissions below current levels. Meeting unmet need for family planning by 2050 would lower the world's carbon emissions an estimated 17% below what they are today.\" The UNDP said analysis covering 100 countries confirmed that greater political participation by women \"is positively associated with better environmental outcomes, including better access to water, less land degradation and fewer deaths due to indoor and outdoor air pollution and dirty water\". As for the issue of how much it will cost to move to clean energy, the report cites estimates of total annual mitigation and adaptation costs by 2030 as ranging from $249bn to $1,371bn. While the amounts are large, the UNDP points out they are below current spending on defence, on recent banking bailouts and on \"perverse\" subsidies. Uzbekistan spends more than 10 times more on fossil fuel consumption subsidies than on health – 32% of GDP, compared with 2.5% – while Iran spends 20% of GDP on fossil fuel consumption subsidies, compared with less than 5% on education. Subsidies aside, the report acknowledges the pressures of the global financial crisis, but points to \"innovative\" sources of financing such as a currency transaction tax – an idea it first mooted in 1994, which is gaining traction. The EU backs such a tax, although it is opposed by the UK which fears that such a move would undercut London's status as a financial centre. A tax of 0.005% would yield around $40bn a year worldwide, according to the report, while even a unilateral currency transaction tax limited to the euro could raise $4.2bn to $9.3bn in additional financing. \"Clearly, then, a currency transaction tax could, even under very conservative assumptions, dramatically scale up global public good expenditure,\" it said. Besides consideration of a transaction tax – often known as a Tobin tax or Robin Hood tax – the report said use of the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights (SDRs), an international reserve asset, is worth exploring. \"Monetising part of the IMF's surplus could raise up to $75bn at little or no budgetary cost for contributing governments,\" says the report, adding: \"Clean energy offers the potential to alleviate poverty, reduce health impacts from indoor air pollution and drive social and economic development, while mitigating energy's impact on the climate.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/apr/02/us-plans-nuclear-drones","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-02T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"US draws up plans for nuclear drones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/02/us-plans-nuclear-drones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/apr/02/us-plans-nuclear-drones","fields":{"headline":"US draws up plans for nuclear drones","bodyText":"American scientists have drawn up plans for a new generation of nuclear-powered drones capable of flying over remote regions of the world for months on end without refuelling. The blueprints for the new drones, which have been developed by Sandia National Laboratories – the US government's principal nuclear research and development agency – and defence contractor Northrop Grumman, were designed to increase flying time \"from days to months\" while making more power available for operating equipment, according to a project summary published by Sandia. \"It's pretty terrifying prospect,\" said Chris Coles of Drone Wars UK, which campaigns against the increasing use of drones for both military and civilian purposes. \"Drones are much less safe than other aircraft and tend to crash a lot. There is a major push by this industry to increase the use of drones and both the public and government are struggling to keep up with the implications.\" The highly sensitive research into what is termed \"ultra-persistence technologies\" set out to solve three problems associated with drones: insufficient \"hang time\" over a potential target; lack of power for running sophisticated surveillance and weapons systems; and lack of communications capacity. The Sandia-Northrop Grumman team looked at numerous different power systems for large- and medium-sized drones before settling on a nuclear solution. Northrop Grumman is known to have patented a drone equipped with a helium-cooled nuclear reactor as long ago as 1986, and has previously worked on nuclear projects with the US air force research laboratory. Designs for nuclear-powered aircraft are known to go back as far as the 1950s. The research team found that the nuclear drones were able to provide far more surveillance time and intelligence information per mission compared to other technologies, and also to reduce the considerable costs of support systems – eliminating the need, for example, for forward bases and fuel supplies in remote and possibly hostile areas. A halt has been called to the work for now, due to worries that public opinion will not accept the idea of such a potentially hazardous technology, with the inherent dangers of either a crash – in effect turning the drone into a so-called dirty bomb – or of its nuclear propulsion system falling into the hands of terrorists or unfriendly powers. Sandia confirmed that the project had been completed: \"Sandia is often asked to look at a wide range of solutions to the toughest technical challenges. The research on this topic was highly theoretical and very conceptual. The work only resulted in a preliminary feasibility study and no hardware was ever built or tested. The project has ended.\" According to a summary of the research published by the Federation of American Scientists, an independent thinktank, computer-based projections were used to test the concepts. \"Based on requirements and direction provided by Northrop Grumman, Sandia performed focused studies to translate stated needs into conceptual designs and processes that could be transferred easily from Sandia to industry design and production personnel,\" the document says. So sensitive is the issue that the summary does not spell out the fact that it is referring to a nuclear-powered drone, referring instead to \"propulsion and power technologies that went well beyond existing hydrocarbon technologies\". However, the project's lead investigator at Sandia, Dr Steven Dron, is well known as a specialist in nuclear propulsion, having co-chaired a session at the 2008 Symposium on Space Nuclear Power and Propulsion, held at the University of New Mexico in 2008. The research summary also stated that the results \"were to be used in the next generation of unmanned air vehicles used for military and intelligence applications\", where they \"would have provided system performance unparalleled by other existing technologies\". It added that \"none of the results will be used in the near-term or mid-term future\", due to political constraints. The potential impact of nuclear-powered drones can be gauged by comparing them with existing aircraft such as the MQ-9 Reaper, which is used extensively in Afghanistan and Pakistan in operations against insurgents. The Reaper presently carries nearly two tonnes of fuel in addition a similar weight of munitions and other equipment and can stay airborne for around 42 hours, or just 14 hours when fully loaded with munitions. Using nuclear power would enable the Reaper not only to remain airborne for far longer, but to carry more missiles or surveillance equipment, and to dispense with the need for ground crews based in remote and dangerous areas. Coles believes the increasing sophistication of drones poses many threats: \"As they become low-cost, low-risk alternatives to conventional warfare, the threshold for their use will inevitably drop. The consequences are not being thought through.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/29/japan-fukushima-plutonium-traces-soil","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T00:55:07Z","webTitle":"Fukushima soil contains plutonium traces, according to Japanese officials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/japan-fukushima-plutonium-traces-soil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/29/japan-fukushima-plutonium-traces-soil","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima soil contains plutonium traces, according to Japanese officials","bodyText":"Traces of plutonium have been found in the soil at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Japanese officials said on Monday, but not at levels considered harmful to human health. The discovery of plutonium - a byproduct of nuclear reactions - added to anxiety over the stricken plant, 150 miles north of Tokyo. Earlier, the government confirmed that levels of radioactivity in water leaking from a reactor at the facility resulted from a partial meltdown of fuel rods, amid growing fears that radiation may also have seeped into seawater and soil. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], said readings of plutoinium-238, 239 and 240 were similar to those recorded in other parts of Japan after nuclear tests conducted overseas. \"I apologise for making people worried,\" Tepco's vice president, Sakae Muto, told reporters. \"It's not at a level that's harmful to human health.\" But an official from Japan's nuclear safety agency was more cautious. \"While it's not at a level harmful to human health, I am not optimistic,\" Hidehiko Nishiyama said. \"This means the containment mechanism is being breached, so I think the situation is worrisome.\" Tepco has yet to determine the source of the plutonium, although it appeared that in two places, the radioactive element had come from reactors rather than from the atmosphere. One of the plant's three reactors contains plutonium in its fuel mix. Meanwhile, contamination in a pool of water in the turbine building of the No 2 reactor was found to be 100,000 times normal levels, Tepco said. On Sunday the firm said the figure was 10m times higher, a mistake the government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said was \"absolutely unforgivable\". Tepco was forced into another embarrassing apology after it admitted it had twice named the wrong isotope in its corrections about the levels of radiation. \"On one hand, I do think the workers at the site are getting quite tired,\" Edano told reporters. \"But these radiation tests are being used for making various decisions on safety … they are absolutely unforgivable.\" In addition, radiation above 1,000 millisieverts per hour was found in surface water in concrete tunnels outside the No 2 reactor, Tepco said. It added that the tunnels did not lead to the sea, but conceded it could not rule out that radioactive water had seeped into the ground. Greenpeace, meanwhile, said that it had recorded radiation levels of up to 10 microsieverts per hour in Iitate, a village 25 miles from the plant, and urged authorities to expand the evacuation zone from its current 12-mile radius. \"It is clearly not safe for people to remain in Iitate, especially children and pregnant women, when it could mean receiving the maximum-allowed dose of radiation in only a few days,\" said Jan van de Putte, the group's radiation safety expert. \"When further contamination from possible ingestion or inhalation of radioactive particles is factored in, the risks are even higher.\" Tepco has reportedly asked the French nuclear sector for assistance, seeking help from Electricite de France, Areva and the Nuclear Energy Agency, a research body, according to Eric Besson, France's industry and energy minister. Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency (Nisa) said radioactive iodine-131 of 1,150 times the maximum allowable level had been detected in seawater near drainage outlets serving four of Fukushima's reactors. Nisa's spokesman Hidehiko Nishiyama said he suspected radioactive water from the plant was leaking into the sea. On Sunday he had denied any connection. Edano said partial meltdown had probably occurred when the plant was hit by the tsunami on 11 March, adding that there was no evidence of subsequent meltdown. Four of the facility's six reactors have yet to be made safe, while efforts are continuing to pump in fresh water to prevent a far more dangerous full meltdown. \"The radiation seems to have come from fuel rods that were partially melted down and came into contact with the water used to cool the reactor,\" Edano said. \"Steam may have condensed … carrying water from within the containment vessel.\" Airborne radiation has been confined to the reactor buildings, and work to remove contaminated water from the structures continued on Monday. Setbacks to attempts to cool the reactors, and the realisation the crisis is far from over, have added to the plight of tens of thousands of people living nearby. Sakae Muto, vice-president of Tepco, said: \"Regrettably, we don't have a concrete schedule at the moment to enable us to say how many months, or years it will take [to make the plant safe].\" About 70,000 people within a 12-mile radius of the Fukushima plant were evacuated soon after the disaster, while a further 130,000 people living in a 12-20-mile radius have been told to stay indoors. The government said that it had no plans to widen the evacuation zone. It is not known exactly how many people remain in the outer zone. Many have left voluntarily after days without essential supplies and services. Truck drivers are refusing to enter the zone, fearing radiation exposure. The government created confusion last week when it advised people within a 20-mile radius to consider leaving. It insisted the advice was given due to concern for their quality of life, not exposure to harmful levels of radiation. According to the public broadcaster NHK, self-defence force personnel in the evacuation zone said 30 people had yet to leave the 12-mile evacuation zone, and 10 had indicated they wanted to remain in their homes. Evacuees have been urged not to return to the area to collect belongings while the Fukushima plant remains unstable. Residents who return, even temporarily, would expose themselves to \"great risk of radiation contamination\", Edano said. \"It is very likely that the [12m] area is contaminated and there is a significant risk to health,\" he added. Local authorities reported, however, that some people had already returned. Others forced out of their homes are coming to terms with the possibility that they may never be able to return. Even if they do, the many residents who depended on Tepco for employment accept that with the plant ruined, their chances of finding work in the area are close to nil. A large number of evacuees have already moved twice since the nuclear crisis began, and could be forced to move again if the situation worsens and the evacuation zone is expanded. \"We're assuming that in a worse-case scenario we might also be subject to evacuation,\" Norio Hattori, a disaster official in Nihonmatsu, said, adding that he had sent his own daughter to Tokyo. Some of the refugees are beginning to accept that a vast area surrounding the Fukushima plant could be condemned as a nuclear wasteland. \"If it had been an earthquake or a tsunami, we could have gone home again, but because it's radiation, we can't,\" said Tokuko Sujimoto. Her home, in the village of Namie, was so close to the plant she heard the first reactor explosion on 12 March. Her husband had watched from the roof of their house as a cloud of smoke rose from the reactor, before they fled. Yoshimoto Nogi, who had a job at the Fukushima plant until he retired last summer, said he had no hopes of going home this year. \"It's going to take a year or two. It is not a question of months,\" said Nogi. \"Even if the nuclear plant is stabilised tomorrow, I don't think the government is going to tell us it is safe to go back any time soon.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/13/journalists-tour-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-13T00:07:11Z","webTitle":"Journalists tour stricken Fukushima nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/13/journalists-tour-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/13/journalists-tour-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Journalists tour stricken Fukushima nuclear plant","bodyText":"Journalists yesterday visited the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, eight months after it was wrecked by the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.

Now 3,000 people are involved in the clean-up and have restored the plant's supply of electricity, set up elaborate cooling and drainage systems, rebuilt walls and erected a huge tent to cover one of the worst-hit reactors, cutting the amount of radioactivity leakage. Tepco, the plant's owner, says it will achieve a \"cold shutdown\" by the end of the year, the first step toward creating a safe environment for work to begin to remove the reactors' nuclear fuel.

Tuesday began with a fresh explosion which damaged the roof above its overheating reactor 2 and left steam rising from the complex, Jiji news agency said. Early reports suggested that there might have been some damage to the containment vessel after pressure dropped, but there was no immediate word of any damage to the reactor itself, the country's nuclear safety agency said. The latest explosion came after a violent blast that destroyed most of the containment building around reactor 3 on Monday, causing debris to fall back inside and on to the structure housing the reactor. The blast was caused by a build up of hydrogen that was produced when superheated steam in the core reacted with zirconium alloy cladding that surrounds the reactor's fuel rods. Tepco, the company that operates the power station, said 11 people were injured in the accident, one seriously. A similar explosion blew the top off the reactor 1 building on Saturday morning. Despite earlier assertions from Tepco that the steel containment vessels surrounding the reactors were undamaged in either of the two earlier explosions, Naoki Kumagai, an official at Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (Nisa), said: \"It's impossible to say whether there has or has not been damage.\" At one point on Sunday emergency cooling at two reactors was suspended because the pools of seawater being pumped in ran dry. Later in the day, a backup pump to a third reactor ran out of fuel, causing water levels to fall so low that the fuel rods were fully exposed. Officials at Tepco said it believed all three nuclear reactors are likely to have suffered partial meltdowns, though this could mean just one fuel rod or nearly all of them melting within the cores. The reactors are at risk of going into meltdown because although they had shut down, the fuel rods continue to give off heat. Primary and backup power to the cooling systems was knocked out during the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck on Friday. Ryohei Shiomi, a Nisa official, said reactors 1 and 3 appeared stable for the time being, but that reactor 2, where fuel rods were most exposed, was still a concern. Water has to cover completely the radioactive fuel rods in the nuclear cores to prevent overheating, but on Monday afternoon water levels dropped substantially in all three reactors, and at one point fully exposed the fuel rods in reactor 2. A spokesman for Tepco said it could not rule out a meltdown at the reactor. Speaking about the situation at reactor 2, chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, said: \"The pump ran out of fuel, and the process of inserting water took longer than expected, so the fuel rods were exposed from the water for a while.\" The decision to pump salty, untreated seawater into the reactors – along with boric acid to dampen down radioactivity – is a vastly expensive last resort that effectively writes-off the nuclear reactors for good. The plants are usually cooled by highly-purified de-ionised water that does not damage delicate components inside. The risk of total meltdown at the plant will fall dramatically over the next few days if engineers can continue to flood the reactors with seawater. The fuel rods will already have lost around 90% of their heat and without further setbacks, the reactors could be cold and rendered safe within a week to 10 days. But engineers at the power plant face a delicate balancing act because sea water being pumped into the reactors is boiling immediately into steam, which raises the pressure inside them. This has to be vented off before more water can be pumped in, but doing so releases small amounts of radioactive material into the air. Nisa has already confirmed that caesium-137 and iodine-131 have been released into the atmosphere. These radioactive substances are produced in the core and can contaminate cooling water if fuel rods get hot enough to melt the cladding that surrounds them. The release of radioactivity has raised health concerns and wider fears of environmental contamination. Monitoring posts to the north-west of the power station recorded radiation levels at 680 microSieverts per hour on Monday, a dose roughly equivalent to four months of natural background radiation. An American warship, the USS Ronald Reagan, detected low levels of radiation at a distance of 100 miles from the Fukushima plant. Radiation levels have increased in the vicinity of the power station and nearby areas. Those caught in the evacuation zone around Fukushima were given potassium iodide pills to protect against thyroid cancer. Radioactive iodine is easily absorbed by the thyroid, where it can cause tumours, but the pills saturate the gland and obstruct the radioactive form's absorption. Edano said the release of large amounts of radiation was unlikely. Under normal conditions, the nuclear reactors produce electricity by using heat from fission reactions in the fuel rods to turn water into steam and drive turbines. Reactors 1 and 2 operate with uranium fuel rods, but reactor 3 uses a mixed oxide fuel, or Mox, which contains plutonium, a highly toxic substance that if released, can linger in the environment for thousands of years. The half life of plutonium is 24,000 years, meaning it takes that long for its radioactivity to drop by half. Nuclear experts emphasised there are significant differences between the unfolding nuclear crisis at Fukushima and the events leading up to the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The Chernobyl reactor exploded during a power surge while it was in operation and released a major cloud of radiation because the reactor had no containment structure around it. At Fukushima, each reactor has shut down and is inside a 20cm-thick steel pressure vessel that is designed to contain a meltdown. The pressure vessels themselves are surrounded by steel-lined, reinforced concrete shells. \"While the material is enclosed in the reactor vessel it is safe, in that it is the same radioactivity that was there in the fuel rods. The issue would come if there is a continued problem to cool down the fuel rods,\" said Paddy Regan, a nuclear physicist at Surrey University. He said the worst case scenario would be \"that some of the fission fragments and fuel could be widely dispersed if the vessel was to explode. This seems unlikely at present, so the next worst would likely be ongoing venting of the steam which has built up in the reactors.\" Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said it was \"unlikely that the accident would develop\" like Chernobyl. \"The Japanese authorities are working as hard as they can, under extremely difficult circumstances, to stabilise the nuclear power plants and ensure safety.\" • The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 31 March 2011. This aricle said readings at the plant had reached \"8,217 microsieverts per hour – described by broadcaster NHK as equivalent to eight times the radiation a person would usually experience in a year\" and in a second story in the same issue – 15 March – we said that monitoring posts near the power station had \"recorded radiation levels at 680 microsieverts per hour yesterday, a dose roughly equivalent to four months of natural background radiation\". In both cases we compared a rate of dose with an amount of dose, which one reader suggested is not a like-for-like comparison and therefore meaningless. To clarify (we hope): NHK meant that a person who spends one hour in an area where the radiation level is 8,217 microsieverts per hour receives eight times the dose they would usually experience in a year. Our figure of 680 microsieverts over an hour is the dose a person might roughly be expected to receive at the end of four months due to natural background radiation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2013/jan/19/battle-for-soul-of-lake-district","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-19T14:09:35Z","webTitle":"Battle for soul of the Lakes pits unspoilt nature against the lure of more jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/19/battle-for-soul-of-lake-district","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2013/jan/19/battle-for-soul-of-lake-district","fields":{"headline":"Battle for soul of the Lakes pits unspoilt nature against the lure of more jobs","bodyText":"From the soaring crags of Scafell Pike to the black depths of Wastwater, the Lake District is one of Britain's most beguiling destinations. Yet its landscape is now at the centre of an increasingly fractious dispute between those who insist that preserving the pristine qualities of the fells is the best blueprint for economic development and a group who say that new developments in the area would create more jobs and growth. Britain's best-known mountaineer, Sir Chris Bonington, fired the first salvo by resigning as vice-president of the Friends of the Lake District, following the national park's rejection of plans for a \"zip wire\" ride down the side of Fleetwith Pike. Now Cumbria's tourist board – the county's largest earner, which oversees the park – has joined the dispute, arguing that the Lakes should move with the times. Richard Greenwood, the board's development and policy director, said that respecting the landscape's integrity did not \"mean the area needs to be preserved in aspic, especially if we want people to continue to come well into the future\". His comments come at a time when the Lake District is facing a growing list of threats, including the possible siting of the world's largest nuclear waste dump in its isolated western valleys; the possibility that scores of electricity pylons will be sited in the national park; and a risk of increased access to its woodlands. Bonington backed the zip wire as an innovative way to regenerate the economy by attracting new and younger tourists. \"The gains from attracting visitors and providing local jobs are great. And let's not be too stuffy: a zip wire would be a lot of fun,\" he wrote. The conservation charity from which he resigned, however, argued that the high fells were sacrosanct, and that it was the unspoilt vistas that drew most of the 15 million annual visitors to the national park. Jack Ellerby, the policy officer of Friends of the Lake District, said that the vast majority of visitors came to \"experience peace and tranquillity\". The emergence of a letter from Bonington in 2009 objecting to a proposed tourism development north of Kendal has further clouded the debate. In it, the climber describes Borrowdale, a valley that the zip wire critics claimed would be affected, as \"one of the loveliest valleys in Cumbria, all the more attractive for its quietness and pristine quality\". The next potential threat is a decision on the site of a huge underground cavern to store Britain's nuclear waste for the next million years. On 30 January, three Cumbrian councils will decide whether to agree a full preliminary planning proposal for an underground storage facility four times larger than the vast Sellafield complex from where the waste will be transported. A letter on Friday from the Friends of the Lake District to councillors set out a catalogue of safety concerns which meant the entire process had \"lost the trust\" of Cumbrians. Yet some in the isolated valley of Eskdale, which has emerged as a possible location for the facility, say the romanticism espoused by William Wordsworth and the 20th century guidebook master Alfred Wainwright is largely reserved for the tourists. Gordon Oldham, a handyman in the hamlet of Eskdale Green, said: \"What's the fuss? We'd be dead without it.\" \"It\" refers to Sellafield, which provides 9,231 jobs to an area of West Cumbria that is as naturally blessed as it is economically challenged. Further down the valley at the King George IV pub in Eskdale, a bar worker, who did not want to be named, said that he was in favour of nuclear waste being buried in the valley after the government promised community benefits for the council that allowed the enormous underground cavern. \"Dig a hole,\" he said. \"The bigger the better. We've lived with Sellafield for 50 years. What's the problem? Every penny in the pound helps.\" A short distance away, Paddington Berger, who runs the Woolpack Inn with husband Harry, agreed. \"The nuclear site is part of life, the attitude of the people who live here is that burying it won't make any difference to their life, they're OK with the possibility.\" Sellafield is considered by many residents to be vital to a region burdened by its isolation – Oldham says that he has to set aside a day to drive to the nearest Asda – and where life is economically tough. Half of all children from one electoral ward in nearby Whitehaven were found to be living in poverty in 2011. Addressing such conditions might best be achieved by adopting a more relaxed approach to the landscape, according to Greenwood, one of the region's important figures. He warned that maintaining the region's position as the \"UK's adventure capital\" required an open mind. \"If we don't invest in innovative ideas like the Honister zip wire then we will be left behind,\" he said. He said that the latest Cumbria visitor survey showed that more than half the county's 40 million annual visitors engaged in outdoor adventure, although 68% also said that they visited for the views. Among the few visitors to brave the freezing Lakes last week were Richard and Emily Bolland from Tadcaster, Yorkshire, who can see four power stations from their own home. Emily said: \"The landscape is amazing, so unspolit. It would put a bit of a dampener on it if the views changed.\" From Eskdale, above the Old Man of Coniston, lies Grizedale Forest, the scene of one of the most concerted opposition movements to the government's abandoned plans to transfer forests out of public hands. The plans were dropped following a report by the Independent Panel on Forestry and in 10 days Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is expected to deliver his detailed response to the panel and call for greater public access to privately owned woodland. Briefings from the Forest Campaigns Network, which was established early in the fight to stop public forests being sold, argue that he must also address \"very deep and real concerns\" over funding cuts that have forced the closure of visitor centres; loss of path maintenance; and made woodlands vulnerable to illegal felling. Grizedale, though, is held by some as an example that \"adventure capital\" can co-exist with the environment. Jen Ball, who has worked at Grizedale since 2008, said that although she is still adjusting to the forests's remoteness – only 10 people battled the icy roads to reach the site last Thursday – those who did were activity seekers. \"The high fells are more about Wordsworth. Over here it's about getting seriously muddy. It's not really a place for twitchers and the like.\" Others say that keeping the Lakes untouched by development is \"critical\" to their business plan. Marc Oakley of the Outward Bound Trust said: \"Any endangerment to the landscape would be problematic and prevent people coming to the area.\" But keeping the views unspoilt requires vigilance. One threat is the possible construction of scores of electricity pylons to connect the new Moorside nuclear power station, to be built near Sellafield, and wind turbines in the Irish Sea, to the national grid. Possible routes include scything across the Lake District National Park south towards Morecambe Bay, with conservationists urging that the cables are instead buried. A National Grid spokesman said that the preferred corridors would not be identified until the spring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/21/nuclear-reactor-reprieve-energy-plans-doubt","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-21T23:05:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear reactor reprieve puts UK energy plans in doubt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/21/nuclear-reactor-reprieve-energy-plans-doubt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/21/nuclear-reactor-reprieve-energy-plans-doubt","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear reactor reprieve puts UK energy plans in doubt","bodyText":"Britain's ageing nuclear reactors, which were due to close in the next decade, are set to be kept open under a plan approved by the industry's regulator. In a move that could have far-reaching implications for the government's energy policy, the Office for Nuclear Regulation has told the Guardian it is working with the country's dominant nuclear operator, the French-owned company EDF, to extend the life of its eight nuclear power stations in the UK, and that it is \"content for the plants to continue to operate\", as long as they pass regular safety tests. The two organisations are also discussing other improvements to EDF's plants, including monitoring systems and dealing with the reactors' ageing. Just a few weeks ago ministers were still referring to the need to \"keep the lights on\" in Britain when a number of existing nuclear and coal power stations closed over the next few years, by building new nuclear and gas power and subsidising renewable energy technologies and carbon capture and storage. The plans have emerged as the government prepares to publish its energy white paper , setting out plans to introduce a guaranteed minimum price for the power produced by low-carbon generators to encourage an estimated £110bn investment in nuclear and renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage equipment that traps emissions from new gas stations. EDF said it has yet to make a formal decision, but the first power stations which could be submitted for another periodic safety review (PSR) to remain open beyond their planned closure were Hinkley B in Somerset and Hunterston B in Ayrshire, both of which were due to shut down in approximately 2016. The company has said it wants to extend the life of seven of its plants for an average of seven years, a figure it has already raised from five years and which could increase again if EDF decided it was commercially viable to keep them open longer. Its other plant, Sizewell B in Suffolk, is expected to remain open until 2035. Plans to keep the nuclear plants open will encourage critics of the government's energy policy, which calls for expensive new nuclear reactors to meet short- to medium-term demand while renewable energy such as wind, solar and tidal power are improved so they can be deployed on a mass scale. The government is also betting on carbon capture and storage technology to enable gas powered stations to keep burning fossil fuels without breaching tough limits on future carbon emissions. Tom Burke, a former head of Friends of the Earth, lobbyist and visiting professor at Imperial and University Colleges, London, said EDF's decision had been \"always on the cards\" since the government put in a carbon floor price. The floor price gives low-carbon energy producers like nuclear, as well as renewable companies, an advantage by making fossil fuel burners who run coal and gas plants pay a minimum amount for each unit of carbon produced from their power stations. The policy, announced in last year's budget, begins in April 2013 at £15.70 per tonne of carbon – more than double the current market price. That rises to £30 per tonne at the end of the decade. At £15.70 the UK power industry would have had to pay more than £3bn for the carbon price alone, based on a 2007 estimate of its total emissions. \"Effectively the carbon price will pay the costs of the life extension, and then some,\" said Burke. \"There never was a plausible energy security argument for building new nuclear: they thought it was a cheap way of getting a transformation to low carbon. [Life extension] buys us time for renewables and carbon.\" The plans to keep the plants open follow a difficult few months for the government's nuclear programme with one of the two leading consortiums bidding to build new reactors pulling out, citing the political fallout from the Fukushima nuclear leak in Japan after the tsunami in that country, and reports that one of the major credit rating agencies could downgrade the rating – and so increase the cost of debt – for EDF and its new-build partner Centrica, if they went ahead with plans to build four new reactors. EDF said: \"Extending the lives of our nuclear power stations makes absolute sense in terms of filling a short-term energy need while the country rightly continues towards aggressive decarbonisation targets.\" However the company said it was still fully committed to building new reactors, dismissing suggestions that the life extensions would undermine the need for new capacity. \"Life extension helps with the very short-term risk but doesn't change the need or urgency of the new nuclear programme in the longer term,\" said a company spokesman. \"The fundamental need for new capacity remains: the inability of old coal to meet tighter emissions limits being the foremost factor.\" EDF did not need specific permission from the Office for Nuclear Regulation to submit the plants for the next 10-yearly periodic safety review, but said it had raised its intentions with the regulator because it liked to work with the regulator on a \"no surprises\" basis. Robert Gross, a leading energy expert at Imperial College, London, said he was surprised the life extensions were not expected to cause more safety issues, but said that the decision could buy time for the energy industry, which was struggling with demands to build new gas, nuclear and renewable energy in a short period of time, including problems raising finance. \"Another advantage would be we'd have more clarity on how successful we were being with renewables,\" said Gross. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said on Monday: \"Extending the lifetime of old nuclear plants will only give us a few more years of power. We will be shifting a problem to another day. New nuclear is where the future lies for long-term energy security. This is why it is so important we begin the transition on market reform today.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/jun/19/obama-berlin-speech-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-19T15:54:36Z","webTitle":"Obama in Berlin calls for reduction of nuclear arsenals – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/19/obama-berlin-speech-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jun/19/obama-berlin-speech-live","fields":{"headline":"Obama in Berlin calls for reduction of nuclear arsenals – as it happened","bodyText":"We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage of President Obama's Berlin outing. Here's a summary of where things stand: • Obama called for the reduction of global nuclear arsenals by as much as a third and for Russia and the United States to move past Cold War posturing. He announced a summit on non-proliferation to be hosted by the United States in 2016. • The American president was greeted warmly by thousands of invited audience members. He drew excited applause for speech lines about the importance of an equal and open society and for the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Still some attendees came away underwhelmed. • Obama paid tribute to Berlin as a symbol of constructive peace after a destructive past. \"Because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom,\" he said, \"we can say here in Berlin: Our values won - openness won, tolerance won, freedom won... here in Berlin.\" • Obama hinted at calls for greater German support for US intervention in countries such as Syria. \"We cannot dictate the pace of change in Arab world but we must reject the excuse that we can do nothing to support it,\" he said. Our news story on the president's speech has just been published. Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts and foreign correspondent Kate Connolly write: Barack Obama called for a renaissance in the shared liberal values that underpin western nations on Wednesday as he announced plans to cut nuclear weapons in a much-anticipated speech in Berlin that also acknowledged unease over privacy and drone strikes. Speaking at the Brandenburg Gate, in the shadow of historic speeches by Presidents Kennedy and Reagan, Obama stuck to big themes but clearly sought to address concerns in Germany caused by recent revelations of internet surveillance and US drone warfare. After quoting Immanuel Kant on freedom and his belief \"in open societies that respect that sanctity of the individual\", the president echoed calls he made during a recent speech in Washington for an ending of America's war on terror. Read the full piece here. Kate Connolly has filed a dispatch on Obama and Merkel's joint news conference preceding his half-hour speech at the Brandenburg Gate. Obama said he is confident US intelligence agencies have \"struck the appropriate balance\" between security and civil rights, Kate writes: \"I was a critic of the previous administration for those occasions in which I felt they had violated our values and I came in [to office] with a healthy scepticism about how our various programmes were structured,\" Obama told the press conference in Berlin's chancellery. But, he added, having examined how the US intelligence services were operating: \"I'm confident that at this point we have struck the appropriate balance\". Obama's remarks on the NSA dominated the 45-minute press conference, which also covered Syria, the global economic crisis and Guantánamo, with observers suggesting he had used the occasion as an opportunity to confront European scepticism over the US government's attempts to justify their surveillance operations, which have triggered deep concerns both at home and abroad. Read the full piece here. The Guardian's Kate Connolly attended the speech: The White House has released an outline of the president's new guidance on US nuclear posture for the Pentagon, state department, energy department and intelligence agencies. The presidential guidance calls for: • maintaining a credible deterrent • narrowing the scenarios for nuclear weapon use to 'extreme circumstances' and reducing the role of nukes in US security strategy • strengthening non-nuclear military capabilities • mostly shelving planning for 'launch under attack' – a nuclear reply if the US is struck. 'The potential for a surprise, disarming nuclear attack is exceedingly remote,' the document notes. • revising geopolitical risk analysis in a way that entails smaller nuclear stockpiles The president is played off by a zestful brass band. He and the first lady have a dinner tonight with Merkel and her husband, Joachim Sauer. Then it's back to Washington. \"Vielen dank,\" Obama concludes. Not as memorable as the 'Ich bin' line, but it's applauded heartily. Obama quotes King: \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" He says anyone who doubts the ability and resolve of the right-thinking to face the political challenges of the day should come to Berlin. The wall belongs to history, but we have history to make as well. And the heroes that came before us now call to us to live up to our highest ideals. The president calls for closing the prison in Guantanamo Bay. The crowd applauds. And scene. Obama calls for the reduction of nuclear arsenals and for new treaties controlling the production of atomic weapons. He says the goal is to reduce \"our deployed nuclear weapons by up to 1/3.\" He has called on Russia to \"move beyond Cold War nuclear postures,\" he says. He calls for fewer US and Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Europe; new nuclear power initiatives; and blocking the nuclearization of countries like North Korea and Iran. Obama announces the United States will host a summit in 2016 on nuclear arms reduction. He also would like for the US to ratify a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, and a treaty to end the manufacture of fissile nuclear weapons. \"We may not dictate the pace of change in the Arab world but we must reject the excuse that we can do nothing to support it.\" Lukewarm applause. \"Working for an Israeli-Palestinian peace...\" Bigger applause. \"They too in their own way are citizens of Berlin, and we have to help them, every day,\" Obama says. The speech creates a Berlin of the mind, where the conflicts of history have found resolution. The president mentioned nuclear weapons very briefly but before diving into the policy details, such as he will, he comes up for more rhetorical air, paying tribute to an equal and open society. \"We are more free when all people can pursue their own happiness,\" he says, to applause. Then he goes for an analogy so readily available as to risk groan induction: As long as walls exist in our hearts to separate from those who don't look like us, who don't think like us... We're going to have to work harder, together, to bring those walls down. To the crowd's credit they don't fall over themselves over that line. An historic line, recycled: 'Ich bin ein Berliner' echoes through the ages, but that's not all that he said that day. Less remember is the challenge he issued to the crowd... LEt me ask you to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today.... Look he said to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves. Obama says \"complacency is not the character of great nations.\" It may look like the battle for history was won with the victories of the last century, he says, but the fight, less stark than before, continues. The start of his pivot to the need for nuclear weapons reduction. Here in Berlin: Because courageous crowds climbed atop that wall... because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom, we can say here in Berlin: Our values won - openness won, tolerance won, freedom won... here in Berlin. \"We're now standing around the symbols of a Germany reborn...\" Obama says. \"While I am not the first american president to come to this gate I am proud to stand on its eastern side to pay tribute to its past.\" The American president is giving his German audience the full flowery rhetoric treatment: \"No wall can stand against the yearnings for justice, the yearnings for freedom, the yearnings for peace that burns in the human heart.\" And at the same time it's a chat among old friends: Thank you for this extraordinarily warm welcome. In fact it's so warm, and I feel so good, that I'm actually going to take off my jacket... we can be informal among friends. Merkel says that in the 21st century there can be no better partners than America and Europe. Then – after a slight miscue – she introduces Obama, who begins, \"Hello Berlin!\" Merkel is now speaking. She begins by commenting that it is a nice day if hot. Obama and Merkel also briefly addressed the controversy over NSA surveillance at their joint press conference. Obama said the spying was narrowly targeted and had saved lives. Merkel welcomed a continued debate on the issue – so there they agree: \"This is not a situation in which we are rifling through ordinary emails\" of huge numbers of citizens in the United States or elsewhere, Obama said. He called it as a \"circumscribed, narrow\" surveillance program. Merkel, for her part, said it was important to continue debate about how to strike \"an equitable balance\" between providing security and protecting personal freedoms. \"There has to be proportionality,\" she said. She added that their discussion on the matter Wednesday was \"an important first step\" over striking a balance. Obama is to speak before 4,000 invited guests. The advance team has found fans of the US president – the crowd is cheering as the dignitaries enter their glassed-in seating area. Berlin mayor Klaus Wowereit is speaking before Merkel, who will introduce Obama. You can watch the proceedings with simultaneous translation on CSPAN here. President Obama is expected to lay out goals for reduced nuclear weapons deployments in his speech today, the Chicago Tribune reports: A senior U.S. administration official said Obama, on his first visit to the German capital as president, would signal his desire to cut deployed atomic weapons by up to one third below the level achieved in the last \"New START\" treaty with Russia. At a joint press conference with chancellor Angela Merkel earlier today, Obama addressed US plans in Syria, repeating his call for the removal of president Bashar Assad but declining to describe the military support the United States plans to provide to the opposition. The Associated Press reports: President Barack Obama is refusing to describe the type of military support the U.S. will give to Syrian rebels even as he praises a decision by world leaders at a just-completed summit to seek a negotiated peace. Obama says even though leaders could not agree on whether Syrian President Bashar Assad must go, he has decided it is not possible for Assad to regain legitimacy. Germany is home to ardent opposition to the prison at Guantanamo Bay. On Monday the Obama administration published, under longtime pressure, the names of 46 Guantanamo prisoners on an \"indefinite detainee\" list. The prison currently is holding 166 inmates. Guardian foreign correspondent Kate Connolly is based in Berlin. 33 Celsius is 91.4 Fahrenheit. A marvelous welcome for the American president: Hello and welcome to our live blog coverage of President Obama's speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. The president is in the German capital for talks with chancellor Angela Merkel following the G8 summit in northern Ireland. In addition to the usual slate of discussions on security and economic concerns, the leaders were expected to address revelations about US government spying on Europeans' email and phone calls, news that has stirred particular consternation in Germany. Obama last spoke at the site as a presidential candidate in 2008. He attracted an adoring crowd of hundreds of thousands, eager to hear from the man who looked to usher the reviled George W Bush from the world stage. The Guardian's Jonathan Freedland captured the scene: The young and the pierced, some with guitars slung over their shoulders, others barefoot, jammed up against each other to cheer on a man who in less than a year has become the world's most popular serving politician, even if, as yet, he has been elected to no office grander than the junior Senate seat for Illinois. It's not the same rosy scene this time. Our correspondent Kate Connolly is there and will be bringing us updates from the crowd."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/feb/19/cameron-sarkozy-uk-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-19T00:01:03Z","webTitle":"Cameron could ask Sarkozy for a steer on how to make UK industry stronger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/19/cameron-sarkozy-uk-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/feb/19/cameron-sarkozy-uk-industry","fields":{"headline":"Cameron could ask Sarkozy for a steer on how to make UK industry stronger","bodyText":"There was a convenient political and economic symmetry to David Cameron's summit with Nicolas Sarkozy last week. Lauding a balanced relationship that has wobbled in recent months, the PM cited an Anglo-French business agreement that provided further proof that Britain's economy was tilting back towards manufacturing. Rolls-Royce, one of our industrial jewels, will earn up to £400m by helping France's Areva build four nuclear reactors on British soil for its compatriot EDF. But the deal looks about as balanced as Monsieur Hulot on a unicycling holiday. Where Rolls-Royce stands to make about £100m per power station, Areva could make around £1bn, underlining the financial benefit of having a world leader in the field of nuclear technology – or indeed any field. Areva is making the stations' steam supply systems – the beating heart of the plants – while Rolls is \"supporting\" its French partner by providing parts and engineering and technical services. Rolls is a world-leading manufacturer of aircraft engines that fly millions of passengers around the world every year. But given Britain's aim of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050, shouldn't we have a world-leading maker of nuclear power stations too? Areva has built 104 in countries including Finland and China, demonstrating the export boost that comes from having domestic industrial giants. Nurtured by the French state's commitment to nuclear power, Areva and its 48,000 employees sell expertise around the globe. Repeated here, that scenario could help to chip away at our £100bn trade deficit. It is perhaps unfair to pick on nuclear power because in France alone, there are export giants in multiple sectors. We could also single out many other areas where the UK lacks indigenous champions – civil aerospace, motoring and renewable energy. Cameron and Nick Clegg proudly showed off a union-flagged Mini in Paris, but the marque is owned by Germany's BMW. It's worth dwelling on the French theme. When Sarkozy and Cameron paid tribute to each other's strengths last week, the British PM failed to mention that despite being a fellow rightwinger, his counterpart is a dirigiste, like his predecessors. The presence of Areva, Alstom, Peugeot-Citroen and GDF Suez alone on the world stage is a ringing endorsement of a politically aggressive industrial strategy. Britain's industrial policy, by contrast, consists of throwing bit-part government contracts at a Victorian train factory in Derby owned by a Canadian multinational. There is a compelling trickle-down logic to fostering national champions, particularly if manufacturing, at 10% of GDP, is to make a meaningful dent in the 75% of the economy that is commanded by services. Lee Hopley, chief economist at UK manufacturers' organisation the EEF, believes there is a genuine rationale to the idea of creating our own industrial big hitters, if only for what follows in their slipstream. \"It is important for every economy to enable companies to grow into large ones. That is not just because they are dominant and can produce things that economies need and governments buy, like defence or energy infrastructure. They also support growth in important supply-chain businesses, which in turn can help smaller companies to do things they otherwise would not be able to do, like targeting export markets,\" he says. \"We have a gap at the top.\" Hopley stresses that non-UK manufacturers have brought good things to these shores, including competition. But because of that gap at the top, exemplified by a laissez-faire approach that lets the market shape our industrial sector, British manufacturing is a sclerotic mix of world-class outfits like Rolls-Royce and much smaller firms. As much as this government trumpets the \"march of the makers\", it simultaneously disavows \"picking winners\". Every little helps It was spectacularly bad – or good if you are a glass-half-full sort – timing for Tesco to choose last week to trumpet the creation of a \"corporate responsibility committee\". The highfalutin aims of this new group, led by newish chairman Sir Richard Broadbent, include figuring out how to honour some rather amorphous concepts in a way that commands \"respect and confidence\" and protects the company's reputation as a \"good citizen\". Let's hope Broadbent and co log on to Twitter, because last week the supermarket's good name was being trashed. Some shoppers even threatening to boycott its stores after a job centre advert was circulated across social networks that appeared to show Tesco was leaning on Britons receiving unemployment benefit to stack its shelves in the wee small hours. The description of that night-shift position as \"permanent\" – which would have been illegal – turned out to be an IT error, but it fanned the flames of the bitter controversy surrounding business's involvement in government-sponsored unpaid work experience schemes for the unemployed that come with strings attached – including the threat of benefits being docked. Surely Tesco could have foreseen that instead of being viewed as charitably offering a helping hand to the unemployed, it would be accused of exploiting cut-price labour? (Let's not forget last month's shock profit warning, which was blamed on underinvestment, including cuts to staffing levels that affected customer service.) After all, a week's jobseeker's allowance barely runs to a trolley-load of groceries in its stores and – like its supermarket peers Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons – it will hire thousands of paid workers this year anyway. On Friday, Tesco asked the DWP to remove the threat of losing benefits, to \"avoid any misunderstanding about the voluntary nature of the scheme\". By now the Twittersphere may have picked a new target for its powerful rage. But the lasting effects of this row on Tesco's reputation\" will be one for the new committee to ponder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/11/iceland-volcano-green-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-11T17:59:00Z","webTitle":"Iceland's volcanoes may power UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/11/iceland-volcano-green-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/11/iceland-volcano-green-power","fields":{"headline":"Iceland's volcanoes may power UK","bodyText":"The volcanoes of Iceland could soon be pumping low-carbon electricity into the UK under government-backed plans for thousands of miles of high-voltage cables across the ocean floor. The energy minister, Charles Hendry, is to visit Iceland in May to discuss connecting the UK to its abundant geothermal energy. \"We are in active discussions with the Icelandic government and they are very keen,\" Hendry told the Guardian. To reach Iceland, which sits over a mid-ocean split in the earth's crust, the cable would have to be 1,000 to 1,500km long and by far the longest in the world. Hendry has already met the head of Iceland's national grid about the plan. The web of sea-floor cables – called interconnectors – planned for the next decade would link the UK to a Europe-wide supergrid, which is backed by the prime minister. The supergrid would combine the wind and wave power of northern Europe with solar projects such as Desertec in southern Europe and north Africa to deliver reliable, clean energy to meet climate change targets and reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports. There are two existing international interconnectors, to France and the Netherlands, but nine more are either in construction, formal planning or undergoing feasibility studies. The next to open, in autumn 2012, will be a link between the Republic of Ireland and Wales, allowing green energy from the windswept Atlantic coast of Ireland to be delivered to British homes. The UK has been energy independent for virtually its entire history. But with the North Sea's oil and gas failing and coal banned as too polluting, Hendry is frank about the future: \"We will be dependent on imported energy.\" The cables \"are an absolutely critical part of energy security and for low carbon energy\", he said. The government's legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions is another key driver for the new interconnectors, which if all built could supply a third of the nation's average electricity demand. Renewable energy, such as the offshore wind power at the heart of the government's renewable plans, is zero carbon once built but is also intermittent, meaning back-up gas plants or energy storage are needed. A 900km interconnector to Norway, due to open by 2019, would enable excess wind energy to pump water into storage lakes above the fjords. Then, when the electricity is needed, floodgates are opened and the water flows back down through turbines. Both the pump storage and the high-voltage direct-current interconnectors lose very little energy. Another ambitious interconnector would link England to Alderney, where very strong tides could produce 4GW of electricity, and then on to France and the new 1.6GW nuclear power plant being built at Flamanville. Commercial agreements for this were signed in February. Interconnector cables can be laid very rapidly – at over 30km a day – but remain significant engineering projects, with each kilometre containing 800 tonnes of copper. The most time-consuming aspect is settling international agreements and preparing landing sites and pylons to handle and distribute a large amount of electricity. \"It's like taking a large nuclear power station onshore,\" said Hendry. He argued that a web of high-voltage cables ending the energy isolation of the British Isles will help keep household energy bills down, by allowing access to the cheapest energy at any particular time. Tony Glover, at energy grid trade body the Energy Networks Association, said: \"For consumers the ability to link electricity supplies from the rest of Europe is good for competition and will generally help to keep prices competitive.\" The interconnectors can be built commercially with operators paying for the investment by taking a cut on the electricity transferred. As well as consumer energy bills, Hendry also argued that interconnectors will help reduce the cost of the intermittency of renewable energy. \"Interconnectors are an incredibly effective way to counter the argument that you need to back up each gigawatt of wind with a gigawatt of gas – they quite clearly show you do not,\" he said. Interconnectors require large investments. The Britain-Netherland interconnector, which opened in 2011 and was the first international link in 25 years, cost £500m. But Greenpeace's Doug Parr said: \"Interconnectors are the cheapest way of backing up wind, because you avoid the greater capital cost of building power stations. We will of course be buying power in when the wind is not blowing, but the interconnectors mean we can sell our wind power when it does, and we have the best wind resource in Europe.\" However, Simon Less at the thinktank Policy Exchange, urged caution in relying on interconnectors for back-up: \"Major new interconnection in north western Europe might not offset much of the need for backup plant because winter high pressure weather patterns can extend low wind conditions right across Europe.\" Norway's pump storage could counter that fear but there is competition for access to that resource, with Germany also negotiating over an interconnector. \"We are keen we should be first,\" said Hendry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"childrens-books-site/2012/apr/24/gone-michael-grant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-24T14:30:00Z","webTitle":"Gone by Michael Grant - review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/apr/24/gone-michael-grant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2012/apr/24/gone-michael-grant-review","fields":{"headline":"Gone by Michael Grant - review","bodyText":"Imagine that everyone above the age of 15 has disappeared, you're stuck in a 20-mile diameter dome that hurts at the touch and just to top it off kids have started to get strange powers like teleportation and the ability to shoot burning light out of their hands. Not very normal, is it? But in the FAYZ (The dome they are trapped in) normal is out, and out-of-this-world crazy is in. The star of the show is Sam Temple, a 14-year-old kid who likes to surf and has developed the power to create light. His power ranges from creating balls of light to melting people's arms off. The story starts in the small town of Perdido Beach when Sam's teacher disappears and he and his three friends (Quinn, Edilio and Astrid) realise everyone over the age 15 has gone. They leave town where the bullies are in power and go searching for Astrid's autistic little brother Pete and eventually find him at the nuclear power plant where Astrid's dad works. When they return four cars arrive and the kids from the Coates Academy (a special school for misfits) get out. The Coates kids are called Caine Soren, Diana Ladris, Drake Merwin and Computer Jack. Caine is their leader and says he wants to work together with the bullies (Orc, Howard and a bunch of others) and anyone else to replace the anarchy with a new society. But soon tempers get frayed and Sam and his friends turn against Caine and a new conflict begins between them. I'm not going to tell the whole story because that would ruin it, but this book is so gripping once you start reading you can't stop. It's an edge of your seat action-thriller jam-packed with loads of excitement. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and adventure or just loves a good read.

These restrictions prevent further Iranian oil export deals with EU states, provide a July deadline for current deals and freeze the European-based assets and trading capacity of Iran's central bank. This follows new US sanctions that were adopted earlier this month. While Iran is accustomed to being challenged over its nuclear programme, the scale and likely effect of these new sanctions means that the Iranian regime is unlikely to respond with quiet acceptance. By restricting Iran's sale of oil – the sustaining lifeblood of the regime – the latest sanctions foreshadow a major escalation in tensions. For Iran's leaders, attaining nuclear power is non-negotiable. From the regime's perspective, a nuclear Iran would effectively guarantee the ongoing Islamic revolution. With nuclear weapons, Iran's clerical leadership believes it would be free to engage in more forceful, overt support for theologically rooted Shia political movements across the region (most obviously, the Lebanese Hezbollah). At the same time, these leaders believe that establishing a nuclear capability would also establish a corollary security umbrella to deter foreign enemies from threatening the regime's existential security. Linked to the first point, an Iranian nuclear capability would be a huge propaganda coup for the regime. As a nuclear power, the self-asserted masters of Shia theological enlightenment would be able to present themselves as similar masters of scientific intellect. The importance of such a success for the regime's mythology cannot be understated. It is in this context of Iran's perceived nuclear necessity that the sanctions will operate. In imposing substantial damage to an Iranian economy already deep in crisis, from Iran's perspective, the west is imposing costs (in requiring the cessation of the Iranian nuclear programme) that are impossibly high. The regime will not give up its nuclear efforts, but neither will it accept an approaching economic implosion. It is under this consideration that Iran is likely to take action to attempt to alter its current predicament – the objective being to weaken the sanctions and to provide time and space for continued nuclear development. In pursuing this outcome, the regime could adopt a number of different strategies. First, the regime might attempt to mine the Straits of Hormuz. This possibility has received much media attention in recent weeks but would inevitably represent a major escalatory step on the part of Iran. In the short term, it would cause an immediate spike in oil prices and panic western markets. However, for all the rhetoric, Iran knows that ultimately it could not maintain a blockade for long. The US navy is simply too powerful. Therefore, in taking this action, Iran could certainly produce a temporary effect, but only at severe military cost. In addition, such action would risk providing Israel with a pretext to launch its own action against Iranian nuclear facilities. Second, the regime might utilise the Revolutionary Guards to engage in covert action against western interests around the world. While such action would unnerve western markets, it would also risk major retaliation. However, the 1996 attack on the Khobar Towers and the 2007 Karbala raid provide two powerful examples of the regime's enduring willingness to take aggressive (and perceivably risky) steps to pursue its political-security agenda. Third, the regime might encourage Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon to reinstigate conflict with Israel. Iran might consider such action would serve to consolidate the position of Iran's ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, allowing him to distract attention from his domestic repression. Alongside this calculation, the regime might hope that it could play off western fears of a regional war – so increasing the likelihood of a negotiated lessening of international pressure. Again, however, Israel might decide to retaliate directly against the Iranian nuclear programme. Fourth, the regime might decide to engage in further sabre-rattling in the Gulf area. Such action might follow the form of previous threats or ship charge runs. Iran might consider that in increasing regional tensions (and oil prices) it could exploit potential fractures in the pro-sanctions element of the international community, while mitigating the risk of major American retaliation (as, say, a direct attack would likely incur). Again, however, the Iranian regime would risk appearing weak if the sanctions regime were to remain firm in face of such actions. Regardless of what action or combination of actions the Iranian regime chooses to take, history and present circumstances suggest that it will be unwilling to tolerate these new restrictions with acquiescence. While Iran's military power is limited, in manipulating the west's fears of the regime as fundamentally irrational and thus capable of highly destructive behaviour, Iran's leaders will hope to weaken the durability of these sanctions while protecting the nuclear power that they so desperately desire. Ultimately, the Iranian leadership will gamble that its resolve supersedes that of the west."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/mar/11/japan-tsunami-earthquake-recovery-future","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-11T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"After the earthquake: changing Japan | Masahiro Matsumura","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/11/japan-tsunami-earthquake-recovery-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/11/japan-tsunami-earthquake-recovery-future","fields":{"headline":"After the earthquake: changing Japan","bodyText":"On the first anniversary of the huge earthquake that hit Japan's northeastern Pacific coast, its people are still coming to terms with their grief and trying to work out what the disaster meant for the nation. Although 3/11, as it's become known, was a bolt from the blue, the country – located in one of the world's largest and most active volcanic zones – had long expected a great earthquake and tsunami to occur sooner or later. It was well prepared for the type of disaster that would happen once every 100 years, but not for a far greater one-in-a-1000-years one. No wonder the catastrophe overwhelmed Japan's well-laid plans for protecting people, buildings and infrastructure. Fail-safe measures to cope with a super-disaster are practically beyond the nation's wealth: the worst-case scenario is sequential or even simultaneous occurrence in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, the central Pacific coast and the southwestern Pacific coast. Alongside national and local government efforts to improve disaster preparations, individuals now have to consider the topographic, geological and social features of their homes and workplaces, and have less choice over where to live than in the past. The areas devastated on 3/11 need a new and comprehensive approach to urban planning and social programmes. In coastal areas, people may work on the seafront but have to live on high ground. The elderly in this rapidly greying society, who often live alone, need to move into regional hubs for better care and services, such as collective housing. And the highly concentrated population and functions of megalopolises, particularly Tokyo, will have to disperse to smaller hub cities in order to dissipate the risks involved in a super-disaster. The general sense of anxiety has been exacerbated by the continuation of the restrictions on the electricity supply caused by the shutdown of all the country's nuclear power plants for checks. The badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant discharged massive amounts of nuclear pollutants, endangering population in the immediate vicinity. As the only nation that has suffered an atomic bombing, Japan reacted sharply to the nuclear accident. However, its people were unknowingly exposed to a considerably higher level of radiation resulting from the nuclear test explosions that China conducted in the 1960s, and nowadays they commonly undergo radiation-based medical examinations such as X-raying and CT scanning. In order to make up the 30% drop in power supply caused by the shutdown, electricity companies have reactivated old thermal power plants, and businesses and individuals have conserved power. People wore fewer clothes in the summer to reduce the need for air conditioning, and wrapped up warmer in winter. And many businesses worked over weekends, shifting a weekend holiday to a week day, to ease peaks in power demand. Nonetheless, energy from fossil-fuels costs more than nuclear, so bills have been higher, which has damaged Japan's international competitiveness. As the sense of fear calms down, however, the public will probably learn to accept nuclear power again, though with a reduced dependence. All the nuclear plants withstood the 3/11 seismic shock, though the three damaged reactors at Fukushima did not survive the tsunami. And two of those three reactors used the old, defective US-built turn-key model, prior to the construction of Japanese-designed, modified ones. Protection against the tsunami threat can be improved; but if sufficient work cannot be done, the plants on the Pacific coast will have to be relocated to the opposite Sea-of-Japan coast that suffers far fewer earthquakes. This could all have been done even before 3/11. In this sense, the nuclear accident was attributable in part to intellectual arrogance and a longstanding but inadequate safety regime. With their loss of peace of mind, many Japanese people feel as if they have been expelled from a country close to paradise. Yet 3/11 has made the people far tougher and the nation more resilient. The postwar era is now over, and the post-disaster era is under way. Natural disaster, not war, will finally transform Japan's carefree cold-war era collective mind. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/29/nuclear-power-safe-sir-david-king","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T14:57:14Z","webTitle":"Nuclear is the safest form of power, says top UK scientist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/29/nuclear-power-safe-sir-david-king","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/29/nuclear-power-safe-sir-david-king","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear is the safest form of power, says top UK scientist","bodyText":"Stepping on to a transatlantic flight will expose a person to more radiation than walking around the Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan – even in its current state of near-meltdown – according to the UK government's former chief scientist. Sir David King mounted a robust defence of nuclear power on Wednesday as renewed fears over its dangers buffeted the industry. He said it was the safest form of electricity generation, and that the recovery of most of Japan's nuclear fleet after the worst earthquake in living memory showed that safety systems were working. \"An earthquake of 9.0 [magnitude] hit Japan, and all 16 nuclear plants that felt the earthquake were switched off within two minutes,\" he said. \"Every one of them acted as they were meant to, including Fukushima. Water cooling was initiated, as designed.\" He pointed out that the 14-metre tsunami which hit Fukushima was \"an extremely unlikely event\" that overwhelmed defences designed for a tsunami of more than 2m. When this happened, the battery systems stepped in to pump cooling water round the plant for nine and a half hours, he said. All this was evidence of safety systems kicking in correctly. \"As far as we know, not one person has died from radiation,\" he added. \"Let me put that in context - in the same week, 30 coal miners died. Generating electricity from coal is far more dangerous.\" He asked: \"Is there safer power than nuclear energy historically? No. Even hydroelectricity has caused more fatalities.\" Nuclear power represented a \"massive economic opportunity\" for the UK, Sir David said, and one that should be kept on track despite the incidents in Japan. Sir David said the lessons from the Japanese incident would help to improve safety further. \"We should be looking carefully at the lessons we have learned from this tsunami and how to manage the risks. On the whole, [the Japanese nuclear industry] responded well.\" The problems in Japan \"could never have been a Chernobyl - that could not have happened,\" he said. The mass evacuations that have taken place were a good precaution, but people were not in danger, he said. Airline passengers unwittingly expose themselves to a dose of radiation when they fly, but it is harmless as it is in such small quantities. Sir David also said he did not believe the assertion by Connie Hedegaard, Europe's climate change commissioner, that electricity generation from offshore wind was cheaper than nuclear power. \"My own view is that nuclear is going to prove to be very competitive,\" he said. But he said that in the race to decarbonise electricity production, countries should pursue all available non-fossil fuel options, including all forms of renewable energy. Sir David was speaking at the launch of a new report from the Smith School of Enterprise, part of Oxford University, which showed that the UK should reform its nuclear industry in order to recycle spent fuel waste into new usable fuel for the new generation of reactors the coalition government is pressing for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2013/jul/05/ten-billion-stephen-emmott-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-05T07:01:00Z","webTitle":"Population 10 Billion by Danny Dorling and Ten Billion by Stephen Emmott – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/05/ten-billion-stephen-emmott-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2013/jul/05/ten-billion-stephen-emmott-review","fields":{"headline":"Population 10 Billion by Danny Dorling and Ten Billion by Stephen Emmott – review","bodyText":"Overpopulation has become almost a forbidden concept. Thirty years ago, when there were around two and a half billion fewer human beings on the planet, the idea was actively debated. Many environmentalists accepted that smaller human numbers were necessary if humankind was ever to live in balance with the natural world, while the argument that there was no such thing as overpopulation was largely the preserve of free-market economists, doctrinaire Marxists and assorted religious fundamentalists. The debate was not always of the highest quality, with some advocates of population control making stark forecasts of imminent global starvation, and some of their opponents suggesting that a Green Revolution in agriculture would abolish hunger within a generation. Neither of these prospects was realistic, but there was a shared recognition that there might be a problem in rapidly rising human numbers. Today, the very idea that there could be too many people on the planet has been abandoned as retrograde and anti-human. Green parties rarely raise the issue of population, saying that what matters is not the number of people but how resources are distributed among them; they insist that concern with population is a distraction from inequality and the immoralities of capitalism. No leader of any mainstream party in any country would dream of making population a key issue. The view that overpopulation is a figment of the dark reactionary imagination is undoubtedly the current orthodoxy. Yet there has not been a voice that could systematically articulate the prevailing wisdom – a gap that has been filled by Danny Dorling. A professor of human geography at Sheffield and soon to be Halford Mackinder professor of geography at Oxford, Dorling aims to discredit any suggestion that the human species might be pressing up against the limits of natural resources. Peppering his argument with pained references to the few that persist in asking whether the planet might not already be rather crowded – David Attenborough and Joanna Lumley among those cited with purse-lipped disapproval – Dorling is the perfect anti-Malthusian. His account of the Essay on the Principle of Population (1798), in which the Reverend Thomas Malthus argued that the growth of human numbers would eventually be checked by shortage of food, follows a time-worn path. \"It was the sexual hang-ups of a man of the cloth that resulted in ideas of population control making their political debut in 19th-century Britain.\" Originating in sexual repression, the idea of overpopulation tells a gloomy tale of the narrow limits of social improvement. \"Human beings progress by telling stories,\" and it is a story of ongoing advance that we need. We should \"learn to try not to estimate the carrying capacity of the Earth\", but instead focus on possibilities of changing human behaviour. Population decline is already under way in some countries, and global human numbers will peak sometime this century. By telling ourselves a story about \"how ten billion people can live well on the planet\", we can exorcise the Malthusian phantasm. Though Dorling describes Population 10 Billion as \"a book for pragmatists\", it is actually intensely ideological all the way through. Reading his winningly simple narrative, you would not know that Malthus stands at the start of a long liberal tradition that acknowledged the dangers of rising human numbers but argued for contraception as the solution. The first economist to suggest (in 1848) that a zero-growth economy might be positively desirable, John Stuart Mill was a lifelong advocate of birth-control who – after discovering a newly killed infant under a pile of rags in St James's Park – was arrested on an obscenity charge and spent a night in prison at the age of 17 for distributing pamphlets offering practical advice on contraception to working-class women. Again, John Maynard Keynes – an admirer of Malthus who believed economics took a wrong turn when it departed from his work – suggested in his famous essay on \"Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren\" (1930) that more than enough wealth could be produced to satisfy human needs, but only if human numbers were stabilised by humane methods of birth control. Dorling doesn't mention these neo-Malthusian liberals because they don't fit the story he wants to tell, which is that the only limits on population are those imposed by oppressive human institutions. There are larger omissions. In a book that recurs regularly to famines caused by western imperialism, there is no discussion of the politically engineered famine that cost millions of lives in the Ukraine in the early 1930s. Even more remarkably, Dorling manages to avoid the famine China suffered as a result of Mao's Great Leap Forward in 1958‑62. If you search for it in the book, you will find a single mention in the text, where it is cited in the course of a sentence listing four exceptions to continuing global population growth between the years 1851-1871. A reference directs the reader to a newspaper article, which an internet search reveals to be a review of Frank Dikötter's book, Mao's Great Famine (2011). But Dikötter's pioneering work, showing how tens of millions of people were starved, worked or beaten to death, is not discussed, while Yang Jisheng's taboo-breaking Tombstone: The Untold Story of Mao's Great Famine (2012) is not cited at all. One of the greatest human catastrophes is consigned to an opaque footnote. An innocent reader might wonder why the largest famine of the 20th century, possibly in all of human history, should not be given a little more space in a book about population and resources. After all, Mao was no Malthusian – fired by a boundless sense of human possibility, he denied there could ever be too many people. Writing of the risk of a major famine in the middle of the current century, Dorling tells us such a famine will occur only if those with power \"see others as less human than themselves\". He goes on: \"It is hard to think how this will happen unless hedge-fund morality becomes the norm and betting on future food prices is not curtailed.\" It's true that betting on food has had political effects – a speculative boom in grain prices helped trigger the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt, for example. But the idea that hedge funds are the main obstacle to seeing others as fully human – let alone the only obstacle, as Dorling seems to suggest – is a parody of politically correct thinking. Despite disavowing anything that smacks of utopia or revolution, he seems to have persuaded himself that sectarian warfare in the Middle East, the re-emergence of the far right in Europe, enmity between China and Japan, as well as other awkward features of the contemporary scene, can be left behind if only we learn to tell ourselves new stories. He never doubts that \"we\" – he means people like himself – are becoming \"a little less stupid\". Reading him on the state of the world today, one can only wonder. Here and there his book contains some useful insights. He makes short work of Matt Ridley's \"rational optimism\", and is right to suggest that we should start thinking about how to live with declining populations. One way or another, the spike in population is sure to come to an end and human numbers will then fall. But there is no reason for thinking this can be a peaceful process. Dorling welcomes the economic slowdown that has occurred in highly developed countries, and, in terms of the health of the planet, he is right; but the great majority of human beings want more growth not less, and any protracted contraction is bound to be accompanied by increased conflict. Believing planetary limits have been dreamt up to frighten us, he insists: \"There is an alternative to fear.\" The alternative – wait for it – is \"to stop buying things you don't need\". Dorling invokes Marx on several occasions, always with respectful admiration. But Marx knew the human world is an arena of struggle and history more than a collection of reassuring anecdotes. Faced with Dorling's sermonising, he would have reacted with a guffaw of contempt. Talk of giving up consumerism is reminiscent of Stephen Emmott's favourite example of a fashionable pseudo-solution for environmental problems: peeing while you're in the shower. Microsoft professor of computational research at Oxford, who founded and leads Microsoft's research laboratory in Cambridge, Emmott is singled out by Dorling as one of those who – following the devilish Malthus – invents nightmare scenarios. What Emmott in fact does – and this is the real difference between him and Dorling – is set the human animal firmly in the material world, where it actually lives. The planet does not care about the stories that humans tell themselves; it responds to what humans do, and is changing irreversibly as a result. As Emmott writes: \"Right now, every leaf on every tree on Earth is experiencing a level of CO2 that the planet has not experienced for millions of years. How the planet's plants will respond to this we simply don't fully understand.\" While this unprecedented shift is under way, 40% of the planet's surface is being used for agriculture – a figure that will surely rise. Changes in diet, along with rising incomes, are part of the picture, but the expansion of agriculture is driven by one force more powerful than any other: the increase in human numbers. Ten thousand years ago there were only a million humans. As recently as 1960, there were only 3 billion. Today, there are more than 7 billion human beings, and there will probably be around 3 billion more before the century is over. Every aspect of the environmental crisis is interconnected, and all of them flow from the pressure of population. As Emmott shows in powerful detail, it is human expansion that lies behind the conquest of our dependency on oil, coal and gas; the industrial-scale use of chemical pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers; battery farming; the transformation of fresh water into a depleting resource and the mass extinction of other life forms that is under way. Food production has become a branch of global industry, increasing our reliance on fossil fuels and accelerating the process of climate change. A mounting risk of famine is the result. In a roundabout process he couldn't have imagined, Malthus has turned out to be essentially right. Emmott's short, highly accessible and vividly illustrated book marshals compelling evidence that \"entire global ecosystems are not only capable of suffering a catastrophic tipping point, but are already approaching such a transition\". He sees only two ways of dealing with what has become a planetary emergency: \"The first is technologising our way out of it. The second is radical behaviour change.\" Emmott is sceptical about the first – particularly geoengineering schemes, which he views as highly risky – and sees no evidence of any readiness for radical behavioural change. \"We need to consume less … And yet, every decade, global consumption continues to increase relentlessly.\" With neither technology nor politics offering any way out, Emmott concludes: \"The problem is us … We urgently need to do – and I mean actually do – something radical to avert a global catastrophe. But I don't think we will. I think we're fucked.\" Are we fucked, then? Well, it's clear we're in for a pretty rough time. The physical systems of the planet look like becoming more dangerously unstable. As Emmott explains, plumes of methane – a greenhouse gas many times more potent than C02 – have been observed rising from previously frozen areas off the Arctic shelf, and if the cause is melting ice triggered by human activities then the process could go on for centuries. The land grab in which rich countries and corporations are buying up arable land around the world will continue. Resource wars will multiply, and in a geopolitical struggle that has already begun the Arctic will become the site of the next Great Game. \"People are not bad when they have plenty of room,\" observed the Austro-Hungarian writer Joseph Roth. Emmott tells us that the violent spillover of environmental crisis is attracting the concern of military thinkers, and reports a young scientific colleague telling him that, looking ahead, he plans to teach his son how to use a gun. A course in computer hacking might be more useful, but the point is sound. While the planet is changing at a rate unknown in human experience, there is no prospect of any radical change in human behaviour. That doesn't mean there is nothing that can be done. Unless climate change escalates to chaotic levels, the human animal will muddle through. A mix of declining fertility and technical fixes (including demonised technologies such as nuclear power) can help deal with the bottleneck in human numbers. The shift in thinking that will be needed if we are to prepare ourselves for living in a different world begins with reading Emmott's indispensable book. • John Gray's The Silence of Animals: On Progress and Other Modern Myths is published by Allen Lane.

Without power, water could not be pumped into the reactors to cool them and they soon began to overheat and overpressurise. Twenty-four hours later, an explosion caused by a buildup of hydrogen at reactor one ripped off the walls and roof. It was not the image an already traumatised nation wished to see. As the world began to grasp the scale of devastation caused by the tsunami – the death toll would surpass 16,000 – fear soon spread that \"another Chernobyl\" was developing at Fukushima. The Japanese government fought to downplay the risks of a radiation leak, but, with growing local and international concern, a 20km exclusion zone was established around the stricken power plant and, after much prevarication, Fukushima was eventually graded as a \"level 7\" accident by the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Only the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 had ever received such a severe grading. It meant that Fukushima was officially classified as a \"major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures\". As a later-to-be-fabled group of workers known as the \"Fukushima 50\" remained at the site to try to contain the damage, most notably a fire that had started at reactor four, the government sought to reassure the world that the incident was under control. But a sense of distrust quickly developed and on 14 March the French government became the first to advise its citizens to leave the Tokyo area. Demand for iodine tablets surged in places as far away as California, as people feared contamination from drifting radiation. Professor Robin Grimes, a nuclear industry analyst based at Imperial College London, watched on with the rest of the world. \"I have to be honest and say that, in those first few early days when the information was both patchy and contradictory, I thought Fukushima would set the global nuclear industry back as much as Chernobyl,\" he says. \"I just wouldn't have guessed then, though, that the reaction around the world would be so markedly different.\" After several months of global concern about the outcome of Fukushima, attention turned from the radiation leak itself – it is now estimated that Fukushima released about a tenth of the radiation expelled into the atmosphere at Chernobyl – to a fallout of a different kind. Many countries – including the UK – were in the throes of planning a new wave of \"next-generation\" nuclear power stations. How would Fukushima impact such plans? The impact within Japan itself was swift and predictable. A nation that had been greatly reliant on nuclear power quickly rose up to condemn the technology. By June, polls showed 80% of the population were now anti-nuclear and suspicious of the government's handling of the affair. Thousands marched through Tokyo demanding the government say \"sayonara\" to nuclear and by October only 11 nuclear power stations were still operating in Japan (a few years earlier it had 54) forcing the country to adopt rolling blackouts to manage demand for electricity. The ripples of concern soon reached Germany. Within just a few weeks of Fukushima, the German government announced that all eight of the nation's reactors that were built prior to 1981 (Fukushima began generating in 1971) were to be temporarily shut down as a precaution and to allow time for safety checks. On 26 March, Germany witnessed its largest ever anti-nuclear demonstration when 250,000 people marched demanding that the government \"heed Fukushima\". By the end of May, Chancellor Angela Merkel had confirmed that Germany would speed up its retreat from nuclear energy and, by 2022, would have shut down the last of its reactors. To compensate, it would instead ramp up its supply of renewables from 17% to 35%. The move was met with incredulity and applause across the world. On the one hand, it left Germany more reliant on energy imports, most notably from \"nuclear France\" and \"coal Poland\". As soon as next year, it is predicted that Germany will become a net importer of energy. But, equally, others greeted the news warmly as it showed a major industrialised economy making a stride towards renewables. \"I was surprised,\" says Grimes. \"They were edging in that direction already, but their reaction really highlighted the politics underlying it all. It was about keeping the coalition government together and appeasing the Greens.\" Grimes adds that it's \"remarkable\" how polarised the reactions to Fukushima have been: \"I was also surprised that the US and UK were not really affected by it. If anything, it has strengthened attitudes in support of nuclear here in the UK.\" Environmental writers such as George Monbiot and Mark Lynas argued that Fukushima should, in fact, reassure us. \"I am no longer nuclear-neutral,\" wrote Monbiot, 10 days after the tsunami. \"I now support the technology … Atomic energy has just been subjected to one of the harshest of possible tests, and the impact on people and the planet has been small.\" Grimes says reactions such as this show that Fukushima has \"improved\" the debate about nuclear in the UK. \"Perception and understanding of risk are two very different things. We have to have a better understanding of risk in our society and Fukushima has helped to open up a better debate about nuclear energy. I think the UK is better placed as a result. We're not shouting at each other in the UK any more. We seem more comfortable talking about nuclear.\" But it has forced us to reassess safety, says Grimes: \"We have lessons to learn about the risk of flooding, for example. But our new reactors will be fundamentally different to the old Fukushima-style reactors. It's like trying to compare a Ford Prefect with a modern car today. India and China, who are both pushing ahead with their own nuclear plans, have also taken pause to look at their safety regimes, but are unlikely to rein back much as a result of Fukushima.\" Outside Germany and Japan, negative reactions have largely been limited to Italy (which, like Germany, has always had strong political opposition to nuclear), Israel and Indonesia. \"Some countries who were thinking about nuclear power have now pulled back,\" says Grimes. \"Indonesia's location on the 'Ring of Fire' area of seismic activity – and memories of its own tsunami – means nuclear energy is considered too risky now.\" But, overall, the global nuclear industry seems not to have experienced the aftershocks of Fukushima that some first imagined. Germany aside, the conclusion has been that nuclear is a \"nosepeg\" solution: we might not instinctively like the smell of it, but, given the predicted looming energy and climate crises ahead, we have little choice but to push ahead – as long as we learn the hard lessons of Fukushima."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/14/germany-japan-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T20:21:05Z","webTitle":"Germany suspends power station extension plans as nuclear jitters spread","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/14/germany-japan-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/14/germany-japan-nuclear-industry","fields":{"headline":"Germany suspends power station extension plans as nuclear jitters spread","bodyText":"Germany today announced the temporary closure of its two oldest nuclear power stations and suspended plans to extend the life of all of the country's remaining plants as jitters over nuclear power spread across the world. Switzerland also put on hold plans to build and replace nuclear plants and Austria's environment minister called for atomic stress tests to make sure Europe's nuclear facilities are \"earthquake-proof\". On Tuesday there will be an emergency meeting of European Union nuclear safety authorities and operators to assess Europe's preparedness in case of an emergency. After two hydrogen explosions at the Fukushima Daiichi reactor in Japan, the German chancellor Angela Merkel decided to re-examine her controversial decision last year to renew 17 nuclear plants for an average of 12 years. Merkel announced a \"three-month moratorium\" while each plant was given a thorough safety check.As a result, Germany's two oldest nuclear power stations will be taken off the grid imminently, as they have already reached the end of their lifespan. They will only be reconnected if they pass strict safety checks, the chancellor said in Berlin. Both plants are situated in states where there are regional elections later this month. One, Biblis A, is in Hesse, western Germany, and the other, Neckarwestheim I, is in the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg. Merkel's Christian Democratic Party (CDU) is at risk of losing Baden-Württemberg for the first time since 1953, leading commentators to suggest the decision was partly politically motivated. Most Germans are opposed to nuclear power, and Japan's problems have raised fears of the technology and strengthened the nuclear lobby and the opposition Green Party. A poll for the news channel N-TV on Monday showed 88% of Germans wanted plants shut sooner rather than later. Merkel said Germany needs to continue using nuclear power while it switches over to renewable power sources to keep energy affordable and to ensure it is not dependent on importing nuclear energy from other countries where safety standards might be lower than those in Germany. However, the events in Japan \"teach us that risks that were considered absolutely improbable are in fact not completely improbable,\" she added. The Swiss energy minister, Doris Leuthard, said the suspension would affect all \"blanket authorisation for nuclear replacement until safety standards have been carefully reviewed and if necessary adapted\". Swiss regulatory authorities had given their stamp of approval to three sites for new nuclear power stations after the plans were submitted in 2008. European energy commissioner Günther Oettinger said safety at older German nuclear power stations must be checked rigorously, and he refused to rule out closures. He told Deutschlandfunk radio that the crisis in Japan had changed the world and brought into question what had been seen as safe and manageable. The government's decision last year to keep Germany's nuclear plants running for 12 years beyond their original shutdown date had stirred large-scale protests. On Saturday, anti-nuclear protesters formed a 45km (27 mile) human chain from the city of Stuttgart to an older nuclear power plant that will be kept running longer because of the new policy. Between 50,000 and 60,000 demonstrators took part, according to police and organisers. In the US, Barack Obama reaffirmed his support for nuclear power. At a White House press conference, the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Gregory Jaczko, said the 104 reactors in the US were built to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis. \"Right now we believe we have a very strong programme in place,\" he said, adding that Japan had requested assistance from the NRC and two experts on boiling water reactors were en route. Jaczko in his remarks gave no details on the magnitude of natural disasters US reactors could withstand. Twenty-three are identical models of the two reactors which exploded in Japan. Twelve are newer versions of that model. He also said any release of radiation would be highly dispersed by the time it travelled across the Pacific to Hawaii or the West Coast. Jaczko's appearance was the second show of confidence in the nuclear industry since Sunday. The White House said in a statement that Obama continued to see nuclear power as part of America's energy portfolio. \"The president believes that meeting our energy needs means relying on a diverse set of energy sources that includes renewables like wind and solar, natural gas, clean coal and nuclear power. \"Information is still coming in about the events unfolding in Japan, but the administration is committed to learning from them and ensuring that nuclear energy is produced safely and responsibly here in the US,\" the statement said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/13/drought-in-romania-threatens-danube-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-13T14:04:00Z","webTitle":"Persistent drought in Romania threatens Danube's power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/13/drought-in-romania-threatens-danube-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/13/drought-in-romania-threatens-danube-power","fields":{"headline":"Persistent drought in Romania threatens Danube's power","bodyText":"In Cernavoda, a small town in southeast Romania, social housing projects stretch all along the left bank of the Danube. The now dilapidated buildings sprang up in the 1970s and 1980s, after the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu decided to build the country's first nuclear power plant there. In his ambition for power and prosperity, he also ordered a canal to be built from Cernavoda to Constantza, a port on the Black Sea, to shorten the trade route by 400km. The excavations were done by thousands of political prisoners, many of whom died. Today, 21 years after the fall of communism, the threat to Cernavoda is not from dictatorship but the drought that has hit Romania since August. \"Look at the water level,\" said Vasile Mogos, who lives in a council flat by the river. \"I would never have imagined that the Danube could fall so low.\" The Danube crosses Europe from west to east over 2,850km, from its source in Germany's Black Forest to the Black Sea in Romania. In its path Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania all exploit the waters of Europe's second-longest river after the Volga. The first reactor in the Romanian nuclear power plant, which uses Canadian CANDU reactor technology based on natural uranium and pressurised heavy water, came on stream in 1996. A second reactor was built in 2007, and three others are planned, since the Romanian government counts on nuclear power for energy self-sufficiency. The two reactors in the Cernavoda plant generate 20% of those needs and were built on the banks of the Danube to use its waters for cooling. Early this month, the Danube's flow rate in Turnu-Severin, a town in southwest Romania, home to the country's largest hydroelectric power plant, was 2,400 cubic metres per second, 63% of the usual average of 3,800 cubic metres per second. Hidroelectrica, the public corporation in charge of delivering the energy produced by the plant, is generating only 1,800MW instead of the usual 2,100 MW. In 2003 the drought in Romania was so severe that it led to the shutdown of one of the Cernavoda reactors. Cantemir Ciurea, director of the National Committee for Controlling Nuclear Activities, said: \"We immediately put in place a new system that allowed the pumps to extract the cooling water from much lower levels.\" The Romanian authorities have not, however, discounted the possible closure of a reactor if the drought persists. The lack of rain is also worrying for hotel owners in the Danube delta, who have lost some 10,000 tourists this year, with 250 boats and craft stranded, waiting for the rains before they can sail again. Losses are now counted in millions of euros. Second world war battleships have even resurfaced on the Sava river, a tributary that joins the Danube in Belgrade, Serbia. The drought is also threatening the fragile ecosystem. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the race to expand agricultural land in the 20th century has already eliminated 80% of the Danube's wetlands. \"The wetlands along the riverbanks were able to absorb water in the event of flooding and free it in periods of drought,\" explained Andreas Beckmann, director of WWF's Danube-Carpathian programme. \"We are going to see more and more of these extreme situations. Our best response is to protect and strengthen our green infrastructure.\" This article originally appeared in Le Monde"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2012/oct/14/boredom-is-bad-for-health","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-14T19:15:00Z","webTitle":"Is boredom bad for your health?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/14/boredom-is-bad-for-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/14/boredom-is-bad-for-health","fields":{"headline":"Is boredom bad for your health?","bodyText":"What were you doing before you started reading this? Were you fully focused on another article? Or doing the crossword? Eating breakfast? Organising your day? Or were you staring out of the window, feeling restless and bored? It is more likely to have been the latter. Fleeting moments of boredom are universal, and are often what drives us to stop what we are doing and shift to something that we hope will be more stimulating. But although boredom is common, it is neither trivial nor benign, according to Dr John Eastwood, a psychologist at York University, Toronto. Eastwood is the joint author of The Unengaged Mind, a major new paper on the theory of boredom. Boredom, he points out, has been associated with increased drug and alcohol abuse, overeating, depression and anxiety, and an increased risk of making mistakes. Mistakes at work might not be a matter of life and death for most of us, but if you are an air traffic controller, pilot or nuclear power plant operator, they most certainly can be. Commercial pilot Sami Franks (not his real name) confirms that boredom can make pilots lose attention. \"When you fly long haul, there are two pilots, one of whom is monitoring all the screens while the other does the paperwork, talks to air traffic control and so on. You need to be alert for landing and takeoff, but once you're 500ft above the runway, the plane's on autopilot and it can be very quiet and boring. \"In a study I saw of co-pilots who woke up after a nap, 30% reported seeing the other pilot asleep too,\" adds Franks, in a comment that will not play well with nervous flyers. The stakes are not usually so high, but boredom can be protracted, heavy and associated with an unpleasant sensation, according to Eastwood. And despite having attracted the attention of philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists and educationalists, there is no precise definition of boredom and no consensus as to how we counter it. The report says boredom is most often conceptualised as \"the aversive experience of wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity.\" \"All instances of boredom involve a failure of attention,\" says Eastwood. \"And attention is what you are using now to blot out the plethora of stimuli around you while you focus awareness on a given topic.\" There are three functions involved in attention. We have to be suitably aroused, so as not to fall asleep on the job. Then we have an orienting system that can cut in so that if you cross the road, deep in thought, you will still respond to a flickering light on the edge of your visual field that heralds a fast-approaching car. And the third type of attention is an executive system that oversees our mental activities, so we can consciously stay engaged even if the task is not very interesting. Boredom results when any of these functions breaks down. Dr Esther Priyadharshini, a senior lecturer in education at the University of East Anglia, has studied boredom and says it can be seen in a positive light. \"We can't avoid boredom – it's an inevitable human emotion. We have to accept it as legitimate and find ways it can be harnessed. We all need downtime, away from the constant bombardment of stimulation. There's no need to be in a frenzy of activity at all times,\" she says. Children who complain that they have nothing to do on rainy half-term breaks may find other things to focus on if left to their own devices. The artist Grayson Perry has reportedly spoken of how long periods of boredom in childhood may have enhanced his creativity. \"We all need vacant time to mull things over,\" says Priyadharshini. But if boredom can enhance our creativity and be a signal for change, why is it such a corrosive problem for some individuals? People who have suffered extreme trauma are more likely to report boredom than those who have had a less eventful time. The theory is that they shut down emotionally and find it harder to work out what they need. They may be left with free-floating desire, without knowing what to pin it on. This lack of emotional awareness is known as alexithymia and can affect anyone. Frustrated dreamers who haven't realised their goals can expend all their emotional energy on hating themselves or the world, and find they have no attention left for anything else. Bungee jumpers and thrill-seekers may also be particularly susceptible to boredom, as they feel the world isn't moving fast enough for them. They constantly need to top up their high levels of arousal and are always searching for stimulation from their environment. \"Boredom isn't a nice feeling, so we have an urge to eradicate it and cope with it in a counterproductive way,\" says Eastwood. This may be what drives people to destructive behaviours such as gambling, overeating, alcohol and drug abuse, he says, though research is needed to tease out whether there's a direct causal link. \"The problem is we've become passive recipients of stimulation,\" says Eastwood. \"We say, 'I'm bored, so I'll put on the TV or go to a loud movie.' But boredom is like quicksand: the more we thrash around, the quicker we'll sink.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/05/uk-government-intelligence-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-05T12:47:22Z","webTitle":"UK government shared intelligence with nuclear industry, documents show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/05/uk-government-intelligence-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/05/uk-government-intelligence-nuclear-industry","fields":{"headline":"UK government shared intelligence with nuclear industry, documents show","bodyText":"The British government has been quietly exchanging intelligence on key policies with multinational companies in an effort to protect and promote their plans for new nuclear power stations, according to internal documents seen by the Guardian. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) has also passed the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), which represents 260 companies, and the French nuclear company, EDF Energy, details of its court battle against Greenpeace, which is trying to block the nuclear plans. The leakage of information has been condemned by Greenpeace as an \"abuse of power\" that prevents democratic scrutiny. The environmental group's lawyers have written to the government and the high court in London complaining that the proper legal procedures have been breached. With the government planning to build eight new nuclear power stations in England and Wales, there is a perception that ministers have been working closely with the industry to manage public opinion and prevent the kind of backlash against the technology that has happened in Germany and Italy. Internal emails revealed by the Guardian in June showed that British government officials approached nuclear companies to draw up a co-ordinated public relations strategy to play down the Fukushima nuclear accident just two days after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March. In the latest revelations, a minute of a meeting on 15 September between officials from Decc's Office for Nuclear Development (OND) and EDF reveals that they shared information about the handling of the company's application to build the first of the new nuclear stations at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, and much else. Most of the minute was meant to be kept secret, but the redacted text was so poorly blacked out when it was released under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act that it can easily be read. It says EDF was briefed about the government's regulatory justification of the nuclear programme, the new fast-track planning regime, electricity market reform, nuclear decommissioning, nuclear policy statements and developments in the European Union. Decc has released documents under FOI about its co-operation with the nuclear industry on Greenpeace's bid for a judicial review of the nuclear power programme. These show that on 7 September, the OND provided the NIA with a list of 31 documents lodged in court by Greenpeace. The minute of the 15 September meeting also says the OND was to send EDF a copy of the government's \"defence grounds\" when they had been submitted to the court. The sharing of information with EDF has particularly irked Greenpeace, since the company was fined €1.5m (£1.3m) last month for spying on the environmental group in France. As a general rule, only the main statement of a case such as this is publicly available, but not a list of accompanying documents, or the documents themselves. People may apply to the court to see the documents, but these will be released only with the court's permission. In practice, this is bureaucratic and involves a delay. \"This shocking new evidence shows the government has been secretly passing on privileged Greenpeace court documents to nuclear giant EDF even as the company faced prosecution in France for spying on Greenpeace,\" said the NGO's executive director, John Sauven. \"Our lawyers have written to the government and the high court to complain of this abuse of process by the government. If the government wants EDF and the nuclear industry to be part of the judicial review case then they should follow the proper procedures.\" The released documents also show that the OND and the NIA swapped proposed press statements reacting to the Greenpeace legal action in August. \"This extraordinary level of collusion between such huge vested interests is a real abuse of power and chokes off debate and democratic scrutiny,\" said Sauven. \"People will have no confidence that the right decisions are being made over safety and value for money when the government has become effectively an extension of the nuclear industry.\" The badly blacked-out text from the 15 September minute shows that government information was shared with EDF on most current policies affecting nuclear power. EDF was also said to have updated the OND on the \"preliminary works\" at Hinkley Point and the preparation of the company's application to build a nuclear station there. According to the minute, EDF was to send the OND \"a short summary of the administrative costs\" of preparing the application, while the OND promised to \"consider the timetable\" for assessing the application and report back. EDF were also going to \"consider a possible ministerial visit\" to Hinkley. Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich in London, argued that such close co-operation was inappropriate. \"These extracts show that, in its desperation to save its failing nuclear power policy, the UK government has totally compromised its position as a neutral arbiter in planning applications,\" he said. Decc argued that it would be unable to encourage the development of different forms of energy to ensure security of supply without \"good working relationships\" with energy companies. \"As well as liaising closely with both large and smaller players in the energy market, we engage regularly with academic organisations and environmental groups,\" said a Decc spokesman. \"In all instances, steps are taken to avoid any conflicts of interest or anything that would compromise the fairness of decision-making.\" The NIA denied that there had been any abuse of power or breach of legal procedures. \"There was no attempt by either Decc or NIA to influence the other's media line, and the list of documents relied upon by Greenpeace could have been obtained directly from the court,\" said the NIA's public policy adviser, Peter Haslam. \"The reason we were interested in seeing the index was that we wanted to consider whether we should be an interested party in the action.\" A spokeswoman for EDF said: \"The topics we have discussed with government are entirely appropriate for an investment of national significance, which could provide up to 12% of the UK's electricity needs. We have been open about this ongoing dialogue, which fits what government expects of us as a developer.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/12/japan-nuclear-alert-level-seven","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-12T00:54:36Z","webTitle":"Japan raises nuclear alert level to seven","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-nuclear-alert-level-seven","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-nuclear-alert-level-seven","fields":{"headline":"Japan raises nuclear alert level to seven","bodyText":"Japan is to raise the nuclear alert level at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant to a maximum seven, putting the emergency on a par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Nuclear safety officials had insisted they had no plans to raise the severity of the crisis from five – the same level as the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 – according to the international nuclear and radiological event scale. But the government came under pressure to raise the level at the plant after Japan's nuclear safety commission estimated the amount of radioactive material released from its stricken reactors reached 10,000 terabecquerels per hour for several hours following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country's northeast coast on 11 March. That level of radiation constitutes a major accident, according to the INES scale. The scale, devised by the international atomic energy agency, ranks nuclear and radiological accidents and incidents by their severity from one to seven. Japan also temporarily issued tsunami warnings for parts of the north-east coast on Monday following another powerful aftershock. It is exactly a month since a magnitude-9 earthquake created huge waves that left an estimated 28,000 people dead or missing. NHK, the public broadcaster, warned of a tsunami up to 2 metres high on the coast of Ibaraki prefecture after the magnitude-7.1 quake. Although the waves were estimated to be much smaller than those that hit on 11 March, the meteorological agency warned people in Ibaraki to evacuate to higher ground. The warnings were later lifted. The aftershock came as the government said it was widening the evacuation zone around the plant due to high levels of accumulated radiation and fears about long-term effects on residents' health. A fire that broke out at the plant's number four reactor at 6.38am local time was extinguished, the operator, Tokyo Electric Power company (Tepco), said. More than 14,000 people are still missing following the disaster, and 152,000 survivors are living in evacuation centres. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, placed a message in newspapers in several countries, including Britain, China and the United States, thanking the international community for its support. Kan said the generosity shown towards Japan in its time of need demonstrated the human capacity for kizuna, or bonds of friendship, and vowed that Japan would emerge a stronger nation. \"We deeply appreciate the kizuna our friends from around the world have shown and I want to thank every nation, entity, and you personally, from the bottom of my heart,\" he said. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said the current 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone would be extended to five other communities, including the village of Iitate, which lies 25 miles from the plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/05/uk-nuclear-plan-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-05T16:39:59Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear plans on hold after Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/05/uk-nuclear-plan-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/05/uk-nuclear-plan-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear plans on hold after Fukushima","bodyText":"The government's plans to build a new programme of nuclear power stations in England will be delayed by at least three months so that lessons can be learned from the accident at Fukushima in Japan. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency (EA), which are jointly assessing the safety of proposed reactor designs, have said this year's deadline for completing the assessments will now not be met. The two regulatory agencies said that they would not come to any conclusions in June as had been promised. Instead they will wait for a final report on the implications of Fukushima, by the chief nuclear inspector, Mike Weightman, due in September. Weightman has been asked by the energy and climate change secretary, Chris Huhne, to examine the lessons that could be learned from the Japanese accident, triggered by an earthquake and a tsunami last month. Until now it had not been clear how this would impact on the \"generic design assessment\" of reactors which the HSE and EA have been working on since 2006. In a joint statement, the two agencies said: \"Safety and protection of people and the environment will always be our top priority. It is important that we take the necessary time needed to ensure that we learn any relevant lessons emerging from the events in Japan, and implement any improvements that might be required to the new reactor designs.\" New reactors cannot be built until the regulators are satisfied they are safe. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said the Weightman's recommendations should be taken into account. \"It's too early to say exactly what impact this will have on the overall timeline. We're continuing with our facilitative actions to encourage investment to come forward as soon as possible,\" he said. But this was in marked contrast to a statement by the climate change minister, Greg Barker. He was quoted by Bloomberg as saying that Fukushima would cause no \"material delay\" to Britain's nuclear power programme. The French company that wants to build its EPR design of power station, EDF Energy, has been previously quoted as saying that any delays due to Fukushima would be \"minimal\". The US firm, Westinghouse, is bidding to build differently designed AP1000 reactors. Last October the UK government gave the initial go-ahead for new nuclear stations at eight sites around the coast of England and Wales. Last week, the Guardian revealed that ministers were being taken to court over allegations that cancer risks had not been properly evaluated. The Nuclear Industry Association, which represents UK nuclear companies, said that the regulators' announcement was \"correct\".

Normally, natural disasters are followed by v-shaped recessions. Output is badly affected in the short term, as infrastructure is knocked out and people can't work or shop. Output falls sharply for three to six months, but then rebounds as the reconstruction starts. Government money is poured into the affected areas, leading to a mini-construction boom as homes, roads and power supplies are rebuilt. Pent-up spending from the period immediately after the crisis is unleashed. Despite Japan's weak public finances, analysts would expect Tokyo to come up with the money to rebuild the north-eastern parts of the country affected by last week's earthquake and tsunami. What makes this crisis different is the nuclear dimension. The three explosions at the Fukushima Daiichi plant puts this incident into a different category from either Kyoto or Katrina. There has been disruption to power supplies and people have been evacuated from a 12-mile exclusion zone around the plant, but it could potentially become far more widespread unless the Japanese can shut the plant down safely and quickly. Some analysts were last night starting to imagine what might happen in the event Tokyo, with 13 million people in its metropolitan district, had to be evacuated because of a radiation cloud heading its way. The economic costs of such an event would be astronomic. In Europe Japan's crisis is already having an impact. Angela Merkel has ordered a temporary shutdown of Germany's pre-1980s nuclear stations, which according to estimates account for 7% of the country's power. That is a significant energy loss for a country that is growing robustly. The second factor is the impact the Sendai earthquake will have on consumer and business confidence. At present the global economy is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty, over the situation in north Africa and the Middle East and now over Japan. Economists think they have a way of quantifying this uncertainty, but they don't. So while, in theory, it should be possible to do a full-scale risk assessment of the impact of Japan on, say, the UK, that is not really possible. In theory, the effects should be limited, because Japan is not a major trading partner for the UK and the days of intensive Japanese inward investment are over. The complexity of global supply chains for the goods in which Japan is world leader could mean delays and disruptions in some sectors, – such as consumer electronics and cars – depending on how badly the major Japanese multinationals are affected by shortages of power and materials. One big unknown for the UK is the oil price, which has been adding to inflationary pressure in recent months but has fallen since late last week because traders believe the paralysis in Japan will lead to a drop in global demand. That trend may not last. If it does have a v-shaped recovery Japan will quickly return to more normal levels of oil usage. Meanwhile, the unrest in Bahrain is evidence that the problems for governments in the Middle East are far from over.

Only one of 54 reactors in Japan is in service – and that is due to join the others for regular maintenance checks on 5 May. No reactors will restart until they pass stress tests - designed to gauge their ability to withstand catastrophic events such as a tsunami and introduced after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi power plant in March 2011. Failure to restart the reactors at Oi plant in Fukui prefecture will force Japan to endure a long, humid summer – when electricity demand peaks – without a single nuclear reactor. To cover the energy shortfall, Japan has drastically increased imports of oil and liquefied natural gas, while industry frets about loss of competitiveness if power shortages force firms to reduce production. The government estimates that the region served by the plant's operator, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), which includes the industrial city of Osaka, could experience a power shortage of up to 20% if the Oi reactors are not switched back on. Supporters of atomic energy worry that if Japan and its economy emerge relatively unscathed from a non-nuclear summer, the momentum to restart reactors will be lost forever. Last week, the economy and industry minister, Yukio Edano, visited the Oi plant after he declared that its Nos 3 and 4 reactors \"generally\" meet stringent new safety standards. Kepco is confident the facility could avoid a severe accident if it were to be hit by a tsunami of the force that sent the Fukushima plant into meltdown. But Edano may have trouble persuading the regional government to sign off on a nuclear restart: public consent is not legally required, but given widespread anger in Japan in the wake of the Fukushima accident, few expect any reactors to go back online without it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/09/fukushima-owner-saved-japanese-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-09T14:58:26Z","webTitle":"Fukushima owner saved from collapse by Japanese government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/09/fukushima-owner-saved-japanese-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/09/fukushima-owner-saved-japanese-government","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima owner saved from collapse by Japanese government","bodyText":"Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company at the centre of Japan's worst-ever nuclear accident, has been saved from collapse after the government in effect nationalised the firm by agreeing to inject 1 trillion yen ($12.5bn) in fresh capital. Japan's biggest utility has received at least 3.5tn yen in state support since three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant went into meltdown after being hit by a powerful tsunami on 11 March last year. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, said the capital injection was needed to ensure the utility company could continue to supply electricity to 45 million people, including residents of Tokyo. \"Without the state funds, [Tepco] cannot provide a stable supply of electricity and pay for compensation and decommissioning costs,\" Edano said after approving what amounts to a state takeover of the firm. The total cost of the disaster, which last weekend led to the closure of the country's last working nuclear reactor, is estimated at $100bn. Tepco faces compensation claims totalling 5tn yen from the tens of thousands of people who have been driven from their homes by radiation leaks. The task of decontaminating the area affected by radiation and decommissioning the plant is expected to take decades. Under the 10-year restructuring plan, the government will acquire more than half of Tepco's shares, with the option of increasing its stake to more than two-thirds if the company fails to reach its restructuring targets. In return for the taxpayer bailout, Tepco plans to reduce costs by 3.7tn yen over the next 10 years and cut a 10th of its workforce. It will also need government approval to increase household electricity bills and restart nuclear reactors that pass stress tests introduced in the wake of the disaster. The plan has already prompted personnel changes amid criticism of Tepco's handling of the disaster and evidence that it played down the risk posed by earthquakes and tsunamis. The current chairman, Tsunehisa Katsumata, will be replaced by Kazuhiko Shimokobe, a lawyer selected by the bailout fund. Naomi Hirose, a Tepco managing director who is overseeing the firm's response to the accident, has been promoted to president. \"Under the new management, I urge the firm to build a new corporate culture, listen to the victims, to customers and to society, and start actively releasing information,\" Edano said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/feb/08/fukushima-rising-temperatures-stability-nuclear-reactor","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-08T04:52:00Z","webTitle":"Rising temperatures at Fukushima raise questions over stability of nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/08/fukushima-rising-temperatures-stability-nuclear-reactor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/feb/08/fukushima-rising-temperatures-stability-nuclear-reactor","fields":{"headline":"Rising temperatures at Fukushima raise questions over stability of nuclear plant","bodyText":"Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant say they are regaining control of a reactor after its temperature rose dramatically this week, casting doubt on government claims that the facility has been stabilised. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] was forced to increase the amount of cooling water being injected into the No 2 reactor after its temperature soared to 73.3C earlier this week. By Tuesday night, the temperature had dropped to 68.5C at the bottom of the reactor's containment vessel, where molten fuel is believed to have accumulated after three of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors suffered meltdown after last year's tsunami disaster. The temperature at the bottom of the No 2 reactor vessel had risen by more than 20C in the space of several days, although it remained below the 93C limit the US nuclear regulatory commission sets for a safe state known as cold shutdown. Tepco said it had also injected water containing boric acid to prevent a nuclear chain reaction known as re-criticality. The operator said the sudden rise in temperature did not call in to question the government's declaration in December that all three damaged reactors had achieved cold shutdown. \"The temperature of the reactor pressure vessel seems to be close to peaking out,\" Junichi Matsumoto, a Tepco spokesman, told reporters. Late last year, however, the minister in charge of the response to the Fukushima disaster, Goshi Hosono, conceded that officials had no idea about the exact location of molten uranium fuel but assumed that it had come to rest at the bottom of its containment vessels. Hosono said the temperature rise may have been triggered by work to replace a cooling pipe after freezing weather in north-eastern Japan caused a number of water leaks at the site. The use of bigger volumes of water to cool the No 2 reactor presents Tepco with the additional problem of a build-up of radioactive water. The utility said recently it had processed more than 220,000 cubic metres of contaminated water using treatment facilities, but added that as much as 95,000 cubic metres – enough to fill 38 Olympic-sized swimming pools – may have accumulated in the reactors' basements. Tepco workers started injecting water into overheating reactors after the 11 March tsunami crippled the backup power supply to cooling systems. The Fukushima Daiichi accident has led to the closure of all but three of Japan's 54 reactors, to undergo regular maintenance and new stress tests designed to gauge their ability to withstand powerful earthquakes and tsunamis. The Yomiuri Shimbun said this week that the government planned to restart two reactors in Ohi, western Japan, before the last reactor is due to go offline at the end of April. If the restarts do not take place by then, Japan will be without a single working nuclear reactor. But the trade minister, Yukio Edano, said that no deadline had been set to restart any reactors, a move some experts say should wait until the official investigation into the Fukushima accident has been completed. Edano acknowledged that an early restart would be difficult, given lingering public concern over the safety of nuclear power. \"The only standard is whether we can gain a certain level of understanding from the local people and the public,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/14/germans-worry-sushi-safe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T20:45:48Z","webTitle":"Post-Chernobyl novel returns to the bestseller lists in Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/14/germans-worry-sushi-safe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/14/germans-worry-sushi-safe","fields":{"headline":"Post-Chernobyl novel returns to the bestseller lists in Germany","bodyText":"Unsurprisingly, the effects of the Japanese earthquake continue to dominate Germany's news agenda, with each newspaper dealing with the story in their own particular way.

German sushi restaurants do not usually use Japanese fish); and \"Should I buy a Geiger counter?\" (no). The Süddeutschezeitung, meanwhile, noted that a novel for young people with a nuclear theme is back in vogue. Die Wolke, The Cloud, by Gudrun Pausewang was published in 1987, the year after the Chernobyl disaster. At the weekend it was the number two book on Amazon.de. In any other week, Germany would surely be paying far greater attention to the deal stuck by eurozone leaders on Saturday. Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed to increase the size of the bailout fund and even consented to easing the terms for Greece – a potentially risky move given German dissatisfaction over the original bailout, and given that Merkel's CDU party is facing a pasting in four regional elections later this month.

Our underlying aim is the same: we all want to reduce human impacts on the biosphere. We all agree that our consumption of resources must be reduced, as sharply as possible. We all question the model of endless economic growth. Almost everyone in this movement also recognises that – even with the maximum possible conservation of resources and efficiency in the way they are used – we will not be able to bring our consumption down to zero. This is especially the case with electricity. Those who have been following the issue closely know that even with massive reductions in energy demand, electricity use will have to rise in order to remove fossil fuels from both transport and heating. The idea, on which there's also wide agreement within the movement, is that the petrol and diesel used to power cars, buses and trains, and the gas and oil used to heat our houses, should be partly or mostly replaced by low-carbon electricity. That means an increase in electricity supply, even as, with sweeping efficiency measures in all sectors, our total energy consumption falls. So the only question that divides us is how this low-carbon electricity should be produced. I don't much care about which technology is used, as long as the other impacts are as small as possible, and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced quickly and efficiently. None of our options is easy and painless. Windfarms are running into massive public opposition, not least because of the new power lines required to connect them to the grid. The costs of other kinds of renewables are high, and their potential to supply much of our electricity is low. The capture and storage of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels has yet to be demonstrated at the scale required to show that it's a viable option. It is also expensive, and still involves mining coal and drilling for gas. That means continued environmental impacts, which are likely to escalate as shale gas is extracted and coal is increasingly mined through open casting. Nuclear power remains an object of deep public suspicion. The advantage it has over renewables is that production takes place on a compact site, rather than being spread over the countryside, and that new power lines are not required in places where they haven't been built before. The disadvantage it shares with coal and gas is that it depends upon the extraction of uranium, which, like mining fossil fuels, imposes a high environmental cost. In principle this could be overcome by moving to fourth-generation nuclear technologies. Not only do they not require fresh supplies of uranium, but some of the proposed technologies consume existing nuclear waste. None of them has yet been demonstrated at scale, however. The large-scale deployment of any of these three options – renewables, carbon capture and storage or nuclear – will take between 10 and 20 years. These are hard physical and political constraints. There is no point in tearing each other apart over issues we can do little about. We can agree to disagree over what the mix should be, and we can keep debating all the issues it involves, hopefully in a friendly manner. The likely scenario is that, because of the problems faced by all three technologies, we'll probably need some of each. But is this possible? According to Jonathon Porritt, it isn't. In a recent blog post discussing renewables and nuclear power, he asserts that: \"It's becoming clearer and clearer that we're now into a strict fight in terms of those two options. The days when people talked about \"co-existence\" are long gone; this is now either/or, not both/and.\" That statement would require an explanation at any time, and unfortunately Porritt doesn't provide one. But coming just after the Committee on Climate Change published its renewable energy review, it needs even more unpacking. The committee is the body that recommends the government's carbon targets, and offers advice on how they might best be met. Of all the agencies involved in these questions, it has the most influence over government policy, as we saw during the bust-up within the cabinet this month over whether or not its target should be adopted (the committee won after David Cameron intervened). What the committee recommends is what is most likely to happen. It advises that: \"The optimal policy is to pursue a portfolio approach, with each of the different technologies playing a role.\" It suggests the following, illustrative scenario for decarbonising electricity by 2030: • 40% renewables • 40% nuclear • 15% carbon capture and storage • Up to 10% gas without carbon capture and storage It raised no difficulties about co-existence between nuclear and renewables. And why should there be? Why can't nuclear provide the baseload power, and renewables and carbon capture and storage most of the rest? Why can't it be both/and, rather than either/or? Here are some of the other things the report said: \"Nuclear power currently appears to be the most cost-effective of the low-carbon technologies\". This will come as a surprise to many greens. Applying a 10% discount rate, the committee suggests that by 2030 nuclear power will cost between 5 and 10p/kWh. I rang the committee to check: yes, this does take into account the costs of decommissioning and waste disposal. Onshore wind will cost between 7 and 8.5p, and the other renewables are more expensive, in some cases much more expensive. The Severn barrage, which Porritt favours, comes out worst of all, at a staggering 21-31p. If you apply a 7.5% discount rate, nuclear does even better against renewables (because of the higher up-front capital costs). It also says: \"Although there is a finite supply of uranium available, this will not be a limiting factor for investment in nuclear capacity for the next 50 years.\" And it reminds us that France added 48GW of nuclear capacity – equivalent to more than half of our entire electricity system – in just 10 years. So my questions to Porritt are as follows: • What has the Committee on Climate Change got wrong? • Could you explain your contention that nuclear power and renewables can't co-exist? • Do you believe that renewables are a better option than nuclear power in all circumstances? Or would you agree that beyond a certain level of difficulty, of cost, of visual intrusion and other environmental impacts (damming estuaries and rivers, building power lines across rare and beautiful landscapes for example), nuclear becomes a more attractive option? • If you are to exclude nuclear entirely, what should the mix of electricity generation in this country be? I would like to hear his answers to these questions. In the spirit of both debate and reconciliation, I've secured space for him to reply on this site.

China and India both increased their use of carbon-heavy coal by over 9% but Europe, where political consensus against global warming is strongest, also saw a 4% increase, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Christof Ruhl, BP's chief economist presenting the figures in London on Wednesday said industrialisation of developing countries and cheap prices were driving coal demand which had \"profound implications\" for CO2 output. The increased use of coal and a continued heavy use of other fossil fuels such as oil and gas led to a 3% increase in world carbon emissions from energy in 2011, a lower rate than in 2010, the statistics show. Ruhl said concerns about climate change seemed to have been parked to one side as a \"sense of frustration\" had set in over the difficulties of finding a quick and easy solution to global warming. He believed a fast move away from coal to gas would help reduce CO2 emissions fast but he questioned whether the current system of subsidising renewable power would lead to the kind of technology breakthroughs needed. Global oil consumption grew by less than 1% to reach 88m barrels a day in 2011 despite the Brent crude price averaging $111 a barrel, an increase of 40% on the previous 12 month period, the BP statistics show. Annual production of oil increased by 1.1m b/d due to output reaching record levels in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar while demand was strongest in China - up 5.5%. Oil remains the world's leading fuel, at 33% of global energy consumption, but it continued to lose market share to reach its lowest level since 1965, BP says. The statistics show UK oil production falling 17% and gas output down 21% while global oil reserves are still large enough to serve current demand for 54 years, according to BP. Global proven oil reserves totalled 1,653bn barrels at the end of 2011, up 8% on the previous year, due to new discoveries and high oil prices which have made tar sands and marginal fields more economic to exploit. Addressing continual concern that the world is close to \"peak oil\" when demand cannot match supply, BP chief executive, Bob Dudley, said: \"The world is not structurally short of hydrocarbon resources - as our data on proved reserves confirms year after year but long lead times and various forms of access constraints in some regions continue to create challenges for the ability of supply to meet demand growth at reasonable prices.\" The BP figures also show nuclear power use dropping by 4% - its lowest on record - while renewable energy used in power generartion grew by 18%. Wind power increased by 26%, due to major increases in China and the US, while solar power rose by 86% but that figure was from a very low starting point."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/29/energy-starved-india-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-29T13:30:01Z","webTitle":"Now is not the time for energy-starved India to increase nuclear dependency | Jaswant Singh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/29/energy-starved-india-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/29/energy-starved-india-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Now is not the time for energy-starved India to increase nuclear dependency","bodyText":"Japan's nuclear disaster has fuelled fear and uncertainty among all of the world's producers of nuclear power. For India, an energy-starved country with big nuclear plans, much is at stake. The wider fear over nuclear power has two main causes. Firstly, although it ranks as a \"clean\" source of energy, it is accompanied by the terrible shadow of nuclear war and Japan's last reckoning with nuclear catastrophe 65 years ago at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Secondly, the secrecy that attends all things nuclear has left people not knowing enough to feel confident. The additional fear inspired by the Fukushima disaster will be reflected in soaring costs for nuclear power worldwide, largely owing to demands for improved safety and insurance. Indeed, nuclear plants are prone to a form of panic transference: should a reactor of one design go wrong, all reactors of that type will be shut down instantly around the world. In India, the dilemma is this: it has 20 nuclear plants in operation, with an additional 23 on order. With the country desperately short of power, and requiring energy to grow, concerned citizens are asking if nuclear is still the answer for India. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has cautiously announced a \"special safety review\" of all plants. \"Not enough,\" say about 50 eminent Indians, who at the end of March demanded a review of the country's entire nuclear power policy for \"appropriateness, safety, costs, and public acceptance\". The group also called for an \"independent, transparent safety audit\" of all nuclear facilities to be undertaken with the \"involvement of civil society organisations and experts outside the department of atomic energy\". Until then, they demanded a moratorium on all nuclear activity and a revocation of recent clearances. This is as explicit as opposition can get. How have other countries reacted? France, a global leader in nuclear power, initially avoided most of the global anti-nuclear concerns. But now it too is promising to upgrade its safety procedures, including a reassessment of the potential effects of natural disasters on nuclear plant operations, conceding that the occurrence of more than one natural disaster simultaneously had not been considered previously. China, which has 77 nuclear reactors at various stages of construction, planning, and discussion, has said that it will embark on a wide-ranging review, but Russia has announced that it will go ahead with its programme. The US has just two under construction on its own territory, despite being the principal exporter of reactors. Meanwhile Denmark, Greece, Ireland and Portugal are strongly anti-nuclear, and Switzerland has stopped all nuclear power projects. All of this will lead to cost evaluation and escalation. According to a study conducted by former Indian government minister Arun Shourie, the price of uranium could rise to $140 per pound, close to its record high. A change of much greater consequence concerns the price of reactors. Pre-Fukushima, a report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), The Future of Nuclear Power, 2003, as well as a study by researchers at the University of Chicago, established that nuclear energy was 50-100% more expensive than energy from coal or gas. The report by India's Working Group on Power says the cost of energy production from the country's coal-based plants is about one-third lower than nuclear power, with gas 50% cheaper. Energy security and public safety should be of equal importance in determining future policy on nuclear power. Indeed, experts like CMA Nayar have said that the Fukushima accident \"could have happened even if there was no tsunami\". Nayar suggests that it has long been known that the reactor's design contained basic flaws, though only the Japanese authorities can verify this. So, what is to be done? Clean energy at a time of global warming is obviously necessary. But so is the safety and security of humans, animals and plants. India has set itself on a path of doubling its nuclear power output. This is deeply troubling, for India's nuclear supplies almost entirely dependent on imports from manufacturers who refuse liability for any malfunction. So how should India's energy demands be met? At a minimum, a thorough re-examination and full public debate must precede the construction of any new nuclear plant. Preferably, the entire policy is reassessed, and dependence on nuclear reduced. With nuclear safety suddenly becoming a global imperative, the costs are simply too high to do otherwise. • Jaswant Singh, a former Indian finance minister, foreign minister, and defence minister, is the author of Jinnah: India – Partition – Independence.

The decision taken today by the Chinese government to suspend approval of new atomic power plants. If this suspension were to become permanent, the power those plants would have produced is likely to be replaced by burning coal. While nuclear causes calamities when it goes wrong, coal causes calamities when it goes right, and coal goes right a lot more often than nuclear goes wrong. The only safe coal-fired plant is one which has broken down past the point of repair. Before I go any further, and I'm misinterpreted for the thousandth time, let me spell out once again what my position is. I have not gone nuclear. But, as long as the following four conditions are met, I will no longer oppose atomic energy. 1. Its total emissions – from mine to dump – are taken into account, and demonstrate that it is a genuinely low-carbon option 2. We know exactly how and where the waste is to be buried 3. We know how much this will cost and who will pay 4. There is a legal guarantee that no civil nuclear materials will be diverted for military purposes To these I'll belatedly add a fifth, which should have been there all along: no plants should be built in fault zones, on tsunami-prone coasts, on eroding seashores or those likely to be inundated before the plant has been decommissioned or any other places which are geologically unsafe. This should have been so obvious that it didn't need spelling out. But we discover, yet again, that the blindingly obvious is no guarantee that a policy won't be adopted. I despise and fear the nuclear industry as much as any other green: all experience hath shown that, in most countries, the companies running it are a corner-cutting bunch of scumbags, whose business originated as a by-product of nuclear weapons manufacture. But, sound as the roots of the anti-nuclear movement are, we cannot allow historical sentiment to shield us from the bigger picture. Even when nuclear power plants go horribly wrong, they do less damage to the planet and its people than coal-burning stations operating normally. Coal, the most carbon-dense of fossil fuels, is the primary driver of human-caused climate change. If its combustion is not curtailed, it could kill millions of times more people than nuclear power plants have done so far. Yes, I really do mean millions. The Chernobyl meltdown was hideous and traumatic. The official death toll so far appears to be 43 – 28 workers in the initial few months then a further 15 civilians by 2005. Totally unacceptable, of course; but a tiny fraction of the deaths for which climate change is likely to be responsible, through its damage to the food supply, its contribution to the spread of infectious diseases and its degradation of the quality of life for many of the world's poorest people. Coal also causes plenty of other environmental damage, far worse than the side effects of nuclear power production: from mountaintop removal to acid rain and heavy metal pollution. An article in Scientific American points out that the fly ash produced by a coal-burning power plant \"carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy\". Of course it's not a straight fight between coal and nuclear. There are plenty of other ways of producing electricity, and I continue to place appropriate renewables above nuclear power in my list of priorities. We must also make all possible efforts to reduce consumption. But we'll still need to generate electricity, and not all renewable sources are appropriate everywhere. While producing solar power makes perfect sense in north Africa, in the UK, by comparison to both wind and nuclear, it's a waste of money and resources. Abandoning nuclear power as an option narrows our choices just when we need to be thinking as broadly as possible. Several writers for the Guardian have made what I believe is an unjustifiable leap. A disaster has occurred in a plant that was appallingly sited in an earthquake zone; therefore, they argue, all nuclear power programmes should be abandoned everywhere. It looks to me as if they are jumping on this disaster as support for a pre-existing position they hold for other reasons.

The German government has said it has been forced to cut subsidies for solar panels, because demand was so high it could no longer afford to support the green technology. Friday's announcement has left Germans rushing to install solar panels on buildings ahead of the planned cut in subsidies of up to 30%. The government has explained its decision as a way of slowing the rapid growth in the sector, saying it was one of Germany's success stories, but had been allowed to grow too fast and had been too heavily subsidised. \"We've already seen a huge reduction in the incentives in the past few years but the incentives were still too high,\" the environment minister, Norbert Röttgen, said. \"Solar is a success story made in Germany. We want it to be an acceptable technology not only in the future but right now but the cost factor has to be at acceptable levels.\" Environmentalists, renewable energy experts and industry representatives have expressed incredulity at the 30% cut from 9 March, following earlier cuts of up to 50% over the past three years. They said it was a huge blow for the fledgling industry and a contradiction in terms for a country planning to phase out nuclear power. \"This plan amounts to nothing less than a solar phase-out law,\" said David Wedepohl, spokesman for the German Solar Industry Association, which represents 800 solar companies. \"Under these circumstances there's no way that the transition of the energy industry can be successful. It's also putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk, and it's tough both on investors and on citizens who want to be part of the energy transformation.\" Germany is the world's top installer of photovoltaic power, with a capacity of around 25,000 megawatts, almost as much as the rest of the world put together. It added a record 7,500 megawatts in 2011. The sun provides from 3.2% to – on sunny days at midday– up to 25% of Germany's energy. Wedepohl admitted: \"You could say we are the victims of our own success. The costs of solar energy have come down immensely due to technological development and scaleability so we're scratching our heads and wondering: why stop supporting this now?\" Germany has seen a huge increase in use of solar panels over the last two years, thanks to a subsidy system that utility companies are obliged to pay to people who generate their own solar power, which is then pumped into the grid. Power companies pass on the costs to their customers in their electricity bill. At a time of rising prices the government argues that it has to lessen the financial impact on consumers by decreasing the subsidies. The solar sector boom has seen everyone from farms to kindergartens making the most of the opportunities to erect solar panels on their roofs. There has even been a trend to form co-operatives and rent space on the roof of public buildings that have installed panels, such as swimming pools or schools. There are now 1.1m such systems in Germany. The proposed cuts would see the feed in tariff subsidy falling to 19.5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for small plants, and to 13.5 cents for plants of up to 10 megawatts. German retail electricity prices are between 21 and 24 cents per kWh. The decision must still pass through the cabinet and parliament but political observers believe it is likely to be approved. On Monday thousands of demonstrators are planning to gather at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to protest under the banner \"Stop the Solar Phase Out\". At a time when solar power is on the verge of costing the same as conventional power, due in large part to the fall in the costs of solar panels and their installation, renewable energy sector representatives have expressed their suspicions that the cuts are an attempt to appease the major energy companies who are losing out greatly to renewables, particularly since the decision last year to phase out nuclear power following the Fukishima disaster in Japan. \"We're taking a part of the market away for large electricity suppliers,\" said Wedepohl. \"But as a country we made a decision after Fukishima to phase out nuclear energy, so we need a lot of power.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-interview-gaia-theory","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-15T16:00:00Z","webTitle":"James Lovelock: The UK should be going mad for fracking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-interview-gaia-theory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-interview-gaia-theory","fields":{"headline":"James Lovelock: The UK should be going mad for fracking","bodyText":"James Lovelock is packing up. In one sense, the celebrated scientist and environmental author is simply moving house. Boxes and piles of unsorted papers scatter the floor of his home and \"experimental station\" located in a wooded valley on the Cornwall-Devon border. But, in another sense, at the age of 92, he is finally leaving his life of scientific study and invention behind; a career that included the formulation of the Gaia theory, his highly influential hypothesis that the Earth is a self-regulating, single organism. His personal effects, notebooks and equipment are being logged and archived ahead of entering London's Science Museum's collection later this year. But leaning over a shoebox, rummaging for a cherished letter he received from Nasa in 1961 asking him to help it discover more about the Martian atmosphere, Lovelock doesn't appear to be sentimental about his past. In fact, he appears relieved to be free of the burden and responsibility of self-storage. \"Adapt and survive,\" he says, when asked why he has decided to move. After more than three decades living amid acres of trees he planted himself by hand, he and his wife Sandy have decided to downsize and move to an old lifeguard's cottage by the beach in Dorset. \"I'm not worried about sea-level rises,\" he laughs. \"At worst, I think it will be 2ft a century.\" Given that Lovelock predicted in 2006 that by this century's end \"billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable\", this new laissez-faire attitude to our environmental fate smells and sounds like of a screeching handbrake turn. Indeed, earlier this year he admitted to MSNBC in an interview reported around the world with somewhat mocking headlines along the lines of \"Doom-monger recants\", that he had been \"extrapolating too far\" in reaching such a conclusion and had made a \"mistake\" in claiming to know with such certainty what will happen to the climate. But Lovelock is relaxed about how this reversal might be perceived. He says being allowed to change your mind and follow the evidence is one of the liberating marvels of being an independent scientist, something he has revelled in since leaving Nasa, his last full-time employer, in the late 1960s. He says it will be the topic of his latest book, due out next year, which has the working title Adventures of a Lone Scientist. He smiles: \"My publisher keeps telling me: 'Can't you do a more cheery book this time?'\" Moving house has handed Lovelock the chance to pore over the everyday objects resulting from his life's work, most of which have been in the attic for decades. He picks up an undated invitation to MI5's Christmas dinner at a restaurant in London. In his other hand, he holds an old envelope stamped: \"On Her Majesty's Service: Top secret.\" (As a freelance scientist, he's worked for many organisations.) There are get-well cards from the likes of the astronomer Carl Sagan, sent when he had heart problems in the early 1980s. He finally finds the letter from Nasa: \"I'd read science-fiction since I was a small kid, so when I got a letter from the director of space flight at Nasa I was gobsmacked. I realised I didn't want to spend the rest of my life as a civil servant, and I didn't like the idea of having everything planned right up to my retirement. My boss [at the National Institute for Medical Research in London] said I'd be a fool to ignore it and out of all that, ultimately, came Gaia.\" Lovelock is donating much of his archive, equipment and inventions – including the electron capture detector he made in the 60s that helped him to record CFC levels in the atmosphere, which later led to the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer – to the Science Museum, in time for an exhibition next year showing the working conditions of scientists through the ages. He says he largely dismantled his home laboratory 10 years ago when he ended his life as a practising scientist: \"I have become a thinker since then. There is so much more to do. I think retirement means death.\" The move, he says, has been forced on him. Three years ago, he received a heating bill for the winter totalling £6,000. His age means he has to have the heating on full in his poorly insulted home and, with his disabled son, Tom, living in a house next door, his outgoings on fuel rocketed. Damp winters on the edge of Dartmoor were taking their toll, so in recent years he has overwintered in St Louis, his wife's hometown in Missouri. The experience altered his attitude to the politics and economics of energy. Having already upset many environmentalists – for whom he is something of a guru – with his long-time support for nuclear power and his hatred of wind power (he has a picture of a wind turbine on the wall of his study to remind him how \"ugly and useless they are\"), he is now coming out in favour of \"fracking\", the controversial technique for extracting natural gas from the ground. He argues that, while not perfect, it produces far less CO2 than burning coal: \"Gas is almost a give-away in the US at the moment. They've gone for fracking in a big way. Let's be pragmatic and sensible and get Britain to switch everything to methane. We should be going mad on it.\" Lovelock says the political fallout from the Fukushima disaster in Japan last year means that the chances of a surge in nuclear power generation are dramatically reduced. \"The fear of nuclear is too great after Fukushima and the cost of building plants is very expensive and impractical. And it takes a long time to get them running. It is very obvious in America that fracking took almost no time to get going. There's only a finite amount of it [in the UK] so before it runs out, we should really be thinking sensibly about what to do next. We rushed into renewable energy without any thought. The schemes are largely hopelessly inefficient and unpleasant. Fracking buys us some time, and we can learn to adapt.\" The reaction in Germany to Fukushima – which announced within weeks of the disaster that it was to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2022 – particularly infuriates Lovelock: \"Germany is a great country and has always been a natural leader of Europe, and so many great ideas, music, art, etc, come out of it, but they have this fatal flaw that they always fall for an ideologue, and Europe has suffered intensely from the last two episodes of that. It looks to me as if the green ideas they have picked up now could be just as damaging. They are burning lignite now to try to make up for switching off nuclear. They call themselves green, but to me this is utter madness.\" Nestled deep into an armchair, Lovelock brushes a biscuit crumb from his lips, and lowers his cup of tea on to the table: \"I'm neither strongly left nor right, but I detest the Liberal Democrats.\" He delivers his mischievous bombshells with such rapidity and meekness that there is a danger one can miss the all-important clarification and context. \"They are all well-meaning, but they have mostly had little experience of power,\" he adds. \"The coalition has behaved disgracefully on environmental and energy policies. It would have been much better if they had been properly rightwing. I don't mean something like Thatcher; that was a revolutionary Conservative government. Just a regular one. Our political system works because they tend to self-correct each other.\" Even with politics, it seems, Lovelock's celebrated idea of a self-regulating organism applies. \"We get to our stable position through checks and balances. The whole of nature does that through natural selection. Proportional representation is a very bad idea and an absolute gift to ideologues.\" Lovelock does not miss a chance to criticise the green movement that has long paid heed to his views. \"It's just the way the humans are that if there's a cause of some sort, a religion starts forming around it. It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion. I don't think people have noticed that, but it's got all the sort of terms that religions use. The greens use guilt. You can't win people round by saying they are guilty for putting CO2 in the air.\" He displays equal disdain for those who do not accept science on climate change: \"They've got their own religion. They believe that the world was right before these damn people [the greens] came along and want to go back to where we were 20 years ago. That's also silly in its own way.\" At times, Lovelock can cut something of an unsympathetic, cold figure. He talks about how, as animals, we're all \"naturally racist\", but how \"we try to curb it and be sensible\". So much of his talk seems to be underscored by the often brutal reality of natural selection and the self-correcting omnipotence of Gaia, with the result that there is little apparent concern for those – in the developing world, perhaps – who might not be able to adapt successfully to future environmental changes. But he also applies his strictly scientific outlook to his theorising about solutions, too. Lovelock is influenced at present by US biologist EO Wilson and his study of social insects. \"He's come up with an extraordinary theory that the nest is the unit of selection, not the individual insects. That has enormous consequences. Now consider that applied to humans. If we all move into cities, they become the equivalent of a nest. Then another thought comes immediately from that: if that's the way the flow is going, don't stop it, let's encourage it. Instead of trying to save the planet by geo-engineering or whatever, you merely have to air-condition the cities.\" This Logan's Run vision of the future – where we all live in megacities to better manage dwindling resources – might not appeal to all, he admits. \"But you don't even have to do the experiment. You only have to go to Singapore. You could not have chosen a worse climate in which to build a city. It's a swamp with temperatures in the 90s every day, and very humid. But it is one of the most successful cities in the world. It seems to me that they are treading the path that we are all going to go. It's so much cheaper to air-condition the cities and let Gaia take care of the world. It's a much better route to go than so-called 'sustainable development', which is meaningless drivel.\" Such talk will not comfort the global leaders gathering in Rio next week for yet another international conference aiming to fix our environmental woes and where calls for \"sustainable development\" are sure to still be in vogue. Lovelock says he's doubtful that internationalist efforts of this sort achieve much: \"Whenever the UN puts its finger in, it seems to become a mess. The burden of my thoughts are very much that the climate situation is more complex than we at present are capable of handling, or possibly even in the future. You can't treat it as a scientific problem alone. You have to involve the whole world, and then there's the time constant of human activity. Look at how long ago the Kyoto treaty was – 15 years ago – and damn all has been done. The human time constant is very slow. You don't get major changes in under 50-100 years, and climate doesn't wait for that.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/blog/2012/may/15/who-pay-update-britain-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-14T23:05:02Z","webTitle":"Who's going to pay to update Britain's infrastructure?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2012/may/15/who-pay-update-britain-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/blog/2012/may/15/who-pay-update-britain-infrastructure","fields":{"headline":"Who's going to pay to update Britain's infrastructure?","bodyText":"The problem facing the government over infrastructure is not whether we need it. From nuclear power stations to new runways in south-east England, there are compelling arguments for a multibillion pound spending programme that would span a decade. The issue is how to pay for it. The story of the M6 toll road will not persuade investors to back motorway projects. It is not just the heavy debt burden, but the problem of competition on a small island where a rival road is never far away. The M6 is a busy, clustered road, but too many drivers would rather put up with it than pay £5.50 for a traffic-free ride on its privately financed rival. Nonetheless, the government would do well to take toll roads or road-user-charging seriously. Not only will we need more roads in the years to come but the economic trajectory of motoring also points to the end of the current road taxation system. The consequences of this are outlined in a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , commissioned by the RAC Foundation. Revenue from motoring taxation will drop by £13bn a year by 2029 as fuel duty takings reduce thanks to growth in use of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. This will leave the exchequer with a tax take from motoring of £25bn, compared with £38bn currently. Over roughly the same period, traffic will grow by nearly 50%. A tax base needs to be replaced and the best way to do it, according to the report, is to tax road use. This can be done through M6-style toll roads or schemes involving automatic number-plate recognition, like the London congestion charge. The Treasury is not a winner in the short-term because these pay-as-you-drive earnings would be ploughed back into the infrastructure, as happens with other utilities such as water, airports and energy. But a 50% increase in traffic will create a requirement for more roads and manipulation of traffic to head off jams. Road user charging and tolls will achieve this by raising funds and giving the government, or road owner, the ability to limit traffic with, for instance, peak-time charges. With better roads the UK economy will ultimately benefit. But the Treasury will have to adjust to a dent in its tax base and whoever is prime minister at the time will be castigated. So it's a long shot. But there will be a need for bold thinking soon, regardless."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/14/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-14T15:01:38Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Birds of prey, peatland burning and hosepipe ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/14/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/14/1","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Birds of prey, peatland burning and hosepipe ban","bodyText":"Environment news • Gas power construction is 'twice government predictions' • Supermarkets pressed to donate spare food to charities • Dramatic fall in number of Scotland's poisoned birds of prey • Natural England drops peatland bog-burning inquiry • China irrigation system responsible for rising emissions, research shows • Australia passes controversial nuclear waste bill On the blogs • From landfill to Lamborghini: the future of biofuels • Bioengineer humans to tackle climate change, say philosophers • Is a hosepipe ban the most effective way to tackle a drought? • Is it worth buying British bikes?

A small band of Norwegians has set up a Greenham Common-style camp near the railway sidings at Sellafield, to protest against potential risks from the huge nuclear plant. Their arrival coincided with a more official Norwegian delegation; the country's environment minister and two district mayors were shown round the site yesterday. Everyone was very polite and the protesters held a peaceful picket plus flag-waving at one of the works entrances before retiring to their longships. Sorry, I meant tents. Their spokesman Frank-Hugo Storelv, of Neptune Network, said: \"Sellafield is positioned at an almost constant wind direction towards Norway. Even though the plant is struggling with technical difficulties, the management has decided to continue to receive nuclear waste for reprocessing. \"Neptune Network finds these things unacceptable and therefore we have established a camp by the railway at Sellafield so we can watch over this most serious activity.\" A spokesman for the plant said: \"We meet regularly with Neptune and other pressure groups and are always ready to discuss concerns that are raised by such organisations. On this occasion Neptune did not seek a meeting.\" Maybe they'll bob in all this sunshine, at the weekend. Glass ceiling cracked Universities are getting flak over whopping fees just now, but Leeds Trinity university college has more cheerful news. It's bashing away at that notorious glass ceiling.

One of the members of my wife's all-women book circle works at the college, so I expect they'll discuss this cheering news. Nationally, men still have 81 percent of professorships, mind, so there's a way to go. Councillor Fearless checks up on the scoops There are all manner of interesting votes on 5 May, but we must remember to keep an eye on Rothbury in Northumberland. Councillor Steven Bridgett is treading a high wire in the beautiful market town by putting his dislike of dog mess before wooing the votes of all and sundry. He is about to become the first councillor in Britain with the power to impose £75 fines on inconsiderate dog owners. The unique status follows a training course with the county's dog wardens and successful qualification. Bridgett says: \"Unlike the council's dog wardens, who work at set times of the day and cover a large area, I will be around all the time, including evenings and weekends. If I see anybody, at any time, failing to pick up - whether I know them or not - they will be given a fixed penalty.\" He adds that \"It will probably make sure that I don't get elected next time round, but it's the right thing to do.\" Mind you, dog mess is always one of the top two types of complaint he gets as a county councillor, so he may get back with a landslide. More of the same While on the subject, here's the equally robust approach in Dalton, Cumbria: any dog mess left in the streets will be spray-painted in bright colours by council staff. Town mayor Martin McLeavy says: \"Dog poo is a serious blight on our town. There is nothing worse than having to clean dog muck off your shoes or your carpet.\" Here, here. Maybe they could give the dogs' owners a squirt of fluorescent paint as well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/31/japan-battle-save-nuclear-reactors-failed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-31T03:43:35Z","webTitle":"Japan says battle to save nuclear reactors has failed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/31/japan-battle-save-nuclear-reactors-failed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/31/japan-battle-save-nuclear-reactors-failed","fields":{"headline":"Japan says battle to save nuclear reactors has failed","bodyText":"Japanese officials have conceded that the battle to salvage four crippled reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has been lost. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said the reactors would be scrapped, and warned the operation to contain the nuclear crisis, well into its third week, could last months. Tepco's announcement came as readings showed a dramatic increase in radioactive contamination in the sea near the atomic complex. The firm's chairman, Tsunehisa Katsumata, said it had \"no choice\" but to scrap the Nos 1-4 reactors, but held out hope that the remaining two could continue to operate. It is the first time the company has admitted that at least part of the plant will have to be decommissioned. But the government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, repeated an earlier call for all six reactors at the 40-year-old plant to be decommissioned. \"It is very clear looking at the social circumstances,\" he said. Tens of thousands of people living near the plants have been evacuated or ordered to stay indoors, while radioactive materials have leaked in to the sea, soil and air. On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suggested widening the 30-km exclusion zone around the plant after finding that radiation levels at a village 40km from the plant exceeded the criteria for evacuation. \"We have advised [Japanese officials] to carefully assess the situation, and they have indicated that it is already under assessment,\" Denis Flory, a deputy director of the IAEA, said. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was due to arrive in Tokyo on Thursday to show support for the Fukushima operation and for talks with his Japanese counterpart, Naoto Kan. Sarkozy, the current G8 chair, is the first foreign leader to visit Japan since the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. An emotional Katsumata apologised for the anxiety the crisis has caused. \"We apologise for causing the public anxiety, worry and trouble due to the explosions at reactor buildings and the release of radioactive materials,\" he told reports in Tokyo late on Wednesday. \"Our greatest responsibility is to do everything to bring the current situation to an end and under control.\" He said the \"dire situation\" at the plant was likely to continue for some time. The pressure to make progress also took its toll on Tepco's chief executive, Masataka Shimizu, who is in hospital being treated for exhaustion. The country's nuclear and industrial safety agency, Nisa, said on Thursday radioactive iodine at 4,385 times the legal limit had been identified in the sea near the plant, although officials have yet to determine how it got there. On Wednesday the measurement had been 3,355 times the legal limit. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a Nisa spokesman, said fishing had stopped in the area, adding that the contamination posed no immediate threat to humans. \"We will find out how it happened and do our utmost to prevent it from rising,\" he said. The government's acceptance of help from the US and France has strengthened the belief that the battle to save the stricken reactors is lost. On Tuesday, a US engineer who helped install reactors at the plant said he believed the radioactive core in unit No 2 may have melted through the bottom of its containment vessel and on to a concrete floor. While Nisa officials attempted to play down the contamination's impact on marine life, any development that heightens health concerns among consumers will dismay local fishermen, many of whom already face a long struggle to rebuild their businesses after the tsunami. Experts say the radiation will be diluted by the sea, lessening the contamination of fish and other marine life. Robert Peter Gale, a US medical researcher who was brought in by Soviet authorities after the Chernobyl disaster, said recent higher readings of radioactive iodine-131 and caesium-137 should be of greater concern than reports earlier this week of tiny quantities of plutonium found in soil samples. But he added: \"It's obviously alarming when you talk about radiation, but if you have radiation in non-gas form I would say dump it in the ocean.\" Gale, who has been advising the Japanese government, said: \"To some extent that's why some nuclear power plants are built along the coast, to be in an area where the wind is blowing out to sea, and because the safest way to deposit radiation is in the ocean. \"The dilutional factor could not be better - there's no better place. If you deposit it on earth or in places where people live there is no dilutional effect. From a safety point of view the ocean is the safest place.\" Criticism of Tepco is building after safety lapses last week put three workers in hospital - all have been discharged - and erroneous reports of radiation data. Shimizu, 66, has not been seen since appearing at a press conference on 13 March, two days after the disaster. He had reportedly resumed control of the operation at the firm's headquarters in Tokyo after suffering a minor illness, but on Tuesday he was admitted to hospital suffering from high blood pressure and dizziness. Tepco said on Wednesday he was not expected to be absent for long. The hundreds of workers at the plant must now find a balance between pumping enough water to cool the reactors and avoiding a runoff of highly radioactive excess water. As yet they do not have anywhere to store the contaminated water. The options under consideration were to transfer the water to a ship or cover the reactors to trap radioactive particles, Edano said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/26/conservatives-opposed-coalition-policy-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-26T20:00:09Z","webTitle":"Anti-wind power MPs may have Cameron's backing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/26/conservatives-opposed-coalition-policy-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/26/conservatives-opposed-coalition-policy-wind","fields":{"headline":"Anti-wind power MPs may have Cameron's backing","bodyText":"The letter, signed by more than 100 Tory MPs opposing their own government's policy on wind power, was embarrassing for No 10. And yet the presence of two of the leadership's most loyal MPs – Nadhim Zahawi and Matthew Hancock – also invited speculation that the move may have been sanctioned at the very top of the party. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Tory MP who collected the signatures of more than half his party's backbenchers, as well as those of two Lib Dem, one Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and two Labour MPs, denies any involvement or blessing from the prime minister or chancellor. But according to one Lib Dem government insider, in the \"realpolitik\" of coalition politics, the leadership does not need to ask MPs to voice opposition in order for backbenchers to know that their trouble-making is welcome. Whatever happened in this case, there are good reasons why David Cameron and George Osborne may have been happy to see the letter make headlines. It is prudent to have a confident rightwing asserting itself, to counter suggestions that the Lib Dems have undue influence on government policies, despite being the minor coalition partner. More pertinently, with regular headlines – fair and unfair – about the cost of the government's energy and climate policies being added to electricity and gas bills, there must be concern among senior ministers about subsidies for wind and other renewables. Add to that the frustration that a large proportion of wind turbine investment and jobs seems to be going overseas when the British economy is struggling, and it is helpful to have ground prepared for a possible policy shift. The attractions of the \"anti-wind\" letter are emphasised by the apparent difficulty in organising a counter-demonstration of support. Heaton-Harris took just three days to collect his signatures; weeks later, nobody has got an equal number of MPs to sign support for onshore wind – although a group of pro-renewable interests is mustering backing from more predictable interests, including renewable companies and environmental campaigners. Heaton-Harris now believes he has enough support across the political spectrum, including at least 10 Labour MPs, to form an all-party group – a permanent reminder to ministers of the opposition on all sides, not least his own. In a letter of reply last week Cameron staunchly defended the government's support for wind power as one of many sources of energy, citing \"hard-headed\" reasons such as reduced reliance on imported gas and job creation. But he played down the importance of targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and to increase renewables to 15% of all energy used by 2020. Significantly, Cameron listed the other elements of a \"balanced\" electricity mix as \"gas, nuclear, cleaner coal and other forms of renewable energy\". It reflects the vision emerging from industry planning documents: one in which the biggest boom in new energy for the rest of this decade is wind power, followed by more than 12GW of new gas power and perhaps two new nuclear power stations – and beyond that maybe more reactors. These scenarios lend credence to the notion that influential voices in the government are arguing that, to insure the UK against a future in which renewable energy cannot be deployed fast enough to meet the country's ambitious targets, more gas-fired power would be a relatively cheap and reliable way to ensure enough generating capacity to meet demand. Ministers have also suggested raising the cap on emissions from new power plants, potentially reducing the amount of expensive carbon capture and storage equipment required for coal power. Meanwhile, electricity market reforms propose a guaranteed minimum price for future electricity to ensure that energy generators will risk building reactors, while technically meeting the coalition pledge of no nuclear \"subsidies\" because the payments would be available for all kinds of generation. Longer term, both these moves help the government go beyond 2020 targets and meet promises to cut greenhouse emissions by up to 80% by the middle of the century. But opening so many new fossil fuel power stations and any nuclear reactors would be controversial with others including the environmental lobby and Lib Dems opposed to nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2012/jun/26/olympic-torch-relay-scunthorpe","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-26T05:59:01Z","webTitle":"Olympic torch route, day 39: showing off the shiny bit of Scunthorpe | Benjamin Perkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/26/olympic-torch-relay-scunthorpe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/jun/26/olympic-torch-relay-scunthorpe","fields":{"headline":"Olympic torch route, day 39: showing off the shiny parts of Scunthorpe","bodyText":"Scunthorpe, in my experience, is a punchline. I have lost count of the number of times where a mention of my home town has been met either with a snigger or, more likely, a faceful of pity from friends and colleagues whose sole knowledge of the town consists of Tinie Tempah's aversion to the M180, the rude word in its name, and that tired preconception that belongs to northern industrial centres that once depended on companies with \"British\" in the title. It doesn't help that, for as long as I can remember, the town has become embroiled in a precarious rhapsody. The steelworks still puncture the skyline, and, mercifully, still makes things. The aquatic centre and the velodrome in the Olympic Park? Held up by Scunthorpe steel. But the threat of outsourcing, cheap exports, and the fall of industry in general perpetually loom like the sulphur in the air; it feels as though the place is lumbering on from one deal to the next. Alternative sources of industry come from food processing and endless retail outlets, but a full replacement they are not. Like any struggling town, there have been attempts at turning the area around economically, and culturally. The results are there for the torch relay cameras to see; our very own regeneration bid for 2012. E20 in microcosm. The torch's first taste of Scunthorpe is Glanford Park. Formerly the sole preserve of our surprisingly not bad football club, it has been joined by a plethora of satellite retail sheds as of late. I've joked before that this constitutes a new town centre; Marks &amp; Spencer have recently left the high street, which is beginning to fester in the company of payday loan and pawn shops, only to announce a large replacement on these edges. Front page headlines that boast of opportunities mask the inevitably part-time nature of such jobs. The Baths Hall is next: an entertainment venue that has stood on Doncaster Road for 75 years providing all manner of wholesome provincial entertainment. I sang in my primary school choir there. But no, not \"stunning\" enough, had to go. The venue was gutted and renovated last year, which left it resembling a nuclear power station, at a cost of £14m, attracting headline acts such as Bill Bailey, and, er, Jim Davidson. Only the original front remains, the rest a mess of glass and Trespa [a building exteriors material], as the rest of the area rots. At least the Pods, our state-of-the-art leisure centre and the climax of the town's torch proceedings, has some kind of community purpose. It's our architectural and environmental star, and has definitely proved popular. I have considered buying swimming trunks. But even the Pods feels like an unnecessary addition. Our previous leisure centre, a postwar institution, has been reduced to rubble, leaving an empty gash across the town centre with nothing to replace it. But the torch will not make it this far, skipping the centre of town altogether, avoiding the empty mass and the inevitable questions: will your schemes and shiny buildings cure this town? This country? Because those questions need asking, by all of us.

The unwelcome increases would come on top of the surging cost of petrol and other goods bringing more pain for consumers and raising government fears about mounting inflation. The forward price of wholesale gas for December has risen from 60p a therm to 72p on the back of the Far East nuclear power blackouts which have forced large-scale purchasing of extra liquefied natural gas. Japan is the largest importer of LNG but demand there has rocketed as power companies seek alternative sources for stations knocked out by the shutdown of nuclear plants. IHS Global Insight predicted that Japan could need a further 9m tonnes of LNG a year. The actual price of wholesale gas was 31p a therm in the winter of 2009 and about 51p in 2010 but has raced this month as some UK gas suppliers start buying for later in the year. A source at one of the UK's leading power companies said: \"You have to assume that this increase in the cost of wholesale gas will feed in to the price of domestic supplies – certainly if this level of 72p continues for some time. \"The past (retail) price increases have taken no account for these latest, unexpected, rises.\"Domestic homeowners are currently paying about £1,050 already for dual fuel: gas and electricity and the price of power is rising because North Sea gas supplies are running down leaving Britain to import more. Norwegian pipelines have been pumping flat out leaving the UK to import LNG from places such as Qatar and Algeria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/pwc-climate-change-reduction-business-investments","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-05T10:38:55Z","webTitle":"Business warned to prepare for catastrophic impacts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/pwc-climate-change-reduction-business-investments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/pwc-climate-change-reduction-business-investments","fields":{"headline":"Business warned to prepare for catastrophic impacts","bodyText":"PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's largest professional services firm, is not known for scaremongering. So it is worth paying particular attention to its latest annual low carbon economy index. Behind the understated language, it points to a catastrophic future unless radical action is taken now to combat climate change. \"Business leaders have been asking for clarity in political ambition on climate change,\" says partner Leo Johnson. \"Now one thing is clear: businesses, governments and communities across the world need to plan for a warming world – not just 2C, but 4C or even 6C.\" The trigger for its dire warning comes from the failure of the global community to reduce carbon emissions by anywhere near the amount needed to restrict temperature rises. PwC's latest report shows the required improvement in global carbon intensity to meet a 2C warming target has risen to 5.1% every year from now to 2050. The improvement in 2011 was just 0.7% despite the global economic slowdown, and since the turn of the century the rate of decarbonisation has averaged 0.8%. PwC, the largest of the big four accounting firms, points out that even if the 5.1% improvement might be achievable in the longer term, it is unrealistic to expect that decarbonisation could be stepped up immediately – which means that the reduction required in future years is likely to be far greater. \"We have passed a critical threshold – not once since the second world war has the world achieved that rate of decarbonisation, but the task now confronting us is to achieve it for 39 consecutive years,\" says the report. It adds: \"Even doubling our current rate of decarbonisation would still lead to emissions consistent with 6 degrees [C] of warming by the end of the century. To give ourselves a more than 50% chance of avoiding 2 degrees [C] will require a six-fold improvement in our rate of decarbonisation. \"Governments' ambitions to limit warming to 2C now appear highly unrealistic. This new reality means that we must contemplate a much more challenging future. Whilst the negotiators continue to focus on 2C, a growing number of scientists and other expert organisations are now projecting much more pessimistic scenarios for global temperatures. The International Energy Agency, for example, now considers 4C and 6C scenarios as well as 2C in their latest analysis.\" It is worth remembering what a world might look like if we fail to rapidly decarbonise the global economy. Mark Lynas, in his book Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet, wrote that at 4-5C warming, much human habitation in southern Europe, north Africa and the Middle East will be uninhabitable due to excessive heat and drought. If we reach 5-6C of warming, average global temperatures will be hotter than they have been for the last 50m years. Sea levels will rise so rapidly that coastal cities across the world will be abandoned by environmental refugees in their millions. Past 6C of warming, perhaps 90% of species will become extinct. What should business be doing to adapt to this possible reality? PwC says any investors in long-term assets or infrastructure, particularly in coastal or low-lying regions, need to consider more pessimistic scenarios. Sectors dependent on food, water, energy or ecosystem services need to scrutinise the resilience and viability of their supply chains. More carbon-intensive sectors need to anticipate more invasive regulation and the possibility of stranded assets. \"It's the boy scout motto – be prepared,\" says Jonathan Grant, PwC's director for sustainability and climate change. \"Businesses need to be prepared for unpredictability – whether that's policy, climate or consumer change. Extreme weather events have become more common, and unpredictability looks set to increase. Businesses that have failed to prepare will find it difficult to keep their operations running smoothly as the risk of disruption increases. Grant add: \"Tools like real options analysis, developed as part of the investment decision-making process in the oil industry for example, analyse the impact of significant uncertainty on a decision. \"Working with our clients, the reality is we will have to advise on a much wider range of climate scenarios. Resilience is the watch word. Businesses need to get engaged on the areas materially relevant to their business. For example if you're a consumer goods company you need to consider the longer-term security of supply of the resources you need, where you will source them from, and the more day-to-day issues of how you deal with the potential for disruption to their supply or delivery caused by extreme weather events.\" Doesn't the latest analysis just make Grant want to give up? \"Doing the analysis makes you realise the sheer scale of the issues we face,\" he says. \"It would be too easy to hold your hands up and say what's the point? We can see from the businesses, NGOs and policymakers we work with that climate change is on the agenda. But we do need more progress, faster.\" On a more fundamental basis, what needs to change? PwC's report says there will need to be radical transformations in the ways the global economy currently functions, a rapid uptake of renewable energy, sharp falls in fossil fuel use or massive deployment of carbon capture and storage, removal of industrial emissions and halting deforestation. It also warns against seeing the dash for gas as a long-term panacea. While the boom of shale gas in the United States may buy some time to help limit emissions growth, low prices may also reduce the incentive for investment in lower-carbon nuclear power and renewable energy. Malcolm Preston, PwC's global lead, sustainability and climate change, tells me: \"Even with progress year-on-year in emissions reduction, the reality is the level of corporate reduction is nowhere near what is required. The new normal for businesses is a period of high uncertainty, subdued growth and volatile commodity prices. If regulatory certainty doesn't come soon, businesses' ability to plan and act – particularly around energy, supply chain and risk – could be anything but 'normal'.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The deal over a new energy bill, struck after weeks of sometimes bitter negotiations between the coalition partners, will mean the total amount energy suppliers can add to domestic and business bills will rise from £2.35bn this year to nearly £10bn at the end of this decade. Adjusting for inflation that would be worth £7.6bn in today's prices, an increase of nearly three times. Based on government estimates that green measures make up £20 of the average domestic gas and electricity bill of £1,249 a year, the cost of increasing the cash set aside to pay for renewable investment would rise to about £80, or £60 adjusted for inflation. However, officials argue that by the end of the decade the benefits of energy-saving measures and less reliance on expensive fossil fuel power will mean bills are actually lower than they would be without the green policies. The extra charges on bills reflect the cost of policies that successive governments have imposed on energy suppliers, such as paying above-market prices for renewable energy to support these new industries and paying homes and businesses who fit wind turbines, solar panels and other small-scale green electricity generators for the energy they supply back to the grid. Government sources said the bill would end months of complaints by businesses that the row between the Lib Dem-controlled energy department and the Treasury was turning away investors, who said they needed more certainty before committing money to building renewable, gas and nuclear power plants in the UK. When the bill is published ministers will claim that it will unleash £110bn of spending on generation and renewing the National Grid by the end of the decade, and generate a further 250,000 jobs by 2030. But the increase in sums added to bills for green measures is likely to anger consumer campaigners and many Conservative MPs who say customers cannot afford to pay for expensive renewable and energy-saving policies at a time when underlying bills are being driven up by the price of coal, gas and oil. That concern will be increased by continuing uncertainty over the true cost to consumers and businesses after government officials admitted that some of the government policies which had previously been included in the cap on the amount added to bills for green measures have been left out. Among the schemes excluded from the cap are energy efficiency and measures to reduce fuel poverty. Officials said a full assessment of the cost for bill-payers would be published soon, possibly as early as next week. The plans were welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry and key energy groups. Maria McCaffery, chief executive of Renewable UK, said: \"This provides the industry with exactly the kind of assurance we've been calling for. It blows the last few months of political infighting completely out of the water. The UK government is sending a clear message that 30% of our electricity will be from renewable sources by 2020. The lion's share will come from wind energy, where we now know for certain that we will have at least 31 gigawatts installed onshore and offshore by the end of the decade.\" John Cridland, the CBI's director general, said: \"This package will send a strong signal to investors that the government is serious about providing firms with the certainty they need to invest in affordable secure low-carbon energy. The government should ensure that those households and businesses most vulnerable to increased energy prices are protected.\" Environment groups attacked a concession by Ed Davey, the Lib Dem energy and climate secretary, who pushed hard for the increase in funding for green measures. Davey appeared to have lost his battle for a target to totally decarbonise the electricity supply sector by 2030: instead the bill will say that a decision on that will be made by the next government in 2016. In another signal that risks undermining certainty over long-term policy for reducing emissions, the bill will announce a review of the fourth carbon budget for 2023-27, provisionally agreed last year. If it is changed it can only be increased to allow the UK to generate more CO2. Such moves might be a backdrop to an expected announcement of a new gas strategy in the next few weeks, probably alongside the chancellor's autumn statement on 5 December. Friends of the Earth executive director Andy Atkins said: \"The coalition has caved in to Osborne's reckless dash for gas and banged the final nail in the coffin of Cameron's pledge to lead the greenest government ever. This decision will help keep the nation hooked on increasingly expensive gas, drive away green jobs and investment and jeopardise UK climate goals.\" The headline figures will be announced in next week's energy bill, but investors in renewable energy will need to wait until next year to find out how much support they will receive. The energy bill does not provide details on the \"strike price\" - which determines the subsidy for a particular technology, such as offshore wind - until the middle of next year, while contracts will not be signed until 2014. Officials would not say how much of the total spending each sector of the low-carbon energy industry – such as offshore wind, solar power and nuclear plants – would receive or how competition among them would be managed. This spells continuing uncertainty for investors, many of whom are likely to wait until the strike price is settled next year before making final decisions. In its most recent assesment in 2001, the government estimated its environment policies add £20 a year to the average domestic gas and electricity bill, bringing it to £1249 a year, and £271,000 a year for the average medium sized business paying £1.8m. Previous analysis for the Department of Energy and Climate Change forecast household bills would actually fall by the end of the decade as the cost of policies was outweighed by the reduced need for expensive fossil fuels and the impact of energy saving measures. Critics argue the government's forecasts, which are due to be updated within weeks, make over-generous assumptions about cost savings, especially from more efficient products.Research by the Guardian also previously established that while average bills are set to fall, most of those cuts will be enjoyed by a minority of households and the majority of homes will pay more. The government's own figures also show steep rises in business bills over the next two decades. The green economy – including renewable energy, and other environmental goods and services such as recycling and water – has been one of the few bright spots of the economy, generating a third of recent growth and accounting for 8% of GDP, according to government figures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/15/green-deal-under-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-15T19:49:03Z","webTitle":"Green deal under fire from climate change sceptics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/15/green-deal-under-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/15/green-deal-under-attack","fields":{"headline":"Green deal under fire from climate change sceptics","bodyText":"The green deal, the government's big policy initiative for fighting climate change, is supposed to plug one of Britain's biggest sources of carbon emissions – draughty, fuel-poor homes. Far from being a Liberal Democrat invention, it bore the imprimatur of David Cameron himself. One FTSE100 business leader who visited No 10 dared to joke about the name, only for the prime minister to explain that the label was his own idea. So for Tories to fight publicly for the policy to be ditched – days after its launch by the Conservative climate minister, Greg Barker – is a big step. It reveals yet deeper fault-lines in the Tory party on green policy. \"The fighting about green policy has been intensifying for months,\" said Ruth Davis, chief policy adviser at Greenpeace UK. \"There is a sense that the government is strategy-less – there are a lot of senior [Tories] who are just looking for places where they can pick holes in climate policy. Cameron needs to take charge.\" Billions of pounds of investment and the potential for hundreds of thousands of green jobs hang in the balance as companies stall investment while they try to figure out what the government's policy direction might be. Potential investors in offshore wind suggested the overwhelming message was that Cameron needed to be more decisive. \"Our investment is on hold until we have certainty and clarity regarding the policy environment,\" said Magued Eldaief, managing director of General Electric. Three of the \"big six\" energy utilities, and retailers such as M&amp;S and Tesco, which were expected to be among firms offering the green deal, failed to turn up to the fanfare launch amid doubts they would take part. Studies have questioned whether the scheme can work, as the loans could be too expensive. Meanwhile, Britain is losing out in the race to develop green industries, as disappointing figures for investment show: the UK managed less than $10bn last year, seventh in the world according to an analysis by the Pew Charitable Trusts, compared with $48bn in the US. This latest row follows a series of setbacks that have spooked investors: sudden drastic cuts to feed-in tariffs for solar power; a letter from more than 100 Conservative MPs railing against wind-energy subsidies; demise of the Horizon consortium which was to build nuclear reactors; and the failure and attempted resurrection of a government competition to fund carbon capture and storage. For many, the worst signal came when the chancellor, George Osborne, strong-armed the new energy secretary, Edward Davey, into firing the starting pistol on a \"dash for gas\", which green groups fear will crowd out investment in genuinely green energy. Paul Steedman, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"The addiction to fossil fuels of the big six [energy utilities] saw bills rise by up to 18% last autumn – but despite this the government wants to fuel their habit by building yet more gas-fired power stations. Rather than papering over the cracks of our broken energy system we need ministers to make our homes more efficient and to switch to clean British energy from the wind, sun and waves we have in abundance.\" The recent setbacks reflect deep confusion over the main governing party's direction on green policy. Osborne has repeatedly taken the side against green subsidies. Tory MPs and Lords are under near-constant lobbying from Lord Lawson's climate sceptic group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation. This plays particularly well with the Tory faction who want to ape the \"culture wars\" of the US, by making climate change a left-right issue rather than one based on science. One prominent Tory MP said: \"As someone who's convinced by the science, and wants to tackle climate change, I'm finding myself an endangered species within my own party.\" The policies under attack include the green deal incentive that offers insulation to homeowners (loans repaid through electricity bills), and that which encourages small-scale renewable energy through feed-in tariffs (FiTs). Subsidies for onshore wind are to be sliced by a tenth from 2013, and offshore wind will also be hit, though less hard. The green policies under attack Green deal to offer insulation to homeowners, through loans repaid through electricity bills Several studies have questioned whether the deal scheme can work, as the loans may be too expensive. Encouragement of small-scale renewable energy through feed-in tariffs The solar power industry, with about 25,000 workers, has had a series of blows as government has slashed subsidies. Community schemes, including those intended to cut fuel bills for people in social housing, have been among the worst hit. Nuclear power Horizon consortium to build new nuclear power plants collapsed in late March, cancelling plans for reactors and leaving the field to EDF, France's state electricity utility. Dash for gas Within weeks of taking up his role as energy secretary, Davey was pulled into plans from Osborne for a massive new-wave of gas-fired power stations. Green groups attacked the move, which they said would lock the UK into high carbon emissions for decades and crowd out investment in renewables.

Some offshore wind companies say their potential investments are under review.

The decommissioning costs over the next four years revealed by officials to Huhne are so serious that he has already flagged the crisis up to the cabinet. The revelation places an unexpected burden on his department's £3bn annual budget ahead of difficult spending negotiations this summer. \"As you can imagine, this is a fairly existential problem. The costs are such that my department is not so much the department of energy and climate change, as the department of nuclear legacy and bits of other things,\" Huhne told the Guardian. The additional costs derive from slowly rising expenditure on nuclear decommissioning, and falling income due to the closure of ageing power plants, Huhne said. Huhne disclosed that in current financial year the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority's budget is expected to be in balance.From 2011-12, the deficit suddenly rises to £850m, in 2012-13 the gap increases further to £950m and then to £1.1bn in the two subsequent years. The black hole is equivalent to wiping out one-sixth of the overall cuts in public spending identified by the Treasury with such fanfare last week. But Huhne insisted: \"I do not think it is possible for anyone responsibly to stand aside and say we are not going to deal with it. We just have to, but what we are effectively paying for here is decades of cheap nuclear electricity for which we have suddenly got a massive postdated bill.\" The revelation will also hand further ammunition to those who say a new generation of nuclear power stations in Britain will end up being more expensive than the industry claims. Huhne – a Liberal Democrat and nuclear sceptic – refused to make that argument directly, saying instead it just underlined the need to ensure that any new nuclear stations had watertight agreements that debar all public subsidy. In any case there are growing signs that the nuclear new-build timetable is slipping as costs rise. Huhne, already in talks with the Treasury about the black hole, said it was very hard to avoid the expenditure: \"There are genuine nuclear safety issues here that means it has to be paid for.\" If the Treasury refuses to shoulder the full costs, Huhne's department would inevitably have to make cuts with possible implications for energy efficiency and climate change programmes. Huhne revealed that as soon as he discovered the problem, he travelled to Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria and concluded: \"There is no way of dealing with this, but by making sure this expenditure goes ahead.\" Since the NDA was formed in 2004, the clean-up of legacy nuclear facilities has been paid for with a mix of funds – roughly half in direct government grants and half generated commercially by the NDA – and allocated in three-year cycles. Huhne said: \"My predecessors avoided taking tough decisions when they should have done and the result is that it is much more expensive to deal with than if we had dealt with it in a timely manner back in the 70s and 80s. A lot of it is spent fuel, and was not dealt with at the time. It is a classic example of short-termism. I cannot think of a better example of a failure to take a decision in the short run costing the taxpayer a hell of a lot more in the long run.\" The Liberal Democrats oppose new stations, but have said they will abstain in any key Commons votes on the issue so long as their Conservative coalition partners ensure no new station enjoys any overt or hidden public subsidy. Huhne said: \"New build is clearly more efficient, there is less waste, and the decommissioning can and should be designed in, but … we need to make sure all the costs are properly dealt with.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/may/19/chris-huhne-nuclear-renewable-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-19T14:54:50Z","webTitle":"Huhne 'sceptical' on nuclear power in talks with utility boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/19/chris-huhne-nuclear-renewable-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/may/19/chris-huhne-nuclear-renewable-wind-power","fields":{"headline":"Huhne 'sceptical' on nuclear power in talks with utility boss","bodyText":"Chris Huhne, the new energy and climate change minister, is sceptical about nuclear power but wanted to support the development of renewable energy, according to the UK's largest renewable generator. Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) said it had \"good discussions\" with Huhne on Tuesday. The company said he was very well-informed and fully supportive of its projects, including the huge Greater Gabbard wind farm off the coast of Suffolk which, when built, will be the largest offshore wind farm of its kind in the world. \"He [Huhne] was well aware of SSE's credentials and he was keen to see us continuing with what we are doing and to ensure there is continuing inward investment in this [wind] sector,\" said SSE's chief executive, Ian Marchant. But the utility boss, whose company is considering whether to build a new nuclear plant near Sellafield in Cumbria with Iberdrola of Spain and GDF of France, said the energy secretary was more downbeat about atomic power. \"He was sceptical on the economics of nuclear but made it clear he would allow people to make their own decisions on this and would not stand in their way if they can do it without subsidies,\" said Marchant. \"Personally, I think being sceptical is no bad thing. The worst thing you can have is a situation where the state bends over backwards to [financially] support nuclear. Look where that got us?\" he added. Huhne's party, the Liberal Democrats, orchestrated a mechanism for maintaining their opposition to nuclear power even though allowing nuclear to progress is government policy. The coalition has pledged to allow nuclear stations to be built so long as they do not involve public subsidies. SSE said it would do a lot of preparatory work on whether to go ahead with a new atomic plant before deciding in around two years' time whether such a move made commercial sense. \"We would have to be able to justify a decision whether for or against to both customers and shareholders,\" said Marchant. In the meantime, the utility company is spending £660m this year pressing ahead with wind farms and other renewable schemes. SSE is the biggest renewable generator largely because of its hydro-electric plants but has also moved into tidal and wave power. The company also runs coal-fired power stations such as Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire but said it was putting back by two years plans to start operating the Abernedd gas-fired power station in Baglan Bay, South Wales. This is partly because industrial customers have reduced demand due to the recession, while homeowners are continuing to cut their own consumption by taking energy-efficiency measures such as insulating their houses. Domestic gas use has gone down by 3% to 5% for the last three years in a row but SSE still ran up pre-tax profits of £1.29bn for the year to end March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/sep/13/heathrow-third-runway-public-split","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-13T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Heathrow third runway: poll reveals public split","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/heathrow-third-runway-public-split","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/sep/13/heathrow-third-runway-public-split","fields":{"headline":"Heathrow third runway: poll reveals public split","bodyText":"Britain is split down the middle on the question of Heathrow expansion – in a manner that reflects political splits in the coalition. That is the finding of new research prepared for this week's YouGov-Cambridge forum, at which the Guardian is media partner. It shows that while 34% of voters believe a bigger airport would \"encourage trade, travel and get the economy moving\", another 34% say they are more concerned by the potential damage of noise and carbon pollution. There is, however, a strong party slant to the figures. By a two-to-one margin of 50% to 25%, Conservatives emphasise the economic gains over the environmental damage. By contrast, Labour voters are slightly more inclined to take the environmental perspective – by a 35%-33% margin – as are Liberal Democrats more emphatically, by 45% to 34%. The findings come the week after David Cameron risked the rage of the greener among his Liberal Democrat coalition partners by shunting out a transport secretary, Justine Greening, who was opposed to expanding Britain's biggest airport, and appointing an environment secretary, Owen Paterson, who has previously spoken out against windfarms and in support of certain fossil fuels. The poll suggests post-reshuffle tensions at Westminster are mirrored among the two ruling parties' supporters. The difference is not so much that Conservatives are in denial about the environmental consequences of airport expansion – 63% believe it will cause a great deal or a fair amount of damage, which is less than the 72% of Lib Dems who say the same, but broadly in line with the 66% of voters overall who take this view. Rather, it is that Conservatives appear to give more weight to kickstarting the economy than to the environment. Respondents were asked to rank various potential investments in energy or the economy for the amount of environmental damage they would do. Voters revealed a hierarchy of polluting policies that fits pretty closely with the green movement's campaigns. A \"net damage score\" can be calculated by subtracting the proportion of voters who regard each project as doing little or no damage from the proportion who regard it as doing a great or fair amount of damage. New coal power stations are rated as the most damaging, with a score of 48 percentage points, and expanding Heathrow comes close behind with a score of 43 points. Easing planning to encourage homebuilding and building new roads come mid-table, with respective scores of 20 and 19 points. New nuclear power stations have divided environmentalists, with some regarding them as a necessary means of containing climate change and others bitterly opposed. Among the public 51% believe they will do considerable damage, against 36% who expect little or none, to give a net damage score of 15 points. The High-Speed 2 train line, which is planned to run from London to Birmingham and then eventually to Glasgow, is promoted as a way to encourage the movement of traffic from dirty roads to cleaner rails, but is being resisted by campaigners concerned about the countryside it would cut through. The public give it a relatively low net damage score of five points. Resistance to windfarms has been growing within the Conservative party, but not – according to the poll – among the public. Only 26% of respondents said they did great damage or a fair amount of it, as against 64% who said they did little or none. That gives a negative net damage score of -38, meaning windfarms are deemed a far cleaner investment than any of the alternative options. Underlying this pattern is, once again, a party divide. While a majority of Tory voters, 58%, do not believe windfarms cause significant damage, a substantial minority of 37% take the contrary view. That compares with far small number of wind sceptics among Labour supporters (19%) and Lib Dems (18%). Conservative modernisers may point to this survey as underlining the political dangers of pandering to anti-windfarm campaigns that play well with a section of the party's core vote, but would appear to have less resonance beyond this. Interesting additional party splits emerge in the ranking of the various projects. Labour voters look rather more kindly on coal than their counterparts – only 66% of them regard new coal power stations as doing great or a fair amount of damage, as against 70% of Tories and 81% of Lib Dems. By contrast, while both Lib Dem and Labour voters lean firmly against nuclear – with respective majorities of 57% and 56% suggesting new power stations would do substantial damage – the Conservatives are evenly split on the nuclear question, with 46% taking the same dim view and another 46% believing more nuclear stations would do little or no damage. • Between 9 and 10 September 2012, YouGov questioned 1871 GB adults.

These principles were extended to create the subject of materials science. Later, Alan was appointed chief scientific adviser to the government, covering a range of issues including aerospace, civil nuclear power generation and environmental pollution. He was born and educated in Moseley, Birmingham, and graduated in metallurgy from the University of Birmingham in 1939, obtaining his PhD three years later. His first book, Theoretical Structural Metallurgy (1948), was a lucid explanation of how the properties of metals are controlled by their electronic structures. It was the definitive source for those of us studying metallurgy in the 1950s. In 1949, Alan was appointed to a personal chair at Birmingham. He was deeply interested in the mechanical properties of metals, recognising that the strength of real alloys was controlled by the presence of defects, known as dislocations. His book Dislocations and Plastic Flow (1953) was recognised as a masterly exposition of the subject. In 2003, a number of us met up with him at Cambridge to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its publication: the proceedings ended with a procession of professors taking their original copies to the front, for Alan to sign. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1955 and was persuaded by Sir Monty Finniston to take up the post of deputy head of metallurgy at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. There, he became immersed in issues relating to the generation of electrical power by nuclear fission. Such issues included irradiation-induced shape changes in fuel elements, the safe annealing of the graphite cores in the Windscale piles and concerns with the possible brittle fracture of steel pressure vessels. In 1958, he was appointed to the Goldsmiths' chair and made head of metallurgy at Cambridge University, revitalising the department by bringing in new people and new lines of research, among them field-ion microscopy and superconductivity. I did PhD research on brittle fracture under his supervision. In 1964, to the dismay of his colleagues, he accepted an invitation to become Sir Solly Zuckerman's deputy in the Ministry of Defence. Alan had grown concerned with the need to invigorate British manufacturing industry with scientific technology, and he felt that Whitehall was the place to do this. Zuckerman soon became chief scientific adviser to the government and Alan became chief scientific adviser to the MoD. In 1968, Alan moved again, to become Zuckerman's deputy. In 1971, he was knighted and became chief scientific adviser to the government. At around this time, the Central Electricity Generating Board was proposing to utilise the Westinghouse pressurised water reactor (PWR) for future generations. Alan was extremely concerned about the integrity of the reactor pressure vessel; in 1974, giving evidence to the select committee on science and technology, he described the PWR as an \"unforgiving\" system, drawing attention to a range of measures that he considered necessary to ensure the safety of PWRs. A high-level pressure vessel committee was set up to address the points. The recommendations of this committee did much to set new safety principles for nuclear plants. In 1974, Alan became master of Jesus College, Cambridge; from 1977 to 1979 he was vice-chancellor of the university. This brought him into contact with the chancellor, Prince Philip. Partly through Alan's encouragement, Prince Edward became an undergraduate at Jesus. Alan maintained his interest in the science of materials and the progress of the PWR, on which he could now comment from an independent point of view. From 1983 to 1993, he chaired a committee set up to advise on the methods proposed to guarantee that no crack-like defects of concern would be present at the Sizewell B PWR power station in Suffolk. After he retired in 1986, Alan wrote the books Introduction to the Modern Theory of Metals and Chemical Bonding in Transition Metal Carbides. He joined a group devoted to the structural integrity of nuclear power generation systems, and from 1987 to 1995 chaired a Rolls-Royce advisory board on materials and processing. In 1944, Alan married Jean Harber. She was an ideal partner, with immense charm and capability – someone who could take matters such as entertaining royalty in her stride. Jean fell ill in 1996 and Alan devoted himself to taking care of her till her death in 1999. Alan is survived by their son, Geoffrey, and Ioana, a daughter of close friends who, after her parents' death, was welcomed by the Cottrells into their family. • Alan Cottrell, materials scientist, born 17 July 1919; died 15 February 2012"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2012/mar/14/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-14T20:08:54Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/mar/14/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2012/mar/14/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A piece reported on British government suggestions to the European commission about how a future phase of EU targets for cutting carbon emissions, by 2050, should work. However, the headline – UK wants renewable energy target scrapped, 12 March, page 7 – could have been read as suggesting that the UK wants a current target dropped, where member states are meant by 2020 to generate 20% of their energy from renewable energy sources. As for the story text, in the first edition of the paper, the opening paragraph was wrong in saying the UK \"is fighting to have nuclear power considered as a renewable form of energy in Europe\". (This wording was partly, though not entirely, the product of an editing change.) What Britain is arguing is that, in the future phase, EU members should be able to cut carbon emissions by whatever mix of energy sources they wish. This would put nuclear energy on the same footing as renewable energy or other technologies, as our article said in later editions; renewables would cease to have their own dedicated target. Finally, it was unfortunate for balance in the story that a comment on behalf of a key party, the Department of Energy and Climate Change, was cut from the newspaper version of this piece. • We were confused when we said that John Prescott and Lembit Opik both hoped to be elected police commissioner for Northumbria.

Founded two centuries ago on the prairie between the Great Lakes, Waterloo is home to the global smartphone maker BlackBerry, 500 tech companies and an institute of quantum computing, but it was first settled by German Mennonites, a religious sect who reject the inventions of the machine age. Working the land, raising barns and crafting hardwood kitchens for the many local technology millionaires, the Mennonites and their town have thrived on BlackBerry's success. But the community's future prosperity hinges on the efforts of a more recent German immigrant, BlackBerry chief executive Thorsten Heins. Appointed 13 months ago, his mission is to arrest the decline of a company whose value has crashed from a peak of $80bn (£51bn) in 2008 to $7.5bn this year. \"A year ago I felt the universe was in disarray,\" says Heins. \"Now all the stars have really lined up.\" Sporting a blue shirt embossed with the company logo, his phone in a holster hung from his belt, Heins is hosting a tour of BlackBerry's sprawling 22-building headquarters. It is two weeks after the splashy New York event, attended by BlackBerry's new creative director, the musician Alicia Keys, and beamed to press conferences in seven cities, at which Heins unveiled his company's first true internet phone, the Z10, and the BB10 operating system on which it runs. Back home, the streets are lined with messages of support. \"Proud to be powered by BlackBerry\" reads the sign outside the VW car dealership. There are discounts at burger joints for customers with the right phone, and the baristas in Starbucks wear BlackBerry T-shirts. With 7,000 of its employees in Waterloo alone, every finger is crossed for the company. BB10 took two years and 15 acquisitions to build, at a time when the firm then known as Research in Motion (RIM) was suffering the greatest upheaval in its history. In January last year, it was in a tailspin: Apple and Google had stolen its crown, with phones that were almost as powerful as laptops. RIM had played no part in the latest wave of the personal computing revolution, spending the years since the iPhone's 2007 arrival pushing email phones in emerging markets rather than improving technology, and its best-selling product was outdated. An investor revolt wrested control from founder Mike Lazaridis and his co-chief executive Jim Balsillie. Heins took their place and set about slashing costs, eventually announcing 5,000 redundancies. He hired two Wall Street banks to seek out potential buyers, and announced the company's first loss in eight years. But Heins also redoubled efforts on the firm's biggest ever project – the building of BB10. The Europeans brought in as his lieutenants are bullish, naturally. \"We want to regain our position as the number one in the world,\" says Kristian Tear, the Swedish chief operating officer who came from Sony. \"It could be the greatest comeback in tech history,\" claims marketing boss Frank Boulben, formerly of Orange. \"The carriers [mobile networks] are behind us. They don't want a duopoly.\" Between them, Google – whose Android software is used by Samsung, HTC and many others – and Apple accounted for 85% of handsets shipped last year, according to research firm Gartner. BlackBerry's share has fallen to 5%. Few software companies survive more than one change of operating system, and while BlackBerry leapt from making pagers to phones in the late 1990s, not everyone is confident of the same success this time. Balsillie, who unlike Lazaridis no longer holds a seat on the board, filed papers last week revealing that he had sold all his shares in the company. \"I took this job not just because I love restructuring,\" says Heins. \"I did it because I loved the core of innovation that I saw at RIM.\" Many advised him to jump on the Android bandwagon, or follow Nokia's lead by taking financial incentives from Microsoft to use its Windows Phone system. Instead, he decided to follow the course set by Lazaridis, who in 2010 had bought a Canadian firm called QNX, intending to use its technology as the building block for a new generation of phones. Like Linux, on which Android is built, QNX is a basic operating system on which the interfaces of different machines can run. While most such systems are monolithic – if one area malfunctions the whole system can crash – QNX is more stable because it uses independent building blocks or \"kernels\": if one breaks, there is no domino effect. As a result, it is used in the computers of nuclear power stations, high-speed trains, space shuttles and heart monitors. It is also in 60% of the engine electronics in today's high-end cars. BlackBerry's ambition does not stop with smartphones. It now extends to connecting individuals to computers running the machines in their lives. These could be remote-controllable washing machines, switching themselves on when electricity is cheapest; cars that book their own service appointments; or dashboard touchpads that guide vehicles and pipe entertainment to their passengers. That, says Heins, is why he chose the harder path of building BB10. \"We will be extremely aggressive at investing into this mobile computing domain. We understood that if we want to create the future we have to do something really dramatic and that was building the new platform.\" Reading on mobile? See the video interview with Thorsten Heins here And so the company decided to draw on its own resources. The graphic designers took their inspiration from the clean lines of the Farnsworth House, a modernist gem near Chicago designed by the architect Mies van der Rohe. The typeface was created by Canadian Rod McDonald, who specialises in clear lettering for the partially sighted. And the engineers found a way to view more than one application at once – say the calendar and email – a conundrum Android and Apple have not yet solved. The device's success, if it comes, will owe much to Alec Saunders, a former Microsoft employee and University of Waterloo graduate who led BlackBerry's battle to persuade developers to create as many apps as possible before BB10's launch. He joined in August 2011, in the middle of the period that is known internally as \"The Crazy\", and on the very day 2,500 staff were let go. His first task was to dismantle some of the \"completely unreasonable, almost Monty Python-esque\" ways of working the company had with outside developers – such as the 144-page contracts no small business could digest. Saunders set out to be the developers' friend by being as open as possible. Thousands of free prototype phones were handed out last summer, the BB10 development timetable was made public, and 44 \"BlackBerry Jam\" shindigs for developers were held in 33 countries. Local teams chasing local content were appointed in almost all of the 20 most prolific app-producing nations. Only Japan, where BlackBerry is withdrawing from the market, and South Korea, where Samsung is hard to work around, were left off the list. There were financial incentives too – $100 for the most basic apps, and a guarantee of $10,000 revenue in the first year for the most popular. When the Z10 made its worldwide debut in the UK, it came with 70,000 apps. By the time it reaches the United States in March, there will be 100,000. \"What we accomplished was monumental,\" says Saunders. \"We persuaded developers to build apps for a platform without the prospect of being able to make any money for months, and they did it.\" The company says that the Z10 performed three times better during its first week in the UK than any previous BlackBerry smartphone. That's a vague metric – and claims that UK stores ran out of stock were undermined by analysts Canaccord Genuity, which found most branches received less than 15 handsets each. We will know more on 28 March, when BlackBerry's next set of financial results are published. Ambitions about using QNX to connect to the real world do not a business plan make – BlackBerry's future rests on sales of its new phones. Tellingly, the company's bankers, JP Morgan and RBC Capital Markets, remain on standby, ready to negotiate a sale. Chinese manufacturer Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC business in 2005, has expressed an interest. Heins says BlackBerry's independence is in the balance. \"Are we out of the woods? No I don't think so. I think we need to still continue working at it and the strategic review is still part of it. As management we always need to assess the options that we have at our fingertips.\" At today's price, a takeover could put at least $13m in cash and share options in the chief executive's pocket. But BlackBerry's stock is at a 10-year low: the creation of a true smartphone and what the industry likes to call an \"ecosystem\" of apps should make it far more valuable to a buyer than the company Heins took control of a year ago. Should BlackBerry meet its Waterloo, it will mint a few more millionaires in the process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/27/angela-merkel-baden-wurttemberg-elections","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-27T00:06:10Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel faces a painful setback in the Baden-Württemberg elections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/27/angela-merkel-baden-wurttemberg-elections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/27/angela-merkel-baden-wurttemberg-elections","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel faces a painful setback in the Baden-Württemberg elections","bodyText":"Baden-Württemberg in south-west Germany is one of Europe's richest regions. For almost 58 years, it has been governed by Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). But from 6pm tonight, when the first results from the state's elections start to come in, this region of plenty might well be heading into the clutches of the opposition. If the pollsters are correct, the risk-averse burghers of Baden-Württemberg – with their locally assembled Mercedes in their garages and their jobs for life – may end up electing, by a narrow vote, Germany's first Green regional prime minister. Even more shocking is the slim chance that the ultra-socialist Linke (Left) party might win enough votes to be represented in the state parliament. The election might be a local one, but the consequences will reverberate in Berlin. \"If the CDU loses, it will be a massive blow for Merkel,\" said the Social Democrat candidate Nils Schmidt, 37, whose party may end up ruling Baden-Württemberg in a coalition with the Greens. \"But remember she is Teflon Angie. Will it stop her staying on as chancellor until the next general election in 2013? She doesn't have any competition in her own party any more.\" On Tuesday evening, the CDU's Stefan Mappus did his best to seem upbeat. The incumbent state prime minister, a squat 45-year-old, took to the podium at the Sillenbuch retirement community in Stuttgart and told the crowd what they wanted to hear. \"We in Baden-Württemberg are the best and we want to keep it that way,\" he said. \"We have the lowest unemployment – just 4.3% – and our economy is growing by 5.5%.\" But Mappus was in trouble and he knew it. Just 50km up the road from Sillenbuch, in the village of Neckarwestheim, was one obvious cause of his – and Merkel's – nosedive in the polls. Surrounded by vineyards and potato fields are two nuclear power stations, Neckarwestheim I and II. Thirteen days ago, Merkel announced that one of them would be immediately taken off the grid, along with six other nuclear plants built before 1980. The decision, taken after the explosions at the Fukushima reactors in Japan, was a brazen U-turn in CDU policy and a naked attempt to shore up votes – 70% of Germans saw it as such, and their suspicions were confirmed on Thursday with a leak of comments made by Merkel's economics and technology minister, Rainer Brüderle, who told a group of businessmen that the chancellor's decisions in the run-up to the Baden-Württemberg elections were \"not always rational\". Perhaps more painful for Merkel were comments by the veteran CDU chancellor Helmut Kohl, who wrote a piece in the tabloid Bild on Friday criticising her \"overly hasty\" decision. Retreating from nuclear energy would \"not help anyone\", said the 80-year-old, and would \"even make the world a more dangerous place\" because Germany's respected engineering know-how would no longer be used to improve the industry. In the bakery in Neckarwestheim, Karl-Georg Weber, 68, agreed. \"It was a panic reaction,\" he said. \"Merkel is a physicist, she should know better than to take these short-term decisions.\" Weber worked in the local nuclear power plants for 36 years. \"I was there in the 70s helping to build the first one,\" he said. \"I have nothing against them.\" But he is unusual. Some 64% of Germans are not in favour of nuclear power, according to the latest poll from the N-TV news channel, which is why the Baden-Württemberg Green party finds itself facing the unexpected prospect that its candidate, a former chemistry teacher called Winfried Kretschmann, could become state prime minister. Even before Fukushima blew, Germany was a vehemently anti-nuclear country, which is why Merkel's defiant decision last year to renew the life of 17 ageing nuclear reactors in the face of protests was controversial. Why Germans are so opposed to the nuclear industry while their French neighbours take it for granted is a matter for debate. Weber thinks it is ingrained in the national psyche: \"Germans are scared of anything and everything. We're scared of getting cancer. We're scared of there being too much salt in our Bretzels. We're scared of buying the wrong sort of eggs. It's a mentality thing.\" But nuclear power is not Merkel's only battleground. She is fighting on other fronts – her unpopular decision to participate in the EU bailout of Greece and other countries, and the decision to abstain from the UN resolution on the no-fly zone in Libya. For some, today's election is \"the beginning of the end\" for Merkel. Jakob Augstein, a German commentator and publisher, wrote last week on Spiegel Online that if the CDU is ousted in the \"conservative heartland\" of Baden-Württemberg, her position will be untenable. \"If the CDU is threatened with defeat here, then bad mistakes have been made. Merkel has made mistakes. And in her attempt to rectify the consequences, she has made even more,\" he said. \"She has lost her political intuition.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2011/mar/23/google-books-aol-content-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T08:55:00Z","webTitle":"Boot up: Google Books ripped up, AOL culls content farm and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/mar/23/google-books-aol-content-farm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2011/mar/23/google-books-aol-content-farm","fields":{"headline":"Boot up: Google Books ripped up, AOL culls content farm and more","bodyText":"A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Judge Rejects Google Books Settlement &gt;&gt; WSJ.com \"The U.S. Justice Department last year said it opposed the deal on such grounds.

This interlude of low-cost, deadpan merriment had a serious purpose: a community ready for assault from the living dead would also be primed to survive earthquake, wildfire, catastrophic flood, windstorm or lethal pandemic. No society is free from natural hazard – the magnitude 6 earthquake in northern Italy on Sunday is a sharp reminder of that. What separates hazard from disaster is a mix of factors, but common to them all are civic readiness and citizen education. Any investment in preparedness is a bargain in financial terms. That is because, since the turn of the millennium, worldwide economic losses from disaster have reached almost $1.4 trillion. In the last five years alone, costs have topped $800bn; 2011, with losses of more than $350bn, was the most expensive in history – according to the insurance industry. Last year was marked by the Great East Japan earthquake, a shock so violent it shifted the planet slightly on its axis, shortened the day by more than a microsecond, shunted parts of Japan 12 feet closer to America, triggered a catastrophic tsunami and tipped the nuclear industry into crisis. Japan, like Canada and the US, is a wealthy country with a lively insurance market and a citizenry prepared for natural hazard. But just as Hurricane Katrina seemed to catch the city of New Orleans by surprise, the scale of the destruction in and around the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the coastal settlements also bewildered the Tokyo government and stunned the surviving communities. The Japanese earthquake was just about as violent as an earthquake could be: the numbers at risk, however, were relatively low. One day, a disaster of similar magnitude will hit a modern megalopolis and the loss of life will be inconceivably worse. That is because the fastest population growth is in the developing world, and more than half of all humanity is now concentrated into cities, many of them at hazard from windstorm, flood and seismic wave. That is why the international disaster agencies have been pushing the theme of civic preparedness; have been arguing for cyclone shelters; for schools and hospitals that withstand shock; and for public education. In any disaster, the wealthy stand to lose money but the poorest risk everything: their homes, their livelihoods and all too often their lives. It makes sense to prepare a community for a disaster that may never happen, because if you prepare efficiently enough, then indeed it may never happen. Zombie attack is not a high-probability hazard, but the Canadians are right to be alert for the day the dead awaken. That way they cannot sleepwalk into another kind of tragedy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/15/eu-energy-chief-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-15T15:21:39Z","webTitle":"EU energy chief calls for new renewable energy targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/15/eu-energy-chief-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/15/eu-energy-chief-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"EU energy chief calls for new renewable energy targets","bodyText":"New renewable energy targets to go beyond 2020 must be negotiated within the next two years, the Europe's energy chief said on Thursday. Günther Oettinger, the EU energy commissioner, said new targets were needed for 2030 to enable businesses to plan ahead, as the current targets to produce 20% of Europe's energy from renewable sources run out in 2020. Oettinger was introducing a new EU energy roadmap to 2050, which showed that opting for a very high renewables component to the energy mix would be no more expensive than opting for alternative scenarios that placed more emphasis on nuclear power or coal and gas with carbon capture and storage. He said that he expected binding renewable energy targets for 2030 to be in place by 2014: \"With our roadmap we want to ensure that, for all participants, there should be an interesting discussion on binding targets for renewables by 2030. This should begin now and lead to a decision in two years' time.\" It is the first time Oettinger has set out a clear timetrable for new targets. It follows an agreement reached at UN climate talks in Durban on Sunday by which all developed and developing countries agreed to negotiate an international agreement on emissions reductions \"with legal force\" that would be written and signed by the end of 2015 and would come into force from 2020. By ensuring that Europe has its own post-2020 emissions and renewable targets decided in 2014, the EU will be in a better place to negotiate as a bloc and to meet the timetable set out in Durban. But the wrangling among member states over what the targets should be is likely to be fierce. The UK is ahead of the rest in having set a \"fourth carbon budget\" for emissions reductions in the 2020s, under which plan emissions would be roughly halved by 2025 compared with 1990 levels. Even that has become less certain, however, as the chancellor, George Osborne, wants a review of the targets in 2014. There is no agreement among other member states on what future targets should be, and several, such as Poland and other east European countries, want weaker targets while some Scandinavian countries want to be tough. Negotiating on targets was hard enough three years ago when the EU's 2020 targets were set. Reopening the discussions in the midst of the worst financial crisis and recession since the war, and with the eurozone looking precarious, will be triply difficult. Oettinger has also supported weaker targets for 2020 than the climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard. Launching the 2050 energy roadmap, Oettinger said: \"Only a new energy model will make our system secure, competitive and sustainable in the long-run. We now have a European framework for the necessary policy measures to be taken in order to secure the right investments.\" The roadmap puts the share of renewables in total energy use by 2050 at between 55% (in the lowest scenario) and 75% (in the highest scenario) – up to 97% in the share of electricity consumption. Christian Kjaer, chief executive officer of the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) in Brussels said: \"The commission's communication could have been clearer in its commitment to binding renewable energy targets for 2030. However, with his strong statement today, Oettinger has provided European industry and citizens with that clarity. The European parliament and council must now give the commission a clear mandate to come forward with ambitious binding 2030 targets for renewable energy.\" Greenpeace's EU energy policy director, Frauke Thies, said: \"The roadmap shows that getting clean energy from renewables will cost taxpayers no more than getting dirty and dangerous energy from coal or nuclear power. The commission will be tempted to overplay the role of coal and nuclear energy to appease the likes of Poland and France, but the numbers in the roadmap are unequivocal. It proves that a modern energy system can't do without renewables and efficiency, but can easily consign coal and nuclear power to the past.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/19/iran-nuclear-middle-east-arms-race","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-19T14:11:50Z","webTitle":"Would a nuclear Iran really trigger a new arms race in the Middle East?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/19/iran-nuclear-middle-east-arms-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/dec/19/iran-nuclear-middle-east-arms-race","fields":{"headline":"Would a nuclear Iran really trigger a new arms race in the Middle East?","bodyText":"GUEST BLOG: by Christopher Hobbs and Matthew Moran, from the Department of War Studies, Kings College, London Much of 2012 has seen a steady rise in tensions with regard to Iran's nuclear programme and its possible military dimensions. Iran has continued to increase its stockpile of 20%-enriched uranium, moving closer to Israel's red line for military action. Successive rounds of negotiations between Tehran, the P5+1 and the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) have failed to yield tangible results and economic sanctions are now crippling the Iranian economy. Yet the country's nuclear programme marches on, stoking fears that Iran may indeed be seeking to cross the nuclear weapons threshold. The regime in Tehran has consistently stressed Iran's opposition to the acquisition of nuclear weapons, primarily on religious grounds – Supreme Leader Khamenei's fatwa prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons is held up as evidence of this position. However, there is widespread agreement that Iran's nuclear activities extend well beyond what is necessary to meet their civil nuclear needs. Inevitably, Iran's nuclear defiance has provided ammunition for the war-mongerers advocating a pre-emptive attack on Iran. Prominent commentators such as Matthew Kroenig, claim that, at the very least, a nuclear-armed Iran would prompt a 'proliferation cascade' in the Middle East. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons – whatever form that scenario may take - its regional rivals will follow suit. The argument here is seductive; it is easier to assume the worst than to hope for the best. The problem is, we find that the counter-argument is more compelling. The idea that 'proliferation begets proliferation' is not new. Dire forecasts on the seemingly inevitable increase in the number of nuclear weapon states have been made since the dawn of the nuclear age. In 1963, for example, US President JF Kennedy predicted that there might be up to twenty-five nuclear weapons powers within the next decade. However, proliferation has proven to be historically rare, with the number of nuclear weapons states expanding only slightly from five in 1964 to nine in 2006 following North Korea's nuclear test. The flawed logic of 'proliferation begets proliferation' is clearly demonstrated in North East Asia where North Korea's nuclear weapons have not provoked Japan or South Korea, countries with advanced civil nuclear programmes, to follow suit despite a long history of regional conflict and volatile relations. In this case, strong security alliances with the United States incorporating extended nuclear deterrence have played an important role in dissuading these countries from going nuclear. Ironically, the Middle East itself offers further evidence that nuclear proliferation is not inevitable. Noted for its policy of nuclear opacity (neither confirming nor denying its nuclear arsenal), Israel acquired nuclear weapons in the late 1960s and over four decades later still remains the only nuclear power in the region. Now the threat posed by Iran to its neighbours is arguably greater given Tehran's aggressive posturing and regional ambitions. However our research finds that those states deemed most likely to go nuclear due to their proximity to Iran and their suspected past interest in acquiring nuclear weapons (namely Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia), would have little to gain and much to lose by embarking down such a route. Take Saudi Arabia, for example. Iran has long been at political and ideological odds with the kingdom across the Gulf. And at first sight, it seems likely that Saudi Arabia would follow Iran down the nuclear path. In February, Saudi officials were reported as claiming that Riyadh would launch a \"twin-track nuclear weapons programme\" in the event of a successful Iranian nuclear test. An article published in the London Times in February [£] described a scenario whereby Saudi Arabia would attempt to purchase warheads from abroad while also adding a military dimension to its planned civil nuclear programme at home. Look more closely, however, and there is a much stronger case to be made against Saudi nuclearisation. Beyond the Kingdom's primitive nuclear infrastructure – the country lacks sufficient experience and expertise in practically all areas of the nuclear fuel cycle – Saudi Arabia's political and strategic context does not favour the acquisition of nuclear weapons. From a security perspective, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States has held firm since the 1940s, despite a number of challenges – most notably the participation of a number of Saudi nationals in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The relationship barters Saudi oil for US conventional arms and an implicit commitment to Saudi's defence. In recent years, the role of Washington as the silent guarantor of Riyadh's security has grown apace with the structural changes in the Middle East. The fall of the pro-Saudi Mubarak regime in Egypt; protests and instability in Bahrain and Yemen; the collapse of the pro-Saudi government in Lebanon; and civil war in Syria have upended the established regional order and made Riyadh's position less secure. In this context, and given the determination of the United States to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region, a move by Saudi Arabia to acquire nuclear weapons holds few positives for Riyadh's security calculus. From and economic perspective, Saudi Arabia's policy outlook exemplifies Etel Solingen's seminal theory on the relationship between economic liberalism and nuclear restraint. Solingen argues that political coalitions favouring the reduction of state control over markets and increased privatisation and foreign investment – are less likely to adopt a nuclear posture that would endanger their economic interests. In this regard, Saudi Arabia's emphasis on facilitating the growth of foreign investment is significant. Riyadh has cultivated extensive trade relations with most international powers, keen to attract foreign investment as a means of reducing over-reliance on oil and gas, increasing employment opportunities for the local population (population growth of almost two percent equates to a need for some 200,000 new jobs per year), and reinvigorating the Saudi private sector. The acquisition of nuclear weapons would have far-reaching consequences, stalling progress and bringing progressive economic isolation, thus drastically changing the nature of the kingdom's international trade relations. Saudi's interests are best served by nuclear restraint. In an article published in the latest issue of The International Spectator, we argue that there are strong arguments for nuclear restraint in the cases of other regional players as well. From security guarantees and the provision of advanced conventional weapons - in December 2011, following the United States agreed a $1.7 billion deal to upgrade Saudi Arabia's Patriot missile defence system, for example – to facilitating increased integration into the international economy, there are a range of measures that can persuade a state to forgo nuclear weapons. Ultimately, many see a domino-effect as the logical response to Iranian nuclearisation. But when the stakes are this high, it is important to look at all sides of the debate. From another perspective, there is substantial evidence to suggest that regional proliferation is not a very likely outcome at all.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Miliband said that Cameron tried to say that Labour was to blame for all the economic problems before 2010, but was now saying global factors were to blame for the problems currently facing the problems. Cameron, who was in the Commons for a statement on the G20, rejected this. You can read the full exchanges at 5.07pm. Cameron has refused to comment on suggestions that the government deficit-reduction programme is falling further behind schedule. When Labour’s John Woodcock put this idea to Cameron, he just said that the government had cut the defici by a third and that the latest figures would be announced, as usual, in the autumn statement. Cameron has urged MPs to quash some of the “wholly false arguments” being made about the impact of the EU/US free trade deal, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) on the NHS. Campaigners claim that it will lead to American firms having the right to take over legal services. Cameron said that Karel de Gucht, the EU’s trade commissioner, has explicitly denied this. (See 4.58pm.) He told MPs: We need to work hard to quash some of the wholly false arguments that are being put about by opponents of TTIP. This does not in any way have to affect our national health service. Cameron also claimed that there was nothing sinister about the inclusion of an investor state dispute settlement provision (ISDS) in the TTIP. These were a feature of every trade deal Britain has signed, he said, and he claimed Britain had never lost a case. He also claimed that some people who were lobbying MPs about this did not fully understand the issues. I do think, and I hope as members of parliament we can all try to do this, when you get that barrage of emails - people sometimes have signed up without fully understanding every part of what they’ve been asked to sign - people want to spread some fear about this thing, and we have a role, I think, of trying to explain properly why these things are good for our country. He said the European Central Bank should adopt a more activist stance to promote growth in Europe. Britain and America have shown that an active monetary policy, delivered by an independent central bank, can make a real difference. And I think, with the signs of rather staggered growth in Europe, then there’s a need for the European Central Bank to take that action as well. He signalled that he was planning to give the Charity Commission new powers to stop extremists abusing charity law. Charities could also be given legal advice to help them expel extremists, he hinted. There is a problem with some charities that have had charity status that have used their existence to support extremism or the extremist narrative. There are two things we need to do here, which we have been looking at through the extremism taskforce. One is to help organisations who might need to take lawyers or legal advice to throw extremists out of their organisations. The second is to make sure the Charity Commission has the resources and the teeth it needs, including possibly new legal powers, so it can take action too. He signalled that he would approve of extremists fighting with Islamic State being charged with treason. (See 5.13pm.) The Tory former chief whip Andrew Mitchell is a “Jekyll and Hyde” character with a mixture of charm and menace, his libel trial against the Sun newspaper over the Plebgate affair has heard. Kelly Tolhurst, the Conservative byelection candidate in Rochester and Strood, has suggested some voters are worried that having a Ukip MP as their local representative could lead to a drop in house prices. Liz Truss, the environment secretary, has announced measures to deal with an outbreak of avian flu at a duck breeding farm in Yorkshire. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Peter Bone, a Conservative, asks if President Putin really left early because he was tired. Or was it because, like most bullies, he didn’t like someone standing up to him. Cameron says he does not know why Putin left early. He says his view is that you should always stay to the end at summits like this, unless something gets agreed that you disagree with. And that’s it. The statement is over. I’ll post a summary shortly. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, says Britons who fight with Islamist State should be prosecuted for treason. Cameron says he agrees. These people should face the full force of the law, he says. The most interesting aspect of the exchanges between Cameron and Miliband was what they both had to say about the global economy. Miliband accused Cameron of getting his excuses in early. Today you tell us there are red lights flashing in the global economy. I think that is what is known as getting your excuses in early. You used to tell us that the problems in the British economy were all to do with the British government and nothing to do with international factors. Now, you want to tell us that on your watch they’re all to do with international factors and nothing to do with the British government. Isn’t the truth that before you went to Brisbane we already knew your export targets were off track and the trade deficit is the highest it’s been for 25 years? Before you went to Brisbane, we knew that Britain’s productivity had stagnated on your watch. Before you went to Brisbane, we knew that average families were £1,600 a year worse off. You have gone from saying everything is fixed thanks to you to everything is not fixed but is nothing to do with you. All along you should have been listening to the British people who see deep problems in an economy not working for them. Isn’t it time you stopped blaming everybody else for an economy that’s great for a few people at the top but isn’t delivering for most working people? Cameron said he was happy to debate Miliband on this. I’m very happy to defend and take some credit for what is happening in the British economy - growing at 3%, the biggest fall in unemployment on record, 400,000 new businesses. Because of the difficult decisions that we took, the British economy is doing well. The difference I would say is now while there are problems in the world economy, you can actually see that Britain is outperforming other countries in the world and the figures speak for themselves. Cameron also ended with a jibe at Miliband. Can I say what a pleasure it always is to get back to Britain and find some things haven’t changed - our language, the beauties of our climate and that crucially you are still in your place? (I’ve taken the quote from the Press Association. Before someone starts complaining BTL, I think they’ve turned an “right honourable gentleman” into a “you”.) Labour’s Andy Sawford asks which prime minister turned up to the discussion on climate change: the one who said he wanted to hug a husky, or the one who said he wanted to cut the crap. Cameron says it was the one who set up the green investment bank, and the one who commissioned a new nuclear power station when Labour did nothing to restart the nuclear programme. Here is the quote that David Cameron cited earlier, from Karel de Gucht, the EU trade commissioner, saying the NHS would not be covered by the free trade provisions in TTIP (which allegedly could open it up to services being taken over by a US firm). It’s in this BBC story. De Gucht said: Public services are always exempted - there is no problem about exemption. The argument is abused in your country for political reasons but it has no grounds. Labour’s Sheila Gilmore asks why the NHS cannot be formally exempted from TTIP. Cameron says these ideas can be discussed. But there is not point raising unnecessary fears amongst the public. Margaret Ritchie, the SDLP MP, asks if a devolve administration could be forced to pay money to a private company under an investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) under TTIP. Cameron says these ISDS arrangements have been part of every trade deal Britain has signed. And Britain has never lost a case, he says. John Baron, a Conservative, says the problem with talking loudly and carrying a small stick is that you get found out by the bullies. Camerons says he does not accept that. Britain has one of the top five defence budgets in the word. Two new aircraft carriers are being built, and destroyers. Britain has a full set of capabilities. We should not talk it down. Cameron says a former EU trade commissioner said there was “no problem” about public services being exempted form TTIP and that these arguments were being abused “for political reasons”. Labour’s Gisela Stuart asks why Cameron is so sure that the NHS will not be covered by TTIP. Cameron says what makes him confident is a statement from the European Commission about states having the right to keep their health service in the public sector. Politicians should challenge the things being said about TTIP, he says. Here’s Labour’s John Woodcock summarising an exchange he had earlier. Labour’s Alison McGovern asks if Cameron will campaign for an international right to health coverage. Cameron says she’s right. This should be considered when the Millennium Development Goals are updated, he says. Julian Lewis, a Conservative, asks Cameron for a commitment to keep defence spending above the Nato target (2% of national income) while he is in office. Cameron says he has set out his plans for this parliament, and that he will set out his plans for the next one at the election. Labour’s Derek Twigg asks how having so many people on low-paid jobs addresses the productivity problem. Cameron says a large number of jobs are being created and that it is a myth to say they are all low-paid ones. Hugh Robertson, a Conservative, asks if Cameron discussed cutting funds to Islamic State from Arab countries. Cameron says he discussed this issue with Barack Obama and Tony Abbott, the Australian prime minister. Labour’s Rushanara Ali asks about an initiative to cut remittance costs for people sending money back to developing countries. Cameron says remittances are a critical source of income in these countries. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, suggests spending £650m from the aid budget on a climate change fund is not the best use of public money. Cameron say breaking promises to the poorest in the world would not be the right thing to do. The SNP’s Angus Roberston invites Cameron to congratulate Nicola Sturgeon on becoming leader of the SNP. Cameron says he is happy to congratulate her. At the G20 almost all leaders came up to say how pleased they were the UK was staying together. Liam Fox, the Conservative former defence secretary, says it is the eurozone itself that poses a threat to the EU’s recovery. Cameron says the eurozone needs structural recovery. And Britain and America have shown an active monetary policy can make a difference. The European Central Bank should follow that course. Labour’s Keith Vaz asks if Cameron discussed trade in his meeting with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. And did he invite him to the UK? Cameron says more can be done to promote trade with India. They discussed the need for the free trade talks with the EU to get going again. Cameron says changes in the US Congress make an agreement on TTIP (the transatlantic trade and investment partnership) more likely. But supporters of TTIP must attack the myths about its impact on the NHS, he says. Labour’s Dennis Skinner accuses Cameron of “hypocrisy” because he is imposing sanctions on Russia, while helping Russians donate to the Conservative party. Cameron says he does not know where to start. Skinner used to support the Communists, he says, but they don’t run Russia any more. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the Conservative former foreign secretary, says further sanctions on Putin and his “cronies” will not have any effect. Cameron says he disagrees. The value of the rouble has fallen, he says. Economic sanctions are having an effect. Labour’s Pat McFadden asks if Cameron regrets watering down Labour’s anti-terror laws. Cameron says the government took advice and took the right decisions. Jack Straw, the Labour foreign secretary, asks about Luxembourg’s “scandalous” record on tax avoidance when Jean-Claude Juncker was prime minister. Cameron says Luxembourg has now signed up to action on tax avoidance. Sir Peter Tapsell, a Conservative, asks if Russia would take more notice if Britain were re-arming. Cameron says Britain is investing in arms. But what Putin really notices is a united opposition. Cameron is responding to Miliband. He says all EU leaders who met Putin gave him a clear message. Further destabilisation would trigger more sanctions, he says. On taxation, Cameron says what is crucial is that tax jurisdictions have agreed to share information. On climate change, Cameron says Britain has already made money available. The biggest breakthrough is that China and America came to an agreement on targets at the Asian summit. On growth, Cameron says he is happy to defend and take some credit for what is happening in the UK: growth at 3pc, the biggest fall in unemployment on record. The difference is that, while there are problems in the world economy, now Britain is outperforming other countries. Coming back to the UK, it is a pleasure to see some things have not changed: our language, the pleasures of our climate - and Miliband still in his place. Ed Miliband is responding to Cameron. He endorses Cameron’s comments about the murder of Peter Kassig. On Russia, does Cameron think enough is being done to get Russia out of Ukraine? And what has to happen for further sanctions to be applied? On corporate taxation, will developing countries be given a role in forming the new rules? This was promised, but has not happened. Why not? When will the UK announce our contribution to the climate fund? On Ebola, Miliband welcomes the UK’s role as the second largest donor. But the G20 conclusions were short on commitments from other countries. What can be done to get them to contribute more? On growth, Cameron says there are red lights flashing in the global economy. I think that is what is known as getting your excuses in early. Cameron used to say problems with the economy were all to do with UK decisions, not global ones. Now he is saying it’s all to do with global factors. Cameron says the G20 plan is plan for jobs and growth. It is intended to boost the global economy by $2 trillion. The warning signs in the global economy show it is more important than ever to stick to the government’s long-term economic plan, he says. He says his focus at the summit was helping to deliver global growth by tackling the threats to it. On free trade, he pushed for the EU/US trade deal to be completed next year. And he pushed for the EU to do other trade deals, including with Australia. On global taxation, he says there was progress on ensuring big companies pay the taxes they owe. This is a moral issue, as well as an economic one. Cameron says he put this on the G20 agenda at the summit in Northern Ireland. It is not embedded in the G20 agenda. On the threat posed by conflict and disease, Cameron says he called on Russia to respect the Minsk agreements. And he said Britain was prepared to tighten sanctions. President Putin said he did not want a frozen conflict, and he said he saw Ukraine as a single political space. But he must be judged by his deeds, not his words. On Ebola, Cameron said he wrote to the Australian prime minister before the summit asking for this to be included. He pushed for global measures to tackle a similar outbreak in future, such as having a standing pool of medics, and more action on fighting bacteria. This was a good G20 for Britain, he says. David Cameron starts by condemning the murder of the US aid worker, Peter Kassig. He says tackling the threat posed by terror formed part of his conversations with the Australian prime minister. He has announced powers to stop extremists returning to the UK. A full statement about the counter-terrorism bill will be made soon. Apparently David Cameron only got back from the G20 summit at lunchtime. And his body clock will be telling him it’s the middle of the night. He might not be in a very good mood ... Lord Ashcroft’s weekly poll is out. Here are the figures. Labour’s Michael McCann isn’t impressed by Cameron’s latest argument about the state of the global economy. David Cameron will be making his Commons statement on the G20 summit in about half an hour. It would normally start at 3.30pm, but there is an urgent question about the army reserves first. For some background, here’s a piece from Guardian Australia’s Van Badham on 10 things we learnt from the G20. Here’s a short afternoon reading list. Nick Robinson on his blog says Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told the cabinet last week that there may have to be cuts in the autumn statement. Philip Cowley at the Conversation looks at how the Conservatives are trying to win in Rochester with a leaflet highlighting their candidate’s local credentials, while describing Mark Reckless as someone who studied politics at Oxford and then worked as a political researcher. And Jackie South at All That’s Left writes about the same leaflet. The idea that voting Conservative is a blow against career politicians without local connections is openly risible. To put it on your leaflets is an act of desperate prattishness. A “web of lies, deceit and indiscipline” by police officers led to former government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and his family being subjected to an extended and vitriolic press campaign, the High Court has heard. As the Press Association reports, James Price QC was opening Mitchell’s libel action against News Group Newspapers (NGN) over a September 2012 story in The Sun which the MP says meant that he was guilty of launching a grossly offensive and arrogant attack at Downing Street police officers two days earlier, branding them “fucking plebs” and “morons”. Mitchell sat in front of his counsel as he told Mr Justice Mitting, who is hearing the case in London without a jury, that what the MP was alleged to have said was a “gross caricature of an attitude of mind which has been out of date for decades”. Price said that the detail of the encounter which was leaked to the newspaper by a number of officers was “wholly false”. This web of lies, deceit and indiscipline, and by police officers, led to Mr Mitchell and his family being subjected to an extremely unpleasant, indeed vitriolic, press campaign and a good deal of hostility from the public who believed what they had read in the press. It also placed him in a position where he required considerable determination and, above all, confidence in the rightness of his position, to stand by his account of events. NGN argues that the article was substantially true and, at the heart of its case, is the account given by Pc Toby Rowland. He claims that Mitchell, having demanded but been denied the right to leave on his bicycle by the main Downing Street gates, lost his temper and said: “Best you learn your fucking place - you don’t run this fucking government - you’re fucking plebs.” In his witness statement to the court, Mitchell said: I admit to sometimes using bad language in conversation. I also admit that I can sometimes be impatient and short-tempered when I consider I am being prevented from going about my legitimate business. I even admit that I can be - or at least that I can appear to be - rude on these occasions. To the best of my recollection, I have never called anybody a ‘pleb’, however, let alone a policeman. Since the incident I have thought long and hard about this and cannot recall a single instance when I have called anybody a ‘pleb’. It just isn’t a word I use. For detailed reporting from the trial, @DannyShawBBC, @JoshuaRozenberg and @TimesCrime are all worth following. Downing Street has said David Cameron will convene a meeting of the government’s Cobra contingency committee to consult with security chiefs and other senior officials following the Islamic State beheading of US hostage Peter Kassig. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a short note today saying that the amount the government is saving from changes to benefits and tax credits is much lower than expected. Amongst other reasons, this is partly because of higher spending on pensioners, and partly because anticipated savings from cuts to tax credits, housing benefit and disability living allowance have not materialised. George Osborne, the chancellor, has used an interview with BBC News to back David Cameron’s comments, in a Guardian article, about the “red warning lights” flashing on the dashboard of the global economy. Osborne said: You have to make a realistic assesment of the global economy today. We’ve discovered that Japan has gone into recession, Europe remains vey weak, and although the British economy is perfoming well we’re not immune to these things happening in the world. It’s all the more reason why we’ve got to go on working through our long term economic plan and why it would be a complete disaster to divert from that plan, to borrow and spend more. That would put Britain in a place where many other countries find themselves today. But Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, has put out a statement saying the coalition is to blame for problems with the economy. It is helpful that Mr Cameron has finally noticed the extreme fragility of the global economy, if only belatedly, but what’s clear from his remarks is that he’s trying to lay the blame for the failures of his own government in any place but the right one. Voters will no doubt recall that this government came into office promising to ‘rebalance’ our economy, away from the financial sector and back towards manufacturing - a move that would have required substantial investment in the real economy, rather than cash flowing into financial and property speculation. That has not happened; the UK’s rate of investment is comparable to El Salvador’s, and the financial sector has debts totalling 1,300% of GDP. Furthermore, the government has utterly failed to rein in the excesses, the fraud, management and risk-taking of the bankers, as the massive fines for market rigging this week demonstrated The Green party says this has to end. We need to slash the size of the financial sector and see that it serves the needs of a boosted real economy that manufactures the goods and grows the food that we need, providing jobs that workers can live on, and homes they can afford. That would also reduce our exposure to the international economic, political and military turbulence. Here’s the Press Association on the security scare at Westminster this morning. (See 10.28am.) A security alert which closed a key Parliamentary building was sparked by suspicions over a tablet computer belonging to a minister’s aide. Portcullis House - which contains MPs’ offices and committee rooms - was evacuated and sealed off while police examined the device. Tory MP Nick Boles took to Twitter to reveal that the false alarm erupted around his newly-recruited apprentice. “An exciting start to my apprentice’s first day at Parliament: the whole of Portcullis House evacuated cos of security scare over his iPad!” the Skills Minster posted. His office said he was not providing any more details of the incident - which saw a number of high-profile figures locked out of meetings. Scotland Yard confirmed that an item found in the airport security-style entrance area of the building opposite the Palace of Westminster was investigated and found not to be suspicious. And here’s the tweet from Nick Boles, the minister for skills. Here is a Rochester byelection round-up. Matthew Goodwin in the Telegraph says Ukip has professionalised its campaigning operation. It started in Clacton. That by-election was significant not only because it launched Ukip into Westminster, but also because it taught the party how to campaign. Clacton was the first electoral battle in which Ukip waged a modern, professional and intensive effort. It was the first time that Ukip experimented with a “voter identification system” – a database of information on each voter – and therefore the first time that the party approached different areas with different messages. Thus Labour voters heard about opposition to the “bedroom tax” and the need to punish bankers; Tory voters heard about the need for more GPs. It was also the first time that younger Ukippers became seriously involved, learning the importance of more targeted, subtle and nuanced messages before their own campaigns next May along the East Coast. Ironically, this change was not the product of diehard Ukippers but of two new recruits: the defector Douglas Carswell, who has long written about how to revitalise parties; and the experienced organiser Chris Bruni-Lowe, who used to run local referendums for MPs. Their priority was to own the “local space” before other parties arrived. In Clacton, the frontline was not Europe or immigration. It was fixing street lights, finding more GPs, saving a maternity unit and curbing knife crime. Precisely the same is now happening in Mark Reckless’s seat of Rochester and Strood. The Tories have started too late and remain focused on a story about the national economic recovery, which even a quick look at the surveys would show is not being felt by most Ukip voters. Kelly Tolhurst, the Conservative candidate, tells the Telegraph she has “never been a massive fan of politicians”. She says: I do believe that I am a normal person. The only candidate who is a true person of Rochester and Strood is me ... I’ve not wanted to be an MP since I was nine. I’m not a career politician, I never set out to do this. But I really want to represent this area because I come from here, I know the people and I think I can do a good job. Roger Helmer, the Ukip MEP, says the party will benefit in the byelection from the government’s decision to pledge hundreds of millions of pounds to a new Green Climate Fund in Berlin on the same day as the poll. Mike Smithson says people who have made a forecast of the byelection result on his Political Betting website expect Ukip to win by an average margin of 8.88 percentage points. David Cameron is going to host a Cobra meeting on the latest Islamic State beheading, Downing Street announced at the Number 10 lobby briefing. There is also going to be a statement in the Commons from Cameron on the G20 summit at 3.30pm this afternoon. The plebgate libel trial has got underway. I won’t be providing minute-by-minute coverage here, but the BBC’s Danny Shaw seems to be providing good rolling coverage here on Twitter. Here are his opening posts. Who’s winning in Rochester and Strood? Having listening to this morning’s hustings, I’m tempted to conclude that the answer is - Sir John Major. I spent a day in the constituency three and half weeks ago - you can read about it here - and I was told explicitly by Ukip that they were putting immigration at the heart of their campaign. They showed me this, which they described as their main campaign leaflet. Yet today a different story emerged. This is the key news line from this morning’s hustings. Mark Reckless, the Ukip candidate, has downplayed the importance of immigration as a key campaign issue. Asked at the start of the BBC Radio Kent hustings to summarise in 60 seconds why he should be MP, he did not mention immigration and instead said he was focusing on health. First and foremost, because I’m putting backing Medway’s NHS at the centre of my campaign. My father’s a doctor, my mother was a nurse and I’m extremely concerned that under both of the parties we’ve seen problems at Medway hospital being allowed to fester for at least a decade now. Kelly Tolhurst, the Conservative candidate and Reckless’s main rival, also highlighted the state of the local hospital as her main issue. Why could this mark a result for Major? Because, within the last week, he has twice spoken out on this subject in ways that seem designed to shame Ukip over its anti-immigration stance. Last week he spoke about his “huge admiration” for immigrants, and yesterday he described Ukip as a party of “negativity and sheer nastiness”. There could be an alternative theory. In an interview with BBC Radio Kent after the hustings, Tim Bale, an academic, said Ukip could be focusing on health because they “own” immigration as an issue anyway. Perhaps. But if you “own” an issue and you think it’s winning you votes, it is customary to keep banging on about it. As for the rest of the hustings, here’s my verdict on how the candidates performed. Mark Reckless: He easily comes over as the most professional candidate (as you would expect from someone who’s been the local MP for more than four years) and he comfortably trumped Tolhurst at several points on local detail. But he was given an easy ride. His Lodge Hill flip-flop was only addressed fleetingly at the end (see 10am), and sadly he was not challenged on why a man now fighting a byelection on his commitment to the NHS defected to a party run by a man who two years ago wanted to dismantle it. Kelly Tolhurst: Rather poor. Having impeccable local credentials is a strength, but she is weak on policy, having little to say when pressed on what she wanted David Cameron to do about immigration (see 9.33am) and, given what the presenter was revealing about the state of Medway schools, she is probably lucky that this has not been a bigger issue in the campaign in the light of her role as cabinet member on the council in charge of education. Naushabah Khan: She was good. I probably wouldn’t go as far as Rod Liddle, who described her as “best, by a million miles” after another hustings, but she was articulate, and had a good grasp of the issues. Geoff Juby: For understandable reasons, he sounded as if his heart wasn’t really in it. (The latest Ashcroft poll puts the Lib Dems on 2% in this fight.) Clive Gregory: He sounded refreshingly different. Listening to him made me think that Natalie Bennett could do well if she gets included in a UK televised leaders’ debate, not so much because the country would endorse every Green policy, but because there is an appetite for an alternative to what the main parties are offering, and the Greens could fill it. That didn’t last long. There is a security alert at Parliament. Portcullis House, the building opposite the main Houses of Parliament where many MPs have offices, has been partly evacuated because of a suspect package. Q: Why is there not central fund to help countries accept migrants? Gregory says that would be a good idea. Q: Why are disability issues not featuring in the campaign? Juby says he has only been approached by one disability group? Q: Ukip have no credibility. They flip-flop. When you were a Conservative MP, you defended the plan for the Lodge Hill development. Now you are against it? Reckless says that, since he made those comments, it has been designated a site of special scientific interest. If it were allowed to go ahead, the whole system of environmental protection would fall apart. One of his reasons for holding the byelection was to campaign against this, he says. Khan says she is in favour of Lodge Hill. Extra homes are needed. Both Reckless and Tolhurst have changed their mind on this, she says. Tolhurst says that’s not true. She has never voted against it, she says. And that’s it. I’ll post a summary soon. Tolhurst says Reckless claims he secured the funding for Stood academy. But that happened before he became MP. And she says Reckless talked about two primaries closing. That was Labour policy, she says. Reckless disputes that. He says it was a decision taken by the council. Juby says Labour created the academies. Khan says people do not understand that there is a difference between Labour and coalition academies. Under Labour, academy status was used to improve failing schools. Under the coalition, the best schools have been encouraged to become academies. Gregory say the whole system is a problem. There is too much focus on league tables. Teachers should be allowed to teach. Q: That’s Michael Gove’s fault, isn’t it? Reckless says Gove was right to place an emphasis on standards. Reckless says there has not been enough urgency at the council. He has a one-year-old child, and two-and-a-half-year-old. There is a good local primary near him. But he is just outside the catchment areas. He says Tolhurst is responsible for local schools being poor. Tolhurst says she has been working hard to improve schools. She has set up a system where schools have to come in an explain their Ofsted performance. We are seeing improvements, she says. But these things do not change overnight. Q: [To Khan] What would you do about local schools? Khan says she went to local schools, and she is a school governor. Q: You’re governor of a secondary school. Do you have a problem with the quality of children coming through? No, says Khan. But it’s a selective school. Tolhurst says that Khan is contradicting herself, saying standards generally are poor, but not at the intake for her school. Khan does not accept that. (Julia George, the presenter, says it’s a selective school.) Q: [To Tolhurst] You have been the cabinet member for schools on Medway council. For 18 months, says Tolhurst. Q: School performance has been catastrophically bad. It is near the bottom of the table nationally on various educational measures. You say you will give parents a choice of outstanding schools. But there aren’t any here. Tolhurst says she has been addressing these problems. Key stage two results have improved, she says. For the first time in many years schools in Rochester and Strood are going to achieve 100% at key stage two. Q: Most of these schools are going to be given to other schools to look after because Medway council has done so badly. Tolhurst says, since she has had this portfolio, there have been improvements. Partnership working is important, she says. The council has encouraged that. Juby says there is one school in the Medway were pupils speak more than 100 languages. Immigration puts pressure on services. But he concedes he does not have all the answers. Reckless says Tolhurst wants to limit the number of immigrants coming from the EU. But you cannot do this if you are in the EU. So, Kelly, will you join me in campaigning to leave the EU. Tolhurst says Cameron wants to limit the numbers coming in. Khan says, when Cameron made his Bloomberg speech on the EU last year, he did not even mention immigration. Tolhurst says Cameron has a record of delivering, on issues like the EU budget. She will keep pushing him on immigration until he delivers. It’s “words not action,” says Reckless. Juby says immigration is good for this country. And limits would be dangerous. There are around 200,000 Spanish people in the UK, but more than one million Britons in Spain. Q: [To Gregory] You would let anyone in? No, says Gregory. But what goes around comes around. There are Britons working abroad as a result of the EU. Khan says immigrants are contributing a great deal to the economy. And the EU is bringing inward investment to the area. Q: What is your real position? You speak about its benefits. But you seem to have been nobbled by Labour, and talk about the problems too. Khan says she does not accept that. The last Labour government made mistakes. Q: [To Tolhurst] Has someone told you not to mention it? Tolhurst says immigration has benefits. But it is having a big impact locally. We need to take measures to reduce it. Q: What are you urging Cameron to do? Tolhurst says she wants him to fight, and have a renegotiation with Europe. People coming to this country should work and contribute. It should not be open to immigrants who are not working, she says. Q: But that’s happening? There is more we could do, Tolhurst says. Q: But what about people coming here to work? What do you want him to do? Tolhurst says she would like Cameron to control the numbers. Q: How? By having some agreement? Q: Permanently? Or temporarily, as John Major suggested. For a short period of time, says Tolhurst. Q: In other debates immigration has come up a lot. Has anyone told you not to mention it? Reckless says people know Ukip has a fair policy on immigration, with an Australian-style points system. Q: Do you think this is not a vote winner? Reckless says it is a huge issue. It gets raised a lot on the doorstep. Q: You did not mention it in your opening remarks. Reckless says he thought it would come up. Q: What would you do to improve health? Tolhurst says Medway hospital being in special measures in unacceptable. She has a personal interest; the hospital save her life last year. She has talked about this with Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, who was down here last week. She would like to pair the Medway hospital up with an outstanding hospital, possibly a London one, to drive it out of special measures. Reckless says the hospital has already paired up with the Homerton hospital to improve A&amp;E. Tolhurst says a general pairing would be good. Julia Smith says there used to be two mental health wards in the local hospital. Now there is just two thirds of one. Q: Does that concern you? Juby says this concerns him very much. This is a national problem. The Mental Health Trust is not getting the money it needs. Q: Is this because mental health does not get parity with physical health? Juby says the problem is we say we want to treat people in the community, but do not give them proper back-up. Q: What about people who need a hospital bed? Juby says he agrees; there need to be more beds. Q: Would you fight for more mental health beds? Juby says in Medway the Lib Dems have been fighting for more beds. And this is a Lib Dem priority nationally too. Q: What would the Green party do on mental health? Gregory says Reckless is right to say there is no proper management. You need a full-time CEO in charge. The NHS will get worse if TTIP comes in, he says. We must stop that, or we will lose the NHS completely. The NHS has to be taken out of TTIP. And the Health Act must be repealed. Q: But what would you do in the constituency? Gregory says the management is the main issue. Julia George says it is interesting how much emphasis they are putting on health. At the start of the campaign immigration was more of an issue. Q: What could you do to improve the hospital? Khan says she would vote for the bill that stops the privatisation of the health service. Q: It’s not just the hospital, is it? Labour say they would allow people to see a GP within 48 hours. But Labour raised GP salaries, while allowing GPs to opt out of night calls. Khan says when Labour was in power you could see a GP within 48 hours. You cannot now. Labour would hire another 8,000 GPs. It would fund that through a Time to Care fund, raising money from a levy on tobacco firms and a mansion tax. Q: [To Reckless] Did you take your eye off the ball on Medway Maritime hospital? Reckless says there is an alphabet soup of regulators. Ukip would have a single elected health board looking after Medway. That would unify management and oversight. Q: What have you failed to do? Reckless said that, when the Medway hospital went into special measures, he complained that no one was in overall charge. The existing management team was left in place, with no support. Q: What did you do when a chairman was brought in on a part-time basis on a huge salary? Reckless says he said that was unacceptable. Q: Do you ever ask your family about this? Reckless says he talks to his family a lot about this. His brother is a doctor and medical director. George is asking each candidate to give a one minute reason why they should be the MP. Labour’s Naushabah Khan says, as someone born in the constituency, she knows they can get things right. But there are issues to address, like the local hospital. Clive Gregory, the Green candidate, says he has live on the Hoo peninsula for more than 20 years. He is absolutely opposed to the Lodge Hill development. And the Greens have the right stance on other issues too. Ukip’s Mark Reckless says he is putting the Medway hospital at the heart of his campaign. His father was a doctor, his mother was a nurse. He wants a unitary health authority for the area. The Lib Dems’ Geoff Juby says he has lived in Medway for 30 years. He would fight for better health services and better transport. Kelly Tolhurst, the Conservative, says she is the true local candidate. She was born here, went to school here and runs a business here. She wants to bring the hospital out of special measures. It’s a two-horse race. If you don’t want a Ukip MP, vote for me, she says. Julia George is presenting the show. It will last for an hour. She will be asking questions, but also taking questions. You can email her at julia@bbc.co.uk. You can follow the hustings live on BBC Radio Kent here. There are 13 candidates in the Rochester and Strood byelection. The full list is here. The five main ones are taking part in the hustings. They are: Clive Gregory - Green party Geoff Juby - Lib Dems Naushabah Khan - Labour Mark Reckless - Ukip Kelly Tolhurst - Conservative There are three more days of campaigning befoe the Rochester and Strood byelection and this morning the five main candidates are taking part in a hustings being broadcast on BBC Radio Kent. Mark Reckless, the Ukip candidate who triggered the byelection by leaving the Conservatives and resigning as the constitutency’s MP, has been criticised for missing some of the other hustings, but he is taking part today. I’ll cover the whole event live. Here’s the agenda for the day. 9am: BBC Radio Kent Rochester byelection hustings. 10.30am: The libel cases involving Andrew Mitchell, the former Conservative chief whip, and PC Toby Rowland starts at the Royal Courts of Justice. The cases revolve around whether Mitchell did or did not call the police plebs. 11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Theresa May, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3pm: Sir David Higgins, HS2 chairman, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee. As usual, I will be also covering all the breaking political news from Westminster, as well as bringing you the most interesting political comment and analysis from the web and from Twitter. I will post a summary at lunchtime, but I will be wrapping up after that because I’ve got a meeting this afternoon. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jan/16/stuxnet-cyberworm-us-strike-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-16T20:19:00Z","webTitle":"Stuxnet cyberworm heads off US strike on Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/16/stuxnet-cyberworm-us-strike-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jan/16/stuxnet-cyberworm-us-strike-iran","fields":{"headline":"Stuxnet cyberworm heads off US strike on Iran","bodyText":"The chances of a military strike against Iran this year are receding because of the success of a joint Israeli-US cyberattack on the country's nuclear facilities, according to officials and analysts with knowledge of the clandestine operation. The New York Times reported today that Israel, with US help, had set up a model of the Iranian nuclear process at Dimona, the Israeli nuclear arms development centre in the Negev desert, to test a sophisticated destructive programme. A computer worm, Stuxnet, was known last year to have been inserted into the Iranian nuclear operation and Iran admitted its programme had been delayed. What is new is the role of Dimona, where the Israelis are reported to have been spinning nuclear centrifuges virtually identical to Iran's nuclear plant at Natanz, and the extent of involvement by US researchers and intelligence agencies. The centrifuges are used to enrich uranium. Last year, rumours of military action began to be heard louder round Washington, with diplomats and officials warning that this year would be the year of decision on whether to launch a military strike. But the mood has changed. An official told the Guardian that the military option is now less likely, citing not only the cyberattack, but also the synchronised assassination last year of two Iranian nuclear scientists, attributed to Israel. A leading analyst, Avner Cohen, the Washington-based author of Israel and the Bomb and Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb, also told this newspaper: \"In the short term, it surely makes military action less likely. In fact, I do not see any military action against Iran anytime soon. It takes the pressure off. It does not mean military action is off the table, but it is not a short-term concern.\" Cohen, from the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said he believed reports about testing the Stuxnet on centrifuges at Dimona and the involvement of the US were largely accurate. \"It makes good sense to me. It fits what I heard and knew,\" Cohen said. The work at Dimona was carried out over the last two years, though neither Israel nor the US has admitted this. The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said last November that malicious software had created problems in some of Iran's centrifuges, though he insisted the problems had been solved. Meir Dagan, head of the Mossad, the Israeli overseas intelligence agency, gave an unusually upbeat assessment of progress on Iran in a report earlier this month, on the eve of his retirement. He said Iran's nuclear programme had been delayed by at least a year. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, echoed this but she attributed the delay to economic sanctions. According to the New York Times, the Stuxnet worm included one component designed to send Iran's centrifuges spinning out of control and another to record normal operations at the nuclear plant and then play them back so that everything would appear normal while the centrifuges were tearing themselves apart. If true, it would be the biggest cyberattack yet launched anywhere in the world, outstripping those attributed to Russia and China. The idea may have developed from work at the Idaho National Laboratory, part of the US energy department that deals with nuclear arms, which teamed up with international companies such as the German company Siemens to look at the risk from cyberattack. Cohen attributed the close co-operation between Israel and the US to Dagan, who insisted that on the Iranian nuclear issues Israel must co-operate with intelligence organisations such as the CIA and MI6. President George Bush, before leaving office in 2009, approved $300m (£189m) on joint covert projects aimed at Iran, and the Stuxnet was apparently a priority. It may have been responsible for destroying more than 900 centrifuges at Natanz. The combination of the apparent intelligence successes and economic sanctions has increased western diplomats' confidence in talks with Iran this week, which have in the past invariably ended in deadlock. Cohen said: \"For the long run, while it is impossible to predict, my gut feeling is that Iran will not have the full bomb.The only thing that would push Iran to the bomb would be an attack on Iran. I think Iran would ultimately emerge smart enough to avoid confrontation with the world but would insist to keep themselves very close to the bomb, still within the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) claiming the right to a fuel cycle. Whether the west and Israel would be able to live with that, I don't know.\" A pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear sites by the US would likely provoke retaliatory attacks by Iranian \"sleepers\". The London-based thinktank the Legatum Institute, in a report published today, warns that a military strike against Iran could result in retaliation. \"In any strike, Iran would likely retaliate against US soldiers and assets in Afghanistan and Iraq, and might activate sleeper cells to launch al-Qaida-like attacks against the US homeland and in Europe.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/23/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T10:52:30Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Nuclear debate, spring sightings and iconic bike designs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/23/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/23/1","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Nuclear debate, spring sightings and iconic bike designs","bodyText":"Climate and energy • Japan nuclear crisis puts UK public off new power stations • Budget 2011: The key green announcements to watch for • Safety breaches reported at UK nuclear reactors • UK government unveils plans to slash solar feed-in tariffs Wildlife and conservation • Spring is here, say UK nature watchers • Shipwreck threatens penguin colony on South Atlantic island • Lord Clark: Independent panel for conserving forests doesn't look very public • Essex reptiles settle into new Wiltshire home Multimedia • Iconic bicycle designs through the ages – in pictures • The week in wildlife - in pictures • Lammas: The eco-village that lives off the grid - video • Yann Arthus-Bertrand: Looking down on creation Green living • Throwing food away sends world's scarce water gushing down the plughole • What's the greenest way to feed the birds? • Danny Carnegie's innovation: setting up UK Aware • A small town in Germany where recycling pays ...

A day of high tension saw workers battle to save a nuclear plant from meltdown and 50,000 rescuers fight their way to victims in the midst of mud, flood waters, collapsed buildings and continuing blazes. At least 1,700 people were reported dead or missing following the earthquake and tsunami, Kyodo news agency said. Further shocks of up to 6.4 magnitude continued to strike the north-east a day and a half after the major quake. In addition, Kyodo said, 9,500 people could not be contacted in Minami Sanriku in the northern prefecture of Miyagi, around half the population. Japanese broadcaster NHK said 2,700 homes had been destroyed in Arahama, in the same prefecture. Further north, the National Police Agency said 5,000 homes were under water in Rikuzen-Takata, Iwate prefecture. Survivors were reported to be clambering over uprooted trees and overturned cars to reach homes. Rail operators were also searching for four commuter trains that were travelling coastal lines in Miyagi and Iwate when the tsunami struck. The frantic search for survivors was almost overshadowed by the spectre of radioactive leaks at a nuclear power plant at the heart of the area most affected by Friday's earthquake. At the Fukushima plant, radiation leaked from a damaged reactor after an explosion blew the roof off. Japan's nuclear safety agency said the accident was rated less serious than the Three Mile Island or Chernobyl disasters, but up to 160 people were exposed to radiation. Authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's atomic watchdog, they were making preparations to distribute iodine to people living nearby. Iodine can increase resistance against thyroid cancer in the case of radioactive exposure. A 20km evacuation zone was imposed around the plant as authorities moved tens of thousands of residents from the area, some 240km north of Tokyo, as they tried to reduce pressure in the reactors. The IAEA said Japanese authorities had informed it of the explosion and that they were \"assessing the condition of the reactor core\". Early this morning, technicians were battling to relieve pressure in a second reactor at the plant after its cooling system failed. The procedure was expected to release a small amount of radiation. As the first wave of military rescuers began arriving, prime minister Naoto Kan said 50,000 troops had joined rescue and recovery efforts, aided by boats and helicopters. Dozens of countries also offered help; Britain sent a specialist team of search and rescue experts. Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, said: \"Our thoughts are with the people of Japan as they begin to recover from this terrible disaster.\" Barack Obama pledged US assistance following what he called a potentially \"catastrophic\" disaster. In a day of chaos, 300,000 people were evacuated from their homes in the region due to radiation and tsunami fears and quake damage. Two hundred fires had been sparked, including three that still raged in the north-east city of Kesennuma, Kyodo said. In the city of Shiogama, oil was leaking from a refinery into the harbour. Friday's 8.9 magnitude shock, the fifth most powerful quake in a century, appeared to have moved the main island of Japan by three metres and shifted the Earth on its axis, an expert with the US Geological Survey told CNN. As temperatures dropped to freezing in the worst-hit north-east prefectures, survivors huddled in shelters and braced themselves against more tremors. While many remained calm, some clutched friends and sobbed as the extent of the disaster sank in. TV footage showed rescue helicopters winching children and adults to safety from the wreckage. Many could be seen trapped on rooftops. The city of Sendai remained swamped by water. Fishing boats, cars and buildings were stranded across farmland along the north-east coastline. \"Everything is so hard,\" said Kumi Onodera, a 34-year-old local, who described her ordeal as \"like a scene from a disaster movie. The road was moving up and down like a wave. Things were on fire and it was snowing [ash].\" Long queues formed outside shops in towns near the coastline as people cleared shelves of water and food. At least a million people in the north-east of the country were thought to be without drinking water. Five million homes are without power and electricity providers have warned they will need to impose rolling blackouts in parts of Tokyo. There was worldwide consternation at the prospect of a nuclear meltdown in the wake of the Japanese earthquake. Tens of thousands of people took part in an anti-nuclear demonstration in southern Germany. The event had been planned for some time, but after the news of Japan's nuclear emergency, organisers were overwhelmed by some 50,000 people who turned up to take part. The demonstrators, who stretched in a 45km chain from Neckarwestheim power plant to the city of Stuttgart, were demanding that the German government move away from nuclear power. In the UK, energy secretary Chris Huhne said that the government was monitoring the nuclear situation in Japan. \"It's too early to say what the cause was, let alone what the implications are,\" he added. Many in the government and the private energy sector in the UK worry that the raising of the spectre of nuclear disaster will have implications for coalition plans to build 10 new nuclear power stations to replace Britain's ageing reactors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/may/13/liberal-democrats-nuclear-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-13T15:40:23Z","webTitle":"Liberal Democrats abandon manifesto pledge to oppose new nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/13/liberal-democrats-nuclear-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/may/13/liberal-democrats-nuclear-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"Liberal Democrats abandon pledge to oppose new nuclear power stations","bodyText":"The Liberal Democrats have thrown overboard one of their most distinctive election pledges and will not stand in the way of a new generation of nuclear power stations, the new energy minister, Chris Huhne, made clear today. The Lib Dem MP, who had previously described atomic power as a \"failed technology\", said the new coalition government with the Conservatives believed a new construction programme could go ahead as long as it was done without financial support from the state. It would be \"entirely up to the nuclear industry in the first instance because they have to decide whether or not they're able to build nuclear power stations without new public subsidy, and that's the key,\" Huhne explained. Asked whether the U-turn was a major climbdown, the energy minister said in an interview on the BBC's Today programme: \"This is a coalition agreement that has always involved compromise on both sides. There are a whole series of compromises which have been struck in this agreement which I think are obviously unpleasant for each of the parties.\" The Lib Dems had stood out from Labour and Conservative parties in the run up to the general election last week by promising to halt any new atomic power facilities even though they are seen by some as a vital low-carbon tool in the fight against climate change. \"We will say no to a new generation of nuclear power stations; nuclear power is a far more expensive way of reducing carbon emissions than promoting energy conservation and renewable power,\" said the Lib Dems in their manifesto. But under a coalition agreement signed this week, the Lib Dems agreed not to vote against Conservative proposals to build new nuclear power stations to replace the current ageing plants. The payoff for such a compromise was a chance to \"reshape British politics\" and protect the economic recovery, argued Huhne, who said: \"If there is a majority in parliament in favour of a particular proposal … new nuclear will go ahead.\" Britain's nuclear reactors generated about a fifth of the country's electricity in the second quarter of 2009, but all except one of them is due to shut by 2025. With time running out to build a new generation of reactors, the Conservatives announced measures before the election to speed up the planning process to stop protesters from delaying their construction. The new planning system would give parliament direct powers to approve new nuclear power stations. Environmentalists poured scorn on the plans, saying they would never happen. \"Every government since Mrs Thatcher has promised a nuclear renaissance and in 31 years only one new reactor has been built – and that was with massive public subsidies, which this time have been ruled out,\" said Ben Ayliffe, senior energy campaigner at Greenpeace. Huhne said Britain should greatly increase its reliance on renewable energy, such as tidal, wave, solar and wind power, which currently accounts for about only 6% of the total power generated. \"We literally have an abundance of potential renewable energy and yet we have one of the worst records of any country in the European Union for generating electricity from renewables,\" he said, describing the renewable energy share as the former government's \"most scandalous legacy.\" In fact, the pace of change escalated dramatically after Ed Miliband took the reins at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, with offshore wind stations particularly primed for major advances through higher subsidies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2012/aug/18/frank-close-higgs-boson-spies","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-18T09:36:59Z","webTitle":"Frank Close: What I'm thinking about ...

Higgs Boson and nuclear spies","bodyText":"That Higgs Boson. It gives structure to the universe but its discovery, on July 4, has turned my own world upside down. The fourth of July is Independence Day in the US, but there's been no freedom for me since then. I've had to revise my book The Infinity Puzzle – changing future tense and \"maybe\" into past tense and \"is\" – write articles for magazines, give talks, and now appear on stage with Peter Higgs himself in Edinburgh. This was a great pleasure, and fun. Chris Close (no relation) took photos of Peter and me, trying to catch bubbles, which floated in front of us like bosons bubbling out of the vacuum. Having just completed a 5000-word essay, to be titled Bonfire of the Infinities, which will bring the original Infinity Puzzle up to date next year (I will put it on a blog somewhere so no one feels short-changed) I can now have my own Independence Day and get back to what my twitter page, @closefrank, reveals is my current project: Bruno Pontecorvo – a great scientist, but was he also a spy? The centenary of Pontecorvo's birth is next year, so I can't hang about. As a student in the 1930s in Italy he discovered the principle which today underpins nuclear power, and which was important in developing the atomic bomb. He worked on the Manhattan project, developing nuclear reactors in Canada, then moved to Harwell and on August 31 1950, at the height of the cold war and McCarthy's witch hunt, vanished through the iron curtain. Pontecorvo was a communist, and it was no surprise when, five years later, the Soviets revealed that he had been working for them, allegedly on peaceful applications of atomic power, since his defection. For many in the west, the fact that his Harwell colleague, Klaus Fuchs, had been exposed as a spy just months before Pontecorvo fled, had some significance. Some KGB defectors insist that Pontecorvo was spying for them all along, though whether this is fact or just a way to sell exciting books has never been established. I will not give my opinion here, as I am still checking and ferreting, but here is a strand, which might trigger someone's memory. Those of a certain age may recall Peter and Helen Kroger, KGB spies discovered in 1962 to have been living in Ruislip for several years, while running the Portland spy ring. In 1950 they had been spies in the US, but the Soviets exfiltrated them back to Moscow, in a panic following the exposure of Fuchs and other spies, just weeks before Pontecorvo disappeared. A lot was happening in 1950. Perhaps some Guardian reader remembers something from those times, or has insights as to how some of these pieces fit together. What is certain is that by settling in the USSR, Pontecorvo missed out on at least one Nobel prize. He is regarded today in physics as the father of neutrino astronomy – a new branch of science. Having had the seminal ideas, he was unable to carry out the critical experiments himself because of Soviet intransigence. The facilities in USSR weren't adequate, and the Soviets would not allow him to leave the country to perform the experiment at Cern. All that he could do was write up the ideas – in Russian. By the time his paper had been translated into English, and appeared in the west, 18 months had elapsed, during which three scientists in the US had independently come up with the same idea, performed the experiment, and subsequently won the Nobel. There are other examples of how Pontecorvo's scientific career was limited by his decision – whether voluntary or forced – to settle in the USSR in 1950. If he was a spy, he paid a heavy personal price, far greater than did those who were exposed as spies at the time. Had he stayed in the west it is likely that his name would be known for great science, not for a fateful event at the end of August in 1950. Whether he would be a household name, like Peter Higgs, we shall never know. But I must get on with my Pontecorvo research, because the Nobel prize for physics is announced in October, and should Stockholm choose a prominent scientist from Edinburgh, it's likely that my days will return again to writing more articles, and giving further popular talks. Meanwhile, though, if anyone has any leads that speed me on my way to Pontecorvo, please get in contact with me at f.close@physics.ox.ac.uk.

A member of the Iranian delegation has accused negotiators from the so-called P5+1 group – the US, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany – of creating a \"difficult atmosphere\". \"What we heard in Istanbul was more interesting … We believe the reason P5+1 is not able to reach a result is America,\" the official told Reuters. Western officials, however, claimed the fact that a substantive discussion about Iran's nuclear activities had taken place at all was a sign of progress and, barring a walkout by the Iranian delegation, should be enough to carry the talks through another round in the next few weeks, once the delegations had consulted their capitals. A US official said there had been a \"fair amount of disagreement\" but also areas of common ground, adding: \"I believe we have the beginning of a negotiation.\" At the talks in the Iraqi capital, the P5+1 group presented a set of proposals by which Iran would stop producing 20%-enriched uranium, which is technically close to weapons grade material, and ship its stockpile out of the country. Iran would also stop operations at an underground enrichment plant at Fordow. In return, Iran would receive fuel plates for its research reactor in Tehran, safety advice and equipment for the Tehran reactor and its nuclear power station in Bushehr, and would be able to buy spare parts for its civilian airliners, currently blocked by sanctions. The Iranian team, led by the country's chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, demanded that sanctions should be eased in return for concessions over enrichment. Jalili was in particular looking for a postponement of an EU oil embargo, due to take effect on 1 July. Iran's state-run news agency, Irna, called the package Iran was offered \"outdated, not comprehensive, and unbalanced\". Jalili pointed to the fact that he was close to an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on a fresh round of inspections, which Iran says will demonstrate it does not have a weapons programme. While the six-nation group welcomed the news, it argued it did not have a direct bearing on the Baghdad talks, which are focused on enrichment. After a session that continued into the early hours of Thursday, Jalili held a bilateral meeting with his counterpart, Catherine Ashton, the EU high representative for foreign policy who acts as a convener for the six-nation group, before a final plenary meeting. Reports from Baghdad said the plenary meeting briefly broke up to allow consultations among the six national delegations and with Tehran. Rumours of Iranian threats to walk out of the negotiations could not be confirmed. The talks are aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the long-running crisis over Iran's nuclear aspirations, and forestalling an Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jun/06/zac-goldsmith-ecologist-sale","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-06T14:18:02Z","webTitle":"Zac Goldsmith sells the Ecologist for £1","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/06/zac-goldsmith-ecologist-sale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jun/06/zac-goldsmith-ecologist-sale","fields":{"headline":"Zac Goldsmith sells the Ecologist for £1","bodyText":"After 42 years of lawsuits from GM companies, campaigns against nuclear power, and breastfeeding tips, the Goldsmith family has sold the Ecologist magazine for £1. The magazine, which has been solely online since 2009, will now return to print and incorporated into the 45 year old Resurgence magazine. Editor Satish Kumar described the new title, Resurgence &amp; The Ecologist, as \"a marriage made in heaven\". Zac Goldsmith, the Ecologist's owner and former editor, said: \"The Ecologist has spearheaded social, scientific and political ecology while Resurgence has spearheaded cultural and artistic ecology. Now the time has come to bring these two aspects of the environmental movement together by merging Resurgence and the Ecologist.\" Eight to 10 pages of the magazine, published six times a year, will be dedicated to Ecologist content, but \"the flavour of the Ecologist will go right through the magazine,\" said Kumar. The magazine was making losses in millions and was financially propped up by the Goldsmiths since its foundation. Discussion for selling the brand began in April and a deal finalised within two months. The Ecologist archive is now being migrated to Resurgence. The Ecologist headquarters will be relocated to Devon and staff redundancies will be decided after consultation, Kumar said. He said financial pressure appear to be the reason behind the sale, with Goldsmiths spending £500,000 a year on the magazine. Zac Goldsmith's personal fortune is estimated between £200-300m. The Ecologist was founded in 1970 by the visionary Teddy Goldsmith in the midst of the global wave of awareness that led to the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Environment. That year Goldsmith devoted a whole issue to his 'Blueprint for Survival' which began: \"The principal defect of the industrial way of life with its ethos of expansion is that it is not sustainable\". The blueprint sold thousands of copies and in its wake PEOPLE, the original incarnation of the UK Green party, was founded. The Ecologist has always retained its serious reputation, and has been involved in some notable campaigns. In 1998 the magazine's printers pulped the entire run of an edition critical of Monsanto; it was eventually printed elsewhere and became one of their best-selling editions. In recent years it has run hard-hitting exposés of US mega-dairies and animal rights issues. A recent investigation into links between Coca-Cola and cheap migrant labour in Italy became an international issue. More recently the website ran a special series of articles on breastfeeding around the world. The website was getting about 200,000 unique page views a month. Kumar hopes the \"merger\" can bring together the best of both magazines.\"The spirituality and strength of Resurgence, with the campaigning and politics of the Ecologist,\" he said. The first joint issue will be launched in September at a special event featuring Green Party leader Caroline Lucas, economist Richard Layard and environmentalist Jonathan Porritt among others. Pat Thomas, Ecologist editor between 2007 and 2009, said: \"There's a real sadness about it, although perhaps it will work out in the end. But no matter how you phrase it, it will be a loss. Part of the Ecologist's strength came from being independent.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jan/03/china-claims-new-nuclear-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-03T18:31:46Z","webTitle":"China claims new nuclear technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/03/china-claims-new-nuclear-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jan/03/china-claims-new-nuclear-technology","fields":{"headline":"China claims new nuclear technology","bodyText":"China's ambitions to lead the world in nuclear power were boosted today by reports that its scientists had mastered a key technique in the reprocessing of spent uranium. State media claimed the technology overcame a supply bottleneck and ensured China would have sufficient nuclear fuel for at least 3,000 years. The breakthrough would be a boon to the domestic industry, which is in the early stages of what looks likely to be the most spectacular burst of reactor-building in world history. Due to surging demand for energy and growing concerns about pollution, China's nuclear-power generating capacity is projected to increase up to tenfold in the next 10 years. By 2030 China could be on course to overtake the US as the world's leading atomic energy producer. The technology, developed and tested at the number 404 factory of the China National Nuclear Corporation, situated in the Gobi desert, enables recycling of irradiated fuel, according to China Central Television. How this differs from existing reprocessing methods in other countries is unclear, but the state broadcaster said that with this technique a kilo of uranium could produce close to 60 times more power than was now possible in China. If proven this method would extend the \"usage life\" of the 171,400 tonnes of the country's known uranium deposits, which previously were forecast to last less than 70 years. Reprocessing can also provide fissile material for weapons, though details have not yet been disclosed about the potential impact on China's nuclear arsenal. China first tested an atomic bomb in 1964, but it was slow to adopt nuclear power because of the cheapness and abundance of domestic coal, and the government was reluctant to depend on expensive foreign technology and uranium imports. But in recent years growing wealth and shifting environmental priorities have prompted a change. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, China now has 13 operating reactors and 26 more facilities under construction. China National Nuclear Corporation said last year it planned to invest 800bn yuan (£78bn) in the industry by 2020. China has already been replicating the technology of its foreign suppliers and is moving to design its own reactors and reprocessing plants. The next step is construction and overseas sales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/mar/14/japan-disaster-lng-gas-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T18:56:53Z","webTitle":"Japan's nuclear crisis could force up LNG prices for years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/14/japan-disaster-lng-gas-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/mar/14/japan-disaster-lng-gas-uk","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear crisis forces up UK gas prices","bodyText":"Energy experts have warned that UK energy bills could increase after the Japan earthquake triggered an increase in natural gas prices. The cost of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which accounted for nearly a third of Britain's gas supply last winter, has risen sharply since Friday's disaster knocked out 11 of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors. The price for a summer delivery of LNG to the UK rose by 6.4% per therm on Monday, with a winter delivery climbing by 5.8%. Adam Forsyth, analyst at Matrix Group, said: \"If the price rises and is consistently at a high level then it has to come through to people's gas bills eventually.\" Forsyth added that LNG cargo ships can be diverted away from their original destinations at short notice and that appears to have been the case with Japan, which has requested extra shipments in the wake of last week's disaster to cover the shortfall in nuclear-generated electricity. In an ominous precedent for UK homeowners, Forsyth said a smaller earthquake that hit the Niigata region of Japan in 2007 and shut down the world's largest nuclear power plant helped cause a gas price spike that lasted several years. Japan is the world's largest importer of LNG. However, analysts at Inenco, an energy consultancy, said rolling power blackouts in Japan are lowering energy demands. \"The potential need to source LNG to compensate for loss of nuclear output could be mitigated by lower demand levels as the country's infrastructure begins to be rebuilt,\" said Inenco. Nonetheless, the nuclear industry plays an important role in Japan, supplying 30% of the country's electricity. The quake could have a long-term effect on nuclear energy and demand for greener fuels such as LNG, with Senator Joe Lieberman, who chairs the US Senate's homeland security panel, urging the United States to \"put the brakes on\" new nuclear power plants until the impact of explosions at the Fukushima plant became clear. Analysts speculated that solar and wind-energy projects will be long-term beneficiaries from the Fukushima incidents. High energy prices and the recent harsh winter have already pushed UK gas prices to record levels. Household gas bills for December were the highest to date at an average of £227 as the cold weather added about £44 to each bill. Even before the impact of severe weather, the charity National Energy Action had estimated that more than one in five households were in fuel poverty – defined as a household that spends more than a 10th of its disposable income on energy bills.

Back then in 2007, construction work was already many years behind schedule and the relationship between the Iranians and the Russian engineers building Bushehr was clearly tense. On the side of the reactor wall, someone had scrawled, in Russian: \"Everything passes and we will get past this.\" Eventually perhaps, but the Russian technicians are going to be there for some time yet. Today, Iran confirmed a UN report that it will have to remove the uranium fuel rod assemblies from the reactor core, a significant setback. The reactor has been under construction since the Shah's era in the 1970's. The fuel assemblies were finally introduced into the reactor four months ago and it was meant to start producing electricity in January, but that deadline was missed. Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Tehran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the ISNA news agency that the fuel was being removed on Russian advice: Based on Russia's request to run tests and technical measures, the fuel will be unloaded from the core of the reactor and will be returned to it after completion of the tests Reuters quotes a source \"close to the project\" as saying the fuel may have been contaminated by the old and deteriorating metal equipment used in the construction of the reactor core. We're talking about particles of about 3 millimeters in size. Some of the equipment used in the construction has been sitting around for 30 years. The fuel has to be unloaded and examined to make sure no metal particles have gotten into it. The problem was first reported on Friday in the latest quarterly report on Iran's nuclear programme by the International Atomic Energy Agency (downloadable here courtesy of the Institute for Science and International Security, ISIS) In the 'Other Matters' section towards the end, it briefly notes: On 23 February 2011, Iran informed the Agency that it would have to unload fuel assemblies from the core, and the Agency and Iran have agreed on the necessary safeguards measures. The Iranians have been on record as saying that the Bushehr plant was affected by the Stuxnet computer worm, which is widely believed to have been a joint venture in cyber warfare by the US and Israel. But the initial signs are that Stuxnet has not played a part in this setback. Before Soltanieh spoke, ISIS provided an instant analysis of the IAEA report, saying it had learned that: the unloading may be motivated by concerns about the possible sabotage of the fuel assemblies or defective fuel assemblies. David Albright, who runs ISIS, told the New York Times: It raises questions of whether Iran can operate a modern nuclear reactor safely...The stakes are very high. You can have a Chernobyl-style accident with this kind of reactor, and there's lots of questions about that possibility in the region. The other interesting line from the IAEA report comes in the \"Possible Military Dimensions\" section, which is quite toughly worded and suggests that the agency has been given new evidence of weaponisation. The relevant passage reads: Moreover, based on the Agency's analysis of additional information which has come to its attention since August 2008, including new information recently received, there are further concerns which the Agency also needs to clarify with Iran ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/gallery/2011/mar/24/fukushima-nuclear-plant-in-pictures","type":"gallery","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-24T15:09:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear plant emergency: week two - in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/mar/24/fukushima-nuclear-plant-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/gallery/2011/mar/24/fukushima-nuclear-plant-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear plant emergency: week two - in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2011/mar/14/technology-links-newsbucket","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"The Technology newsbucket: sorry Bing, fast iPads, nuclear facts and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/mar/14/technology-links-newsbucket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2011/mar/14/technology-links-newsbucket","fields":{"headline":"The Technology newsbucket: sorry Bing, fast iPads, nuclear facts and more","bodyText":"A burst of 7 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Why I am not worried about Japan's nuclear reactors &gt;&gt; Dr Josef Oehmen Oehmen is a research scientist at MIT: \"I am writing this text (Mar 12) to give you some peace of mind regarding some of the troubles in Japan, that is the safety of Japan's nuclear reactors.

Now they think they can find life on Mars. Comic and cosmologist Dara Ó Briain, along with his co-presenter, the physicist Professor Brian Cox, are back on our television screens this month for a third year of the successful BBC2 project Stargazing Live. Tapping into the swell of interest in the heavens, the three programmes are accompanied by live events, talks and exhibitions at towns, schools and cities all over the UK and, if past years are anything to go by, bringing with it a peak in sales of telescopes, star charts and astronomy books. And after a year in which one of the single biggest events was the successful, if nerve-jangling, touchdown of the Mars Science Laboratory, aka Curiosity, on the surface of the red planet, Ó Briain said Mars was an obvious focus for this year's first episode. \"We're stationed at the Nasa Jet Propulsion Lab to talk about their Curiosity Rover,\" he said. \"We'll be talking about Mars and in a similar vein to last year's 'crowd-sourcing' project – where we turned the raw data from an exoplanet search over to the public, got a million graphs examined in three days and managed to locate a brand new planet that was duly called Threapleton-Holmes B after the punters who discovered it. \"We're turning over similar raw data in the search for traces of water, and thus, hopefully, life on Mars,\" he said. The most advanced piece of hardware ever to set foot-wheel on another world, Curiosity is equipped with an array of cameras, geological tools to scoop up soil, and even a high-powered laser that can be aimed at rocks to work out their composition. It also has its own Twitter account with more than a million followers. The photographs being sent back, including the high resolution ones it took of itself with the Mars Hand Lens Imager, have been gripping the imagination of amateur astronomers all over the world as well as in the UK. The clarity of the images being sent back by modern space exploration modules straight to Nasa's websites and others is undoubtedly another new element to astronomy that is enthralling huge numbers of people but Ó Briain believes it's the very simplicity of how to get involved with astronomy that is its appeal. \"I've always felt the appeal of the show is a complex matrix of, firstly, how ludicrously easy it is to get involved at the most basic level – after all, you just walk out the door and look up. Springwatch can't promise you a badger at the end of every garden but, cloud cover permitting, Stargazing Live can offer tickets to the oldest show in town to anyone who wants to throw on a scarf. \"Secondly, the epic and fundamental nature of what's happening above us. Creation and destruction on a mind-boggling scale; stars forming from giant clouds of dust and gas, other stars burning out and going supernova, black holes being formed. Then we even throw in Brian Cox's delightful hair! \"For me the appeal is having the opportunity to ask questions on a telly show of people who genuinely know what they're talking about. Seriously, what's not to like?\" Ó Briain, who studied theoretical physics and maths at university in Dublin, said they had been astounded by the success of the show, the latest and most successful of a series of TV and radio shows covering science and the universe that have seen sales of telescopes more than double from 2010. He said: \"The viewing figures for the show have always been quite astounding, topping four million on average last year, but probably the most flattering statistic we've had, apart from how we cleared Amazon out of planispheres by the end of the first show on series one, was the huge surge in applications for university astronomy and physics courses. \"I heard figures like 40% up in astronomy and 17% up in physics. While I don't at all claim Stargazing Live is the reason for this, it's amazing to see this happening now.\" While the show is the latest in several science series that are helping to fuel this passion for the stars in a new generation, much of the credit must go to the scientific community, said Dr Helen Jamison, deputy director of the Science Media Centre. \"In the past four or five years there has been a renewed engagement effort: scientists have been talking about their work and are genuinely excited about it and finding ways to communicate that, which has not always been the case, and there has been some excellent media work too and it's paying off,\" Jamison said. She has just signed herself up for an astronomy GCSE, an exam that faced being scrapped before a surge of interest from schools and adult education centres in the past few years. There are now three online sites offering tutoring in the GCSE course to adults and more than 3,000 children taking the exam at 250 schools. Astronomy apps on phones and tablets are another technological development making the science more accessible as well as the internet and the stunning images of the universe that are available from any search engine. Nine regional Science Learning Centres around the country are another example of the funding that is now available after a panic at the decline of subjects such as physics in schools at the beginning of the decade. The availability of physics courses at universities and girls studying science remain an issue in the midst of all this enthusiasm but scientists are hopeful this will change. Ó Briain said: \"Astronomy is controversial but not in the way that nuclear power or swine flu is – it's something where amateurs and professionals can be engaged in a conversation. It's something that everybody can do: just walk out of your back door and look up, there it all is. It's a really great way to put things in perspective if you've had a bad day at the office.\" In south-west Scotland, near Dumfries, has been created one of only four \"dark skies\" national parks in the world. Part of the 300 square miles of Forestry Commission-owned Galloway Forest Park, where the light pollution that colours the skies and blocks out the stars above so many of our cities is controlled, won its designation in 2009 by the International Dark Sky Association and is already having to revamp its visitor centres to cope with the burgeoning numbers of stargazers coming for an uninhibited view of the night skies. And this year is set to be a lively one for stargazers – not only with Curiosity and two comets set to streak through the skies of the northern hemisphere, but also a solar maximum due (the period of greatest activity during the sun's 11-year cycle) that will mean the aurora borealis could be visible in the UK. As the late Sir Patrick Moore, who presented the first edition of The Sky at Night on BBC television in 1957 and urged those who had no access to a telescope to \"pick up binoculars\", put it: \"The amateur astronomer can make a real contribution to the science. It is a truly wonderful hobby.\" It is certainly a hobby with scope – last week astronomers estimated that at least 100 billion planets populate the galaxy. A team from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, made the estimate while analysing planets orbiting a star called Kepler-32 – planets that are representative, they say, of the majority in the galaxy and thus serve as a perfect case study for understanding how most planets form. \"There's at least 100 billion planets in the galaxy – just our galaxy,\" said John Johnson from Caltech. \"That's mind-boggling.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/17/row-nuclear-waste-dump-proposal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-17T16:44:06Z","webTitle":"Row over nuclear waste dump proposal in Kent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/17/row-nuclear-waste-dump-proposal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/17/row-nuclear-waste-dump-proposal","fields":{"headline":"Row over nuclear waste dump proposal in Kent","bodyText":"A furious row has broken out among local politicians over a proposal to build a nuclear waste dump in Kent. Romney Marshes is being mooted as a site for Britain's first store for high-level radioactive materials by members of Shepway district council but the move has infuriated the leader of Kent county council and a local MP. \"Let's not sell Romney Marsh short; I believe it has and deserves a better future than being the dumping ground for all of Britain's high level nuclear waste,\" said Damian Collins, MP for Folkestone and Hythe, on his own website. \"Shepway council has started a consultation to ask whether residents want to find out more about building this underground storage facility here and my view, and that of the Marsh's county councillor Carole Waters, is that the answer should be 'no'.\" Paul Carter, leader of Kent council, told a local website, thisiskent, it would be \"utter madness\" to even consider building such a facility in an area which he said was \"both an earthquake zone and one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world\". The government is keen to see the development of a deep-level waste repository as it tries to press ahead with a new generation of atomic reactors to generate lower carbon electricity. Currently some local authorities in Cumbria, close to the UK's biggest nuclear site at Sellafield, are the only ones to open a local debate about whether the high level waste should be buried there. But Shepway council, already home to reactors at nearby Dungeness, has now sent letters out to 10,000 local residents asking them for their views. David Godfrey, a supporter of nuclear power and one of the local councillors behind the mailout, told the Guardian that the potential scheme had been discussed as a way of creating jobs after discovering that there was little chance of any new reactors being built at Dungeness. \"We are not saying there should be a waste repository, we are just asking people whether they would like to explore the possibility. If they say \"no\" then that will be the end of it,\" he said. Asked about the negative reactions from some other local politicians, Godfrey said others were entitled to their views although he was \"not quite sure where some of the sensational views are coming from\". A website has been set up by Shepway council giving information on the proposal for a Romney Marshes Nuclear Research and Disposal Facility. Members of the public are informed that they should make their view known to the council by 20 July. The website lists both the pros and the cons. The prospect for creating jobs at a time when the Dungeness power stations are on their way out is emphasised but local residents are also warned there could be \"possible adverse health impacts\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2014/sep/24/labour-conference-ed-milibands-morning-interviews-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-24T15:18:45Z","webTitle":"Labour conference: shadow cabinet meets to discuss air strikes - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/sep/24/labour-conference-ed-milibands-morning-interviews-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2014/sep/24/labour-conference-ed-milibands-morning-interviews-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Labour conference: shadow cabinet meets to discuss air strikes - as it happened","bodyText":"Ed Miliband is about to chair a meeting of the shadow cabinet to discuss whether Labour should support Britain taking part in air strikes against Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq. (See 4.10pm.) Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, has told the Labour conference that progressives can win elections fighting for radical change. (See 3.51pm.) Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has criticised Andy Burnham for not apologising for the Mid-Staffs hospital scandal in his conference speech. Hunt said: Once again at Labour conference the most important part of a speech was forgotten - Andy Burnham failed to apologise for, or even mention, the tragic events at Mid Staffs. We will only improve the NHS if we are honest about terrible problems which happened because of a target culture Labour have never taken responsibility for. Harriet Harman, Labour’s deputy leader, has closed the conference with a speech saying the party can out-organise the Conservatives, even if it can’t outspend them. We know we are going to face the fight of our lives and the Tories are awash with money. - a lot of it in Roubles. They may be able to outspend us, but they will never out organise us. We can’t match their millionaires and oligarchs, but they will never match our unity and determination. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The shadow cabinet will be meeting shortly in Manchester to discuss air strikes against Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq. My colleague Patrick Wintour has sent me this. Shadow cabinet was meeting in an unexpected emergency session in Manchester to discuss whether to support air strikes in Iraq in light of notificaiton from Downing Street that it would like to recall parliament later this week. The recall will not go ahead unless and until Labour makes clear it will support air strikes in Iraq. Labour has said it supports the air strikes undertake in Syria by America so far, but it has called for a UN Security Council resolution before strikes inside Syria. Shadow cabinet sources said the meeting is likely to focus on whether to support air strikes in Syria at this stage given the doubts about its legality, and the absence of a viable ground force inside Syria that can combat IS, but does not lead to a strengthening of President Assad. If the shadow cabinet agrees to support UK involvement in the air strikes in Iraq, David Cameron will seek a recall of parliament. Normally 48 hours is required for parliament to be recalled, but these rules can be waived. Bill de Blasio, the leftish Democrat who was elected New York mayor last year, told the Labour party that progressives could win power on a transformative agenda. It was a long, elegant speech, and it’s being said that de Blasio has performed rather better than Ed Miliband did yesterday. Here are some of the key points. De Blasio said that his own victory showed that candidates committed to real change could win. In the lead-up to the election for New York City Mayor last year, the voices of the status quo gave voters another false choice: support MY candidacy … OR vote for someone with a real shot at winning. Well, I am here before you today because the people of New York City rejected the lazy logic of false–choice politics. He said voters were won over by his campaign for fairness. Not only were other candidates for mayor better known, they espoused ideas that were seen as more politically practical, hewing to the familiarity of the status quo. But it was never my intention to nibble around the edges with policies of timid maintenance; I ran to take dead aim at the crisis of our time. And I became Mayor because everyday New Yorkers, too, were hungry for a clean break from the status quo. Our campaign was powered by people of every race, every age, every income bracket. And yes, even many New Yorkers who had enjoyed great success joined our fight against rising inequality. They wanted the next generation of New Yorkers to have the same opportunities the city had given them. We were a small group, at first, but as New Yorkers learned that we were fighting for a government that would represent their values - fairness, justice, real opportunity for all – our campaign grew. And grew… And grew. We worked – together – as activists, to spread the word. And so, in living rooms and parks… on Twitter and Facebook… people were hearing from one another for the first time things they already knew in their own hearts to be true… and they were learning the power that could come when they themselves spoke out. That is how in a matter of months we went from a few hundred souls gathered on that blustery Brooklyn day, to not just winning, but winning big on election day. He said progressive politics would benefit everyone. There is little basis for glib assertion from the Conservatives that a progressive agenda is narrow in terms of whose lives it would improve. The opposite is true. Mounting inequality creates ripple effects that undermine our whole societies. Here’s just one example of how: The Financial Times recently concluded that the income gap between America’s richest and poorest metropolitan regions is not only the widest it has ever been, but that this phenomenon was quote “shaping an uneven housing recovery that threatens to hold back the broader revival of the world’s largest economy.” In an increasingly interconnected world, a system grounded in exclusivity is not sustainable for anyone, including those at the very top. But that also means a progressive agenda has the power to help everyone, whether your opponents acknowledge it or not. He said progressive politics would prevail in the end. The right side of history can feel like a lonely place. But it isn’t. It never has been. Rather, history itself tells us that people gravitate towards decency, inclusion and progress. And you don’t have to look back thousands of years to see that – go walk around the streets of Manchester… Go to a school, a church, a mosque… You can see the trust people put in one another every day; the value people place in simple moral action. He praised Labour lavishly. I cannot imagine a more appropriate backdrop for this gathering because yours is a party born out of working people attaining the right to vote … a party that exists to fight for working families and forcefully address their needs. Labour has inclusiveness and progressiveness coded in its DNA … Yours is a party grounded in the idea that everyone’s voice matters …. And that no one should be left behind. This Labour Party is led by a new generation of progressive leaders and defined by bold ideas. You stand ready to act with a plan for a fairer, more prosperous United Kingdom …. and to fight for an economy ... a country … that works for working people. It’s almost over; within an hour, the Labour conference will be over. So, what have we learnt? It’s been harder than usual answering that question, because the conference has been overshadowed so much by other news stories, but here goes. 1 - Parties should never hold a conference immediately after an independence referendum. Not ever. Ever at all. The Scottish campaign seems to have sucked the life out of this event, with the result that it has been the least energised Labour party conference for some years. Partly that’s because the aftermath of the referendum dominated the news agenda over the weekend, but it’s also because senior figures in the party were so engaged with Scotland over the last fortnight that they they gave the conference less attention than usual. Also, compared to the enormity of what was at stake last week, the conference proceedings seemed relatively inconsequential. 2 - Labour is going to need a better answer to the West Lothian question. Going into a general election campaign, parties need robust answers to the tricky questions they are going to face day after day from opponents and the media. With David Cameron determined to make “Why should Scottish MPs vote on English-only laws?” a key Conservative issue, Labour will be vulnerable unless it can construct a stronger response than the vague and evasive “complicated issue, constitutional convention next autumn” line that it has been deploying all this week. 3 - And Labour has now realised it has a serious problem in Scotland too. Many MPs and activists at the conference travelled from England or Wales to Scotland to campaign in the referendum and they came back alarmed at how feeble the party’s machine is in some areas. The SNP managed to persuade a large proportion of Labour supporters to vote yes and this could damage the party badly if those voters don’t return in 2015. One of the most worrying statistics for Labour this week was Peter Kellner’s assertion that an 8% swing to the SNP in Scotland would cost Labour 19 seats. 4 - Ed Miliband is relying hugely on the NHS to win him the election. Labour has a comfortable lead over the Conservatives on the NHS and over the last year the party has increasingly been talking it up as an election issue. Now Miliband has made it clear it’s Labour’s trump card. The NHS funding announcement easily overshadowed all others. 5 - Labour has finally resolved its dilemma over whether to fight the election on a grand vision, or a narrow offer – and it’s a bit of a fudge. As Jon Cruddas acknowledged at a conference fringe, there has been tension in the party between those wanting to fight the election offering bold plans to reshape the economy, and those happier with a more cautious offer and waiting for the government to muck up. On balance, the gradualists have seen off the visionaries, although there’s been something of a compromise. Ed Miliband did offer a 10-year prospectus for the future, but his policy proposals fall well short of re-ordering capitalism and his key announcement was a conventional, old-fashioned spending commitment, funded by tax raid on “baddies” (the rich and cigarette companies). 6 – Labour is more aware of the threat posed by Ukip than ever before. Miliband’s focus in his speech on the people who feel the system does not work for them shows that he has some understanding of what is driving Ukip support, and speakers at the conference repeatedly attacked the party in very strong terms. But Labour has not found a reliable strategy for containing Ukip, and there are two forthcoming elections – the Heywood and Middleton by-election and South Yorkshire police commissioner by-election – where Labour frontrunners are seen as very vulnerable to a Ukip challenge. 7 - Miliband is now more confident than ever about not offering an in/out referendum on the EU. At one stage it was said that one of Miliband’s biggest dilemmas was whether or not to promise an in/out referendum. He resolved that some time ago, virtually ruling that out, but now a position that was seen as a potential liability is something Labour is actually quite proud of. Being anti-referendum is one of Labour’s best pro-business policies, and the party even gave the Airbus boss, Robin Southwell, a speaking slot on the platform to make that point. 8 - Labour is not confident of winning a clear majority. The mood here is far from despondent, but it is hardly upbeat either, and there is considerable uncertainty about what will happen next May. 9 - But Labour is arguably the most unified of all three main political parties. Anyone looking for splits this week will have been disappointed. Miliband’s leadership is not an issue (at least until after the election), the unions back the leadership, the New Labourites have faded and the only real argument that broke out this week, about English devolution, was muted. The Tories are far more divided, on issues like Scotland and Europe, and the Lib Dems have not resolved where they go after 2015. 10 - Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham would be the key candidates in a leadership contest if Miliband stood down next year. The final day of the conference is normally quite low key, but this morning there were powerful speeches from Cooper and Burnham and it felt a little like a very premature leadership hustings. A poll of candidates earlier this week found that Cooper and Burnham were the two leading candidates to succeed Miliband (pdf), and events on the conference hall have probably confirmed this. Ed Miliband is now introducing Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, to address the conference. I’ll summarise de Blasio’s speech when I’ve seen the text. In the meantime, here’s an article from LabourUncut saying Labour should “avoid getting too carried away by de Blasio’s lofty rhetoric”. Ed Miliband has said he is “open to the possibility” of supporting Britain getting involved in air strikes against Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq. (See 9.42am.) Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has said that Ed Miliband’s failure to discuss the economy in his speech yesterday was a “glaring omission.” Miliband has conceded he forgot a key section of his big conference speech tackling the issue of reducing Britain’s deficit, saying it was one of the perils of speaking without the help of a teleprompter. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has said Labour would halt Home Office plans to axe a further 1,100 police officer jobs next year and set up a new national refuge fund to help victims of domestic violence. The full text of her speech is here. Cooper has said Labour would act to stop the use of slave labour in international company supply chains. She told the conference. We need to do more to stop the criminals trading in humanity here and across the world. To stop clothing woven with the sweat of slaves reaching our fashion rails. Seafood stained with the blood of slaves reaching our supermarket shelves. The government’s modern slavery bill doesn’t go nearly far enough. There can be no half measures. A Labour government will demand action from major companies throughout their international supply chains. It’s time to stamp out this evil trade. Cooper has said Labour would change deportation rules “to make it easier to send home EU citizens who commit crimes”. She said Ukip could not be trusted on immigration because leaving the EU would “make it harder to get France to sort out the Calais crisis”. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, has said David Cameron will face a day of reckoning with the electorate for “trashing” the NHS without the public’s permission. A Survation poll has shown that 72% of people support Labour’s plan to raise £2.5bn for the NHS using taxes against tobacco companies and mansions as well as closing loopholes. Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, used his speech to the conference to say that Labour will make voting easier. Here are the points. Khan said Labour would “overhaul our democracy’ to make voting easier. Labour will overhaul our democracy. Making it as easy as possible for people to vote. Transforming elections so that voting is in tune with the busy lives people lead. Holding elections at weekends to raise turnout. Polling opened a week in advance to allow early voting. Electronic voting, making sure it’s affordable and isn’t open to abuse. Seeing 16 and 17 year olds vote last week in their thousands was inspiring. Fuelled by schools and colleges holding mock elections and debates. Conference, votes for 16 and 17 year olds is an idea whose time has come. He challenged the government to legislate now to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the next general election. He said Winston Churchill would be sacked from a Conservative government today because he was an “enlightened” Tory who supported the European convention on human rights. I’m so appalled by Tory plans to abolish the Human Rights Act and walk away from the European Convention of Human Rights. They want to strip people of their rights and make our justice system the preserve of the rich. Tories rubbing their hands at the prospect of governments free to ride roughshod over the sick, the elderly, the disabled and the vulnerable. Enlightened Tories who get this, like Dominic Grieve, have been sacked. Forgetting that without enlightened Tories like Winston Churchill, Europe wouldn’t have the human rights we have today. If Churchill were a minister today, David Cameron would have sacked him for his views on human rights. Showing how you can’t trust the Tories to protect people’s rights. Andy Burnham received a better reception for his speech than any other member of the shadow cabinet has done. The first standing ovation came only about one minute in. No issue has such a strong hold on the emotions of Labour conference as the NHS, and there are very few people who can celebrate it as passionately as the shadow health secretary. His speech did not contain much detail, and there was little acknowledgment of the harsh funding constraints a Labour government would face, but as a battle cry, it was a great success. One journalist colleague who heard it came out of the hall talking about Burnham as a future leader. Here’s the full text. And here are the key points. Burnham said Labour was proposing new support for carers. I can announce today a big change in the way the NHS supports carers so they can keep going. No longer invisible but at the very centre of this new service. So today we announce new support for carers: protected funding for carer’s breaks; the right to ask for an annual health check; help with hospital car parking for carers; and we will go further. We will give all families the right to care in their home, if they want it. He said he wanted to end “the scandal that is care of older and vulnerable people in England in 2014”. I ask you this: how much longer will we say that people who are so frail that they need help with getting up, washing and eating, and who suffer from loneliness and isolation, are only worth a slap-dash 15 minute visit? How much longer will society send out the message to young people looking after someone else’s mum, dad, brother or sister that it is the lowest form of work, lower than the minimum wage because it doesn’t pay the travel time between the 15 minute visits? How much longer will we see these shameful scenes from care homes on our TV screens of people being shouted at or abused and not say enough is enough? And for how much longer, in this the century of the ageing society, will we allow a care system in England to be run as a race to the bottom, making profits off the backs of our most vulnerable? He also recalled how he became determined to tackle this issue after finding his gran in her care home with her knuckle raw where someone had stolen her engagement ring. He said Labour would reverse the coalition’s market reforms for the NHS. We will free the NHS from Cameron’s market and, yes, repeal his toxic Health and Social Care Act. We will ask hospitals to collaborate once again and reinstate the NHS as our preferred provider. The public NHS, protected with Labour. Not for sale. Not now, not ever. He confirmed that Labour would integrate health and social care. We will ask hospital trusts and other NHS bodies to evolve into NHS integrated care organisations, working from home to hospital coordinating all care - physical, mental and social. Why? Because it makes no sense to cut simple support in people’s homes only to spend thousands keeping them in hospital. Under Labour, people caring from someone with long-term needs would only deal with one team, he said. No longer should frail or vulnerable people be shunted around the system, from ambulance to A&amp;E to noisy ward. Instead, this team will come to you. Its goal will be to keep you in your own home, safe and well. You and your carers will have one person to call to get help so no longer telling the same story over and over again. You will have a care plan personal to you and your family. He said Labour would look at getting private health providers to contribute “their fair share” towards the cost of training. He said under the coalition the NHS was “on the brink”. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is addressing the conference now. I’ll post the highlights from his speech in a moment. Delegates are debating health this morning. The most moving speech has come from 91-year-old Harry Smith, a historian of the great depression and a contributor to the Guardian’s Comment is free who used his experience of life in the 1930s to explain why he thought the NHS was so valuable. Here’s a lengthy extract. My memories stretch back almost a hundred years and if I close my eyes I can smell the poverty that oozed from the dusky tenement streets of my boyhood. I can taste on my lips the bread and drippings I was served for my tea. I can remember extreme hunger, and my parent’s undying love for me. In my heart I can still feel my mum and dad’s desperation as they tried to keep our family save and healthy in the slum we called home ... No one in our community was safe from poor health, sickness and disease. In our home, TB came for my oldest sister Marion who was the apple of my dad’s eye. It is why her sickness and his inability to pay for her medicine or the best care broke his heart. Tuberculosis tortured my sister and left her an invalid that had to be restrained with ropes tied to her bed. My parents did everything in their power to keep Marion alive and comfortable but they just didn’t have the dosh to get her to the best clinics, doctors or medicines. Instead she wasted away before our eyes until my mother could no longer handle her care and she was dispatched to our Work House infirmary where she died 87 years ago. Mum and dad couldn’t afford to bury their darling daughter so, like the rest of our country’s indigent she was dumped nameless into a pauper’s pit. My family’s story isn’t unique; sadly, rampant poverty, and no health care were the norm for the Britain of my youth. That injustice galvanized my generation to become after the Second World War the tide that raised all boats ... As I stand here today, my heart is with all of those people from my generation who didn’t make it past childhood, didn’t get an education, grow as individuals, marry, raise a family and enjoy the fruits of retirement because they died needlessly and too early in another era of austerity. But my heart is also with the people of the present, who, because of welfare cuts and austerity measures, are struggling once more to make ends meet, and whose futures I fear for. Today, we must be vigilant, we must be vocal, we must demand that the NHS will always remain an institution for the people and by the people. We must never ever let the NHS free from our grasp because if we do your future will be my past. I am not a politician, a member of the elite or a financial guru, but my life is your history – and we should keep it that way. So say it loud and say it clear in this hall and across this country: Mr Cameron, keep your mitts off my NHS. Grant Shapps, the Conservative chairman, or someone in his office, has been trying to have some fun at Ed Miliband’s expense. There’s more here if this appeals, although judges of online comedy awards can probably give it a miss. Ed Miliband’s plan to raise £2.5bn for the NHS by a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes is very popular with voters, a Survation poll for LabourList suggests. Full details of the polling, which also covered other Labour announcements, are here, on the LabourList website. Here’s an extract. Today’s big policy – that NHS spending will be funded by taxes on tobacco companies and mansions, and closing tax loopholes – is the most popular policy polled, with 72% of the public in favour, compared to just 12% who were opposed. That suggests that if Miliband is able to capitalise on this in the coming days, he could make headway. It was particularly popular with Labour (81%) and Lib Dem (84%) voters from 2010 – the group that Miliband needs to keep together to win in 2015. This is what the broadsheet papers are saying in their editorials about Ed Miliband’s speech. The Guardian says Miliband was trying to move away from personality politics. Reminding the hall of how Cameronian compassion had given way to the bedroom tax, and of how hugged huskies had yielded to “green crap”, Mr Miliband hit home with an audience which was never going to take much persuading. The far trickier test remains persuading the country of his own stocks of the character thing. The Labour leader’s list of the powerful whom he has stood up against – including Rupert Murdoch, energy giants and the Daily Mail – is not a bad place to start. Fundamentally, however, Mr Miliband used yesterday to try to move away from personality politics. What he is selling is less himself than a Labour government. The Daily Telegraph says the speech fell short as a prospectus for government. Yet even as he laid out his vision of a socialist Utopia, the Labour leader seemed unwilling to spell out the details of how his revolution will proceed – let alone be paid for. Labour will build as many homes as the country needs – wonderful, but how? Labour will impose “equal rights for the self-employed” – what does that actually mean? Perhaps the biggest hostage to fortune was the pledge, repeated from last year, to decarbonise the electricity supply completely by 2030. Does that mean rapidly building new nuclear power stations and wind turbines? If so, it will cost billions – so where will they come from? And if the answer is private investment, rather than tax rises, how on earth can that be squared with Mr Miliband’s promise to freeze energy bills by government fiat? The Times (paywall) says Miliband failed his audition. The content of this speech will not endure. The governing theme of “together” was too bland to give the address any edge. The lingering impression, if there even is one, will be that Mr Miliband failed his audition. In interviews Mr Miliband has the habit of asking himself questions and then answering them. In his speech yesterday he offered pious answers to some questions that he had set for himself and no answers at all to the questions that really counted. The Financial Times says it was “a dull and meandering conference speech” which contained “a string of fiddly policy gimmicks”. It is disappointing Mr Miliband believes the challenges of the National Health Service can only be met by throwing more resources at an institution that has been spared austerity and has enjoyed significant real terms increases in funding over the past decade. And while there may a principled case for some form of wealth taxation, mounting a smash-and-grab raid on a few well-known pantomime villains is a poor substitute for tax reform. The Independent says Miliband offered a coherent alternative to the coalition. The Independent agrees with some of those policies, and admires the serious attempt to fix the funding crisis in the health service. But not mentioning the deficit was a bad error which may fortify Labour’s difficulties on the economy. For all that, Mr Miliband articulated a social democratic vision of Britain which is, in several key respects, different to that of the Coalition. Next May, those who proclaim there is no alternative will be wrong. Labour will halt Home Office plans to axe a further 1,100 police officer jobs next year and set up a new national refuge fund to help victims of domestic violence, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, will say in her speech this morning. My colleague Alan Travis has filed a preview story. Here are more details. Cooper is to tell delegates that the funding for the extra police officers and to begin to reverse a 31% cut in funding for women’s refuges will come from £50m saved from scrapping the next set of police and crime commissioner elections. A further £17m will also be raised from increasing charges for gun licenses and £9m found by levying increased fees for compulsory driver retraining courses. The extra cash for policing and to support the victims of domestic violence is the product of Labour’s “zero-based review” which has identified cuts, savings and revenue-raising measures to protect the frontline and help meet the financial constraints on policing budgets. Police forces across England and Wales are already planning to cut 1,100 officers’ jobs in the next financial year of 2015/2016 as a result of the 27% cuts in Whitehall grants to the police made since the government came to power in 2010. A total of £41m would be needed to prevent the loss of the officers’ jobs through natural wastage and recruitment freezes. Here’s the Guardian’s Steve Bell discussing doing his cartoon of Ed Miliband. By my count, Ed Miliband has given at least five interviews this morning (to ITV’s Good Morning Britian, BBC Breakfast, Sky News, the Today programme and Radio 5 Live). Here are the key points. I’ve taken some of the quotes from PoliticsHome and hte Press Association. Miliband said he was “open to the possibility” of supporting Britain getting involved in air strikes against Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq. I don’t think we can turn away from the threat of (Isis). When we see the plight of Alan Henning, I think it is something we should be deeply concerned about. They are a murderous organisation. I’ve been saying consistently we need to build a coalition, not just a military coalition, but a political and diplomatic coalition. I’m open to that. But he sounded more cautious about supporting air strikes in Syria, saying that the situation was “more complex”, that Syria had not asked for intervention and that he would like to see a UN security council resolution. He said the deficit was “incredibly high” on his list of priorities. He accused David Cameron of making a “false promise” on immigration. I didn’t pluck a number of the out of the air for what should happen to immigration. The prime minister has done that, he made a promise, he made a false promise to get immigration into the tens of thousands. Miliband rejected suggestions that his plans for a mansion tax amounted to a tax on London. When this was put to him by Nicky Campbell on Radio 5 Live, he replied: It’s a tax on expensive homes. Some of those are in London, some of those are in other parts of the country. He said the mansion tax plan would not lead to a wholesale council tax revaluation. It’s definitely not going to lead to that. And I can tell you why, because the government itself has brought in a tax on homes above £2m by people who are putting them in companies and trying to avoid tax, so they’ve shown that it can be done without any kind of revaluation across the board at all. He said he would like Britain to have more millionaires. When Campbell asked him if he would like see more millionaires, he replied: If they are are wealth creators, people who are entrepreneurs, absolutely, that’s absolutely part of a successful country. But I also think that millionairs should pay their fair share of tax. He admitted that the NHS in Wales faces “challenges”. But he rejected the charge, levelled regularly by Cameron, that the NHS is much worse in England and that that’s the fault of the Labour administration in Cardiff. Miliband said a Nuffield Trust study found that no one health system in the UK is particularly better than the others. He admitted that he forgot passages that he had planned to include in his speech. (See 7.41am.) But he said he would continue to give speeches without notes. Asked if he would do this again, he told Sarah Montague on Today: “Absolutely.” He said it was a form of speaking that suited him, and part of his attempt to change the way politics works. To have politicians just reading out a speech - I think we’ve got to change the way politics works. I think actually people want people to just come along and tell them what they think. That’s what I did yesterday ... I like it as a way of engaging with people, and of course one of the perils of it is there are bits that get left out, bits that get added in, so it comes with the territory, but I find it quite an effective way of communicating with people ... I think people want to hear directly from me. That’s a style that I’ve chosen, a style that I believe works for me. He said the Scottish independence referendum showed that giving 16 and 17-year-olds the vote was “the right thing to do”. He brushed aside a question about his poor kissing technique. When Sky’s Eamonn Holmes said there was an awkward moment at the end of the speech when Miliband moved towards his wife Justine as if he were going to kiss her, and she moved away, and he joked that Miliband might have a “bad breath” problem”, Miliband replied: “All I can say is, she’s never complained. John Prescott was not particularly comradely last night when asked what he thought of Chuka Umunna. Prescott jokingly referred to him as “Chumbawamba”. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, was on the Today programme earlier. There were two key points from his interview. Johnson said there was a significant difference between the Conservative’s approach to deficit reduction after 2015 and Labour’s. He said the Conservatives were planning “significantly bigger” cuts, but that Labour’s plans would leave a higher debt and higher deficit. What the shadow chancellor actually said is that they would be looking to get to current budget balance, he said, by the end of the parliament – that does mean some significant cuts over the period of the next parliament, particularly after 2016. But that is quite a different thing to what the current chancellor is suggesting; he’s suggesting something much tougher. So the Conservatives are suggesting significantly bigger spending cuts or tax rises than those the Labour party are planning ... What Mr Osborne said he wants to do is to get to budget balance by the end of the parliament. Mr Balls has basically said ‘I’m willing to borrow for investment at the same time’... It matters in two ways. First of all, the Conservatives would have to implement much deeper and really significant cuts to public spending to achieve what they’re doing. On the other hand, where Mr Balls would end up is with higher debt and higher deficit and more to do in the 2020s to get us back onto a path for reducing debt. He said Labour’s plan for a mansion tax was “perfectly feasible” and “makes quite a lot of sense”. What we’re looking at here is some extra payments on top of the current council tax for the most expensive properties. The council tax is a very odd tax because it is capped, so a mansion worth £50m pays essentially the same council tax as a house worth probably £800,000 or £1m. So putting additional bands on top of that or having a proportion of the value above £2m paid as additional council tax is perfectly feasible and in some senses makes quite a lot of sense, rather than the current system which is deliberately regressive. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. We’re now getting the post-match commentary from the BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson. He says the extra £2.5bn Labour has found for the NHS is less than 3% of its budget. Even Margaret Thatcher used to increase the NHS budget, on average year on year, by more than 3%. So even if Labour could do this, unless they found extra spending they would not be increasing the NHS budget by as much as Thatcher. The average real terms increase in the NHS budget has 4% a year since its creation, he says. This would be “an extraordinarily tight financial settlement”. Robinson says that, providing David Cameron receives a formal request from Iraq for today, there will be a recall of parliament. But MPs will just be asked to back a recall of parliament for military action in Iraq. Labour MPs will support this. They will not support military action in Syria. I’ll post a full summary soon. Q: What do you feel about the coverage of your speech? Miliband says people will have heard that Labour has a plan for the future. The mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, is addressing the conference today. He showed how you can win an election on the affordability crisis, he says. Q: Will you continue to do speeches without notes? Absolutely, says Miliband. Q: Will you do things differently in the NHS? Will there be a re-organisation? Miliband says they are not proposing a top down reorganisation. But they will do things differently. They want to integrate health and social care. Q: How can you do that without reorganising? By getting organisations to work together, he says, and by pooling budgets. Because there is not much extra money, they have to transform the service, he says. Q: You said the Tories are worried about Ukip? Are you worried about them too? Or are you not that worried? Miliband says this goes to the argument of his speech. People feel the country is not working for them. Q: Jeremy Hunt said yesterday that they had put an extra £2.7bn into the NHS last year, more than you promised. Miliband says the NHS is “sliding backwards” under the coalition. People cannot see GPs when they want. Staffing levels are too low. He presented a plan to address this. Q: Will you turn it round with £2.5bn? Miliband says this will make “a big difference”. Andy Burnham will be saying more about this in his speech today. Q: You did not mention immigration? Miliband says he did. Q: But a passage was dropped? Miliband says there was a passage on immigration that he did not use. But he gives speeches in this way so that people can hear directly from him. Q: You described your speech as a job interview. Everyone gets nervous at job interviews. Is that why two chunks were missing, on the deficit and immigration? Or did you deliberately leave them out? Miliband says he did not deliberately leave them out. He writes a speech, but uses that as a starting point. He added bits in, he says. There will be no plans in the manifesto funded by additional borrowing, he says. Q: Your original script referred to a tough new approach on the deficit. What would you do to get it down? Miliband mentions the 50p tax rate, and taking benefits away from wealthy pensioners and capping child benefit. His speech was about the need for big reform, he says. Ed Miliband is being interviewed by Sarah Montague on the Today programme now. Q: David Cameron is expected to recall parliament for a vote on air strikes on Friday. Will that happen? Miliband says that is a possibility, but he has not been told it will happen. Islamic State (Isis, as we call it, or Isil, as Miliband calls it), is a threat that must be tackled. If a proposition comes forward for military action, we will look at it. Q: If you were prime minister, and Iraq requested military action, would you say yes? Miliband says he would have to look at that. But he would be open to the idea. Iraq is a democratic state; we should support it. Q: And does that apply to Syria too? The situation there is different, Miliband says. It is not a democratic state. For action there to be legitimate, it would be better to have a UN security council resolution. Q: And if Russia vetoed that? Miliband says he does not want to get into hypotheticals. But he says he would rule out deploying ground troops. For the last three years Ed Miliband’s party conference speeches have been widely praised. This year’s speech, though, has had a rather different reception. If it were a West End show scheduled for a three-month run, on the basis of today’s reviews it would be closing on Friday. Miliband has been giving interviews this morning, and one of the questions he has been asked is whether it is true that he forgot passages from the speech, which he had prepared in advance but was delivering from memory. “Absolutely yes,” he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. It’s not really about memorising the speech. What I try and do is I try and write a speech and then I use it as the basis for what I want to say to the country. In a way I could just stand there and read out a speech that’s been prepared earlier. I like it as a way of engaging with people. And, of course, it’s one of the perils of it that there are bits that get left out, bits that get added in. It sort of comes with the territory. I’ll post more from his morning interviews soon, as well as covering his Today programme interview at 8.10 in detail. Here’s the agenda for the day. 10.45am: Debate on health and care 11.25am: Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, speaks. 11.45am: Debate on stronger communties 12.25pm: Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, speaks. 2.45pm: Douglas Alexander, the general election coordinator, speaks. 3.20pm: Harriet Harman, the deputy Labour leader, closes the conference. I’ll be covering all the conference events, and at some point I will post on 10 things we’ve learnt from the Labour conference.

Eli Yishai on Sunday banned Grass from entering Israel, to which Grass replied in a commentary in Süddeutsche Zeitung by comparing the travel ban to one imposed on him by Erich Mielke, head of East Germany's dreaded secret police. He wrote that only the communist DDR and Burma had ever banned him from entry before. \"Now the interior minister of a democracy, the state of Israel, has punished me with a travel ban and the tone of his justification reminds me of the verdict of minister Mielke,\" Grass wrote in the piece which appeared on the Süddeutsche Zeitung's website on Wednesday evening. Grass said he still saw himself as \"irrevocably connected to the country of Israel\", but while Burma seemed to offer a glimmer of hope for change, Israel was an \"unchecked nuclear power\" that regarded itself as immune to criticism. Grass, 84, caused a storm with his poem What Must Be Said in which he accused Israel of being a threat to world peace. The poem led to accusations of antisemitism and prompted Yishai to declare him persona non grata. Grass said in an interview following the poem's publication that he was \"primarily talking about the [Netanyahu] government\" and had often supported Israel. In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Yishai rejected the Stasi comparison. \"There is no doubt that Günter, as one who came out of a tyrannical regime, usually knows how to identify one. However, this time he's wrong,\" the statement said, making reference Grass's youth in Nazi Germany. Grass had been for many the voice of Germany's postwar conscience, appealing to his countrymen and women to face up to their Nazi past. His moral authority was severely dented when he revealed only in 2006 that in his teens he had been a member of the Nazi Waffen SS. Yishai said he would be happy to meet Grass in a neutral nation to explain why someone who had served under the Nazis would not be able to enter a state whose people they had advocated exterminating. The minister added that his only mistake was not imposing a ban on Grass earlier, when he took up his position as interior minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/03/ed-davey-green-policies-in-tray","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-03T17:10:16Z","webTitle":"What are the key green policies in Ed Davey's in-tray?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/03/ed-davey-green-policies-in-tray","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/03/ed-davey-green-policies-in-tray","fields":{"headline":"What are the key green policies in Ed Davey's in-tray?","bodyText":"Ed Davey, the new secretary of state for energy and climate change, faces a daunting in-tray of policies that will create battles with industry, electricity consumers, anxious renewable energy investors and green campaigners – but the toughest challenge of all is likely to come from his cabinet colleagues. Chris Huhne was one of the few heavyweight champions of the green agenda within the coalition government. His departure sparked immediate fears that without him, the voices within cabinet - and among the Tory rank-and-file - that have been calling ever more loudly for a watering down of environmental policies will prevail. Those calls have been led by George Osborne, the chancellor, who vowed the UK would do no more than the minimum to meet environmental goals, and could revise current targets downwards. Andrew Simms, fellow at the New Economics Foundation, urged: \"Davey must face down the economic and environmental self-defeating destructiveness of the Treasury, which is preventing the UK from becoming a world leader [in green industries].\" Matthew Spencer, director of the Green Alliance, said it was time for David Cameron and Nick Clegg to speak up: \"This creates a moment for the prime minister and deputy prime minister to assert their ownership of the green economy, and for the new secretary of state to build a broader coalition for action across government. It's important that the top tier of government speak publicly to correct the misunderstanding that the leadership are giving up on this agenda.\" Speaking in Westminster today, Davey said: \"I've now got to take up the challenges, the challenge of climate change, of energy security and I'm particularly conscious of the impact on consumer households across the country of high energy bills.\" He added: \"I want us to have a green economy where there's lots of green jobs to help grow our economy.\" Here are the key policies in Davey's in-tray: Energy bills The government's ability to influence bills, which have soared on the back of international fossil fuel prices, relies mainly on attempts to bully and shame the big six suppliers. Its answer has been to bring forward a new flagship policy, the \"green deal\", for cutting consumer charges by encouraging insulation and other low-carbon home improvements. The bad news is the green deal is in trouble, as several analyses show its appeal is likely to be limited when it launches this autumn. Renewable energy Subsidies for renewable energy are under fierce attack, from free-market thinktanks and sections of the rightwing media. The government was humiliated when it tried to cut feed-in tariffs for small-scale renewables, in a hasty move that judges ruled unlawful, and that stirred up turmoil and job losses among solar companies. But the promise of hundreds of thousands of green jobs, billions of pounds in investment, and meeting our EU obligations on renewable generation all hang on a strong showing of government support for the sector. New nuclear power For Liberal Democrats, nuclear power is always a tricky issue. Huhne tried to finesse his party's long-standing opposition to new reactors with Tory enthusiasm for them by pledging that they would receive no public subsidy. Critics pointed out that policies to aid \"low-carbon\" generation would also provide financial support to nuclear. As nuclear projects inch forward, Davey will have to walk a similar tightrope. Fourth carbon budget Under pressure on his green credentials, Cameron agreed last summer to carbon-cutting targets for the UK that will be some of the most stringent in the world when they take effect in the 2020s. Osborne wants to review them within two years. This will be a key test for Davey - if he is still around by then. International The next two years will see some of the toughest negotiations over climate change within the European Union and globally in the long-running United Nations talks. In Brussels, member states must thrash out the next set of renewable energy and carbon targets by the end of 2014. Under the UN, countries have committed to forge a new global climate change treaty by the end of 2015. Both these punishing forums require a combination of high statesmanship and low guile. Huhne was widely praised for his skilful performances - Davey will have a tough act to follow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/iran-blog/2012/aug/02/israel-intentions-iran-pressing-question","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-02T11:06:05Z","webTitle":"Israel's intentions towards Iran – the pressing question","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2012/aug/02/israel-intentions-iran-pressing-question","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/iran-blog/2012/aug/02/israel-intentions-iran-pressing-question","fields":{"headline":"Israel's intentions towards Iran – the pressing question","bodyText":"Speculation over whether Israel is preparing for a unilateral military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities has intensified in the past few weeks after a period in which the atmosphere was less febrile. The visit of four senior US administration officials – the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, the national security adviser, Tom Donilon, and the counter-terrorism chief, John Brennan – suggests that Washington is renewing its efforts to rein in Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's inclinations towards military action. It can be assumed that the administration is also anxious to reassure Netanyahu that it is committed to tackling the Iranian nuclear threat following presumptive Republican candidate Mitt Romney's visit to Jerusalem earlier this week. Romney, assisted by his senior aide Dan Senor, positioned himself in hawkish solidarity with Israel. Senor even suggested that Romney would back unilateral action launched by Israel, although there was some later backtracking on that stance. The message to Israel from administration officials boils down to this: the US is serious about preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, you need to trust us on this, we will in the end use force if we have to and we are much better equipped to do so than you, so don't muck it all up by going ahead on your own. An analysis in the Jerusalem Post by Yaakov Katz summarises the debate within Israel's political and military establishment: \"The debate that is raging within the government and the defence establishment is not about the value of an attack, since no one really wants Iran to be allowed to go nuclear. The question, however, is about the timing of such an attack and whether it needs to happen over the summer, before the US elections, or if it can wait until afterward, maybe as far away as next spring. \"At the heart of this question are two additional questions – first, whether Israel can afford to wait that long and second, if Israel can really rely on the US to use military force one day if and when everything else has clearly failed.\" Some commentators believe Netanyahu will only respond to a clear and powerful message from Barack Obama. Writing in Haaretz, Ari Shavit says: \"The key to preventing disaster is … in the hands of the US president. Barack Obama is a brilliant orator. Obama has made quite a few exemplary speeches both as presidential candidate and as president. But the American president's most important speech is the one he has not made so far – the Iran speech. A speech in which the leader of the free world pledges in public that the free world will prevent Iran from obtaining military nuclear ability – at any price. A speech in which the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says that if the sanctions don't stop Iran, America's military power will. \"A speech in which the US president stands before the citizens of the United States and its allies and says – it's on me. I will not ignore your existential needs nor abandon our strategic interests, nor let Iran become a nuclear power. In my name and in the name of Mitt Romney and the bipartisan leadership, I hereby pledge that in the course of 2013 America will paralyse the Iranian centrifuges that could bring an historic catastrophe on us all.\" Such a speech will prevent an Israeli strike and \"almost\" guarantee Obama's re-election, says Shavit. An unusual view is taken by Larry Dernfer, writing on the +972 website. In a piece headlined \"It's over – there will be no Israeli attack on Iran\", he says: \"Israel is not going to attack Iran. Not before the 6 November presidential election, not afterward if Obama wins, and maybe not afterward even if Romney wins, which is unlikely. \"It's not that Netanyahu doesn't want to bomb Iran – he does, and he makes that clearer every day. What's happened is that there's been such a torrent of opposition in the Israeli media this week from the security establishment, starting with IDF [Israel Defence Forces] chief Benny Gantz, and backed by the Obama administration and Pentagon, that there's no way Bibi [Netanyahu] can get his cabinet to vote for a war, and without the cabinet's backing, he can't do it. The ministers will not support Bibi in an extremely risky war opposed by the heads of the IDF, IDF intelligence, the air force, the Mossad, the Shin Bet and the United States of America. Dernfer adds: \"So I think the game is up. Making the case for war with Iran is now a losing battle, and people are going to start running away from it, beginning, I expect, with Ehud Barak, who has been Bibi's equal partner in this whole scaremongering affair.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/dec/05/sellafield-nuclear-energy-solution","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-05T20:40:00Z","webTitle":"We need to talk about Sellafield, and a nuclear solution that ticks all our boxes | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/05/sellafield-nuclear-energy-solution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/05/sellafield-nuclear-energy-solution","fields":{"headline":"We need to talk about Sellafield, and a nuclear solution that ticks all our boxes","bodyText":"It's a devastating admission to have to make, especially during the climate talks in Durban. But there would be no point in writing this column if I were not prepared to confront harsh truths. This year, the environmental movement to which I belong has done more harm to the planet's living systems than climate change deniers have ever achieved. As a result of shutting down its nuclear programme in response to green demands, Germany will produce an extra 300m tonnes of carbon dioxide between now and 2020. That's almost as much as all the European savings resulting from the energy efficiency directive. Other countries are now heading the same way. These decisions are the result of an almost medievel misrepresentation of science and technology. For while the greens are right about most things, our views on nuclear power have been shaped by weapons-grade woo. A fortnight ago, the Guardian examined the work of a Dr Chris Busby. We found that he has been promoting anti-radiation pills and tests to the people of Japan that scientists have described as useless and baseless. We also revealed that people were being asked to send donations, ostensibly to help the children of Fukushima, to Busby's business account in Aberystwyth. We found that scientists at the NHS had examined his claims to have detected a leukaemia cluster in north Wales and discovered that they arose from a series of shocking statistical mistakes. Worse still, the scientists say, \"the dataset has been systematically trawled\". Yet Busby, until our report was published, advised the Green party on radiation. His \"findings\" are widely used by anti-nuclear activists. Last week in the New York Times, the anti-nuclear campaigner Helen Caldicott repeated a claim which already has been comprehensively discredited: that \"close to 1 million people have died of causes linked to the Chernobyl disaster\". The \"study\" on which it is based added up the excess deaths from a vast range of conditions, many of which have no known connection to radiation, in the countries affected by Chernobyl – and attributed them to the accident. Among these conditions was cirrhosis of the liver. Could it have any other possible cause in eastern Europe? Earlier this year, when I asked Caldicott to provide scientific sources for the main claims she was making, she was unable to do so. None of this has stopped her from repeating them, or has prevented greens from spreading them. Anti-nuclear campaigners have generated as much mumbo jumbo as creationists, anti-vaccine scaremongers, homeopaths and climate change deniers. In all cases, the scientific process has been thrown into reverse: people have begun with their conclusions, then frantically sought evidence to support them. The temptation, when a great mistake has been made, is to seek ever more desperate excuses to sustain the mistake, rather than admit the terrible consequences of what you have done. But now, in the UK at least, we have an opportunity to make amends. Our movement can abandon this drivel with a clear conscience, for the technology I am about to describe ticks all the green boxes: reduce, reuse, recycle. Let me begin with the context. Like other countries suffering from the idiotic short-termism of the early nuclear power industry, the UK faces a massive bill for the storage and disposal of radioactive waste. The same goes for the waste produced by nuclear weapons manufacturing. But is this really waste, or could we see it another way? In his book Prescription for the Planet, the environmentalist Tom Blees explains the remarkable potential of integral fast reactors (IFRs). These are nuclear power stations which can run on what old plants have left behind. Conventional nuclear power uses just 0.6% of the energy contained in the uranium that fuels it. Integral fast reactors can use almost all the rest. There is already enough nuclear waste on earth to meet the world's energy needs for several hundred years, with scarcely any carbon emissions. IFRs need be loaded with fissile material just once. From then on they can keep recycling it, extracting ever more of its energy, until a small fraction of the waste remains. Its components have half-lives of tens, rather than millions, of years. This makes them more dangerous in the short term but much easier to manage in the long term. When the hot waste has been used up, the IFRs can be loaded with depleted uranium (U-238), of which the world has a massive stockpile. The material being reprocessed never leaves the site: it remains within a sealed and remotely operated recycling plant. Anyone trying to remove it would quickly die. By ensuring the fissile products are unusable, the IFR process reduces the risk of weapons proliferation. The plant operates at scarcely more than atmospheric pressure, so it can't blow its top. Better still, it could melt down only by breaking the laws of physics. If the fuel pins begin to overheat, their expansion stops the fission reaction. If, like the Fukushima plant, an IFR loses its power supply, it simply shuts down, without human agency. Running on waste, with fewer pumps and valves than conventional plants, they are also likely to be a good deal cheaper. So there's just one remaining question: where are they? In 1994 the Democrats in the US Congress, led by John Kerry, making assertions as misleading as the Swift Boat campaign that was later deployed against him, shut down the research programme at Argonne National Laboratory that had been running successfully for 30 years. Even Hazel O'Leary, the former fossil fuel lobbyist charged by the Clinton administration with killing it, admitted that \"no further testing\" is required to prove its feasibility. But there's a better demonstration that it's good to go: last week GE Hitachi (GEH) told the British government that it could build a fast reactor within five years to use up the waste plutonium at Sellafield, and if it doesn't work, the UK won't have to pay. A fast reactor has been running in Russia for 30 years, and similar plants are now being built in China and India. GEH's proposed PRISM reactor uses the same generating technology as the IFR, though the current proposal doesn't include the reprocessing plant. It should. If the government does not accept GEH's offer, it will, as the energy department revealed on Thursday, handle the waste through mixed oxide processing (mox) instead. This will produce a fuel hardly anyone wants while generating more waste plutonium than we possess already. It will raise the total energy the industry harvests from 0.6% to 0.8%. So we environmentalists have a choice. We can't wish the waste away. Either it is stored and then buried. Or it is turned into mox fuels. Or it is used to power IFRs. The decision is being made at the moment, and we should determine where we stand. I suggest we take the radical step of using science, not superstition, as our guide.

The £30bn scheme, championed by the former Labour minister Peter Hain who quit his shadow cabinet role earlier this year to promote it, promises to generate 5% of the UK's electricity and create 10,000 jobs. It would be expected to be operational for more than 120 years. The prime minister met Hain last month to discuss the plan and, according to the FT, has now asked Oliver Letwin, his policy chief, and Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, to investigate the idea for the 6.5GW barrage. Chris Huhne, Davey's predecessor, rejected a similar scheme two years ago because it would have cost the taxpayer too much, but Hain says the new proposal would be entirely funded by private investors. \"We had a very good meeting. The prime minister promised to look into it,\" Hain told the BBC. \"It's encouraging that Number 10 are taking the barrage much more seriously than has been the case over the last few years. Government support is an absolute pre-requisite for getting the whole project underway. Not a penny of taxpayers' money would be needed for this £30bn investment, which would be transformative for Wales. It would create 20,000 jobs in construction and another 30,000 in activity around the barrage.\" In a letter to the prime minister seen by the Guardian, Hain wrote: \"Several sovereign wealth funds have already expressed interest in financing the £30bn project, as long as government signals its support in principle, provides authorisation in the form of a Hybrid bill, and stabilises the electricity price for 25-30 years through a feed in tariff 'Contract for Difference', or similar mechanism. It is worth noting that after 25-30 years, when the price support drops away, the barrage will produce electricity virtually for free for at least another 90 years; this compares favourably with the lifespans of nuclear plants (35 years) and wind turbines (20-25 years).\" The BBC reported on Sunday that it is anticipated that much of the funding would come from investors in Kuwait and Qatar. The Guardian understands that any possible extra income from a road or rail link across the barrage from Lavernock Point near Cardiff across to Brean Down near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset would not be highlighted to investors at first. Corlan Hafren, the consortium of engineering and construction companies behind the proposal, wants to sell the plan on the strength of its electricity generating capacity alone. Hain told the Guardian earlier this year that in response to concerns by environmental groups, the new proposal would incorporate \"fish friendly\" turbines. The consortium says it has engaged with groups such as the RSPB to try and overcome fears about the barrage's possible impact on fauna in the estuary. However, the RSPB said this year that until the proposal are published in full, it was wrong for the consortium to suggest that the RSPB's environmental objections have been overcome. In his letter to Cameron, Hain wrote: \"The consortium has focused from the outset on mitigating the environmental impact. The revolutionary very-low-head turbines spin slowly and are fish friendly, and preserve an estimated 60% more intertidal habitat than previous schemes, thereby reducing the impact on birdlife. Without a barrage, rises in sea level would reduce intertidal habitat by roughly the same amount within 100 years.\" Hain also told the prime minister that the scheme would help to better protect homes in the area that are vulnerable to flooding of the River Severn. A Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) spokesperson said: \"The government is open to working with affordable, environmentally-responsible projects that represent good value for consumers. So far, we have only seen a very draft and high-level outline business case from the consortium. Even if this proposal can meet our criteria it has a long way to go in development.\" In a separate development, the former environment secretary Lord Deben confirmed to the Guardian on Monday that he stood down as chairman of Corlan Hafren two months ago. Deben, a former Conservative environment secretary, has been selected by Decc as the preferred candidate to succeed Lord Turner as chair of the committee on climate change. A Decc spokesman said: \"The appointment will be the subject of a parliamentary pre-appointment scrutiny hearing in September. Deben has provided both Decc and the Cabinet Office with a full list of his interests. If appointed, Deben will put in place arrangements to avoid a conflict of interest.\" Meanwhile, WWF Cymru has urged caution on the new proposal. \"Establish the facts and show us the evidence. We're pleased that the government is looking at renewable energy projects as an alternative to new fossil or nuclear power stations, but in the case of the Severn barrage, we want to see a lot more research carried out.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/oct/16/cuban-missile-crisis-safer-now-than-then","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-16T16:32:00Z","webTitle":"Cuban missile crisis: are we safer now than we were 50 years ago? | Heather Hurlburt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/cuban-missile-crisis-safer-now-than-then","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/cuban-missile-crisis-safer-now-than-then","fields":{"headline":"Cuban missile crisis: are we safer now than we were 50 years ago?","bodyText":"Fifty years after the Cuban missile crisis, three generations of American policy-makers have cut teeth on those events that brought the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink in October 1962. This generation is now winding its way upwards as twenty- and thirtysomething speechwriters, special assistants, reporters and congressional candidates. The basic outline of what they have been taught remains the one canonized by Harvard's Graham Allison some 25 years ago, in four lessons. First, \"nuclear war is really possible.\" Second, \"the principal risk of nuclear war arises from the uncontrollable\" events that take place during genuine crises – such as simple mistakes or errors of perception – and not from the risk that rational human beings will intend war as a matter of policy. Third, \"the reality of nuclear interdependence\" means that states depend upon other states to avoid war for their own survival. Taken together, these \"perils of crisis management\" in the nuclear age ultimately teach that \"crisis must be prevented.\" In other words, if it is true that the only way to win a nuclear war is not to play, the only way to guarantee we don't find ourselves in an accidental pick-up game is to prevent crises before they occur. These lessons still hold; but they are far less obvious than they were in 1987, when the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact still existed, Osama bin Laden was fighting alongside US allies, email was for universities and Twitter was for the birds. Is nuclear war really possible? Americans today still worry about the possibility of a nuclear attack, though by a stateless terrorist group, rather than from Russia or China. But we are less likely to believe a nuclear war – as opposed to a one-off terrorist attack – is possible. So, even as military planners increasingly find nuclear weapons less useful than decades ago, the public responds to the possibility of nuclear terrorism with the desire for the US to keep its weapons, which are more numerous now than in the 1980s. What is uncontrollable? During the cold war, or by the 1980s at any rate, conventional wisdom held that our Soviet opponents were rational, interested in regime survival, and thus deterrable. Therefore, the threat of accident and misperception was as great as that posed by Communist aggression. Today, arguing that Iran's leaders are rational, and deterrable, is enough to get you called out from a presidential campaign podium – even if you are chairman of the joint chiefs. The irrationality of North Korea's leadership is an article of faith on the right, though not among experts who have actually spent time there. (It seems necessary to note that \"rational\" is not the same thing as \"moral\".) If the threat from \"the uncontrollable\" now is perceived to arise from the character of regimes and terrorist groups, rather than circumstance, then lessons three and four of Allison have been placed in doubt. And so, we have the Pentagon worried about misperception and accident, showing interest in hotlines and incidents-at-sea agreements with Cuba and Iran – and political leaders saying no. What about nuclear interdependence? Developments in the last two decades or so have brought this core tenet of deterrence theory very much into question for those countries that must plan to deter the United States – and thus, for us as well. First, Ronald Reagan's dream of national missile defense remains so attractive precisely because it seems to offer a path out of interdependence (which, back in the day, we used to call \"mutual assured destruction\"). Experts, however, continue to tell us that watertight coverage is unlikely to impossible, and systems to counter such defenses will always be cheaper and advance faster than the systems themselves – both thanks to the laws of physics. Second, we are moving rapidly toward hyper-powerful, hyper-effective non-nuclear weapons with destructive powers that, decades ago, would have required nuclear weapons. If the United States is one day able to make a credible, non-nuclear threat to cripple another state's nuclear forces – which future systems like Prompt Global Strike are moving steadily toward – then does that end our nuclear interdependence? Could cyber weapons one day achieve similar effects? Some US commentators and political leaders believe this would be a good thing. But a moment's thought about how the leaders of a smaller nuclear power could be expected to respond to such a threat should be disquieting. Hard as it may be to imagine for those old enough to have grown up with nuclear nightmares and duck-and-cover drills, we might come to miss that interdependence once it is gone. Lastly, do we still believe in crisis prevention? The debate continues, including here, about who got the better of whom 50 years ago. But we know that both Kennedy and Khrushchev believed it was important to de-escalate, important to control the hotheads in each of their governments, and important enough to risk their own leadership to do so. Each spent a great deal of time, before and after, publicly criticizing the other. But each could withdraw to private diplomacy and crisis management when he needed to. Is this still true? Fifty years ago, the discussion and debate over how to manage the crisis was influenced by an extremely small number of voices. The sources of information the American public – and decision-makers – had were limited. And neither the media nor the public had the ability to know and comment on everything as it happened. For better and worse, it is now simply impossible to control the media and public environment as Kennedy, to say nothing of Khrushchev, did. This year alone has seen Twitter turn a series of demonstrations and a terrorist attack in North Africa into a central issue of the presidential campaign, outstrip policy-makers in managing the sensitive case of a would-be Chinese defector and magnify gaffe, after gaffe, after gaffe. Fifty years after Cuba, in short, nuclear war is still possible. Crisis management is more perilous and the international environment is, if anything, less controllable. America is now as interdependent in economics, health and well-being as we were in nuclear strategy then. We have not learned to live with our interdependence any more gracefully."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-22T23:06:13Z","webTitle":"Tory 'Tea Party tendency' putting green energy jobs at risk, warns Ed Davey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Tory 'Tea Party tendency' putting green energy jobs at risk, warns Ed Davey","bodyText":"Tens of billions of pounds of investment in low-carbon, job-creating energy infrastructure projects that are \"ready to go\" could be lost to Britain because of an anti-green movement that is sweeping through the Tory party, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary warns today. In an interview with the Observer, Ed Davey describes a \"Tea Party tendency\" among Conservative MPs who question climate change and green investment as \"perverse\", and says it is creating deep uncertainty for an industry that could do much to help lift the country out of the economic doldrums. Davey is careful not to take aim at George Osborne, who is increasingly sceptical about the green agenda, but makes it clear that the \"noise\" created by some of the chancellor's \"friends\" on the anti-green Tory right risks putting off investors for good. \"Noises off at the margins are undermining investors' confidence and that is undermining green growth, and that is undermining the central purpose of the government, which is deficit reduction,\" Davey says. He says he has confidence in Osborne to continue backing the green agenda, even if some of those around him are urging him to take a different course: \"Of course some of these people are his [Osborne's] friends – some of these people on the margins – but he is going to be judged by growth. The Conservative party is going to be judged by growth. The Liberal Democrats are going to be judged by growth.\" Over recent months the Tory party, including David Cameron and Osborne, has appeared to dilute its enthusiasm for green policies that defined its supposed \"modernisation\" drive in the runup to the 2010 general election. Osborne is said to have formed the view that green policies such as investment in windfarms and solar power are too costly at a time of recession. He is understood to have been swayed by arguments put forward by the former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson, a climate change sceptic. Davey says, however, that there are huge opportunities for the British economy from investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure projects, including wind and solar energy, carbon capture storage and new nuclear power, all of which make up a large part of projected spending of £118bn in the sector over the next decade. Last year alone £12.7bn was invested in this country by the renewable energy industry, creating 20,000 jobs. Davey says he fears these opportunities will be lost if the pre-election consensus on climate change and green policies continues to be questioned. \"If there is not seen to be that consensus investors are going to balk. When you hear all that noise on the right of politics that worries investors. They think, 'Well if I am going to put all this money in – it is a 30-year investment – I need to know that if the government changes we are not going to have some rightwing Tea Party tendency taking over.' \" Last week the head of the Swedish firm Vattenfall, which opened its third British offshore windfarm on Wednesday, said the UK would fail to tempt wind turbine manufacturers to set up in the country because of the uncertainties about future government policy. \"If you look at the UK, not one supplier has established itself yet because of uncertainty in the future,\" said Oystein Loseth. Describing the arguments of the Tory right as perverse, Davey said he could not believe so many Conservatives failed to see the economic benefits of investment in green infrastructure, much of which would be from the private sector and so off the government's books. \"Energy infrastructure is going to drive growth and what is even more significant is that a lot of the energy projects are shovel-ready – they are ready go tomorrow.\" He went on: \"We have to win this argument for the future: it is almost like we have to re-win it. I am confident that if I was the chancellor I would want growth.\" As the Lib Dem conference opened in Brighton, Tory hostility to the green agenda was top of the agenda. Among those taking on Osborne will be his deputy Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, who has proposed a motion condemning \"the refusal of the Conservatives to acknowledge that investing in carbon-reducing technologies has the potential to make an important contribution to long-term growth\". Davey also made it clear that he was in favour of introducing a legal goal to decarbonise the power sector by 2030 – something also opposed by Osborne – although he said he believed this could be done through secondary legislation and with less stringent conditions than were being proposed by many of the green groups. He described the former Tory energy minister Charles Hendry, who was enthusiastic about renewable energy but sacked in the recent reshuffle, as a \"brilliant minister\" and said he had no idea why he had been dismissed from the post. \"I genuinely don't know [why he was sacked] because I have not had a conversation with the prime minister. I do know that Charles Hendry was a brilliant minister,\" said Davey. While Osborne is known to be enthusiastic about a new \"dash for gas\" – which he sees as crucial to the country's future energy needs – Davey was sceptical about over-reliance on gas. In particular he questioned whether exploration of shale gas in the UK would change the need for a balanced energy policy. \"As far as the British shale gas story is concerned I don't think it is a game changer at all, as we would still be dependent on imports.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-crisis-uncertainty-after-yanukovych-signs-deal-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-23T00:01:50Z","webTitle":"Ukraine: Tymoshenko freed as president denounces 'coup' - 22 February as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-crisis-uncertainty-after-yanukovych-signs-deal-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-crisis-uncertainty-after-yanukovych-signs-deal-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine: Tymoshenko freed as president denounces 'coup' - 22 February as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to wrap up our live coverage of events in Ukraine for the day. Thanks very much for joining us. Reuters has been speaking to some of the protesters camped out in Kiev’s Independence Square about what happens next. The consensus seems to be that the barricades will remain in place until a post-Yanukovych leadership is squarely in place. It has also been speaking to those in the crowd whose response to the return of Yulia Tymoshenko was less than enthusiastic. “Tymoshenko is a wise woman but I don’t know whether I’ll vote for her. As for the three opposition leaders - they are not ready to be president,” said Oleksander Sitnikov, from the town of Ivano-Frankivsk. The AFP news agency spoke to a more forthright supporter who compared the former prime minister to US President Roosevelt, presumably because they both at some point used a wheelchair. “She’s just like Roosevelt, but she’s indestructible,” gushed demonstrator Tetiana Matvychuk, referring to the US president who had a paralytic illness. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker in Kiev describes the day’s extraordinary events in the Ukrainian capital and beyond, including a look inside the opulent home of Viktor Yanukovych, where hundreds flocked to gawp after the president fled. Few had any doubts as to the level of wealth Yanukovych had amassed for himself, and the compound itself has been the subject of swirling rumours for some time. But seeing the wealth of riches with their own eyes still took their breath away. The events in Ukraine make the front pages of several of the UK’s Sunday newspapers. Here’s a selection via the BBC’s Nick Sutton: Reports unrest of the northern city of Kharkiv, where Tymoshenko was released earlier today. A quick flashback to the crowds in Independence Square during Tymoshenko’s speech. This man presumably a supporter of the former prime minister. Ukraine’s border control service claimed that aides to Viktor Yanukovych tried in vain to bribe border guards to let him fly out of the country, according to the AFP news agency. “A private plane due to fly out of Donetsk airport did not have the correct paperwork. When officials arrived to check the documentation they were met by armed people who offered them money to fly out urgently,” border service spokesman Serhiy Astahov told AFP. He said border guards refused the offer. Astahov’s account has not been independently confirmed. Yulia Tymoshenko has addressed protesters in Kiev’s Independence Square. Mixed reception as she urged crowds to continue their action until change is secured Former opposition leader was released from prison just hours earlier Ukraine’s parliament has impeached President Viktor Yanukovych and called for elections on May 25 Yanukovych, who fled the capital, denounced what he called a coup in Kiev Britain, Poland and other EU countries have declared their support for the new government while Russia attacked the demonstrators who formed it as “extremists and pogromists”. Apparently there was some heckling during Tymoshenko’s speech, a clear sign that the former prime minister by no means enjoys the wholehearted support of the protesters. What was a very emotional address by Yulia Tymoshenko to the crowds gathered in Kiev’s Independence Square has now finished. Here’s an image of Yulia Tymoshenko addressing the crowds in Kiev Tymoshenko says that Viktor Yanukovych should be made to come to Independence Square to face the protesters. Tymoshenko: You have tried to eliminate this cancerous tumour and for that it was important for you to stand at the barricades and face the bullets of snipers... This nation will never be subdued, it will never bow to anyone... because you would not allow it. Because your strength, your force is indefatiguable. Tymoshenko: Those who fell, fell for us today to stop the dictatorship together... Ahead of us is a very important task, first of all you don’t have the right to leave this square until we achieve real change in this country, until there is an authority that will not allow the country to step back. The crowd chants: “Heroes never die!” repeating a phrase used by Tymoshenko. Yulia Tymoshenko is now addressing the crowd in Kiev’s Independence Square. The former prime minister, speaking from a wheel chair, says protesters were “liberators” who have created “a new country”. The BBC reports that Tymoshenko has been talking to supporters in a street near Kiev’s Independence Square, where thousands are waiting to hear her speak. “If you only knew how many times I wanted to be here, how many times I wanted to hold the hands of those who fought and never gave up,” she said. “My dearest kin, you are the best in the world. There is no-one else, no-one. Glory to Ukraine!” The White House has said it welcomes the release of Yulia Tymoshenko and says the latest developments in Ukraine could move the country to a de-escalation of violence, constitutional change and early elections. It says it will work with its allies and Russia to support a “strong, democratic Ukraine”. No direct word from the Kremlin on Saturday’s events, but Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has been on the phone to US Secretary of State John Kerry to denounce the actions of protesters in Kiev. Lavrov said a peace deal signed on Friday after the week’s deadly violence had been “sharply degraded by opposition forces’ inability or lack of desire” to respect it, according to Russia’s foreign ministry. Interfax via Reuters: Yulia Tymoshenko says she is sure Ukraine will join the EU in the near future and “this will change everything”. Reports say Yulia Tymochenko is due to speak in Kiev soon. In the meantime, she appears to have been pictured with other opposition leaders. It isn’t clear when or where this photo was taken. Never one to miss an opportunity to shoehorn in a pugilistic reference, Ukrainian opposition leader and retired world boxing champ has been quoted describing the latest developments as a “political knockout”. Some Russian reaction to the situation in Ukraine with harsh words for the European Union mission which helped broker the peace deal in Kiev which presaged Saturday’s dramatic events. Vladimir Lukin, Moscow’s envoy to Kiev, had this to say in a TV interview, according to Reuters: I do not understand, frankly, how after recognising the legitimacy of President Yanukovich, the parliament, all the state structures, my European colleagues can then come to Kiev and go to the nationalist-revolutionary and terrorist Maidan and say there - down with the government they recognised. Lots of images now emerging of Yulia Tymoshenko being released. An unconfirmed report, via Reuters and the Russian Interfax news agency, says President Viktor Yanukovych made a failed attempt to flee the country. The report quoted Ukraine’s parliamentary speaker, Oleksander Turchynov, an opponent of the president, saying Yanukovich tried to board a plane to Russia, had been prevented from doing so, and was now in the Donetsk region. William Hague, the foreign secretary, has been talking about the situation in Ukraine. He says Britain will support a new government in Kiev. Today I am in close touch with key partners over the extraordinary developments in Ukraine. Events in the last 24 hours show the will of Ukrainians to move towards a different future, and ensure that the voices of those who have protested courageously over several months are heard.” We will work closely with our EU partners in support of a new government in Ukraine, as and when that is formed. In the meantime it is important that Ukraine’s political leaders respond to events calmly and with determination to harness the united efforts of all Ukrainians to work together for a successful future. Here’s some footage of Yulia Tymoshenko talking to journalists, apparently after her release. A photograph has emerged of Yulia Tymoshenko, apparently on board a plane bound for Kiev. Her smile clearly reveals delight at her unexpectedly swift release from incarceration. Yulia Tymoshenko has been released from custody in Kharkiv and is expected to fly to Kiev. The parliament has impeaced President Viktor Yanukovych and called for elections on May 25 Some eastern cities have declared their support for the new government although Yanukovych said there was a coup in Kiev Britain, Poland and other EU countries have declared their support for the new government while Russia attacked the demonstrators who formed it as “extremists and pogromists”. Here’s Tymoshenko leaving the hospital in Kharkiv. Britain will push for IMF money for the new government. According to Unian Tymoshenko left the hospital by car at 17.40. She travelled with her lawyers. Andrei Kozhemyakin and Sergey Vlasenko. Around 200 people cheered and chanted, “Yulia”. She made no comment to reporters but Unian reported that she wore her traditional braided hairstyle. Unian has now said that Tymoshenko left hospital by car. The Ukrainian parliament has risen until tomorrow morning after appointing several new ministers, removing the president from power and setting a date for new elections. Radislaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, has said there was no coup in Kiev and that the actions of parliament are legal. He was speaking after his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, had contacted him to express his concern over the events in Kiev. Lavrov said: The opposition not only has failed to fulfil a single one of its obligations but is already presenting new demands all the time, following the lead of armed extremists and pogromists whose actions pose a direct threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty and constitutional order. It’s time to stop misleading the international public opinion and pretending that the Maidan represents the interests of the Ukrainian nation.” 328 MPs have voted to impeach Yanukovych including his own supporters. New elections will be held on May 25. A Ukrainian rabbi has urged Kiev’s Jews to leave the city and even the state. Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman, told Ma’ariv, an Israeli newspaper: “I told my congregation to leave the city center or the city all together and if possible the country too. I don’t want to tempt fate. But there are constant warnings concerning intentions to attack Jewish institutions.” Edward Dolinsky, head of the umbrella organization of Ukraine’s Jews described the situation in Kiev as dire, told Maariv “We contacted Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman requesting he assist us with securing the community.” Thew BBC have reported that the head of Ukraine’s armed forces says the military will not get involved in the political unrest. Yuriy Ilyin, Chief of the General Staff, said in a statement: “The armed forces personnel remain at their normal peacetime locations and perform their routine functions.” A tale of two cities. Riot police welcomed back from Kiev by crowds in Sevastopol. News from Dnipropetrovsk. Reuters is snapping excerpts from a speech by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian minister for foreign affairs.

I am not afraid. I feel sorrow for my country,” he told UBR television and Internet outlet. Photographers have tracked down the riot police in Kiev. More on Yanukovych who some said was earlier planning to resign. Yanukovych has now described the events in Kiev as a coup. Centrifugal forces at work as residents of Sevastopol demand union with Russia. Yanukovych is live on television and he is not resigning. Channel 4’s Matt Frei has been getting to the heart of the story at Yanukovych’s zoo and chalet-style house which all a bit Marie-Antoinette and the Petit Trianon at Versailles. The leaders of the paramilitary police who fought protesters have appeared on television to say they are “with the people”. Unian news agency have pictures of Tymoshenko supporters gathering outside Ukrzaliznytsya hospital in Kharkiv where she is being held. This picture shows that the protesters had their own weaponry to use against security forces. Russia Today have reported some parts of the declaration from Kharkiv “The territorial integrity of Ukraine is at risk,” the gathering stated in the resolution. It added that instability in Ukraine is highly dangerous and may cause unpredictable consequences, considering that the country hosts five nuclear power plants with 15 reactors in total, which some extremists have threatened to attack. The resent decisions of the national parliament were taken in conditions “of terror, threats of violence and death,” the resolution says. The gathering says the legislative acts may have been passed involuntarily and are neither legitimate nor lawful. The opposition has broken the agreement with the government signed on Friday, the resolution says. “Armed gangs have not given over their weapons, they continue taking over governmental buildings, killing citizens and officers of the law,” it says. In Kharhiv, it appears that the congress of politcians from the south and east have effectively said they will not be governed from Kiev. According to Russia Today: The Kharkov public gathering has announced a number of measures local authorities should take in response to the developments in Kiev. They should take full responsibility for all decision in respective regions, with no regard to authorities in Kiev until the constitutional order in Ukraine is restored, a resolution of the gathering says. The military commanders should take measures to protect arms depots and prevent their take-over and looting by radical opposition activists. Meanwhile citizens are encouraged to form local militias to protect public order. Local authorities are to fund and support those militias. Tymoshenko has not been released from prison yet. Her aide has corrected herself. But Reuters have spoken to her daughter, Yevgenia. Jailed Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko will soon be released in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, where she is being treated in hospital, her daughter signalled on Saturday. Yevgenia Tymoshenko said she was going to Kharkiv to meet her mother, who was jailed in 2011 for seven years for abuse of office linked to a gas deal and is a bitter rival of President Viktor Yanukovich. “According to Ukrainian law my mum is already a free person,” Yevgenia Tymoshenko told reporters following a vote in parliament to speed up procedures for her release. A spokeswoman for the former prime minister, 53, said that although the moves in parliament already made her a free woman, Tymoshenko had not yet been released or left the hospital where she is receiving treatment for a back problem. After agreeing a peace deal with protesters President Vikto Yanukovuych flees Kiev. Police withdraw from the street and public buildings. Protester guards take over security. Parliament votes in new speaker, new interior minister and votes for releases of Yulia Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko is to be released from prison in Kharkiv. Congress of regional politicians votes to keep constitutional order in response to events in Kiev. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian government which was appointed by Yanukovych says it will hand over power to the new government. UKRAINE GOVERNMENT SAYS MINISTRIES WORKING NORMALLY, GUARANTEES SMOOTH HANDOVER OF POWER TO NEW GOVERNMENT - STATEMENT Crowds in Independence Square began cheering after hearing rumours of Yanukovych’s resignation. No confirmation or corroboration yet. BBC correspondent Yuri Maloveryan in Kharkiv says thousands of pro-opposition demonstrators are on the streets close to where a congress of deputies from Ukraine’s east is taking place. This time, he says, they are being protected by the police as several hundred pro-Russian protesters shout at them. AP: A spokeswoman for Yulia Tymoshenko says the former Ukrainian prime minister and opposition icon has been released from prison. Natasha Lysova told The Associated Press that Tymoshenko was released from her prison in Kharkiv on Saturday. She did not have further details. From the Russian ministry of foreign affairs. Time’s Simon Shuster is Crimea. Unian news agency reports that the plane carrying Viktor Yanukovych landed at the Kharkiv Aviation Plant. A source told them. “Yes , the President is indeed in Kharkov. But his plane landed not in the central airport and aircraft factory in the territory .” Yulia Tymoshenko has been released according to AP. Latest Yanukovych rumours. In Kharkiv, regional MPs and councillors have taken responsibility for constititional order in Ukraine in response to events in Kiev. Russia Today has this report. The public gathering of deputies from local councils of southeastern Ukraine have declared they are taking responsibility for constitutional order in the country, as thousands of people have assembled in the city of Kharkov. The Kharkov public gathering has announced a number of measures local authorities should take in response to the developments in Kiev. They should take full responsibility for all decision in respective regions with no regard to authorities in Kiev until the constitutional order in Ukraine is restored, a resolution of the gathering says. They authorities should take measures to protect arms depots and prevent their take-over and looting by radical opposition activists. The deputies have criticized the decision adopted by the Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) in the last few days, saying they are raising doubts about its legitimacy. The gathering says the legislative acts may have been passed involuntary and are neither legitimate nor lawful. The resent decisions of the national parliament were taken in conditions “of terror, threats of violence and death,” the resolution says. Meanwhile, citizens are encouraged to form local militias to protect public order. Local authorities are to fund and support those militias. Over 10, 000 people have gathered at the city’s Sport Palace, where a total of 3,477 deputies have been holding a meeting. The situation remains generally quiet with the crowd being partly in good spirits and partly subdued and concerned, Itar-Tass news agency reports from the Palace. “3, 477 deputies from local councils in southeastern Ukraine have gathered. We have gathered here not to separate the country, but to save it,” the regional governor, Mikhail Dobkin, told the crowd. Thousands of people are now roaming the grounds of the presidential compound, according to Shaun Walker. There is a holiday atmosphere as people wander around fountains, gardens and golf course, taking selfies. No one has attempted to break into any of the buildings in the compound. Oleksandr Turchynov, the speaker, has been asked to co-ordinate the work of government until a new government is formed which makes him effectively prime minister. As Ukrainians try to understand the ramifications of the today’s events, funerals are taking place all over Kiev. Harriet Salem went to the funeral of Sergey Shapoval, 44, in the suburb of Obolon. Shapoval was a gardener and car park attendant joined the protests in November and was a member of the ”self-defence” units. He was shot dead. There were around 60 people who made the journey from his home in an apartment block. The mourners and the coffin were covered in bright carnations which contrasted with the monochrome, uniform architecture. His mother said that she wished the perpetrators would suffer the same loss as she was experiencing while his girlfriend said that Shapoval loved his country and knew his place was with the protesters. Shapoval’s 15-year old daughter was among the mourners. Now 322 MPs have voted for the release of Yulia Tymoshenko which means she could be freed today as presidential approval no longer seems to be an issue. The Ukrainian parliament has adopted the 2004 constitution and issued a decree against manifestations of separatism. MPs have also voted for a new minister of the interior, Arsen Avakov, one of the leaders of the protesters. Not entirely peaceful in Kiev. BBC are reporting that Ukraine’s Kanal 5 TV has broadcast footage of statues of Soviet-era leader Lenin being toppled in various cities and towns, including in Khmelnytskyi, pictured. Statues were also brought down in the south-eastern city of Dnipropetrovsk; the central city of Poltava; the northern city of Chernihiv; in Pereyaslav-Khmelnytskyy, Brovary and Boyarka in Kiev Region and in the city of Zhytomyr in northern Ukraine. If you have read below the line or browsed on twitter, you might have seen statements that Yanukovych has flown to Dubai or Fujairah in the UAE. These rumours have been circulating for more than 24 hours and as yet there is no evidence to support it. Before and after. Russia Today is no clearer on the whereabouts of Yanukovych. Some media reports suggest that Yanukovich is in Kharkov, a city in Eastern Ukraine, which is a stronghold of his Party of Regions. The president is supposedly going to take part in a summit of members of regional parliaments from Eastern and Southern Ukraine. The emergency gathering will be discussing the ongoing crisis and the strategy the Euromaidan-skeptical regions will follow after the opposition gains in Kiev and in the west of the country. Neither presidential staff nor local authorities in Kharkov confirmed Yanukovich’s visit. The local airport said the presidential plane had not landed there. There is an emergency session of parliament sitting in Kiev. MPs have just voted Oleksandr Turchynov, of the opposition Fatherland Party and a close ally of Yulia Tymoshenko, to be speaker. Ian Traynor has also been driving around Kiev, No police, no traffic police and no forms of authority evident anywhere. The citizens and the rebels appear to be controlling vast tracts of the city and barricades and have set up their own traffic control and traffic police. On the highway to the airport, a checkpoint has been formed by the public to ensure no movement of regime loyalists coming into Kiev from Yanukovych’s eastern heartland. Only a few days ago, it was the opposite, with a succession checkpoints on the highway controlled by regime loyalist thugs and police to stop insurrection reinforcements coming in. Reuters have more on the statement from the ministry of the interior. Ukraine’s interior ministry said on Saturday it was in favour of “speedy change” and urged people to unite in ensuring security and the creation of an “independent, democratic and just” country. In a statement on its website, a day after parliament voted to dismiss Interior Minister Vitaly Zakharchenko, the ministry said it served “exclusively the Ukrainian people and fully shares their strong desire for speedy change.” It urged citizens to unite “in the creation of a truly independent, democratic and just European country.” Here’s a good picture of the presidential compound from the Ukrainian news service, Unian. The interior ministry, the body that directed the majority of the riot police who have been confronting protesters this week, has issued a statement announcing its change of direction. Shaun is now at the gates of the presidents’ residence in Mezhyhirya where a crowd of several hundred people have gathered. One of the guards addressed the crowd. He said he is not affiliated to any political party and is only there to keep order. He said that everyone would be allowed in but in an orderly fashion. When he said there would be no looting, the crowd cheered. Hanna Herman, a close Yanukovych ally, told the Associated Press that the president had no intention of leaving Ukraine and was visiting the eastern city of Kharkiv, which is the heart of his support. As Ukrainians try to understand what is happening in their country, families bury their relatives who died in the unrest. Protesters at the door of parliament. I have just spoken to our Moscow correspondent, Shaun Walker, who is travelling from the centre of Kiev to the president’s residence in the suburbs. I have just passed through a makeshift checkpoint policed by demonstrators with baseball bats who appear to have taken responsibility for the city’s security. The presidential administration where Yanukovych met EU foreign ministers yesterday has been deserted by securty forces. There are protesters outside who say the building is not being ransacked but they won’t allow journalists to enter. There’s an eerie calm in the city. It’s unclear what happens next. We are waiting to see what Yanukovych says in Kharkhiv. Reuters reports that Yanukovych is still in Ukraine after speaking to a helpful source. “Everything’s ok with him,” a source told Reuters. “He is in Ukraine.” Asked whether the embattled leader was in the capital, the source replied: “I cannot say.” The Unian news agency cited Anna Herman, a lawmaker close to Yanukovych, as saying the president was in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv. Reuters reports that the opposition leader Vitaly Klitschko has said that Yanukovych had left Kiev and that the country must hold early elections. “Today he left the capital,” Klitschko told an emergency session of parliament, which was debating an opposition motion calling on Yanukovych to resign. “Millions of Ukrainians see only one choice - early presidential and parliamentary elections.” Yanukovych’s whereabouts were not known, though he had been due to visit the north-eastern city of Kharkiv. His residence outside the capital was empty and unguarded and journalists were entering freely, media reported. Crowds believe that the government has collapsed, but it is possible that the president has moved to a more secure part of the country. James Mates demonstrates the surprise of visitors and residents in Kiev at the sudden change of atmosphere. AP has filed this report: Protesters in the Ukrainian capital claimed full control of the city Saturday following the signing of a Western-brokered peace deal aimed at ending the nation’s three-month political crisis. The nation’s embattled president, Viktor Yanukovych, reportedly had fled the capital for his support base in Ukraine’s Russia-leaning east Police abandoned posts around the capital, and protesters took up positions around the presidential office and residence. Parliament discussed voting on impeaching Yanukovych and setting a quick date for new elections to end a crisis over Ukraine’s identity and future direction. Yanukovych’s whereabouts were unclear Saturday morning. Media outlets reported that he left Kiev for his native eastern Ukraine after surrendering much of his powers and agreeing to early elections by the end of the year. The once heavily-guarded presidential palace appears empty. Good morning. After a week of violence, initial reports suggest that President Viktor Yunkovich has left Kiev and security forces have withdrawn from the city centre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/01/london-2012-japan-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-01T10:05:04Z","webTitle":"Japan hopes London Olympics will boost recovery from tsunami | Justin McCurry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/01/london-2012-japan-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/01/london-2012-japan-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Japan hopes London Olympics will boost recovery from tsunami","bodyText":"Every one of Japan's 300 Olympic athletes was a medallist even before their arrival in London. Days before the team flew from Tokyo, children from the region devastated by last year's tsunami presented each athlete with a wooden medal carved out of debris left behind by the waves. The gifts, attached to ribbons bearing good luck messages, brought tears to the eyes of Japan's Olympic javelin thrower, Yukifumi Murakami. \"I'm really moved,\" he said, adding. \"I have to repay the faith everyone has placed in me.\" That unconventional medal ceremony was only the first of what promises to be a fortnight of poignant moments in London for Japan's athletes, several of whom were affected by the disaster in which almost 20,000 people died on 11 March last year. About one in 10 of Japan's contingent has some connection to the disaster-hit region of Tohoku: Kenta Chida, a fencer, lost his best friend to the tsunami; the world champion pistol marksman Tomoyuki Matsuda, practised in Ishinomaki, where thousands died; and the women's football team gave the country rare cause for celebration when they lifted the World Cup last July. Among them is Aya Sameshima, who worked at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant while playing for Tepco Mareeze, a club owned by the plant's operator. For Kazunari Watanabe, the repercussions of the disaster promise to continue long after his appearance in London, where he will begin his quest for medals in the men's keirin and team sprint this week. Watanabe was living with his wife, parents, grandmother and other relatives in Futaba, two miles from the Fukushima plant, when three reactors went into meltdown, causing the evacuation of more than 150,000 people. Watanabe's relatives are scattered around several locations and have no idea when, or if, they will be able to return to Futaba, a radiation ghost town where the exclusion order barring residents from returning could remain in place for large parts of the town for another decade. The 28-year-old Watanabe, who finished fifth in the keirin at the world track cycling championships in April, was training in Tokyo when the tsunami struck and had to wait hours for confirmation that his relatives had survived. But the disaster affected his performances; his times suffered and he no longer enjoyed training. Almost 18 months on, he has regained his appetite for the sport, and has an outside chance of winning a medal. \"The consequences from the devastation will continue for many more years, and it will be my life work to keep attention on the issue,\" he said. \"I want to be a source of strength for the people of Futaba and Fukushima at this Olympics, and will aim for the gold medal.\" The disaster almost forced Narumi Kurosu, who in London will become the first Japanese woman to compete in the modern pentathlon, to abandon her dream of taking part in the Olympics. The quake badly damaged training facilities in her hometown in Ibaraki prefecture, leaving her with nowhere to practise in a country of only about 100 pentathletes. Kurosu was on the verge of giving up when she received an unexpected invitation to train in South Korea from a coach who had been moved by her plight. Ten days after the tsunami, Kurosu was training alongside rival athletes in South Korea and, with their help, quickly began putting in the best performances of her career. \"I definitely want to put on a good show for the people of Ibaraki,\" she said. Japan has used the arrival of tens of thousands of visitors in London to demonstrate its appreciation for the international support received after the disaster. A corner of Holland Park has been transformed into a typical Fukushima garden and, during the Games, Japan's athletes will be auctioning Olympic uniforms and other items to raise money to rebuild the north-east coast. The country is holding an open house, Arigato (thank you) in London, at County Hall until 11 August. A decent medal haul would also boost Tokyo's chances of hosting the 2020 Games, decades after the capital's first summer Olympics, in 1964, marked Japan's re-entry into the international community after the second world war. Those Games, said Yoshiro Mori, a former prime minister, \"helped our country rebuild and join in again with the international community\". Once again, he added, \"we would like to show the people who have supported us that we are certainly on the way to recovery.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/17/fukushima-nuclear-plant-workers-try-to-avert-catastrophe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-17T21:02:19Z","webTitle":"Fukushima workers labour round the clock in effort to avert catastrophe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/17/fukushima-nuclear-plant-workers-try-to-avert-catastrophe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/17/fukushima-nuclear-plant-workers-try-to-avert-catastrophe","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima workers labour round the clock in effort to avert catastrophe","bodyText":"The population of Japan is with them in spirit and, according to reports, colleagues of the estimated 200 remaining workers at the Fukushima nuclear power plant are ready to work alongside them to avert catastrophe. The limited effectiveness of the water bombing to cool the storage poll for spent fuel rods has re-focused attention on the anonymous technicians, now thought to have been joined by firefighters and soldiers. The few details from relatives suggest no one in this elite team has got ideas about abandoning the work. One reportedly told a colleague from the plant he was prepared to die: it was his job. The wife of one of the \"Fukushima 50\" told the state broadcaster, NHK, her husband had emailed to say the situation was serious. \"He told me to take care of myself because he wouldn't be home for a while.\" The plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, has been inundated with offers after requesting 20 volunteers to help with making the reactors safe. A 59-year-old, with decades of experience, put himself forward. A woman, thought to be his daughter, wrote on Twitter: \"I fought back tears when I heard that my father, who is to retire in six months, had volunteered.\" She said he had told her that the future of Japan's nuclear power industry rested on Fukushima. He had said, 'I am on a mission',\" she added. The workers are operating round the clock, in near-intolerable conditions, threatened by exposure to radiation. Japan's health ministry said the legal limit on radiation exposure would be raised to facilitate time spent at the reactors. Five Tepco workers have died since the plant was damaged by last Friday's earthquake and tsunami, though none from radiation poisoning. Two are reported missing, while 22 have been injured, some in the plant's hydrogen explosions. On Wednesday, surging radiation levels forced workers to withdraw from the crippled plant for 45 minutes. Their permanent withdrawal will be the first sign that the battle has been lost. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, has told them that \"retreat is unthinkable\". Experts said the workers might be increasing their chances of developing cancer despite the team rota system. The workers can expect to keep their anonymity, so strongly protected by their families in recent days. The fear is that having been exposed to danger they will join tens of thousands of other Japanese whose health has been forever affected by radiation, becoming a modern-day equivalent of the hibakusha, the survivors of the 1945 atomic bombs. \"The government and Tepco were saying the volume of leaked radiation is significant, but I think they're taking the situation too lightly,\" Haruhide Tamamoto, 80, a victim of the nuclear attack on Hiroshima, told Kyodo news agency. \"I've suffered from illnesses and other health concerns ever since I was exposed to radiation and I know it's not how the authorities describe it – I want them to realise that this is a real crisis.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/may/29/tuna-contaminated-radiation-fukushima-california","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-29T09:59:44Z","webTitle":"Tuna contaminated with Fukushima radiation found in California","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/tuna-contaminated-radiation-fukushima-california","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/29/tuna-contaminated-radiation-fukushima-california","fields":{"headline":"Tuna contaminated with Fukushima radiation found in California","bodyText":"Bluefin tuna contaminated with radiation believed to be from Fukushima Daiichi turned up off the coast of California just five months after the Japanese nuclear plant suffered meltdown last March, US scientists said. Tiny amounts of caesium-137 and caesium-134 were detected in 15 bluefin caught near San Diego in August last year, according to a study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal. The levels were 10 times higher than those found in tuna in the same area in previous years, but still well below those that the Japanese and US governments consider a risk to health. Japan recently introduced a new safety limit of 100 becquerels per kilogram in food. The timing of the discovery suggests that the fish, a prized but dangerously overfished delicacy in Japan, had carried the radioactive materials across the Pacific ocean faster than those conveyed by wind or water. The researchers, led by Daniel Madigan at Stanford University, said they had found evidence that the fish had been contaminated at \"modestly elevated\" levels with caesium. The chemical was released into the ocean in the wake of the accident at Fukushima Daiichi on 11 March 2011. Madigan told Reuters: \"I wouldn't tell anyone what's safe to eat or what's not safe to eat. It's become clear that some people feel that any amount of radioactivity, in their minds, is bad and they'd like to avoid it. But compared to what's there naturally ... and what's established as safety limits, it's not a large amount at all.\" The fish are thought to have been exposed to radiation for about a month before beginning their journey east across the Pacific. They were found to contain 4 becquerels per kilogram of caesium-134 and 6.3 becquerels per kilogram of caesium-137, the report said. A 2008 study of fish in the area found no evidence of caesium-134, which is produced only by nuclear power plants and weapons, and caesium-137 only at levels that naturally occur in the environment. The results \"are unequivocal. Fukushima was the source\", said Ken Buesseler of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who played no part in the research. Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, conceded that the findings suggested the monitoring of radiation levels in fish outside Japanese waters may have to be stepped up. The spawning and migratory patterns of bluefin tuna indicate that the issue of contaminated fish will be confined to Pacific coastlines. Bluefin spawn only in the western Pacific, off the coasts of Japan and the Philippines. Some juvenile or adolescent fish migrate east to the coast of California coast and remain there to fatten up. Scientists say they do not believe contamination will linger in large fish capable of swimming farther afield, as they are able to metabolise and excrete radioactive substances. The fish examined in the US study weighed an average of 15 pounds. They had shed some of the radionuclides during their journey but had been unable to flush them out altogether. \"We were frankly kind of startled,\" said Nicholas Fisher, an expert at Stony Brook University in New York who took part in the study. \"That's a big ocean. To swim across it and still retain these radionuclides is pretty amazing.\" The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, Tokyo Electric Power, estimates that 18,000 terabecquerels of radioactive materials flowed into the Pacific after the accident, either in the form of fallout, or through mixing with water that leaked from the facility. A terabecquerel is equal to 1tn becquerels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/may/22/google-corporate-responsibility-ed-miliband-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-22T11:26:13Z","webTitle":"What responsible capitalism is all about | Ed Miliband","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/22/google-corporate-responsibility-ed-miliband-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/may/22/google-corporate-responsibility-ed-miliband-speech","fields":{"headline":"What responsible capitalism is all about","bodyText":"This is the prepared text of a speech delivered at Google's Big Tent event on the morning of Wednesday 22 May, 2013. It is great to be here inside the Google Big Tent. My sons Daniel and Sam think I do a very boring job, so they will be excited when I tell them I appeared along with the \"Killer Robots\" and the \"Captain of the Moonshots\" at your sessions. I'd like to start by showing you four pictures and asking you to decide which is the odd one out, because it's reveals the theme of my talk: what kind of future we want to build. The first is my dad. His name was Ralph Miliband. He was a Marxist professor. The second is Willy Wonka, the genius who owns the factory in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and eventually gives it all away to Charlie's family. The third is Margaret Hodge, Labour chair of the public accounts committee, who, as you know, has been very critical of Google in the last few days. And the fourth is Google, along with your founding slogan: \"Don't be evil\". So, as they say on \"Have I Got News from You?\", I'd like people to tell me who is the odd one out. Well, I'll tell you my answer. My answer is that it is my dad. Because he's the only one who thought that the route to a fair society was not through capitalism but through socialism based on public ownership. It wasn't just my dad who thought it, of course. Until 1995 this view was enshrined on the membership card of the party I now lead. Tony Blair got rid of it and rightly so, because nationalising the major industries is not the route to a fair society. Nowadays, there are some people who will tell you that because capitalism is here to stay there aren't really any choices any more about what kind of society we need. But I don't believe that either. So here's another four people that might tell us why. First, here's Richard O'Neill, he's a small businessman who runs a small company called School Office Services in London and despite it being a highly competitive industry, he prides himself on paying all of his workers a living wage. The second is Muhammad Yunus, the microfinance genius, who won the Nobel peace prize. The third is Charlie Mayfield, who is head of Britain's major employee-owned retail chain, John Lewis, sharing its profits with its workforce. And, the fourth is Montgomery Burns, who runs the nuclear power plant in The Simpsons. Now, the odd one out is obvious this time. It is Mr Burns. He's not such a good guy. He leaves radioactive nuggets lying around. Of course, he is cartoon character, but I could have substituted him with RBS or some of the other big banks before the financial crash. He illustrates my case today because there is a choice to make. A choice between an \"irresponsible capitalism\" which sees huge gaps between the richest and the poorest, power concentrated in a few hands, and people are just in it for the fast buck whatever the consequences. And a \"responsible capitalism\", and this is an agenda being led by business, where companies pursues profit but we also have a equal society, power is in the hands of the many and where we recognise our responsibilities to each other. And my case is a \"responsible capitalism\" isn't only fairer but we're more likely to succeed as a country with it. Now, this is an argument I have made for the last two years, as leader of the Labour party. And today I want to apply it to the internet and the digital age. The possibilities of the internet On the face of it, we have many reasons to believe that digital technology is taking us to a more \"responsible capitalism\". Digital technology has opened up markets to people who used to have no access to them it, from the African farmer to the small business people in my constituency. From politics to media, it helps break down old hierarchies. And by making the world more interconnected, the internet creates communities that are more likely to see their responsibilities to each other. And of course, Google is at forefront of this. People all over the world rely on you. And from your search engine, to Gmail, to Google Glass, you have been at the cutting edge of all this revolution. And I applaud you for your innovation. Big choices remain Of course, you are used to politicians coming and saying this sort of thing. But if that's all there was to it, there weren't any big questions that we need to resolve, then frankly I am not sure I should be here. But there are choices we need to make. The internet opens up opportunities for millions, but countries and people can be left behind. The internet breaks down old hierarchies but it can also create new powerful vested interests. And the internet connects people across the globe, but it can also enable footloose global companies to shirk their responsibilities. The rules that we set, the behaviour we encourage, and the cultures we reward will all help to determine which future we end up in. Whether our economy has more Mr Burns or more Charlie Mayfields. Creative people Let me start with how we give every individual an opportunity to benefit from the internet and how we avoid being left behind as a country. There are still 2.6 million households in Britain without access to basic broadband. And there are millions of people in Britain who have never used the internet. That digital divide excludes the potential designers, innovators, entrepreneurs of the future. We've got to turn it around. It's bad for them and it is wrong for our country. But taking advantage of the internet goes far beyond access. It is about putting creativity at the heart of our education system. Google has recognised this by distributing Raspberry Pi computers to schools across the country. But we need to take that insight and use it to transform the way our whole national education system works. Unfortunately, our education is going in the opposite direction. Schools are spending 15% less time on art, design and technology in England, compared to only three years ago. There are over a third fewer teachers being trained in these subjects. And it is no wonder. The government's favoured EBacc simply doesn't include creative and vocational subjects. Art, design, technology and creativity have been rendered second class. But this is precisely the wrong message to be sending out to schools. Just think about Sir Jony Ive. As a kid his Christmas present every year was a day in the classroom with his parents who were design teachers. Sir Jony went on to change the world by designing the iMac and iPad. We need to make sure the next generation aren't just good at using Google, Facebook, and YouTube, but are also designing and creating the next phase of the digital world. That's why we have to put art, design and technology back at the heart of our education system. An economy made by the many The second part of our task is to harness the ability of the internet to transform our economy. In particular making sure that power isn't concentrated in a few hands, but we allow the smallest firms to flourish. Enabling individual creators to work hand-in-hand both with the public sector and with global companies as they design the next generation of technology. That will only happen if the big firms don't squeeze out their smaller rivals. Sometimes markets themselves see off this danger. Like Google did when it gave Android to the world, open source. It prevented the smartphone market being monopolised. But we can't rely on the private sector alone. In the public sector the principle should be create more open access. Think of our great public institutions, like the BBC and the British Library, there is more we can do to open them up, through digital public space. Think of the old world where you had to go to the British Library, where you had to go and have a membership card to get in. Then imagine a world where you don't need to go to the British Library with an exclusive membership card to access to the amazing archives they have. Helping a whole new generation of small businesses in this country. We also need to make sure there are proper financial returns to creativity. So Labour is working with the present government, starting with the Bill currently going through Parliament, to resolve the problems over copyrighting, piracy and intellectual property. And finally, there needs to be regulation that responds to the complexity of the internet. Preventing monopolies arising while being careful not to stifle creativity and we should work with the industry to make sure that doesn't happen. The case has been made, including in our Small Business Taskforce, that Britain needs a digital ombudsman to track anti-competitive practices as they emerge, and provide information to government as they work with regulation at a European level. We welcome people's views about whether this is a sensible way forward. Above all, if we're to have a responsible capitalism we need to make sure that the opportunity offered by the internet is spread to a large number of small businesses not restricted to a small number of large ones. Responsible companies To create a more responsible capitalism, we also need responsible companies. It is great that the Google Big Tent encourages debate on every issue. And I want to engage with you on the issue of tax that has been so prominent in the last few days: with Google, Apple and Amazon all in the spotlight. The first and primary responsibility of government is to get the law right. I welcome Google's call for international tax reform. The government should be putting forward proposals now to make this happen at the G8. Those proposals should guarantee country by country reporting transparency to show how much profit firms are making and tax they're paying. Reform of the rules on transfer pricing to stop companies from shifting profits unfairly. A crackdown on tax havens as well. I hope Google will support us in our endeavours. And, let me say, if we cannot get international agreement, a Labour government will act here at home. But does the responsible company need to do more than obey the letter of the law? My answer is yes. In Google's 2004 IPO prospectus, it said: \"Don't be evil. [We will] be stronger in the long term, we will be better served – as shareholders and in all other ways – by a company that does good things for the world, even if we forego some short-term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared in the company.\" So you were saying: Your employees want a culture where they feel they are doing the right thing. Your customers want it too. Our society depends on the right messages being sent out from the top. And the reputation of business depends on the most prominent businesses doing the right thing. That's why I spoke out after the Select Committee hearings last week. I can't be the only person here who feels disappointed that such a great company as Google, with such great founding principles, will be reduced to arguing that when it employs thousands of people in Britain, makes billions of pounds of revenue in Britain, it's fair that it should pay just a fraction of one per cent of that in tax. So when Google does great things for the world, I applaud you. But when Eric Schmidt says, its current approach to tax is just \"capitalism\", I disagree. And it's a shame Eric Schmidt isn't here to hear me say this direct: when Google goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying its taxes, I say it's wrong. And it's not just me that thinks it. It is crystal clear from your own founding principles. Conclusion So these are some of the ways we create a more responsible capitalism. A society that is more equal not less. Where power is spread to the many, not concentrated in the hands of the few. And where we show our responsibilities to each other. I started with my dad and I will end with him. He was wrong about public ownership. But he was right about something else. He was a refugee here in Britain. Who came here at the age of 16 in 1940. And he joined the Royal Navy. He used to talk about those days in the Navy, where people of all backgrounds, all walks of life, came together for a common purpose. That's how Great Britain succeeds. That's how great companies succeed. That's what responsible capitalism is about. That's what I call One Nation. That's the future we must build together."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/16/japan-nuclear-fire-fuel-pools-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T11:21:10Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear crisis: fire in fuel pools 'would raise radiation exposure'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/16/japan-nuclear-fire-fuel-pools-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/16/japan-nuclear-fire-fuel-pools-radiation","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear crisis: fire in fuel pools 'would raise radiation exposure'","bodyText":"A fire at the stores of spent atomic fuel in Japan's stricken nuclear reactors would dramatically raise the dangers of a radiation leak, scientists have warned. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) confirmed a fire in Fukushima Daiichi's No 4 reactor on Tuesday, following an explosion that damaged the structure housing the massive concrete pools storing fuel rods used in the reactor. A further fire broke out at the No 3 reactor on Wednesday, where a fuel storage pool had overheated and may have let off radioactive steam. Nuclear engineers warn there is more radioactive material stored in those pools than in the reactor core – and a fire would increase the chances of radiation spreading. \"If the spent fuel pool is on fire, the chances of radioactivity getting to the public are very much higher,\" said David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He said the unit's reactor core was emptied out into the spent fuel pool last year following a shutdown. \"There is much more material there because there is at least one reactor core plus what there was to start with, and it is in a building that has a big hole in the side of it,\" he said. Scientists began raising concern about the possibilities of fire and radiation leak from the waste sites on Monday. Robert Alvarez, a senior policy expert at the Institute of Policy Studies, told a conference call with reporters that satellite pictures of the Fukushima plant showed evidence of damage. \"There is clear evidence that the fuel cask cranes that haul spent fuels to and from the reactor to the pool both fell. They are gone,\" he said. \"There appears to be copious amounts of steam pouring out of the area where the pool is located.\" The damage confronts technicians with the tasks of cooling both the reactor and the fuel pools, where temperatures also began rising dangerously once the nuclear plants lost power. \"The spent fuel pool in unit 4 is boiling, and once that starts you can't stop it,\" said Jim Riccio, a nuclear expert at Greenpeace. \"The threat is that if you boil off the water, the metal cladding on the fuel rods that is exposed to the air, and is volatile, will catch fire. That will propel the radiation even further.\" A 2005 report by the National Academy of Sciences warned of just such a danger. The study said the spent fuel pools put America at risk of a widespread radiation leak in the event of a terrorist attack. It went on to warn of a radiation leak travelling hundreds of miles causing up to 6,000 cancer deaths. The report urged immediate action to secure the pools. But even that report – though dire – was not new. In the early 1990s, a number of nuclear engineers – including Lochbaum – warned about the dangerous situation of spent atomic fuel in US plants that were built along the same lines as those in Fukushima. The engineers called for nuclear waste to be stored instead in dry casks at a distance from the reactors. Their story made the cover of Time magazine. It did not, however, lead to any improvements in nuclear safety, Lochbaum noted. \"It was a design mistake to put the spent fuel in the same building as the reactor,\" he said. The proximity makes it much harder for technicians struggling to cool down the reactor and the spent fuel pool at the same time. \"They are Siamese twins, you can't separate them,\" Lochbaum said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/may/17/tories-cower-under-ballistic-balls","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-17T17:16:30Z","webTitle":"Tories cower under ballistic Balls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/17/tories-cower-under-ballistic-balls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/may/17/tories-cower-under-ballistic-balls","fields":{"headline":"Tories cower under ballistic Balls","bodyText":"Outside, the euro's life appeared to be drawing noisily towards its close. In the Commons, Ed Balls was noisily just getting started. Gosh, he seemed furious, though unlike David Cameron's occasional rages, it was synthetic. But pretty terrifying nonetheless. I would not happily face it. You could shove the shadow chancellor on a roof in the east end of London, and the Olympics would be entirely safe from airborne attack. He fired away like a cluster of mortars. Every time a Tory backbencher stood up to read out an intervention provided by the whips, he brought them down with statistics he must have had provided from every Tory seat in the country, \"In your constituency, youth unemployment has risen 169%,\" he told someone. Each intervention increased his ersatz fury, like Frankenstein's monster jolted by the lightning bolts. The greater his own tumult, the more he blamed the Tories for being overexcited. \"Calm down!\" he said, six times at one point. The prime minister was ignoring all the evidence around him. \"He is sitting like a teenager in the front row of the class listening only to his headphones!\" He spoke so fast that words were halved as they tried to flee his larynx. \"Disappointment\" became \"dissment\". \"Startling\" was \"starling\". \"Plan A has failed here, and plan A has failed in the eurozone, too! The economy is in recession, and they hate it!\" he cried, waving his speech at the Tories as if it were a machete. \"You love it!\" someone shouted back, but it was like trying to be heard over Niagara falls. He ended with a riff about an opinion poll in which 1,800 people – he claimed – had been asked if they thought that George Osborne was suited to his job as chancellor. Only 1%, or 18 people, had said they thought he was. \"The question is, who on earth are those 18 people? They must be vegan, health-freak, cyclist millionaires who hate cars, caravans and holidays and think that pensioners get a cushy deal. So, apart from Steve Hilton, who are the other 17?\" Mr Osborne didn't try to answer. Earlier, there was a splendid scene at energy questions. Tessa Munt, a Liberal Democrat, had asked a question about nuclear power. The junior minister, the Tory Charles Hendry, answered it. He then – I presume by accident – sat back down on top of the senior minister, Ed Davey, a Lib Dem. This caused Ms Munt to corpse, and she could barely squeeze out her supplementary for laughing. Mr Hendry said gravely that the cause of the humour was the fact that he had inadvertently sat on the secretary of state, \"which shows our commitment to acting seamlessly together\". Well, you might call it that, sunshine, I thought. But there are a lot of your colleagues who would regard sitting down on the Lib Dems, possibly on a permanent basis, as a very good way of handling them. And what a sight it would be – David Cameron conducting prime minister's questions from his position exactly on top of Nick Clegg, like one of those recliners you can buy for watching television. He could even use Clegg's hands as beverage holders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/jul/29/beijing-investors-flock-to-london","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-28T23:04:00Z","webTitle":"Beijing's champion investors flock to London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/29/beijing-investors-flock-to-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/jul/29/beijing-investors-flock-to-london","fields":{"headline":"Beijing's champion investors flock to London","bodyText":"China blew previous Olympic hosts out of the water by pumping £20bn into the Beijing Games, which memorably closed with the spectacle of fireworks exploding in the shape of the interlocking rings. The monster budget was a not-very-subtle display of China's financial firepower. The striking bird's nest stadium, with its ribbons of steel, was a symbol of the huge country's economic prowess. And though the Olympic cauldron may now be burning in east London, Beijing is still flexing its financial muscles. On Friday senior UK government ministers courted Chinese industrialists at a summit in the capital as the coalition desperately tries to pull in overseas investors to Britain. China is already the second-largest overseas investor in London, and the third biggest in the UK as a whole. It has the outspoken backing of the UK government: on a trip to the world's second-largest economy in January, George Osborne encouraged investors there to put money into British transport, energy and utility projects. Three days later, China Investment Corporation (CIC), the country's sovereign wealth fund, bought a 9% stake in Thames Water. And a few days ago, Wales &amp; West Utilities, the company that operates Wales's gas infrastructure, was sold to a Chinese consortium in a £645m deal. Chinese oil enterprises have also just bought two North Sea oil fields in one day, albeit from Canadian companies: China's top refiner, Sinopec, acquired a $1.5bn stake in the North Sea operations of Talisman, while the China National Offshore Oil Corporation splashed out $15bn on Nexen. The deep-pocketed Chinese are now the power behind the throne of British companies ranging from Thames Water and Scotland's biggest mainland oil refinery, Grangemouth, to Weetabix, bespoke suitmaker Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Harvey Nichols and Pringle. The UK drew the line when the privately-owned telecoms group Huawei offered to pay for mobile phone coverage on the underground as a gift between Olympic nations, but it is already BT's strategic partner in developing the national broadband network in Britain and on Friday promised to create 200 new UK jobs. Its chairman, Sun Yafang, praised the UK's \"free and open market\" and \"efficient, supportive and transparent government\". All that cash comes from one pool of money: China's massive stockpile of foreign exchange reserves, worth about £2tn at present, says Aman Wang, the London-based head of KPMG's global China practice. Most of the funds flow to CIC and the state administration of foreign exchange, an arm of China's central bank. The UK continues to attract more foreign investment than any other European country, creating more than 112,000 jobs in the last year, a near 20% increase on the previous year, business secretary Vince Cable announced last week. So what gives Britain the edge? Wang cites the flexible labour market vis-a-vis countries like Germany and France, a wealth of senior managerial staff and financial talent, a benign tax regime and high-end manufacturing expertise in areas such as aviation. \"Politically it's a relatively open environment for foreign investors,\" he adds. \"The UK government has done a reasonably good job promoting the infrastructure sector at national level, and at state level Scotland and Wales have been promoting themselves.\" Just last week, it emerged that China also harbours ambitions to become a major player in the UK energy industry by building a series of new nuclear power stations. Two Beijing-backed energy groups are in separate talks to buy the Horizon consortium, which plans to build two UK reactors, from its German owners E.ON and RWE. China's companies are pushing forward globally: Chinese investment abroad has swelled from an annual average of below $3bn before 2005 to more than $60bn in 2010 and 2011, according to a recent report by consultancy Rhodium Group, which specialises in China. Garry Pass, managing director of NVC UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of China's largest lighting company, says: \"We welcome people here a lot more than other European countries.\" The company is supplying lighting to the 2012 Olympics, having started from a London office in 2009 with a sales force of 10 and two designers. Sales were £6,000 then. That figure ballooned to £2m by May 2012. And now the firm is plotting its expansion into mainland Europe, using Britain as a base – a common strategy. • This article was amended on 30 July 2012.

Barack Obama has reiterated that Washington is prepared to accept Tehran maintaining a peaceful nuclear power programme, but at the same time the White House is becoming more explicit in warning that the negotiations beginning in Istanbul on Friday are \"perhaps a last chance\" for diplomacy to work. Diplomats say Iran will be pressed by the permanent UN security council members plus Germany, known as the P5+1, to shut its underground nuclear facility at Fordo, to stop enriching uranium to 20%, and to hand over the estimated 100kg of uranium already enriched to that level. The demands match those made by Binyamin Netanyahu at a White House meeting last month at which Obama pressed the Israeli prime minister to hold off from a military attack on Iran and give sanctions and diplomacy an opportunity to work. Britain and France are also pushing for Iran to dismantle those parts of its nuclear programme that could be used for weapons. Netanyahu repeated the three requirements in a meeting with the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, on Sunday. He also warned against allowing Iran to use the talks \"to delay and deceive\". The Israeli prime minister also said in an interview with Maariv newspaper (link in Hebrew) at the weekend that the underground nuclear facility at Fordo must be shut down. \"What do they need it for?\" he asked. \"I think we should make very explicit demands about ending all enrichment and the removal of enriched material and converting the nuclear programme back [to non-military use]. If we come with clear requirements along with the threat of more sanctions then it's possible there could be a result. But if there are sanctions without demands, then the sanctions will not help. Our goal is not the talks but the result. The result is an end to Iran's nuclear programme.\" Iran has said it will not close the Fordo facility nor surrender enriched uranium. The head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Fereydoon Abbasi-Davani, told the Iranian state news agency both demands were irrational. He said the Fordo facility was built underground because of the threat of attack by Israel and the US. \"If they do not threaten us and guarantee that no aggression will occur, then there would be no need for countries to build facilities underground. They should change their behaviour and language,\" he said. \"We do not see any rationale for such a request from the P5+1\". However, he repeated the Iranian leadership's assertion that Tehran has no intention of producing large amounts of 20% enriched uranium. It is not clear that Washington can carry all of the P5+1 in pressing the demand for Fordo to be dismantled, particularly with Russia and China prepared to give Tehran room for manoeuvre. One diplomat suggested that Washington may be emphasising the issue in order to satisfy the Israelis but that the group may be prepared to settle for an agreement to freeze the number of centrifuges at Fordo, which are believed to be too few to produce weapons-grade uranium at a pace sufficient to develop a bomb in the foreseeable future. Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, made little mention of the Fordo facility itself and instead dwelled on the uranium on Sunday. He warned that for the major powers to accept anything less than the demand for an end to enrichment would be a victory for Tehran. Barak told CNN: \"We told our American friends as well as the Europeans that we would have expected the pressure for successful negotiations to be clear – namely that the P5+1 will demand clearly, no more enrichment to 20% [and] all the already enriched 20% material out of the country.\" \"But if the P5+1 will settle for a much lower threshold, like just stop enriching to 20%, it means that basically the Iranians, at a very cheap cost, bought their way into continuing their military programme. Slightly slower but without sanctions. That will be a total change of direction for the worse.\" The Israeli defence minister added that while oil and banking sanctions have clearly had an impact, causing inflation in Iran to nearly double to 21.5% in urban areas, he doubted they would be enough to force Tehran's hand. \"We hope for the better but I don't believe that this amount of sanctions and pressure will bring the Iranian leadership to the conclusion that they have to stop their nuclear military programme.\" Barak repeated his view that while matters will not come to a head within weeks, it will not take years, either. Israel is itself an undeclared nuclear power with an undetermined number of atom bombs. Obama continues to throw his weight behind diplomacy and sanctions while warning he will use force as a last resort. Washington, however, does not believe there is the urgency that Israel claims, in part because the White House is sceptical that Iran is as close to being able to develop a nuclear weapon as Netanyahu says. Last month in Washington, the Israeli prime minister publicly derided sanctions and claims that Tehran is not already engaged in developing a nuclear weapon. The US president has sent several messages to Tehran in recent days warning that this is perhaps the last chance to negotiate an end to the crisis. The most recent was passed via the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at a meeting in South Korea on nuclear non-proliferation. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has also pressed the message that time is running out for negotiations. She said last week that the US was taking part in the talks in Turkey because they may be \"a last chance to demonstrate a way forward that can satisfy the international community's concerns and have Iran come forward and accept limitations on what they are able to do\". Clinton warned that she did \"not want the Iranians to go into it with the attitude of that we can just keep it open and never have to come to any outcome\". The talks will be the first in more than a year. The last round failed after Iran refused to abide by UN resolutions to stop enriching uranium to higher grades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/12/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-12T09:06:00Z","webTitle":"North Korea stages nuclear test in defiance of bans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/12/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/12/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake","fields":{"headline":"North Korea stages nuclear test in defiance of bans","bodyText":"North Korea has drawn widespread condemnation after conducting a nuclear test in defiance of international bans – a development signalled by an earthquake detected in the country and later confirmed by the regime. The test, which took place in the north-east of the country just before noon local time, could bring North Korea a step closer to developing a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a long-range missile and possibly bringing the west coast of the US within striking distance. The authorities in Pyongyang said scientists had set off a \"miniaturised\" nuclear device with a greater explosive force than those used in two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009. \"It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment,\" KCNA, the North's official news agency, announced. The agency said the test had been in response to \"outrageous\" US hostility that \"violently\" undermined the regime's right to peacefully launch satellites – a reference to the condemnation and tighter sanctions that greeted Pyongyang's successful rocket launch almost two months ago. Tuesday's test was quickly condemned by the UN general secretary, Ban Ki-moon, who said it was \"deplorable\" that Pyongyang had defied international calls to abandon it, adding that it was a \"clear and grave violation of the relevant UN security council resolutions\". Barack Obama said the test was a highly provocative act that violated security council resolutions and posed a threat to US and international security. The US president called for \"further swift and credible action by the international community\" against North Korea. China, once North Korea's closest ally, said it strongly opposed the test and warned North Korea to avoid any actions that could worsen the situation on the Korean peninsula. \"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, heedless of widespread international opposition, has again carried out a nuclear test, to which the Chinese government expresses its firm opposition,\" the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. \"It is China's firm stance to realise non-nuclearisation for the Korean peninsula and prevent nuclear proliferation and maintain peace and stability in northeast Asia,\" the statement said. Russia's foreign ministry said the Kremlin \"decisively condemned\" the test. William Hague, the UK foreign secretary, joined the international chorus of condemnation and warned that North Korea faced further isolation if it did not stop developing its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. Officials in South Korea, Japan and the US had earlier announced they were almost certain a controlled nuclear explosion had taken place at or near the site where the North's two previous tests were conducted. Diplomats said the UN security council was convening an emergency meeting in response, although with so many sanctions already in place against the regime following precious nuclear tests and rocket launches it is not clear what options remain open to the international community. Any push for a fresh round of sanctions could take weeks and come up against opposition from China, the North's only remaining ally and its biggest aid donor. Beijing had not commented on the test by mid-afternoon local time but had reportedly called on its neighbour not to go through with it. The US, South Korea, Japan and European nations are expected to call anyway for a fresh round of sanctions against the North for defying previous security council resolutions banning it from testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. A UN body that monitors nuclear tests said earlier it had detected an \"unusual seismic event\" in North Korea. \"The event shows clear explosion-like characteristics and its location is roughly congruent with the 2006 and 2009 [North Korea] nuclear tests,\" said Tibor Toth, the executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation in Vienna. The agency said it constituted \"a clear threat to international peace and security, and challenges efforts made to strengthen global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, in particular by ending nuclear testing\". Seismic activity had been picked up by the US geological survey and monitoring stations in South Korea. It appeared to be a more powerful blast than the North's two previous tests. Experts in South Korea, the US and Japan put the quake at magnitudes of between 4.7 and 5.2. Earthquakes of magnitude 3.9 and 4.5 respectively were detected in the North's 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. The US geological survey said Tuesday's seismic activity had been of magnitude 4.9. Yosuke Igarashi, an official at the Japan Meteorological Agency, said: \"A natural earthquake normally starts with a smaller tremor followed by a larger one. This quake's strength was the same throughout.\" The South Korean government raised its military alert level, while Japan was preparing to dispatch military aircraft to look for signs of atmospheric radiation. In Tokyo, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called an emergency meeting of his security council to discuss Japan's response. \"I have ordered that we consider every possible way to address this issue, including our own sanctions, while co-operating with other countries,\" he said after the meeting. Tensions have been running high in the region since North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test in protest at fresh UN sanctions imposed after the regime successfully launched a satellite into orbit in mid-December. The North again raised the diplomatic stakes when its most powerful military body, the National Defence Commission, warned that its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes were targeted at the US. Any progress the North makes in its missile and nuclear programmes is a cause for concern, although it is thought to be some way off having the ability to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to mount on a reliable long-range missile. North Korea has enough plutonium to build between four and eight nuclear weapons, according to Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear scientist who visited the country's main Yongbyon nuclear complex in 2010. Other reports suggest the country has enough fissile material for about a dozen plutonium warheads. In 2009, the regime said it would begin enriching uranium, giving it another means of building a nuclear arsenal. Speculation had been mounting that this third test could involve a uranium device – a clear signal that North Korea's scientists have mastered the ability to produce highly enriched uranium. In October 2012, a spokesman from the North's national defence commission told state media the country had built a missile capable of striking the US but did not provide further details. A missile featured in an April 2012 military parade appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile but its authenticity has not been verified by foreign experts. Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group in Seoul said: \"The question is whether things could spiral. I agree there should be some costs and consequences, but as far as believing the consequences should deter them – I think that's wishful thinking. \"The [North Koreans] view the world as hostile and menacing; and if even China is hostile, then even more so. Other people might think OK, they will be more cautious and have second thoughts because even China will take action. But from their point of view it reaffirms why they need [a nuclear programme]. When the world is like this, do you not want to be a nuclear power?\" Analysts said the test, like the previous two, was designed to strengthen the North's bargaining position as the US, South Korea, Russia, China and Japan attempt to restart talks on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme. Dr Leonid Petrov, a North Korea expert at the Australian National University, said it would bolster the North's case for describing itself as a genuine nuclear state. \"Obviously the [North Koreans] are not going to bargain and are not going to give up the nuclear options,\" Petrov said. \"We have passed already the point of no return: North Korea is de facto a nuclear state, all we can do is minimise the damage.\" Petrov suggested the North might be willing to freeze its civilian nuclear programme if given sufficient incentives, such as the loosening of international sanctions. It would also need assurances, particularly from the US, that it would not be the target of attempts at regime change or military strikes. The only alternative, he said, was a pre-emptive strike that could miss many of the country's underground nuclear sites and raise the dangerous prospect of a counter-attack. Petrov said the North's determination to push ahead with its nuclear programme was a failure of diplomacy that began with the administration of George Bush, who described the country as part of an \"axis of evil\" when Washington adopted a tougher stance in 2002. \"The world is now a much more dangerous place,\" Petrov said. \"It's very sad.\" Kim Min-seok, a South Korean defence ministry spokesman, said the North had informed China and the US in advance of its intention to conduct the test but could not say when the message was relayed. Petrov said that, if true, the decision to inform other nations in advance was a marked change in the regime's approach under its leader, Kim Jong-un, who has been in power just over a year. Kim has shown no sign of ditching the nuclear ambitions of his father, Kim Jong-il, but has been more open than the country's former leader about his regime's intentions, having also given notice of its recent satellite launch using a ballistic rocket. • Read the latest developments on this story here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2012/mar/29/north-sea-oil-revenue-squandered","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-29T15:10:50Z","webTitle":"Britain has squandered the golden opportunity that North Sea oil promised","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/mar/29/north-sea-oil-revenue-squandered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2012/mar/29/north-sea-oil-revenue-squandered","fields":{"headline":"Britain has squandered golden opportunity North Sea oil promised","bodyText":"Back in the 1970s, North Sea oil and gas were the great hope for the British economy. The UK had struggled to keep up with its European rivals in the three decades after the second world war, but the discoveries on the continental shelf were supposed to bring about a new Klondike gold rush. Britain would be self-sufficient in energy and the revenues from the North Sea would modernise the economy. Getting on for four decades later, North Sea resources are running dry. Figures released by the Department for Energy and Climate Change on Thursday showed that oil production in 2011 was more than 17% lower than in the previous year. A total of 1.04m barrels a day was pumped, down from a peak of 2.7m in 1999, and the lowest since the 1970s. Gas imports were higher than production for the first time since 1967, the year the Beatles released Sgt Pepper. George Osborne included a measure in his budget last week designed to end the uncertainty over the tax treatment of decommissioning rigs, hoping that the UK can extract every last drop of oil from the North Sea fields. This was welcomed by the industry, but doesn't change the grim truth: output is in terminal decline. And what has Britain got to show for this bonanza? Not much. Norway has used its North Sea revenues to amass a sovereign wealth fund that will help the country adjust to an ageing population. Britain used its oil and gas receipts to pay for mass unemployment, tax cuts and current government spending. Boasts that the black gold would retool British industry proved utterly hollow. If anything, oil added to the woes of manufacturing, since sterling's status as a petro-currency drove up the exchange rate and made exports uncompetitive. A fraction of the billions creamed off by the Treasury might have been used as the capital for a national investment bank, but neither Conservative nor Labour governments saw fit to use the receipts for this purpose. Lower North Sea oil production is one reason for Britain's weak economic recovery and makes it harder for Osborne to balance the books. Even more worryingly, acute energy dependency looms. The coal mines have closed; the older nuclear power stations are on their last legs; the gush from the North Sea will soon be a mere dribble. An entire era can be summed up in three words: discovered, extracted, squandered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-evacuate-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-11T20:35:52Z","webTitle":"Japan earthquake forces thousands to evacuate in nuclear plant emergency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-evacuate-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-evacuate-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Japan earthquake forces thousands to evacuate in nuclear plant emergency","bodyText":"Japan has declared an emergency at two nuclear power plants as technicians struggle to restore crippled cooling systems and prevent catastrophic meltdowns following the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Thousands of people had been evacuated from their homes on Friday after the Japanese government declared a nuclear emergency, and the trade minister admitted that a radiation leak was a distinct possibility as concerns mounted that the cooling system at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power station had failed, with grave implications for the integrity of hundreds of tonnes of radioactive fuel at the site. The sight of 2,800 local residents forced to flee their homes evoked the scenes after the Chernobyl accident in theUkraine, almost exactly 25 years ago. Japanese authorities said pressure was rising inside the plant with the risk of a radiation leak, according to the Jiji news agency. One British atomic engineer said the evacuation of 2,800 citizens suggested a radioactive leak remained a possibility. \"It looks very serious. Obviously we do not know exactly what is going on but evacuating people is normally only a matter of last resort when there is only one containment layer left to be breached,\" said John Large, a member of the British Nuclear Engineering Society and a fellow of the Royal Society. A Japanese nuclear safety panel said radiation levels were 1,000 times above normal in a reactor control room after the quake. Some radiation had seeped outside the plant, with levels just outside the facility's main gate measured at eight times normal, Public Broadcaster NHK quoted nuclear safety officials as saying. The safety officials said there was \"no immediate health hazard\" to nearby residents from the leakage, which they described as \"minute\", and people were urged to evacuate calmly. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said as he boarded a helicopter to visit the plant that the government had expanded the evacuation radius around the plant from two miles to six. Reports of a breakdown in the cooling systems in three of four reactors at Fukushima-Daini compounded fears of a new disaster. For much of Friday, nuclear safety officials and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates both plants, had been focused on a failed cooling system in a single reactor at Fukushima-Daiichi. But early this morning, the company reported the failure of an additional reactor at Fukushima-Daiichi and at the second plant, Fukushima-Daini. The Japanese government ordered further evacuations and warned of a small risk of a radiation leak as technicians tried to release vapour at the Fukushima Daiichi plant to lower pressure and prevent a meltdown. The chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, said the amount of radioactive element in the vapor would be \"very small\" and would not endanger the environment or human health. \"With evacuation in place and the ocean-bound wind, we can ensure the safety,\" he told a press conference. The authorities expanded the evacuation zone on Saturday, and ordered people within a 25km radius to stay indoors. News reports suggested that the earthquake had shut down electricity to the cooling systems of the reactors. A back-up diesel powered generator was knocked out by the tsunami an hour later. Without electricity, the reactor will not be able to pump water to cool its hot reactor core, possibly leading to a meltdown or some other release of radioactive material. If radioactivity has broken through into the final dome over the top of the plant, this would put the incident on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in the US, which cost $1bn. Another nuclear expert said that if the water cooling system had broken down, the consequences could be dire. \"One critical safety issue is the maintenance of water cooling systems to ensure that the nuclear fuel inside the reactor core does not heat up to unsafe levels,\" said Shaun Burnie, a consultant to the nuclear industry. He said the reactor's operator, Tokyo Electric, had apparently been unable to pump cooling water into the 40-year-old reactors for at least three hours. \"The possibility is that the reactor fuel is already damaged. If they are unable to restore coolant pump capacity then the fuel will continue to heat up and eventually be exposed to air at which point a whole series of events can unfold, including steam explosions, fuel meltdown and in the worst case, loss of containment. The last thing the people of Japan need after the tragedy of this earthquake and tsunami is a nuclear catastrophe.\" Others cautioned that it was too soon to declare that a nuclear disaster was imminent. Sue Ion, fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said the evacuations could equally be a sensible precaution and noted that Japanese reactors were built to withstand the rigours of nature in an earthquake-prone part of the world. \"As this is an earthquake zone, the Japanese apply very rigorous standards, with robust designs and regulations,\" she said. Paul Haigh, a fellow of the Institution of Chemical Engineers, added: \"All Japanese reactors are designed to withstand substantial earthquakes. Instrumentation is provided for the early detection of tremors which would lead to a controlled shutdown of the reactor. These systems appear to have successfully shut down the affected reactors. Modern western reactors, including those planned for the UK, are already designed to withstand significant seismic events.\" The incident would not undermine public faith in nuclear energy, Ion predicted. \"People should gain confidence from the fact that these plants have shut down as they should be.\" The nuclear industry is currently in the middle of a surprise renaissance with dozens of new plants planned in Britain, America and China amid deeper public worries about energy shortages and low carbon ways of tackling climate change. The sector had hoped fears about safety had receded in the public mind and was steeling itself for a wave of bad publicity surrounding the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl, where work is still under way to dismantle the plant and make safe spilled radioactive fuel. This plant – built and operated under the Soviet system – blew up during a safety test although the accident was blamed on a mixture of bad design and human error. Failure of the cooling system – and the diesel back-up generator – at the Fukushima 1 plant in Onahama raises questions about what has gone wrong so far and what could happen in future. Another British nuclear engineer, who asked not to be named, said: \"It is difficult to know exactly what has happened here, but any shutdown is expensive and any system failures of wider concern. The cooling systems around the reactors are driven primarily by nuclear power but if that is not working then via diesel generator.\" Large said any complete power outage would quickly lead to the reactor overheating and the potential meltdown of the fuel under temperatures that could reach 1,200C. Different mechanical and chemical reactions could potentially lead to a hydrogen explosion, he added. All of this could be \"astronomically\" expensive given the heavily populated and insured population of Japan, said Large, who has visited Fukushima. The engineer said he was concerned that the nuclear industry and local political system had a reputation for considerable secrecy that would not make it easy to discern what had gone wrong. Earthquakes often close Japanese nuclear plants, some of which are built close to known fault lines. In 1999, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009 reactors shut down because of seismic activity. Confidence in Japan's nuclear safety was dented by a series of scandals in the late 90s when the Tokyo Electric Power Company, owner of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, admitted falsifying safety data and concealing cracks in the core structures of its reactors. The same plant was seriously damaged by an earthquake in 2007, but the owners tried to conceal a radiation leak. Much of the plant had to be closed for 21 months at a cost of more than $3bn.

Bill O'Reilly Bill O'Reilly was deeply sympathetic to the plight of the people in Japan who are struggling to cope with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, and the developing nuclear disaster, but his main focus, as always, was the potential consequences for America, which he discussed with two expert guests, Rita King, a former nuclear industry journalist and Dr Daniel Branovan, president of Project Chernobyl (view clip; read transcript). Neither guest sought to downplay the longterm harmful effects of radiation or the possibility of similar disasters occurring in the US. King pointed out that at least two nuclear reactors located in California (a seismic zone that many experts say is long overdue a massive earthquake) are only built to withstand a 7.5 magnitude quake. She also pointed out that 8% of the nation's population live within a 50 mile radius of the oldest reactor in the US, Indian Point, (located about 35 miles north of midtown Manhattan), which, though not in a seismic zone, has already had a lot of problems and probably does not meet current safety standards. Dr Branovan discussed the dangers of radiation and said that in Chernobyl, hundreds died from immediate exposure but tens of millions were affected by low-level exposure and incidents of thyroid cancer abounded years after the incident. O'Reilly agreed that exposure to radiation is hard to measure and that the long-term consequences take a while to manifest. Look what happened with 9/11 with breathing in that debris and then it comes seven, eight years later, where they have all kinds of health problems. That's what you are seeing at Chernobyl: it took a long time for the health problems to develop in some people there. Yet, O'Reilly remained concerned that our attempts to increase our reliance on nuclear power and to build more nuclear power stations in the US may be stymied now because of the disaster in Japan. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume agreed with him, saying that already you are hearing comments from people all over the place saying that we should perhaps be seeking out alternatives, which neither man thought realistic. Isn't it prudent, though … look, to be realistic, we are not going to get away from foreign oil unless we get an expansion of nuclear power. Alternative fuels are not going to be ready for decades on a mass level. Now people are going \"uh-oh\". Saying, look, Diablo Canyon [one of the plants in California], the plant here in New York, all these things are not built to withstand a calamity like a 9 on a Richter scale earthquake. People will say, \"Well, then, we don't want them.\" You don't often hear Bill O'Reilly talking about the need to move away from dependence on foreign oil, so that's progress I suppose. Yet it seems that no matter how high the cost or the body count (from either oil spills or nuclear power accidents), both he and Brit Hume still seem to think that steering any investment toward alternative forms of energy that would almost certainly be less dangerous and, possibly in the long run, cheaper is still absolutely out of the question. Sean Hannity Hannity discussed the potential dangers of exposure to radiation with a panel of experts including Jay Lehr from the Heartland Institute, Margaret Harding, a nuclear safety consultant, and Ira Helfand, a member of the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility (two pro-nuke experts and one not so pro). Hannity asks Lehr (in the pro camp) how realistic the threat of a meltdown is and whether the people within close range of the reactors are at risk (view clip). Lehr assured Hannity that he can attest \"with the utmost confidence there will not be any health impact of anything that's going at at the Fukushima power plant.\" Hannity asked Ira Helfand if he agreed with Lehr's assessment. Helfand replied that he could not disagree more because although we cannot tell yet if there will be a significant breach of containment at the plant, such an occurrence is certainly possible. Helfand also indicated that the fact that workers have had to resort to unprecedented measures, not in the playbook, such as pumping sea water into the reactors even though that will destroy them (and lead to long-term power supply disruptions) should be a cause for concern. That was all he got to say, and Hannity allowed the rest of the discussion to be monopolised by Margaret Harding and Jay Lehr, who both tried to reassure viewers that everything at the Japanese plant was working according to plan and there was no real cause for concern. Glenn Beck Glenn Beck was back from vacation and ready to stick it to the New York Times for suggesting last week that Fox News may not renew his contract at the end of the year because he is \"crazy\", \"apocalyptic\" and that he's \"kind of a downer to watch\" (view clip). He pointed to some recent Times headlines, such as \"Japanese scramble to avert nuclear meltdown\", which he countered were also fairly apocalyptic and kind of a downer. And so he vowed to shed some sunlight on the Japanese situation and to assure his viewers that while the earthquake and tsunami are very bad things, the nuclear meltdown is really nothing to work up a sweat about. The size and magnitude (of the tsunami) is mind-boggling. Thousands today are dead in Japan and missing. But out of all of the things that could go wrong, and they did, of all of the things that would affect the lives of the average Japanese person and affect your life, I'm trying to figure out how it (the meltdown) is even in the top three? I'm looking at this story and, at best, I see a lazy media. So, determined not to be lumped in with the rest of the lazy journalists who are spreading stories about radiation and broadcasting images of reactors exploding and acting like it's a big deal, Beck decides to demonstrate with the assistance of some props (a wok, a steamer, a saucepan, a cutlery container and some tubes of M&amp;Ms) why we should not be in any fear of falling ill or dying from exposure to radiation. Beck puts the tubes of M&amp;Ms (which represent nuclear rods) into the cutlery container and then into the steamer (the nuclear reactor) which he seals tightly. Then he places the \"nuclear reactor\" into a large saucepan and seals it off with an upturned wok. Beck then explains that the footage we saw on our televisions of the reactors exploding was just the upturned wok or lid being blown off the saucepan but that the steamer inside, with the nuclear pellets, was still intact. Having thus reassured his audience that there is nothing whatsoever to worry about, he chastises the mainstream media (like the New York times) once again for their fear-mongering tendencies. So, why would the media focus on the Japanese nuclear meltdown and try to tell you that you should prepare in California because of an earthquake?! If you're living in California and you don't know you could be hit with an earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear power plant sliding into the ocean, you're too dumb to live anyway! You can see why Beck gets frustrated that he's the one being called apocalyptic. • This article was amended at 15:55 GMT on 16 March.

Yesterday, Sir Mark Walport took the reins as the government's chief scientific adviser, the eleventh scientist (all of them men) to occupy that post since it was created by Harold Wilson in 1964. In a seamless Doctor Who-style transition (another early-60s institution which has survived through eleven incarnations) those who follow @uksciencechief on Twitter saw Sir John Beddington's trademark beard shimmer and then vanish, to be replaced by Walport's freshly-trimmed moustache. A new era was underway. Walport arrives in Whitehall following a highly successful decade as director of the Wellcome Trust. He is a seasoned political operator who knows how to forge alliances and steer a path through the corridors of power. On his appointment, Sir Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, echoed the views of many in the scientific community when he said \"we have absolutely the right person for the job.\" A few months ago, not long after Walport was confirmed as the next government chief scientific adviser (GCSA), I heard him speak at an event for biology students in Cambridge. It was an accomplished, inspiring talk, but what stuck with me was Walport's reference to Microcosmographica Academica, a short pamphlet published in 1908, which he recommended to his audience of young researchers as his preferred guide to the politics of science and academic life. Written by Frances Cornford, a Cambridge academic, Microcosmographica Academica is a biting satire on universities, with relevance to many other institutions. It begins with a warning: My heart is full of pity for you, oh young academic politician. If you will be a politician you have a painful path to follow, even though it be a short one, before you nestle down into a modest incompetence. While you are young you will be oppressed, and angry, and increasingly disagreeable. When you reach middle age, at five-and-thirty, you will become complacent and, in your turn, an oppressor; those whom you oppress will find you still disagreeable; and so will all the people whose toes you trod upon in youth….If you persist to the threshold of old age - your fiftieth year, let us say - you will be a powerful person yourself, with an accretion of peculiarities which other people will have to study in order to square you. Cornford goes on to explain two blocking tactics that will be wearily familiar to anyone who has worked in academia or Whitehall. First, the principle of the \"dangerous precedent\": that \"every public action which is not customary, either is wrong, or, if it is right, is a dangerous precedent. It follows that nothing should be done for the first time.\" Second, the principle of \"the wedge\": that \"you should not act justly now for fear of raising expectations that you may act still more justly in the future.\" In essence, Microcosmographica Academica is a plea for a more honest approach to politics, and a practical guide to getting things done, whatever obstacles others may place in your way. Walport is right that it's a brilliant read; it may also yield some insights into what makes him tick. In an editorial endorsing Walport's appointment, the journal Nature noted that one of the hallmarks of the GCSA role is its flexibility; \"to a great extent the job is what the holder makes of it.\" At Wellcome, Walport was a strong advocate for genomics research and open access publishing. What are his likely priorities as GCSA? Let me list seven items that I'd expect to find high on Walport's 'to do' list: 1. Build on Beddington's legacy Walport's predecessor is widely judged to have had a successful tenure as GCSA; a recent Guardian editorial praised John Beddington for having 'trodden a thin line with grace.' Probably his greatest achievement was to have extended the network of departmental chief scientific advisers into every corner of Whitehall, and to encourage it to work in a more collegiate way across government, supported by a strengthened science and engineering profession within the civil service. Updated guidelines were also produced for the use of scientific advice in policy following the controversial sacking of Professor David Nutt by the Home Secretary in 2009. Walport needs to ensure that the CSA network is preserved, and these guidelines are adhered to, avoiding any further bust-ups between science advisers and their ministers. 2. Position science within a leaner, meaner Whitehall Walport is taking over at a turbulent time, as government departments grapple with dwindling budgets, civil service reform and a new emphasis on 'open policymaking', which looks to draw external sources of expertise into the policy process. With structures for scientific advice still fragile in some quarters of Whitehall, and departmental research budgets vulnerable to ever deeper cuts in the next spending review, Walport needs to position the CSAs and the science and engineering profession at the vanguard of Whitehall reform - an example of open policymaking in practice - and tightly aligned to broader efforts to promote evidence-based policy, including the use of randomised controlled trials and the establishment by the Cabinet Office of a network of 'what works' evidence centres. 3. Bang the drum for investment in research Making the case for research funding is not a formal part of the GCSA's remit, but the scientific community will inevitably look to Walport for leadership on this issue, particularly in the run-up to the 2015 general election and subsequent spending review. Walport's own background as the head of a premier league funder, with vocal opinions on the organisation of the research and innovation system, make it even more likely that he will engage. The challenge here is to maintain the commitment to robust evidence that the GCSA is meant to bring to all areas of policy, and avoid falling into a tribal defence of particular budgets or funding models. Kieron Flanagan has described some of the challenges here. Creating a UK equivalent to the US 'science of science policy' programme is one way that Walport could boost the evidence base for investment. He should also wield the collective clout of the Prime Minister's Council for Science and Technology, with its impressive line-up of business and academic leaders, to produce an agenda-setting report on research investment ahead of the next election. 4. Champion the full breadth of academic expertise Scientific advisers are in some ways intended to provide a bulwark against the traditional dominance of economics within Whitehall. But in recent years, the network of CSAs has expanded to include a handful of engineers, economists and social scientists. Given the momentum now building behind evidence-based policy, and the benefits that often flow from examining problems through an interdisciplinary lens, Walport has an opportunity to become a champion within government for the breadth of all that the natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, arts and humanities have to offer. The alternative will be a growing clamour from particular disciplines for their own advisory structures which, as I argued here recently, is a clumsy solution. The ultimate end-point could be a collapse in the distinction between the government economic service, the science and engineering profession and other analytical professions across Whitehall, and their replacement with a unified government evidence service, which blends disciplinary expertise as required, and gives greater prominence to intermediaries and translators between different forms of specialist knowledge. 5. Keep a cool head in a crisis Scientific advisers have to remain vigilant to the ever-present threat of the unexpected. Beddington handled a succession of crises – volcanic ash, Fukushima and ash dieback – with considerable skill. He also placed scientific issues on the National Risk Register, and managed to embed a new Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies into the government's civil contingencies procedures. At some point on Walport's watch, a crisis (probably several) will flare up which places scientific credibility on the line. Such situations will test his judgment and leadership. As well as coordinating Whitehall's response, he will have to communicate risks and uncertainties to the country at large. Treating the public like grown-ups, acknowledging areas of scientific uncertainty or disagreement, and avoiding false reassurances (think John Gummer and hamburgers) are the hallmarks of mature crisis management. 6. Move foresight closer to the heart of industrial policy One of the most effective parts of the Government Office for Science is the Foresight programme, which reports to the GCSA and looks in-depth at emerging technologies and topics such as computer trading in financial markets, global food security and flood defences. Since the global financial crisis, there has been a renewed interest in the UK and other countries in the use of foresight processes to help identify technologies and sectors with long-term growth potential. As the UK teeters on the brink of a triple-dip recession, Walport should push for a more ambitious role for foresight in economic and industrial policy, and ensure that it influences priorities for policy and investment. 7. Listen and broker options, while defining your own agenda Sir David King chose climate change, Sir John Beddington the 'perfect storm'; sooner rather than later, Walport is likely to want a policy agenda that he can call his own. This is a good idea, though there is now scope for any agenda to be collectively defined and owned by the entire network of CSAs, which could have even greater impact. But leadership must be combined with humility, and a willingness to listen and learn from a variety of perspectives. These may come from other disciplines, but also from professions, civil society and the wider public. As the science policy analyst Roger Pielke Jr. argues, science advisers aren't superheroes able to separate science cleanly from the political process. Good scientific advice is more often about helping policymakers to navigate options than it is providing them with single answers. Lord May, another of Walport's predecessors, put it well more than 20 years ago: \"The role of the scientist is not to decide between the possibilities but to determine what the possibilities are.\" Every GCSA needs to bear this in mind, particularly when commenting on controversial issues such as GM crops, fracking or nuclear power, when personal views or interpretations of evidence, however legitimate, may lead to the inappropriate exercise of scientific authority to artificially narrow debate or limit options. The appointment of a new GCSA creates a natural opportunity to take stock of relations between science, politics and policy. Over the past six months, I've been involved in a series of events looking at the future of scientific advice in Whitehall. These have fed into an edited book, which Walport will launch at an event in London on 18 April. At the same time, it will be made freely available to download here. The book brings together perspectives from current and former science advisers, civil servants, policy analysts and academics, and maps out some proposals for scientific advice over the next five years. Over the next few days, we'll be previewing a few of the best contributions on this blog. Some of our ideas will no doubt be ruled out as dangerous precedents. Others as thin wedges.

Japan is the world's biggest buyer of liquefied natural gas, with some 30% of Japanese power generation coming from gas. But another 20% comes from nuclear – and with 11 out of 54 reactors there now shut down and huge question marks over the safety of the others, given the events that are unfolding – there is going to be a big hole to fill. As Japan faces rolling power blackouts, LNG tankers are already being rerouted to Japanese ports. In the LNG spot market tankers set sail but can be quickly diverted if a buyer slaps down a higher bid for the cargo – and the price is up about 6% since the earthquake struck, the highest level since 2008. That is bad news for the UK, which relied on gas for about a third of its power supply over the past winter. But this could be a long-term shift in demand: when a magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the north-west coast of Japan in July 2007, the world's biggest nuclear power plant in Niigata was shut down and it was May 2009 before the first reactor reopened. Japan's demand for gas rose to fill the gap left by the shutdown and the price on world markets reacted accordingly. This time, it is worse, far worse. Fukushima is finished. At very best the others that have been halted are likely to require long shutdowns while checks are made and there will be a complete reappraisal of the safety of all nuclear power plants – both in and outside earthquake zones. There are already calls for moratoriums on new nuclear plants in Europe and the US until it is a little clearer what has happened – and may yet happen – at Fukushima. Twenty five years after Chernobyl, the images of Japanese children being tested for radiation are powerful arguments against a nuclear future. In the short term it means more reliance on carbon-producing fossil fuels: renewables cannot fill the gap. According to analysts at SocGen, about half of the shortfall in Japan will be made up by gas – and that means prices will go up. They are estimating a 10% increase in the coming months. The disaster also underlines just how vital it is to secure more deals such as the one Centrica signed last month with Qatar that ensures that £2bn of LNG will be delivered to the group's British Gas subsidiary over the next three years – equal to a tenth of UK consumption."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2012/apr/16/eggers-shuns-gunter-grass-prize","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-16T14:31:11Z","webTitle":"Dave Eggers shuns Günter Grass Foundation prize ceremony","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/16/eggers-shuns-gunter-grass-prize","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2012/apr/16/eggers-shuns-gunter-grass-prize","fields":{"headline":"Dave Eggers shuns Günter Grass Foundation prize ceremony","bodyText":"American author Dave Eggers did not travel to Bremen to accept a literary award from the Günter Grass Foundation in the wake of the Nobel laureate's controversial poem about Israel. Grass was last week barred from Israel following publication of his poem, What Must Be Said, which warned that Israel's \"nuclear power is endangering / Our already fragile world peace\". The author, who served as a young man in the Nazi Waffen SS, was subsequently declared persona non grata in the country by Israel's interior minister Eli Yishai, for his \"attempt to fan the flames of hatred against the state of Israel and its people, and thus to advance the idea to which he publicly affiliated in his past donning of the SS uniform\". Eggers was due to receive the Günter Grass Foundation's €40,000 Albatross prize, won in the past by David Grossman, Bora Ćosić and Lídia Jorge, on Friday for his book Zeitoun, the story of a Syrian-American's experiences in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. But the author said that while he was \"very happy\" to receive the award, he decided not to attend the ceremony in person following the international uproar over Grass's poem. \"In the wake of Mr Grass's recent controversial poem, I felt that the award ceremony should be postponed, so the controversy would not distract from the very separate work of the Foundation and the subject matter of Zeitoun,\" he said in a statement. \"The organisers chose to go on with the ceremony on the existing date, and thus I felt it best if I did not attend in person. The issues raised in Grass's recent poem are not issues I am prepared to speak about, and I would have been expected to comment on them repeatedly. That said, I am happy that the Foundation has recognised my book and has brought attention to the issues of justice and interfaith cooperation I attempted to highlight in Zeitoun.\" Eggers said that when the award was announced in December, he asked that the prize money be given to agencies in Germany that promote interfaith understanding. \"The Foundation kindly granted that wish. I thank them for this honour and for their generosity,\" he said. The Albatross prize is for a writer whose work \"is exceptional for its high literary quality and its cultural and socio-political relevance\", with the winning work intended to promote \"freedom of thought and an unconstrained engagement with every area of our life, world and times\". Judges said that Zeitoun \"makes a powerful case for civic conscience and convictions\", with Eggers' achievement \"to have calmly separated the life of one Syrian American out from the context of post-9/11 hysteria and given it back its quiet, unremarkable, everyday dignity\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2012/feb/12/monopoly-chance-encounters","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-12T21:00:08Z","webTitle":"Letters: Monopoly – a game of chance encounters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/12/monopoly-chance-encounters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/12/monopoly-chance-encounters","fields":{"headline":"Monopoly: a game of chance encounters","bodyText":"The extract from your archives for February 1977 (11 February) told how the UK Monopoly championship was played on top of the Oldbury nuclear power station, having been played on the platform of Fenchurch Street Station in 1976.

India's 16th general election this month, held against a background of economic jolts and titanic corruption scandals, and tainted by the nastiest campaign yet, announces a new turbulent phase for the country – arguably, the most sinister since its independence from British rule in 1947. Back then, it would have been inconceivable that a figure such as Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist chief minister of Gujarat accused, along with his closest aides, of complicity in crimes ranging from an anti-Muslim pogrom in his state in 2002 to extrajudicial killings, and barred from entering the US, may occupy India's highest political office. Modi is a lifelong member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a paramilitary Hindu nationalist organisation inspired by the fascist movements of Europe, whose founder's belief that Nazi Germany had manifested \"race pride at its highest\" by purging the Jews is by no means unexceptional among the votaries of Hindutva, or \"Hinduness\". In 1948, a former member of the RSS murdered Gandhi for being too soft on Muslims. The outfit, traditionally dominated by upper-caste Hindus, has led many vicious assaults on minorities. A notorious executioner of dozens of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 crowed that he had slashed open with his sword the womb of a heavily pregnant woman and extracted her foetus. Modi himself described the relief camps housing tens of thousands of displaced Muslims as \"child-breeding centres\". Such rhetoric has helped Modi sweep one election after another in Gujarat. A senior American diplomat described him, in cables disclosed by WikiLeaks, as an \"insular, distrustful person\" who \"reigns by fear and intimidation\"; his neo-Hindu devotees on Facebook and Twitter continue to render the air mephitic with hate and malice, populating the paranoid world of both have-nots and haves with fresh enemies – \"terrorists\", \"jihadis\", \"Pakistani agents\", \"pseudo-secularists\", \"sickulars\", \"socialists\" and \"commies\". Modi's own electoral strategy as prime ministerial candidate, however, has been more polished, despite his appeals, both dog-whistled and overt, to Hindu solidarity against menacing aliens and outsiders, such as the Italian-born leader of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, Bangladeshi \"infiltrators\" and those who eat the holy cow. Modi exhorts his largely young supporters – more than two-thirds of India's population is under the age of 35 – to join a revolution that will destroy the corrupt old political order and uproot its moral and ideological foundations while buttressing the essential framework, the market economy, of a glorious New India. In an apparently ungovernable country, where many revere the author of Mein Kampf for his tremendous will to power and organisation, he has shrewdly deployed the idioms of management, national security and civilisational glory. Boasting of his 56-inch chest, Modi has replaced Mahatma Gandhi, the icon of non-violence, with Vivekananda, the 19th-century Hindu revivalist who was obsessed with making Indians a \"manly\" nation. Vivekananda's garlanded statue or portrait is as ubiquitous in Modi's public appearances as his dandyish pastel waistcoats. But Modi is never less convincing than when he presents himself as a humble tea-vendor, the son-of-the-soil challenger to the Congress's haughty dynasts. His record as chief minister is predominantly distinguished by the transfer – through privatisation or outright gifts – of national resources to the country's biggest corporations. His closest allies – India's biggest businessmen – have accordingly enlisted their mainstream media outlets into the cult of Modi as decisive administrator; dissenting journalists have been removed or silenced. Not long after India's first full-scale pogrom in 2002, leading corporate bosses, ranging from the suave Ratan Tata to Mukesh Ambani, the owner of a 27-storey residence, began to pave Modi's ascent to respectability and power. The stars of Bollywood fell (literally) at the feet of Modi. In recent months, liberal-minded columnists and journalists have joined their logrolling rightwing compatriots in certifying Modi as a \"moderate\" developmentalist. The Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati, who insists that he intellectually fathered India's economic reforms in 1991, and Gurcharan Das, author of India Unbound, have volunteered passionate exonerations of the man they consider India's saviour. Bhagwati, once a fervent supporter of outgoing prime minister Manmohan Singh, has even publicly applied for an advisory position with Modi's government. It may be because the nearly double-digit economic growth of recent years that Ivy League economists like him – India's own version of Chile's Chicago Boys and Russia's Harvard Boys – instigated and championed turns out to have been based primarily on extraction of natural resources, cheap labour and foreign capital inflows rather than high productivity and innovation, or indeed the brick-and-mortar ventures that fuelled China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse. \"The bulk of India's aggregate growth,\" the World Bank's chief economist Kaushik Basu warns, \"is occurring through a disproportionate rise in the incomes at the upper end of the income ladder.\" Thus, it has left largely undisturbed the country's shameful ratios – 43% of all Indian children below the age of five are undernourished, and 48% stunted; nearly half of Indian women of childbearing age are anaemic, and more than half of all Indians still defecate in the open. Absurdly uneven and jobless economic growth has led to what Amartya Sen and Jean Dreze call \"islands of California in a sea of sub-Saharan Africa\". The failure to generate stable employment – 1m new jobs are required every month – for an increasingly urban and atomised population, or to allay the severe inequalities of opportunity as well as income, created, well before the recent economic setbacks, a large simmering reservoir of rage and frustration. Many Indians, neglected by the state, which spends less proportionately on health and education than Malawi, and spurned by private industry, which prefers cheap contract labour, invest their hopes in notions of free enterprise and individual initiative. However, old and new hierarchies of class, caste and education restrict most of them to the ranks of the unwashed. As the Wall Street Journal admitted, India is not \"overflowing with Horatio Alger stories\". Balram Halwai, the entrepreneur from rural India in Aravind Adiga's Man Booker-winning novel The White Tiger, who finds in murder and theft the quickest route to business success and self-confidence in the metropolis, and Mumbai's social-Darwinist slum-dwellers in Katherine Boo's Behind the Beautiful Forevers point to an intensified dialectic in India today: cruel exclusion and even more brutal self-empowerment. ❦ Such extensive moral squalor may bewilder those who expected India to conform, however gradually and imperfectly, to a western ideal of liberal democracy and capitalism. But those scandalised by the lure of an indigenised fascism in the country billed as the \"world's largest democracy\" should know: this was not the work of a day, or of a few \"extremists\". It has been in the making for years. \"Democracy in India,\" BR Ambedkar, the main framer of India's constitution, warned in the 1950s, \"is only a top dressing on an Indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic.\" Ambedkar saw democracy in India as a promise of justice and dignity to the country's despised and impoverished millions, which could only be realised through intense political struggle. For more than two decades that possibility has faced a pincer movement: a form of global capitalism that can only enrich a small minority and a xenophobic nationalism that handily identifies fresh scapegoats for large-scale socio-economic failure and frustration. In many ways, Modi and his rabble – tycoons, neo-Hindu techies, and outright fanatics – are perfect mascots for the changes that have transformed India since the early 1990s: the liberalisation of the country's economy, and the destruction by Modi's compatriots of the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya. Long before the killings in Gujarat, Indian security forces enjoyed what amounted to a licence to kill, torture and rape in the border regions of Kashmir and the north-east; a similar infrastructure of repression was installed in central India after forest-dwelling tribal peoples revolted against the nexus of mining corporations and the state. The government's plan to spy on internet and phone connections makes the NSA's surveillance look highly responsible. Muslims have been imprisoned for years without trial on the flimsiest suspicion of \"terrorism\"; one of them, a Kashmiri, who had only circumstantial evidence against him, was rushed to the gallows last year, denied even the customary last meeting with his kin, in order to satisfy, as the supreme court put it, \"the collective conscience of the people\". \"People who were not born then,\" Robert Musil wrote in The Man Without Qualities of the period before another apparently abrupt collapse of liberal values, \"will find it difficult to believe, but the fact is that even then time was moving faster than a cavalry camel … But in those days, no one knew what it was moving towards. Nor could anyone quite distinguish between what was above and what was below, between what was moving forward and what backward.\" One symptom of this widespread confusion in Musil's novel is the Viennese elite's weird ambivalence about the crimes of a brutal murderer called Moosbrugger. Certainly, figuring out what was above and what was below is harder for the parachuting foreign journalists who alighted upon a new idea of India as an economic \"powerhouse\" and the many \"rising\" Indians in a generation born after economic liberalisation in 1991, who are seduced by Modi's promise of the utopia of consumerism – one in which skyscrapers, expressways, bullet trains and shopping malls proliferate (and from which such eyesores as the poor are excluded). ❦ People who were born before 1991, and did not know what time was moving towards, might be forgiven for feeling nostalgia for the simpler days of postcolonial idealism and hopefulness – those that Seth evokes in A Suitable Boy. Set in the 1950s, the novel brims with optimism about the world's most audacious experiment in democracy, endorsing the Nehruvian \"idea of India\" that seems flexible enough to accommodate formerly untouchable Hindus (Dalits) and Muslims as well as the middle-class intelligentsia. The novel's affable anglophone characters radiate the assumption that the sectarian passions that blighted India during its partition in 1947 will be defused, secular progress through science and reason will eventually manifest itself, and an enlightened leadership will usher a near-destitute people into active citizenship and economic prosperity. India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, appears in the novel as an effective one-man buffer against Hindu chauvinism. \"The thought of India as a Hindu state, with its minorities treated as second-class citizens, sickened him.\" In Nehru's own vision, grand projects such as big dams and factories would bring India's superstitious masses out of their benighted rural habitats and propel them into first-world affluence and rationality. The Harrow- and Cambridge-educated Indian leader had inherited from British colonials at least part of their civilising mission, turning it into a national project to catch up with the industrialised west. \"I was eager and anxious,\" Nehru wrote of India, \"to change her outlook and appearance and give her the garb of modernity.\" Even the \"uninteresting\" peasant, whose \"limited outlook\" induced in him a \"feeling of overwhelming pity and a sense of ever-impending tragedy\" was to be present at what he called India's \"tryst with destiny\". That long attempt by India's ruling class to give the country the \"garb of modernity\" has produced, in its sixth decade, effects entirely unanticipated by Nehru or anyone else: intense politicisation and fierce contests for power together with violence, fragmentation and chaos, and a concomitant longing for authoritarian control. Modi's image as an exponent of discipline and order is built on both the successes and failures of the ancien regime. He offers top-down modernisation, but without modernity: bullet trains without the culture of criticism, managerial efficiency without the guarantee of equal rights. And this streamlined design for a new India immediately entices those well-off Indians who have long regarded democracy as a nuisance, recoiled from the destitute masses, and idolised technocratic, if despotic, \"doers\" like the first prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. But then the Nehruvian assumption that economic growth plotted and supervised by a wise technocracy would also bring about social change was also profoundly undemocratic and self-serving. Seth's novel, along with much anglophone literature, seems, in retrospect, to have uncritically reproduced the establishment ideology of English-speaking and overwhelmingly upper-caste Hindus who gained most from state-planned economic growth: the Indian middle class employed in the public sector, civil servants, scientists and monopolist industrialists. This ruling class's rhetoric of socialism disguised its nearly complete monopoly of power. As DR Nagaraj, one of postcolonial India's finest minds, pointed out, \"the institutions of capitalism, science and technology were taken over by the upper castes\". Even today, businessmen, bureaucrats, scientists, writers in English, academics, thinktankers, newspaper editors, columnists and TV anchors are disproportionately drawn from among the Hindu upper-castes. And, as Sen has often lamented, their \"breathtakingly conservative\" outlook is to be blamed for the meagre investment in health and education – essential requirements for an equitable society as well as sustained economic growth – that put India behind even disaster-prone China in human development indexes, and now makes it trail Bangladesh. Dynastic politics froze the Congress party into a network of patronage, delaying the empowerment of the underprivileged Indians who routinely gave it landslide victories. Nehru may have thought of political power as a function of moral responsibility. But his insecure daughter, Indira Gandhi, consumed by Nixon-calibre paranoia, turned politics into a game of self-aggrandisement, arresting opposition leaders and suspending fundamental rights in 1975 during a nationwide \"state of emergency\". She supported Sikh fundamentalists in Punjab (who eventually turned against her) and rigged elections in Muslim-majority Kashmir. In the 1980s, the Congress party, facing a fragmenting voter base, cynically resorted to stoking Hindu nationalism. After Indira Gandhi's assassination by her bodyguards in 1984, Congress politicians led lynch mobs against Sikhs, killing more than 3,000 civilians. Three months later, her son Rajiv Gandhi won elections with a landslide. Then, in another eerie prefiguring of Modi's methods, Gandhi, a former pilot obsessed with computers, tried to combine technocratic rule with soft Hindutva. The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), a political offshoot of the RSS that Nehru had successfully banished into the political wilderness, turned out to be much better at this kind of thing. In 1990, its leader LK Advani rode a \"chariot\" (actually a rigged-up Toyota flatbed truck) across India in a Hindu supremacist campaign against the mosque in Ayodhya. The wildfire of anti-Muslim violence across the country reaped immediate electoral dividends. (In old photos, Modi appears atop the chariot as Advani's hawk-eyed understudy). Another BJP chieftain ventured to hoist the Indian tricolour in insurgent Kashmir. (Again, the bearded man photographed helping his doddery senior taunt curfew-bound Kashmiris turns out to be the young Modi.) Following a few more massacres, the BJP was in power in 1998, conducting nuclear tests and fast-tracking the programme of economic liberalisation started by the Congress after a severe financial crisis in 1991. The Hindu nationalists had a ready consumer base for their blend of chauvinism and marketisation. With India's politics and economy reaching an impasse, which forced many of their relatives to emmigrate to the US, and the Congress facing decline, many powerful Indians were seeking fresh political representatives and a new self-legitimising ideology in the late 1980s and 90s. This quest was fulfilled by, first, both the post-cold war dogma of free markets and then an openly rightwing political party that was prepared to go further than the Congress in developing close relations with the US (and Israel, which, once shunned, is now India's second-biggest arms supplier after Russia). You can only marvel today at the swiftness with which the old illusions of an over-regulated economy were replaced by the fantasies of an unregulated one. According to the new wisdom – new to India, if already worn out and discredited in Latin America – all governments needed to do was get out of the way of buoyant and autonomous entrepreneurs and stop subsidising the poor and the lazy (in a risible self-contradiction these Indian promoters of minimalist governance also clamoured for a big militarised state apparatus to fight and intimidate neighbours and stifle domestic insurgencies). The long complex experience of strong European as well as east Asian economies – active state intervention in markets and support to strategic industries, long periods of economic nationalism, investments in health and education – was elided in a new triumphalist global history of free markets. Its promise of instant and widespread affluence seemed to have been manufactured especially for gormless journalists and columnists. Still, in the last decade, neoliberalism became the common sense of many Indians who were merely aspiring as well as those who had already made it – the only elite ideology after Nehruvian nation-building to have achieved a high degree of pan-Indian consent, if not total hegemony. The old official rhetoric of egalitarian and shared futures gave way to the media's celebrations of private wealth-creation – embodied today by Ambani's 27-storey private residence in a city where a majority lives in slums – and a proliferation of Ayn Randian cliches about ambition, willpower and striving. ❦ Nehru's programme of national self-strengthening had included, along with such ideals as secularism, socialism and non-alignment, a deep-rooted suspicion of American foreign policy and economic doctrines. In a stunning coup, India's postcolonial project was taken over, as Octavio Paz once wrote of the Mexican revolution, \"by a capitalist class made in the image and likeness of US capitalism and dependent upon it\". A new book by Anita Raghavan, The Billionaire's Apprentice: The Rise of the Indian-American Elite and the Fall of the Galleon Hedge Fund, reveals how well-placed men such as Rajat Gupta, the investment banker recently convicted for insider trading in New York, expedited close links between American and Indian political and business leaders. India's upper-caste elite transcended party lines in their impassioned courting of likely American partners. In 2008, an American diplomat in Delhi was given an exclusive preview by a Congress party factotum of two chests containing $25m in cash – money to bribe members of parliament into voting for a nuclear deal with the US. Visiting the White House later that year, Singh blurted out to George W Bush, probably resigned by then to being the most despised American president in history, that \"the people of India love you deeply\". In a conversation disclosed by WikiLeaks, Arun Jaitley, a senior leader of the BJP who is tipped to be finance minister in Modi's government, urged American diplomats in Delhi to see his party's anti-Muslim rhetoric as \"opportunistic\", a mere \"talking point\" and to take more seriously his own professional and emotional links with the US. A transnational elite of rightwing Indians based in the US helped circulate an impression of an irresistibly \"emerging giant\" – the title of a book by Arvind Panagariya, a New-York-based economist and another aspiring adviser to Modi. Very quickly, the delusional notion that India was, as Foreign Affairs proclaimed on its cover in 2006, a \"roaring capitalist success-story\" assumed an extraordinary persuasive power. In India itself, a handful of corporate acquisitions – such as Tata's of Jaguar and Corus – stoked exorbitant fantasies of an imminent \"Global Indian Takeover\" (the title of a regular feature once in India's leading business daily, the Economic Times). Rent-seekers in a shadow intellectual economy – thinktank-sailors, bloggers and Twitterbots – as well as academics perched on corporate-endowed chairs recited the mantra of privatisation and deregulation in tune. Nostrums from the Reagan-Thatcher era – the primary source of ideological self-indoctrination for many Americanised Indians – about \"labour flexibility\" were endlessly regurgitated, even though a vast majority of the workforce in India – more than 90% – toils in the unorganised or \"informal\" sector. Bhagwati, for instance, hailed Bangladesh for its superb labour relations a few months before the collapse of the Rana Plaza in Dhaka; he also speculated that the poor \"celebrate\" inequality, and, with Marie Antoinette-ish serenity, advised malnourished families to consume \"more milk and fruits\". Confronted with the World Health Organisation's extensive evidence about malnutrition in India, Panagariya, ardent patron of the emerging giant, argued that Indian children are genetically underweight. ❦ This pitiless American free-marketeering wasn't the only extraordinary mutation of Indian political and economic discourse. By 1993, when A Suitable Boy was published, the single-party democracy it describes had long been under siege from low-caste groups and a rising Hindu-nationalist middle class. (Sunil Khilnani's The Idea of India, the most eloquent defence and elaboration of India's foundational ideology, now seems another posthumous tribute to it.) India after Indira Gandhi increasingly failed to respect the Nehruvian elite's coordinates of progress and order. Indian democracy, it turned out, had seemed stable only because political participation was severely limited, and upper-caste Hindus effectively ran the country. The arrival of low-caste Hindus in mass politics in the 1980s, with their representatives demanding their own share of the spoils of power, put the first strains on the old patrimonial system. Upper-caste panic initially helped swell the ranks of the BJP, but even greater shifts caused by accelerating economic growth after 1991 have fragmented even relatively recent political formations based on caste and religion. Rapid urbanisation and decline of agriculture created a large mass of the working poor exposed to ruthless exploitation in the unorganised sector. Connected to their homes in the hinterland through the flow of remittances, investment, culture and ideas, these migrants from rural areas were steadily politically awakened with the help of print literacy, electronic media, job mobility and, most importantly, mobile phones (subscribers grew from 45 million in 2002 to almost a billion in 2012). The Congress, though instrumentally social-welfarist while in power, failed to respond to this electorally consequential blurring of rural and urban borderlines, and the heightened desires for recognition and dignity as well as for rapid inclusion into global modernity. Even the BJP, which had fed on upper-caste paranoia, had been struggling under its ageing leaders to respond to an increasingly demanding mass of voters after its initial success in the 1990s, until Modi reinvented himself as a messiah of development, and quickly found enlarged constituencies – among haves as well as have-nots – for his blend of xenophobia and populism. A wave of political disaffection has also deposited democratic social movements and dedicated individuals across the country. Groups both within and outside the government, such as those that successfully lobbied for the groundbreaking Right to Information Act, are outlining the possibilities of what John Keane calls \"monitory democracy\". India's many activist networks – for the rights of women, Dalits, peasants and indigenous communities – or issue-based campaigns, such as those against big dams and nuclear power plants, steer clear of timeworn ideas of national security, economic development, technocratic management, whether articulated by the Nehruvians or the neo-Hindus. In a major environment referendum last year, residents of small tribal hamlets in a remote part of eastern India voted to reject bauxite mining in their habitats. Growing demands across India for autonomy and bottom-up governance confirm that Modi is merely offering old – and soured – lassi in new bottles with his version of top-down modernisation. Modi, however, has opportunely timed his attempt to occupy the commanding heights of the Indian state vacated by the Congress. The structural problems of India's globalised economy have dramatically slowed its growth since 2011, terminating the euphoria over the Global Indian Takeover. Corruption scandals involving the sale of billions of dollars' worth of national resources such as mines, forests, land, water and telecom spectrums have revealed that crony capitalism and rent-seeking were the real engines of India's economy. The beneficiaries of the phenomenon identified by Arundhati Roy as \"gush-up\" have soared into a transnational oligarchy, putting the bulk of their investments abroad and snapping up, together with Chinese and Russian plutocrats, real estate in London, New York and Singapore. Meanwhile, those made to wait unconscionably long for \"trickle-down\" – people with dramatically raised but mostly unfulfillable aspirations – have become vulnerable to demagogues promising national regeneration. It is this tiger of unfocused fury, spawned by global capitalism in the \"underdeveloped\" world, that Modi has sought to ride from Gujarat to New Delhi. ❦ \"Even in the darkest of times,\" Hannah Arendt once wrote, \"we have the right to expect some illumination.\" The most prominent Indian institutions and individuals have rarely obliged, even as the darkness of the country's atrocity-rich borderlands moved into the heartland. Some of the most respected commentators, who are often eloquent in their defence of the right to free speech of famous writers, maintained a careful silence about the government's routine strangling of the internet and mobile networks in Kashmir. Even the liberal newspaper the Hindu prominently featured a journalist who retailed, as an investigation in Caravan revealed, false accusations of terrorism against innocent citizens. (The virtues of intelligence, courage and integrity are manifested more commonly in small periodicals such as Caravan and Economic and Political Weekly, or independent websites such as Kafila.org and Scroll.in.) The owners of the country's largest English-language newspaper, the Times of India, which has lurched from tedium to decadence within a few years, have innovated a revenue-stream called \"paid news\". Unctuously lobbing softballs at Modi, the prophets of electronic media seem, on other occasions, to have copied their paranoid inquisitorial style from Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. Santosh Desai, one of contemporary India's most astute observers, correctly points out that the \"intolerance that one sees from a large section of society is in some way a product of a 'televisionised' India. The pent-up feelings of resentment and entitlement have rushed out and get both tacit and explicit support from television.\" A spate of corporate-sponsored literary festivals did not compensate for the missing culture of debate and reflection in the press. The frothy glamour of these events may have helped obscure the deeper intellectual and cultural churning in India today, the emergence of writers and artists from unconventional class and caste backgrounds, and the renewed attention to BR Ambedkar, the bracing Dalit thinker obscured by upper-caste iconographies. The probing work of, among others, such documentary film-makers as Anand Patwardhan (Jai Bhim Comrade), Rahul Roy (Till We Meet Again), Rakesh Sharma (Final Solution) and Sanjay Kak (Red-Ant Dream), and members of the Raqs Media Collective outlines a modernist counterculture in the making. But the case of Bollywood shows how the unravelling of the earliest nation-building project can do away with the stories and images through which many people imagined themselves to be part of a larger whole, and leave only tawdriness in its place. Popular Hindi cinema degenerated alarmingly in the 1980s. Slicker now, and craftily aware of its non-resident Indian audience, it has become an expression of consumer nationalism and middle-class self-regard; Amitabh Bachchan, the \"angry young man\" who enunciated a widely felt victimhood during a high point of corruption and inflation in the 1970s, metamorphosed into an avuncular endorser of luxury brands. A search for authenticity, and linguistic vivacity, has led film-makers back to the rural hinterland in such films as Gangs of Wasseypur, Peepli Live and Ishqiya, whose flaws are somewhat redeemed by their scrupulous avoidance of Indians sporting Hermès bags or driving Ferraris. Some recent breakthroughs such as Anand Gandhi's Ship of Theseus and Dibakar Banerji's Costa-Gavras-inspired Shanghai gesture to the cinema of crisis pioneered by Asian, African and Latin American film-makers. But India's many film industries have yet to produce anything that matches Jia Zhangke's unsentimental evocations of China's past and present, the acute examination of middle-class pathologies in Kleber Mendonça Filho's Neighbouring Sounds, or Nuri Bilge Ceylan's delicate portrait of the sterile secularist intellectual in Uzak. ❦ The long artistic drought results partly from the confusion and bewilderment of an older, entrenched elite, the main producers, until recently, of mainstream culture. With their prerogative to rule and interpret India pilfered by the \"unwashed\" and the \"gullible\", the anglophones have been struggling to grasp the eruption of mass politics in India, its new centrifugal thrust, and the nature of the challenge posed by many apparently illiberal individuals and movements. It is easy for them to denounce India's evidently uncouth retailers of caste and religious identity as embodiments of, in Salman Rushdie's words, \"Caligulan barbarity\"; or to mock Chetan Bhagat, the bestselling author of novels for young adults and champion tweeter, for boasting of his \"selfie\" with Modi. Those pied-pipering the young into Modi-mania nevertheless possess the occult power to fulfil the deeper needs of their needy followers. They can compile vivid ideological collages – made of fragments of modernity, glimpses of utopia and renovated pieces of a forgotten past. It is in the \"mythological thrillers\" and positive-thinking fictions – the most popular literary genres in India today – that a post-1991 generation that doesn't even know it is lost fleetingly but thrillingly recognises itself. In a conventional liberal perspective, these works may seem like hotchpotches, full of absurd contradictions that confound the \"above\" with the \"below\", the \"forward\" with the \"backward\". Modi, for instance, consistently mixes up dates and historical events, exposing an abysmal ignorance of the past of the country he hopes to lead into a glorious future. Yet his lusty hatred of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty excites many young Indians weaned on the neo-liberal opiates about aspiration and merit. And he combines his historical revisionism and Hindu nationalism with a revolutionary futurism. He knows that resonant sentiments, images, and symbols – Vivekananda plus holograms and Modi masks – rather than rational argument or accurate history galvanise individuals. Vigorously aestheticising mass politics, and mesmerising the restless young, he has emerged as the new India's canniest artist. But, as Walter Benjamin pointed out, rallies, parades and grand monuments do not secure the masses their rights; they give them no more than the chance to express themselves, and noisily identify with an alluring leader and his party. It seems predictable that Modi will gratify only a few with his ambitious rescheduling of India's tryst with destiny. Though many exasperated Indians see Modi as bearing the long-awaited fruits of the globalised economy, he actually embodies its inevitable dysfunction. He resembles the European and Japanese demagogues of the early 20th century who responded to the many crises of liberalism and democracy – and of thwarted nation-building and modernisation – by merging corporate and political power, and exhorting communal unity before internal and external threats. But Modi belongs also to the dark days of the early 21st century. His ostensibly gratuitous assault on Muslims – already India's most depressed and demoralised minority – was another example of what the social anthropologist Arjun Appadurai calls \"a vast worldwide Malthusian correction, which works through the idioms of minoritisation and ethnicisation but is functionally geared to preparing the world for the winners of globalisation, minus the inconvenient noise of its losers\". Certainly, the new horizons of desire and fear opened up by global capitalism do not favour democracy or human rights. Other strongmen who supervised the bloody purges of economically enervated and unproductive people were also ruthless majoritarians, consecrated by big election victories. The crony-capitalist regimes of Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand and Vladimir Putin in Russia were inaugurated by ferocious offensives against ethnic minorities. The electorally bountiful pogrom in Gujarat in 2002, too, now seems an early initiation ritual for Modi's India. The difficulty of assessing his personal culpability in the killings and rapes of 2002 is the same difficulty that Musil identifies with Moosbrugger in his novel: how to measure the crimes, however immense, of individuals against a universal breakdown of values and the normalisation of violence and injustice. \"If mankind could dream collectively,\" Musil writes, \"it would dream Moosbrugger.\" There is little cause yet for such despair in India, where the aggrieved fantasy of authoritarianism will have to reckon with the gathering energies below; the great potential of the country's underprivileged and voiceless peoples still lies untapped. But for now some Indians have dreamed collectively, and they have dreamed a man accused of mass murder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2012/jun/07/merkel-cameron-chat-future-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-07T19:44:52Z","webTitle":"Cameron and Merkel enjoy cosy fireside chat on the future of Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/merkel-cameron-chat-future-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jun/07/merkel-cameron-chat-future-europe","fields":{"headline":"Cameron and Merkel enjoy cosy fireside chat on the future of Europe","bodyText":"It was billed as a town hall get-together, taking place in the breezy \"sky lobby\" of Angela Merkel's cuboid chancellery with a handpicked audience of students and diplomats. On the agenda: the future of the relationship between citizens and the state. In the end though the fireside chat, which touched on everything from floppy discs and Commodore 64s to the Arab spring and shitschtorming, (as Merkel put it) turned into a focused discussion about the future of Europe. David Cameron, introduced to the audience as the \"champion of twitterers\" with a million followers (though, it was quickly added, he did not write his own tweets) argued that Europe needed to rethink its raison d'être. It was, he said, an organisation that worked best on the human level and it seemed to have lost its way. \"The things that have worked have been when Europe has been fuelled by collaboration between people, but it has not worked so well when plans have been imposed from above,\" he said. Though he didn't mention the euro, it was hard to ignore the connection. Its future, and Britain's in it, Cameron said, was dependent on the relationships between the people of Europe \"rather than the attempt to cook up new plans and new bureaucracy\", adding how \"baffling the processes, the procedures\" of European institutions were. Forget the treaties and the complex legislative framework, \"cheap air travel and being able to use your mobile phone all over Europe\" had done far more to \"establish a European identity\" than the European parliament or the blue and yellow EU flag combined. Merkel hardly disagreed. \"Angela\" and \"David\", as they referred to each other throughout – he, billed as the great eurosceptic, she as the mother of European values – were at great pains during the 90-minute discussion, which was streamed live to a worldwide audience (albeit crashing every few seconds), to stress their commonalities. And if there were differences (the euro, eurobonds, transaction tax, to name just a few), they were mostly politely ignored. Cameron said that while there were certain issues on which they agreed to differ, such as nuclear power, \"Angela and I agree about many things\". He cited free enterprise, as one, and Nato membership as another. And he added, \"We both think that getting rid of budget deficits is important,\" which steered the debate neatly on to the issue of Greece, whose repeat election, effectively a referendum on its euro membership, is looming. That was Merkel's chance to jump in and defend her much-criticised austerity policy towards Greece. Greeks she said, needed to believe in the \"very great effort\" to save it. The amount pumped into the Greek economy so far amounted to 1.5 times the GDP of Greece, she said, while the post-world war two Marshall plan had amounted to just 3% of European GDP. But she said she suspected there was a lack of identification in Greece for what was being done to help. \"At least as important as the huge amount of money is the belief there that it can actually achieve something,\" she said. That, she felt, was missing. But anyone discussing Europe, she said, in a remark that drew the largest sniggers of the afternoon along with her reference to being shitschtormed, should also consider why some countries thought it normal to pay taxes, and others did not. While the group was on the subject of how the EU might increase its competitiveness, why not, one student asked Cameron, boost the feel-good factor on the continent by repeating the UK's recent jubilee holiday as a regular occurrence across Europe? \"Well, it's not good for the economy,\" said the PM, very much on message, \"even if it's good for the soul.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2011/apr/13/anti-nuclear-lobby-interrogate-beliefs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-13T15:00:40Z","webTitle":"Nuclear opponents have a moral duty to get their facts straight | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/apr/13/anti-nuclear-lobby-interrogate-beliefs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/apr/13/anti-nuclear-lobby-interrogate-beliefs","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear opponents have a moral duty to get their facts straight","bodyText":"My request to Helen Caldicott was a simple one: I asked her to give me sources for the claims she had made about the effects of radiation. Helen had made a number of startling statements during a television debate, and I wanted to know whether or not they were correct. Scientific claims are only as good as their sources. Here are three examples of the questions I asked, and the answers she gave me. At first I asked for general sources for her claims. She sent me nine documents: press releases, newspapers articles and an advertisement. Only one of them was linked to a scientific publication: the BEIR VII report published by the National Academy of Sciences. She urged me to read it. I did so and discovered that, far from supporting her claims, it starkly contradicts them. For example, it says: • The risk of radiation-induced mutations in sperm and eggs, resulting in heritable disease \"is sufficiently small that it has not been detected in humans, even in thoroughly studied irradiated populations such as those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\". • Regarding transmissible genetic damage from the exposure of future parents, such as \"spontaneous abortions, congenital malformations, neonatal mortality, still births and the sex ratio of offspring … there is no consistent evidence of an association of any such outcomes with exposure to environmental sources of radiation.\" • \"On balance, the existing evidence does not support the conclusion that rates of childhood leukaemia have increased as a result of radiation exposures from the Chernobyl accident\". I began to wonder whether Helen has actually read this report, or was hoping that, at 423 pages, it would scare me away. The PDF costs $46. She claimed that \"Turkish food is extremely radioactive.\" The source she gave me (on page 292) said nothing of the sort. Instead it states the following: \"TURKEY. Some 45,000 tons of tea was contaminated with Chernobyl radioactivity in 1986–1987, and more than a third of the 1986 harvest could not be used.\" That says nothing about Turkish food today. She claimed that isotopes of krypton, xenon and argon \"can mutate the genes in the eggs and sperm and cause genetic disease\". When I asked her for a source, she told me, \"This is also described in my book.\" In fact her book says (p55): \"There have never been any epidemiological studies performed on the effects of exposure to the noble gases xenon and krypton.\" This flatly contradicts her own claim. When I pressed her for better sources, her publishers wrote to me and said she did not have time to find them. Now she has had time – time enough to write an article for the Guardian attacking me – but still hasn't supported the claims I questioned. Instead, she compounds the damage. First she invents a quote, which she attributes to me. She says: \"It is inaccurate and misleading to use the term 'acceptable levels of external radiation' … as Monbiot has done.\" I have never used this term, and never would. Then she appears to suggest that iodine-131 can \"continuously irradiate small volumes of cells … over many years\". As it has a half life of eight days, this seems unlikely. Again, a source would help to clear the matter up.. Then she makes a remarkable allegation: as a result of a conspiracy hatched with the International Atomic Energy Agency, since 1959 the World Health Organisation has \"made no more statements on health and radioactivity\". This is completely false, as even the quickest search would have shown her. For example, the WHO currently runs an Ionizing Radiation Programme and a Radiation and Environmental Health Programme, both of which assess the impacts of radiation on health. It has set up an International Research Advisory Committee \"to identify gaps and under-discovered areas on health effects from low-dose exposures to ionizing radiation\". In 2006 it published a 167-page report titled Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident. As for the alleged conspiracy, this is a story that has been circulating among anti-nuclear campaigners for many years, becoming ever more lurid. It is, as far as I can tell, baseless. It arises from a wild inflation of what looks like a standard information-sharing agreement between two UN agencies. This is what happens when we fail to be as sceptical about the ideas we like as we are about the ideas we don't. Incidentally, Helen has still not provided a shred of evidence for her claim that the recent report by another UN agency – the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation – into the Chernobyl disaster is \"a total cover-up\". Twice I have asked her to substantiate this allegation; twice she has replied with accusations about the WHO. Is she aware that these are different agencies? But perhaps most alarming is her continued reliance on the report by Alexey Yablokov, Vassily Nesterenko and Alexey Nesterenko, which claims that 980,000 people died as a result of Chernobyl. As its critics have pointed out, this figure cannot possibly be correct, as it arises from the extraordinary assumption that all increased deaths since 1986 from a host of diseases – including many which have no known connection with radiation – were caused by Chernobyl. The report has not been peer-reviewed and the academy which published it has distanced itself from it. Continuing to use such a severely flawed document for your central claims about the health impacts of radiation hardly inspires confidence. All this, while the disaster at Fukushima continues to unfold, might sound trivial. But I think these points are worth making, for several reasons. I believe that journalists should not stand by while misinformation is spread. If there is any value in journalism, it lies in trying to winnow fact from fiction, and helping people to form a more accurate view of the world. If, on the basis of falsehoods and exaggerations, we make the wrong decisions, the consequences can be momentous. Two immediate issues leap to mind. The first is that countries shut down their nuclear power plants or stop the construction of new ones, and switch instead to fossil fuels. Almost all of us would prefer them to switch to renewables, but it seems that this is less likely to happen. In response to the Fukushima disaster, for example, the German government insists that it will replace its nuclear plants with new renewable power sources – particularly large wind farms. But as most of its wind is in the north and much of its nuclear capacity is in the south, this will require a massive new construction of power lines. That gives the government just as much of a political headache as the current anti-nuclear protests. The new lines are also likely to take around 12 years to build, raising the possibility of shortages. My fear is that the German programme will run into difficulties as a result of public objections to new wind farms, power lines and pumped storage plants. The government will discover that there's a less contentious way to solve its problems: importing even more electricity from the Czech Republic. This carries low political costs but high environmental costs. Over 60% of Czech power is produced by burning coal. Not any old coal, but lignite and brown coal – for the most part, the dirtiest and most polluting of all forms. As climate change expert Mark Lynas has shown, phasing out planned nuclear programmes in a number of countries as a result of the Fukushima disaster could tip the balance between two and three degrees of global warming. We know that nuclear power, as it has done at Fukushima, can make large areas uninhabitable, for some years at least. We know that the decommissioning and waste disposal costs are huge. Both problems are horrible, the first particularly so. But both are very much smaller than the likely impacts of climate change, which could force the evacuation of regions many times larger, and which leaves us with a decommissioning problem – the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – that looks insoluble. We must not replace a bad technology (atomic energy) with a far worse one (coal). In deciding whether or not to retain nuclear power, we are not talking about some distant possible future in which human population, human desires and economic activity have all greatly declined, desirable as that might be. We're talking about choices being made right now, starting from where we are, within the current economic model; choices which could, if the wrong decisions are made, have devastating consequences for future generations. If these decisions are guided by misinformation and exaggerations, those responsible for spreading false stories have a heavy moral burden to carry. There's a second sense in which this is a moral challenge, not just an intellectual one. We know that the consequences of underplaying the dangers of radiation could be hideous, and I fervently hope that this has not happened, and that the doses received so far by workers at Fukushima carry the low likelihood of causing cancer that scientists anticipate. We hear much less about the consequences of overplaying them. What if, for example, the continuing dangers of radioactive pollution for the people in the nations around Chernobyl have been so greatly exaggerated that they have been exposed to 25 years of unnecessary terror and distress? What if this has caused serious and widespread psychological problems, as the UN Scientific Committee suggests? (PDF p513) What if we have exploited vulnerable people – those born with deformities and genetic diseases – by parading their conditions as examples of the damage radiation has done, when the evidence suggests that they are not? What if the same burdens are inflicted on the people of Japan? If that has happened, is it not a terrible thing to bear? Don't we have a duty to interrogate ourselves as scrupulously as we can to ensure that we have not and will not do such a thing? All of us who are concerned about such issues – Helen and I included – want to prevent unnecessary suffering. If we spread misinformation, we could inadvertently achieve the opposite. This is an especially difficult time to try to make the case for keeping the dangers of nuclear power in perspective. The frightening events at Fukushima are still unfolding, the disaster has been upgraded to category 7, making it one of the two worst such events on record. But it is just when the case is hardest that it most urgently needs to be made, however much anger this generates. If we don't stick to the facts, if we don't subject all claims to the same degree of scepticism, we could make a bad situation worse. www.monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/apr/23/french-presidential-election-nicolas-sarkozy-francois-hollande","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-23T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Nicolas Sarkozy v François Hollande: les différences","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/23/french-presidential-election-nicolas-sarkozy-francois-hollande","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/apr/23/french-presidential-election-nicolas-sarkozy-francois-hollande","fields":{"headline":"Nicolas Sarkozy v François Hollande: les différences","bodyText":"Nicolas Sarkozy • Will balance French finances by 2016. • Promises to call national referendums on compulsory training for the long-term unemployed and how to deal with illegal immigrants. • In a bid to shed his reputation for favouring the rich, he promises to tax dividend income, apply a minimum 15% tax on major French corporations and introduce a levy for tax exiles who seek refuge abroad. • To curb the excesses of the financial industry, Sarkozy promises tougher regulation on banks and the introduction of a financial transaction tax. • Plans to raise VAT to fund a reduction in social charges for employers and lower the cost of labour. • Wants to halve the number of foreigners entering the country legally each year and increase deportations of illegal immigrants.

The acting head of Iran's atomic energy organisation, Mohammad Ahmadian, said reports of major damage to the Bushehr plant were a malicious campaign by countries hostile to Tehran's nuclear programme, but that they should be looked into in any case. \"Many of these discussions raised in the media and world public opinion about the Stuxnet virus are an effort to create concern among the Iranian people and people of the region and delay the work of the nuclear power plant,\" he told the ISNA news agency. \"Therefore it is necessary that experts in the field investigate to see how much truth there is in these discussions.\" Many analysts believe Stuxnet was a cyber attack by the US and Israel aimed at disabling Iran's nuclear equipment and slowing down a programme they believe is aimed at making nuclear weapons. Iranian officials have confirmed Stuxnet hit staff computers at Bushehr but said it did not affect major systems. They deny that they are manufacturing nuclear weapons. Stuxnet is a computer worm that spreads through Windows networks and targets specific machinery called programmable logic controllers built by the German company Siemens. Those run software called Step-7; Stuxnet interferes with their operation in a way that can cause high-speed machinery to fail disastrously. It was first spotted online in March 2010, though elements of it were spotted by computer virus experts in summer 2009. It spread through networks via infected USB memory sticks; it is believed that the infection at Bushehr originated from USB sticks brought there from Russia. Last month the New York Times reported that the deployment of Stuxnet to target Bushehr had reduced the risks of a military strike on the country, and that the computer code had been tested at Israel's Dimona plant which uses the same uranium centrifuges, used to refine the fuel, as Bushehr. Last week Russia's ambassador to Nato said the worm's effects \"could lead to a new Chernobyl\", referring to the 1986 nuclear accident at a plant in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. Russia built and supplied the fuel for Bushehr, which has yet to start injecting power onto Iran's national grid. \"If supposedly an incident with a damaging effect on [Bushehr] happens, it would have more impact on Russians than Iranians as it will harm their reputation as an actor who claims to be willing to participate in building other nuclear power plants in different countries,\" Ahmadian said. But, he added, \"There is no significant delay ... in the startup of the Bushehr plant.\" Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told Reuters on Tuesday he believed Russia and Iran were paying \"enough attention\" to prevent any accident, but expressed concern about cyber attacks on nuclear facilities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/aug/01/hinkley-c-reactor-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-01T10:47:59Z","webTitle":"Hinkley C – Somerset's nuclear money pit? | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/aug/01/hinkley-c-reactor-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/aug/01/hinkley-c-reactor-plans","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley C – Somerset's nuclear money pit?","bodyText":"French state-owned power company EDF has been given permission to start the pre-construction of \"Hinkley C\", the third nuclear power station on the Somerset coast of the Bristol channel. From the announcement, it might appear that the firm will just send in a few bulldozers and put a fence around the site, much like any other construction project. Wrong. EDF must completely clear 400 acres of land and will then move more soil and rock from the site than has been moved to create the Olympic games site in London. There's also the small matter of planning permission. EDF still has no formal permission to construct the reactor, so this would be a bit awkward if Centrica, its partner in the project, decides to pull out at any stage (as the City is advising it to). They would leave one of the biggest holes in Britain. But the most extraordinary thing in this whole saga is that the companies are going ahead without knowing how much this 1,600MW power station will cost. Its prototype are the two being built at Flamanville in Normandy, France, and in Finland. Both of these have taken nearly twice as long to build as expected and, at £5.2bn for Flamanville, are turning out to be nearly twice as expensive as expected. Since Fukushima in March, the costs have risen further. Stress tests to determine whether these reactors can withstand natural disasters are expected to put the cost up hundreds of millions more. But anyone who thinks the Hinkley C or any of the other new generation of plants are a done deal despite what government, the industry and and a few climate change greens want, should think again. Here's why: 1. There are real fears that the design is compromised and may not be used in Britain, or in India, which has plans for six reactors of the same design. The head of ASN, the French nuclear safety authority, went on the record only a few months ago saying that he \"could not rule out\" a moratorium on the third generation European Pressurised Reactor (EPR). The shares had to be temporarily suspended. 2. Centrica, the energy company which operates most of the UK's nuclear plants in partnerships, is far from certain to stay with the project. Sam Laidlaw, its chief executive, last week said: \"The reality is that [after] the news about Flamanville and Fukushima we are clearly going to have some changes. \"People have been focusing a little more on the optionality since then. It's by no means a done deal. We'll give it our best shot, but if at the end of the day, we add all that up and we just don't think the returns are there for the perceived risk, then we've always been very clear that this is an option, not an obligation for us,\" he says. \"We will only do it if it makes good sense and good returns,\" he told the FT. The awful reality for both politicians in love with techno-fixes, and advocates of nuclear energy for climate change reasons, is that it really does not matter how good their argumentsin favour of nuclear are. It is the City that decides if the reactors are built. It was the City that ruled out new nuclear plants throughout the last 20 years when there was no law preventing their construction, and with the price rising fast, and the age of austerity with us for years, it will be the City that decides this time, too. I would say it's still only 50:50 that west Somerset will get Hinkley C. But if it doesn't, think of all the things the locals will be able to do with a vast, 400-acre hole. No prizes for suggesting that they fill it with rubbish to generate energy from waste."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/24/east-coast-earthquake-nuclear-emergency","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-24T17:34:00Z","webTitle":"East coast earthquake reveals faults in nuclear emergency planning | Kate Sheppard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/24/east-coast-earthquake-nuclear-emergency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/24/east-coast-earthquake-nuclear-emergency","fields":{"headline":"East coast earthquake reveals faults in nuclear emergency planning","bodyText":"To say that Tuesday's east coast earthquake surprised everyone would be an understatement. In a post 9/11 world, those of us in Washington always have the vague fear of something bad happening lurking in our subconscious. That fear is usually of an event caused by humans, not of a natural disaster, but we never really can know what Mother Nature has in store for us. This is why our best bet is planning for the worst. And when we look at the US nuclear energy infrastructure, it becomes clear that we aren't planning for the worst – not even close. We had a pretty good warning earlier this year, when the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused an even bigger tragedy when the Fukushima nuclear power plant suffered a meltdown. Tuesday's earthquake was the worst on the east coast of the US since 1944, measuring at 5.8 on the Richter scale. And while we certainly avoided the kind of crisis that Japan has endured, two nuclear reactors near the site, at the North Anna nuclear power plant, were shut down following the quake. The plant temporarily lost power and halted operations until it switched to back-up generators. Twelve other plants around the country were put on alert following the quake. Though a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told reporters that \"as far as we know, everything is safe\", the event revived fears about the safety of US nuclear plants. Most of the region's reactors were reportedly designed to withstand a 5.9 to 6.1 magnitude quake – which means Tuesday's quake was, for many, too close for comfort. At Fukushima, the reactors were built to withstand a 7.9 magnitude quake. But then, they were hit with a 9.0 quake. While it's true that the bigger problem at Fukushima was the loss of power and the failure of back-up power to keep the cooling systems running, it was a reminder that we never know exactly what kind of curveballs nature will throw at us. Nuclear plants are supposed to be able to handle the anticipated quake intensity and likelihood relevant to their location. But what happens when the quake is stronger than anyone anticipated? And what happens if something else goes wrong, too? The North Anna plant is located about 15 miles from the epicentre of the quake in Mineral, Virginia. It was designed to withstand a 6.2-magnitude quake, according to its owner, Dominion Resources. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission lists the plant as one of the 10 US plants most at risk of damage in a seismic event. So, it seems like we got lucky in this case. We're also lucky that this particular plant isn't as close to an urban centre as many others in the US. It's nearly 50 miles from Richmond, and about 100 miles from Washington, DC. But the plant that the NRC deemed most at risk was the Indian Point 3 reactor in Buchanan, New York – just 38 miles from New York City. This is the primary reason why New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has called for the plant to be shut down. After Fukushima, everyone within 50 miles of the plant had to be evacuated. Right now, our evacuation plans for all our nuclear sites only cover a 10-mile radius. If something really bad were to happen at Indian Point, it could create the need to evacuate 21 million people. We need to seriously consider the potential for a combination of events like those in Japan earlier this year – a natural disaster (or two), infrastructure failure and the human migration that would inevitably occur in its wake. But the NRC has so far defended its minimal emergency zones, despite unease about preparedness. I don't believe we're going to shut down our existing nuclear energy infrastructure entirely any time soon. But at the very least, the 23 August quake should be a reminder that our worst-case scenarios might not be bad enough. We should perhaps rethink just how ready we are for the worst."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/04/loophole-energy-bill-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-04T14:36:00Z","webTitle":"Loophole in energy bill could see UK taxpayers funding nuclear bailouts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/04/loophole-energy-bill-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/04/loophole-energy-bill-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Loophole in energy bill could see UK taxpayers funding nuclear bailouts","bodyText":"The coalition government is opening a legal loophole that could allow taxpayer-funded guarantees to nuclear power stations, while publicly insisting that the industry will stand on its own. An obscure clause in the forthcoming energy bill, seen by the Guardian, means that nuclear power companies could in future be eligible for bailouts, despite ministers' repeated denials that no public subsidies would be made available. The move also threatens to open cracks in the coalition over nuclear energy, with Liberal Democrat members and grassroots opposed to the technology. The apparent back-tracking by the government came as a key debate in parliament on Monday night over the government's record on green issues had to be cancelled, to the fury of Labour MPs. Clause 102 of the energy bill currently going through parliament provides for the secretary of state to make public agreements with nuclear power companies on how much they will spend on certain items, such as decommissioning. But the government cannot change these public agreements in future if new situations arise – for instance, if a new safety feature is developed that ought to be installed. If the nuclear company stuck to the original agreement, the cost of these unforeseen circumstances would then have to be met by the taxpayer instead. Meg Hillier, the shadow spokeswoman for energy and climate change, said: \"This clause is so confusing and loosely worded that it really does leave open a potential loophole that could leave taxpayers facing liabilities in future. The government is saying one thing on nuclear and doing another.\" The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said the clause would not allow for taxpayer money to flow to nuclear power, but green campaigners and Labour MPs are concerned that the loose wording of the provision means that future governments and nuclear companies could take advantage of it to allow bailouts. The clause also represents a major problem for Liberal Democrat MPs, who back coalition moves to reform the energy industry, despite the party's opposition to nuclear power. The Lib Dems had said in their election manifesto that they would reject new nuclear power stations and the climate and energy secretary, Chris Huhne, had previously branded nuclear a \"failed technology\". The coalition compromise was that new nuclear power stations would only be built if they received no public subsidy. Under current rules, the secretary of state is allowed to approve a \"funded decommissioning programme\", by which a company explains how its nuclear sites are to be cleaned up and how the waste will be dealt with. Companies are required to put aside sufficient money for clean-ups. However, under clause 102 (previously clause 99 when the bill was debated in the House of Lords), these obligations will be subtly changed, because the secretary of state can give a guarantee at the outset that any arrangement with the nuclear company cannot be amended in the future, except by mutual consent. This will mean that if anything unexpected happens – for instance, if there is an accident at a plant, or issues with stored waste, or if new safety features are developed that should be installed – then the government would become liable for the extra cost, rather than the nuclear plant owner. Nuclear power developers are likely to insist that the secretary of state exercises this power, in order to minimise their future risk and reassure investors. The transfer of that risk to taxpayers represents a hidden subsidy to the nuclear industry, according to green campaigners. Decc said the clause would not pave the way for taxpayer funding. An official told the Guardian: \"It's not a weakening of the rules on what the nuclear industry will have to pay for. The Energy Act 2008 ensures that prospective operators of new nuclear power stations must accumulate funds to cover the costs of decommissioning their facilities and of managing and disposing of their waste. To ensure this, operators must submit a Funded Decommissioning Programme (FDP) for approval by the secretary of state. When approving an FDP the secretary of state must be satisfied that it makes prudent provision for all the costs. The amendment does not alter any of these requirements. [It] allows the secretary of state to enter into an agreement with a prospective operator setting out how he will, or will not, exercise this power to modify an FDP. The aim of such an agreement is provide to greater clarity and certainty to investors to enable them to make the very large investments necessary. However, when entering into such an agreement, again, the secretary of state must do so with the aim of ensuring prudent provision.\" But green campaigners said that allowing ministers to enter into agreements that could not be adapted to changing circumstances was a mistake. Martyn Williams, an energy expert at Friends of the Earth, said: \"It's incredible that ministers can keep a straight face when promising not to subsidise new reactors – they're already drafting new laws to bail out the nuclear industry with taxpayers' money if radioactive waste costs are higher than expected.\" He added: \"The Alice-in-Wonderland economics of nuclear power are notorious and cost overruns are frequent. These proposals to shift financial risks on to taxpayers are yet another hidden subsidy.\" The coalition has repeatedly stressed that nuclear power plants would not receive public subsidies under their reforms. However, the planned \"floor price\" for carbon dioxide emissions, which will prop up the price of carbon that fossil fuel industries have to pay, and other measures that benefit \"low-carbon power generation\" – which includes nuclear power as well as renewables such as wind and solar – will bring financial advantages to the nuclear industry. Up to eight new nuclear power stations are planned for the UK. The government's former chief scientist, Sir David King, has sought to allay fears arising from the nuclear incident in Japan by saying nuclear power is \"the safest form of electricity generation\", and has pointed out that passengers on transatlantic jets are exposed to more radiation than people in the Fukushima district around the stricken power plant. The scheduled debate on the coalition's green record was cancelled following an unusual move by the government, which tabled four public statements that meant there would not be enough time for the 7pm debate. Hillier added: \"Chris Huhne seems to have a habit of disappearing. He is leading a green ghetto, and is not being listened to by the rest of government.\" She said the debate cancellation was the result of \"high-handed\" behaviour by the government. \"I don't sense that being green is a coalition-wide priority.\" But a government source said that instead of cancelling the debate, Labour could have agreed to shorten it or cancel a debate on policing instead. The source also pointed out that the Labour front-bench tabled an urgent question, which also contributed to the loss of time available for the debate. Labour has pledged to amend the clause during the committee stage of the bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/30/geothermal-energy-uk-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-30T17:52:00Z","webTitle":"Geothermal energy could meet a fifth of UK's power needs – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/30/geothermal-energy-uk-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/30/geothermal-energy-uk-power","fields":{"headline":"Geothermal energy could meet a fifth of UK's power needs – report","bodyText":"The UK could meet a fifth of its power needs – the equivalent of nine nuclear power stations – by exploiting geothermal power, a new report into the technology has found. But the report found that the current subsidy regime does not provide sufficient incentive to develop the technology in the UK - even as Charles Hendry, minister of state at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, flew to Iceland on Wednesday afternoon and signed a Memorandum of Understanding with his Icelandic counterpart Oddný G. Harðardóttir to explore a possible new interconnector that could be used to import geothermal electricity from the country's volcanoes. Geothermal power stations use water pumped down to hot rocks under the earth that returns to the surface heated, fuelling electricity generation or to be used for space heating. There are promising sites for geothermal power spread throughout the UK, from Cornwall to the Lake District, East Yorkshire, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Another plus is that geothermal power, while renewable and low-carbon, can provide baseload electricity. That means it can be used to back up intermittent sources of renewable energy such as wind and sun. The study found geothermal could supply 9.5GW of electricity, about 20% of current demand, but also 100GW of heat, which would be enough for the whole of the UK's space heating needs. The government has struggled to encourage the take-up of renewable forms of heat, such as wood-fired boilers and underground heat pumps. However, geothermal power receives a relatively low level of subsidy - less than that offered to wave and tidal power, and less than that offered in rival countries such as Germany and Switzerland - according to the report, commissioned by the Renewable Energy Association and written by the engineering consultancy Sinclair Knight Merz. The study, published on Wednesday, found that subsidising geothermal technology initially would help to bring down costs rapidly as sites around the UK were developed. It recommended a different system of subsidy, targeting support at the exploration drilling phase. Ryan Law, chair of the REA's deep geothermal group, said: \"We don't want to be left out of a global industry which is estimated to be worth £30bn by 2020. We could be at the forefront of this industry given the strength of British engineering skills. If the UK wants to seize a share of this booming global market we must prove our competence at home. Clearly investment at home could also go a long way to meeting our future energy needs cleanly and safely.\" There are potential problems to be overcome, however. Geothermal technology is still expensive, can only work in certain sites and the process of drilling and pumping water to the underground rocks has been linked to seismic activity in some areas. The two small earthquakes that hit Blackpool following drilling in the area for shale gas exploration did not stop advisors recommending that ministers should allow shale drilling to go ahead - but local residents may have concerns. Separately, the UK has been advised to extract as much of its remaining reserves of oil and gas as possible, in a report by the International Energy Agency. While praising the UK's low-carbon strategy, the agency said oil and gas would still be needed and should be exploited. Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the IEA, said that the UK needed a more liquid wholesale electricity market, with more competition. She commended government plans for a \"green deal\" to encourage households to insulate their homes, but warned that its success would depend on making the public \"sufficiently aware of its benefits\". She also warned that plans for electricity market reform, which will include companies entering contracts to supply power at a price above the market rate, were \"pioneering\" and would be \"closely observed by other countries in their efforts to ensure continuing reliability of electricity systems while promoting timely decarbonisation of electricity supplies\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/may/23/green-energy-cheaper-gas-bills","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-23T16:03:02Z","webTitle":"Will green energy prove cheaper than gas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/may/23/green-energy-cheaper-gas-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/may/23/green-energy-cheaper-gas-bills","fields":{"headline":"Will green energy prove cheaper than gas?","bodyText":"As I said back in March when the Department of Energy and Climate Change released its predictions for how its climate policies would impact energy bills up to 2030, I am instinctively suspicious of any claims to know what energy prices might be decades away from now. There are simply too many variables at play. However, what I think today's report does do well is emphasise how (most) low-carbon technologies, once installed and running, see their on-going costs fall considerably, unlike sources such as gas which will forever be vulnerable to market volatility, with or without \"miracles\" such as fracking. What the report can't hide, though, is that the low-carbon \"agenda\", as some call it dismissively, will cause our energy bills to rise over the short term, which means for the rest of this decade and possibly into the 2020s. It will take many billions of pounds - and time - to install the low-carbon generating capacity required to account for the winding down of unabated gas and coal. Will consumers tolerate this over the short-term, especially with a media that, in parts, continues to rail against the \"agenda\"? Can any politician today, whose horizon and fate is determined by five-year election cycles, campaign successfully for a rise in energy bills in the near-term in order to help reduce bills for coming generations? It's a very tough ask, but one I believe firmly is ultimately worth pursuing. And it starts with being honest and up-front about the current and estimated future costs of low-carbon energy. Yesterday, José Manuel Barroso, the EU president, gave a presentation (pdf) to the European Council entitled, \"Energy Priorities for Europe\". It is worth looking at slide 7, \"Will there ever be cheap energy for Europe?\"... Back in February, the Guardian produced this interactive graphic using data supplied by Dr Robert Gross, the director of Imperial College London's Centre for Energy Policy and Technology. It shows the \"cost of energy from wind and gas - now and then\". Prof Jim Watson, research director at the UK Energy Research Centre, has sent me this reaction: Their analysis is very important, and it points to a key issue in the debate - i.e. the need to compare the costs of investing in low-carbon energy infrastructure to meet the UK climate change targets with the costs of alternative strategies which risk not meeting these targets. Often the counterfactual costs of not investing in a low-carbon energy system are missing from this debate. The CCC's central conclusion that investing in low-carbon electricity generation is likely to be cheaper than continued reliance on gas is, as the committee argue, evidence based. It reaches a similar conclusion to recent UKERC analysis in its support for a 2030 electricity decarbonisation target. However, it is also important to acknowledge the uncertainties in the CCC analysis: if gas prices turn out to be much lower than expected and the costs of new low carbon technologies are much higher than expected (which is a distinct possibility), a different conclusion could be reached. It would be unwise to assume that there will be substantial falls in UK gas prices in the short-to-medium term - whether from the development of UK shale gas (which is itself highly uncertain) or from a general downward shift in international prices. Here are the thoughts of Dr Jeff Chapman, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association: We welcome the publication of the committee’s report on how government should resolve the uncertainties within the EMR framework. In particular, the committee’s analysis shows that up to 3GW of CCS should be contracted for in the first EMR delivery plan to 2019 – this would imply that all current proposed CCS projects should be built, including the two in the current CCS competition, as well as those outside the competition. However, at present there is little detail about the process for the projects outside the competition and we are seriously concerned that without further clarity for these projects in the near future, the sponsoring companies will be unable to justify continued investment. These projects must be developed in parallel to the projects in the current CCS competition, to allow a seamless transition to the second phase of CCS projects which will create the beginnings of a CCS industry for the UK. We therefore strongly support the recommendation in the committee’s report that government should publish commercialisation strategies for technologies such as CCS – to give much needed confidence to investors of those projects outside the competition and beyond. We implore government to take on board the recommendations in this report and publish an ambitious delivery plan under the EMR framework – clearly setting out the objectives for CCS beyond the current competition. This should include a commitment to offer contracts for differences to a number of CCS projects outside the competition, to begin operating from later this decade. CCS is a critical part of the UK’s low-carbon agenda and represents a major investment in UK infrastructure, creating a significant number of jobs for the UK economy. However these benefits will only be realised with a steady and continuous roll-out of CCS beyond the current competition and we therefore need to ensure that all CCS projects are kept alive and taken forward. One section (pg23, pdf) of the CCC's report is particularly interesting in that it breaks down why it believes (relying on Pöyry's analysis, see my earlier comment) costs will fall varyingly for the different low-carbon technologies: Pöyry identify potential for the costs of all technologies to come down in future through a combination of learning in deployment and de-risking leading to reductions in the cost of capital. The less-mature technologies offer the biggest opportunities for cost reduction through both of these mechanisms. Onshore wind. Potential cost reductions for onshore wind are limited as the technology is already mature. There may be small gains in the cost of capital once new market arrangements are tested and proven to work, and some projects involving repowering of existing sites are likely to be cheaper than entirely new projects. Biomass conversion. We have recommended, in our Bioenergy Review, that long-term use of bioenergy in the power sector should be limited without carbon capture and storage, and that biomass capacity should be focused on conversion of existing coal plants, which is likely to be limited to the near term, given the current age of these assets. We therefore do not include cost estimates for further biomass conversions beyond 2020. Nuclear. Pöyry identify significant scope for costs to fall after the first plant (e.g. to £60-75/MWh by 2030). This primarily reflects the premium built into ‘first of a kind plants’ in both construction costs and cost of capital, in turn reflecting the challenges in deploying new nuclear projects for the first time under the UK’s current regulatory regime, even though this has been set up to minimise costs. It also captures both domestic and international learning effects. Offshore wind. Pöyry assume significant cost reductions as the technology matures (e.g. to £110/MWh in 2030 under central assumptions). This partly reflects learning in construction and operation. It also reflects a significant reduction in the cost of capital as the perceived risk associated with the technology declines as the industry matures and gains experience of deployment and the new market mechanisms (i.e. from the 12.4% currently assumed to 10.4% by 2020 and closer to 9% by 2030 in line with other established technologies). Both these effects rely on continued deployment in the UK, given UK-specific conditions and market arrangements. Carbon Capture Storage. Pöyry assume that costs for commercial projects in the late 2020s could be reduced to under £100/MWh. This would require a concerted and successful commercialisation programme, including measures to ‘commoditise’ and de-risk transport and storage infrastructure. This could reduce required rates of return to 10%, whilst construction costs are also assumed to fall with learning and a scaling up from the early demonstration plants. These cost estimates are also reliant on effective leveraging of learning from both UK and international projects. These estimates suggest that all options have the potential to be competitive with unabated gas generation facing a carbon price in the 2020s (Figures 1.2 and 1.3). This assessment reinforces the portfolio investment approach, which is aimed at driving down the costs of low-carbon technologies such that these become increasingly competitive with gas-fired generation over time. The more eagle-eyed among you might have spotted that solar and marine energy are not referenced above. The report later explains why: The scenarios involve limited roll-out of other renewables (e.g. marine technologies, solar) given currently high costs and limited use of imported low-carbon electricity. It's also worth seeing how the report estimates the costs for these low-carbon technologies in 2030 compared to today. Here's how it sees \"current costs of low-carbon technologies, relative to unabated gas\"... And here's the graphic for \"Projected costs of low-carbon technologies (2030), relative to unabated gas\"... Here's the all-important smallprint for that graphic: Costs for projects starting construction in 2030. Excludes biomass conversion which comes on in 2010s. Fuel price assumptions consistent with latest DECC Projections (October 2012). Carbon price rises in line with Carbon Price Floor, to £76/t in 2030; beyond 2030 rises in line with Government ‘central’ carbon price values (£147/t in 2040 and £217/t in 2050). Cost over project lifetime assuming pre-tax real rate of return of 9% for unabated gas, 9.1% onshore, 9.1% offshore, 9.2% nuclear, 10% CCS. Solid boxes represent range for high/low capex and central fuel prices (central load factor for wind); thin extending lines show sensitivity to combined high/low capex and high/low fuel prices (high/low load factor for wind). Here is the view of Dr Gordon Edge, RenewableUK’s director of policy: This thorough research by the most authoritative body in its field provides compelling evidence that investment in British renewables is cost-effective, whereas an unhealthy addiction to foreign fossil fuels is excruciatingly expensive, as well as being deeply irresponsible. The Committee on Climate Change is also right to highlight the fact that the current lack of a long-term political vision is jeopardising investment in renewable energy projects - including the development of the supply chain which could create tens of thousands of jobs in wind and marine energy, with turbine factories opening around the UK. Earlier this week the European Parliament voted in favour of setting a binding 2030 renewable energy target, to provide long-term clarity. The UK should be sending out similarly positive signals, so that we can maintain Britain’s global lead in the offshore wind, wave and tidal sectors, as well as maintaining our success in onshore wind which is the most cost effective way to generate large amounts of low carbon electricity to power our homes. A niggle to note: the CCC report relies heavily on commissioned research by Pöyry, a management consultancy that specialises in the energy sector. But, rather irritatingly, we can't inspect that research for the following reason: Supporting research:- Pöyry (2012) Technology supply curves for low-carbon generation – a report to the Committee on Climate Change (coming soon) James Murray, editor of BusinessGreen, has been looking at the report, as well as speaking to the CCC's David Kennedy. The article is paywalled, but here's an extract: Speaking to BusinessGreen, CCC chief executive David Kennedy acknowledged some commentators have been advocating precisely that course of action, calling for the world to give up on tackling climate change, but he argued that such an outcome was hugely unlikely. \"We have a Climate Change Act that is in primary legislation and which the government is committed to - we are planning for a carbon constrained world,\" he said, adding that the European Commission was currently working on ambitious new emission targets for 2030 and the US and China were sending \"encouraging signs\" about their commitment to climate action. \"There is no reason to assume we will not still be in a carbon constrained world through the 2020s and 2030s\"... Kennedy explained that the \"dash for gas\" approach delivers significantly higher overall costs of between £25bn and £45bn, because it requires a high build rate of low carbon energy sources in the 2030s that are unlikely to have come down in cost because a supply chain will not have been developed during the 2020s. Significantly, the report assumes the UK will start to develop its own shale gas resources and models a series of scenarios based on high and low global gas prices. It finds that only the lowest gas price modelled makes the gas-focused strategy cost competitive with the portfolio approach, and even then the benefits are negligible. Kennedy revealed the central gas price scenario used for the report was 70p/therm, in line with the International Energy Agency's \"optimistic scenario\" for high levels of new gas supplies, while the low cost gas scenario assumes a price as low as 40p/therm, which he admits is far more optimistic than the vast majority of industry projections. \"We would not end up regretting having invested in the low carbon portfolio, and there is the potential for a very big upside depending on the gas price,\" he said, explaining that if gas or carbon prices exceed the central scenario the economic benefit of the portfolio approach could reach £100bn. The report looks set to spark yet another row between the green and anti-green factions within the coalition. But while he refused to get drawn into the political implications of a report that points out the numerous flaws in what is thought to be Chancellor George Osborne's preferred energy strategy, Kennedy leaves no doubt as to which side of the current energy debate has the stronger evidence base on its side. \"The arguments [to date] have been ideological, rather than evidence based,\" he said. \"It's important we make decisions on these different investment pathways based on the evidence.\" Equally, he is adamant that there is \"no evidence\" to support media scare stories that energy bills will double as a result of decarbonisation, just as there is scant evidence to suggest shale gas will be a game changer on the scale that has been seen in America in the UK... [The report] is a gauntlet thrown down to both the current coalition and whoever forms the government after the next election. A challenge to base policy on the available evidence base, rather than anti-green ideology and blind optimism that global gas prices will plummet. Michelle Hubert, the CBI's principal policy adviser on energy and climate change, has sent me her reaction: The report rightly highlights the importance of finding the most cost-effective route to building a low-carbon economy and the potential benefits on offer to businesses and consumers if we get this right. We need a huge amount of private capital flowing into our energy system to ensure we keep the lights on in an affordable and sustainable way. Our priority must be to get the energy bill onto the statute book as soon as possible to give investors the confidence they need. Here's what people have been saying on Twitter... The timing of the CCC's report is clearly an attempt - to my mind, at least - to influence MPs ahead of the looming energy bill vote, in particular with regard to the crucial issue of Tim Yeo's tabled amendment which proposes a new target to cut power sector carbon intensity to 50gCO2/kWh by 2030. Without it, the CCC suggests, the drive towards adopting an ever-increasing amount of low-carbon energy sources in the decades ahead will be greatly hampered. Here's the wording from the report's executive summary (pg 9, pdf): We recommend the following package of measures that the Government should put in place to improve conditions for investment: Set in legislation this Parliament a target to reduce the carbon intensity of power generation to 50 gCO2/kWh by 2030, with some flexibility to adjust this in the light of new information. Set out strategies to support the development of less-mature technologies through to competitive deployment. Extend to 2030 provisions for the funding of low-carbon technologies (i.e. “the Levy Control Framework”). Publish in the Delivery Plan the amount of capacity that the Government intends to contract over the period 2014/15-2018/19, and prices that it will pay for onshore and offshore wind. Set out options to support mobilisation of new sources of finance, including roles for the Green Investment Bank and Infrastructure UK. These measures would support investment in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies through the 2020s, which the report indicates would result in cost savings of £25-45 billion, in present value terms under central case assumptions about gas and carbon prices, rising to over £100 billion with high gas and carbon prices. The alternative strategy would be to focus on investment in gas-fired generation in the 2020s, followed by investment in low-carbon technologies in the 2030s. This would result in cost savings only in the event that gas prices were to fall significantly, or with low carbon prices, and even then such savings would be limited. Only if the world were to abandon attempts to limit the risk of dangerous climate change would there be significant cost savings from a strategy focused on investment in gas-fired generation. The initial incremental cost to consumers of the recommended carbon-intensity target is around £20 per year for the typical household in 2030 compared to 2020, following which potentially significant cost savings would ensue. A failure to commit to this now can be justified only on the assumption of low gas prices. It would be a bet on an outcome that is the opposite of most expectations. Even if the proposition were to be true, and low gas prices were to ensue, investment in gas-fired generation through the 2020s would offer very limited cost savings. Such an approach would also lock out the much higher benefits from investment in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies in more likely scenarios. Nick Molho, head of energy and climate change policy at WWF-UK, who I quoted earlier, has sent me some further thoughts: The recommendations of the CCC on long-term volume and financial certainty for new low-carbon technologies are spot on. If implemented, they could play a key role in accelerating the cost reductions of those technologies. A key component of reducing the costs of new technologies is not only through learning and economies of scale but it is also by reducing investors’ perception of political risk. The Crown Estate found, for example, last year that for each 1% reduction in the costs of borrowing – a metric that is highly dependent on perception of risks – the costs of offshore wind were likely to go down by around 6%. So, stable policies that create a clear demand for low-carbon power in the long-term and provide stable financial support make sense in that they will have an important bearing in reducing risks for investors and, therefore, technological costs. When you also take into account the forecasts of organisations like the International Energy Agency that indicate that gas prices and gas imports are likely to continue rising in the EU over the next 20 years, with or without shale gas, the CCC have put a compelling case that moving early towards a low-carbon power sector makes strong economic and environmental sense. As ever, Carbon Brief is quick off the mark with its analysis. Robin Webster makes some crucial points and observations, so here's a fulsome extract, which includes a quote given to Carbon Brief by David Kennedy, the CCC's chief executive: The CCC is scathing about the government's gas strategy, launched last December. The gas strategy suggested three possible futures for UK energy policy - including a 'dash for gas' scenario where significantly more gas generation would be built. Publishing \"such widely varying scenarios for sector development\" has created confusion amongst investors, the committee says. There are some similarities between the gas strategy and the CCC's modelling. Both documents suggests that the country could reduce the power sector's emissions intensity to 100g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 2030 - and still hit its emissions targets. But in the CCC's report, this outcome is very much \"Plan B\". It accepts that energy policy is very uncertain and it is hard to make meaningful predictions. For example, nuclear power could turn out to cost more than the government expects; carbon capture and storage technology might not deliver; or offshore wind might turn out to be more expensive than hoped. In these cases, the country might fail to meet the 50g target, and emissions intensity might be reduced to 100g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 2030. But crucially, under the CCC's assumptions, the less mature low carbon technologies would still have been developed. The country would have a wide diversity of low-carbon technologies to rely on, not just gas and nuclear: The CCC contrasts the government's approach with its own, saying: \"...a scenario with high nuclear deployment, but low investment in CCS and offshore wind during the 2020s (e.g. as assumed in the government's emissions projections) could deliver a similar emissions intensity but would leave the UK overly reliant on a single low-carbon technology. This would imply unacceptable costs and risks of achieving the 2050 target and/or of very high electricity prices required to deploy uncommercialised low-carbon options at scale after 2030.\" As our teachers used to say: to fail to prepare is to prepare to fail. It's worth pointing out that the report is based on a crucial assumption - that the UK government and governments worldwide will be committed to decarbonising in the future. Indeed, the CCC's prediction of savings in the UK is based on there being an effective carbon price. And in the UK, cutting emissions and reforming the electricity market continues to present a challenge to politicians focused on short-term energy bills, especially as the savings the CCC predicts depend on high renewable rollout - which will cost money. In fact, in the short term, the CCC estimates that subsidies for low-carbon technologies will add £100 to consumer energy bills by 2020. The greatest economic benefits from investing in low carbon would come after 2030 - which, when the next election is in just two years, is a long time in politics. Chief executive of the CCC, David Kennedy, gave Carbon Brief his opinion: \"Some people might say this is about the 2030s and 40's, so who cares? But lot of us hope to alive then, and so will our kids our grandkids. It's the same argument as about national debt or pensions. Energy is the same, you have to think long term. It's about not lumbering future generations with burdens they can't cope with.\" Here's an extract from the report's foreword (pdf) by Lord Deben (John Gummer, the former environment secretary), the CCC's chairman: This report shows that there is a clear benefit in committing to invest in low-carbon generation over the next two decades. This extension of the time frame beyond 2020 will encourage the necessary investment at a very limited additional cost to the consumer, adding £20 to the annual household energy bill in 2030 compared to 2020, while offering significant cost savings thereafter. This conclusion has been reached after considering whether an alternative strategy of investing in gas-fired generation through the 2020s and delaying investment in low-carbon technologies to the 2030s would be more sensible. The detailed analysis shows that to invest in low-carbon technologies to 2020, then to focus on investment in gas in the 2020s, and to move back to investment in low-carbon generation in the 2030s simply doesn’t stand up. Such an approach is likely to drive up costs, by up to £100 billion in some scenarios. It is therefore important to avoid these unnecessary costs by resolving present uncertainties. The government should state clearly that it intends to support investments in low-carbon technologies through the 2020s. We think that the best way to do this is to set in legislation this parliament a target to reduce 2030 carbon intensity to 50 gCO2/kWh. Industry has been clear that this would provide them with the confidence that they need to invest large amounts of money in project development and the supply chain. Here's a summary of the reaction to today's CCC report... Ed Davey, the energy secretary, in the Independent: “In the long term, low-carbon could be a much cheaper path to go. Our opponents don’t want to admit that we really do care about people’s bills, but actually I’m the consumer’s champion here. The real reason for high energy bills is high global gas prices. I can’t control global gas prices but I can put a cushion between the high global gas price that people face and the bills consumers pay,” in part by supporting low-carbon power generation, he added. Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman: We agree with the CCC on both the need to invest in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies, and the need to reduce our dependence on imported gas which is the main factor driving up household energy bills. We recently trebled government support for low-carbon technologies to £7.6bn out to 2020, and we have introduced landmark legislation through the energy bill to incentivise £110bn of investment in clean energy infrastructure, which has the potential to support 250,000 jobs in the energy sector. This July, we will set out the strike prices we will offer investors within our electricity market reform delivery plan, and prior to this will consult with a range of interested parties, as well as considering the CCC’s recommendations. Tim Yeo MP, chair of the Commons' Energy and Climate Change Committee: This report raises serious concerns about the mixed messages the government has been sending on energy and climate change policy. The energy bill is supposed to deliver billions of pounds of investment in clean energy infrastructure by providing long term certainty and reducing capital costs, but the Treasury has undermined investor confidence by stripping the legislation of a clear carbon reduction target. If the government wants to secure the maximum economic benefits of its energy bill, it must listen to the advice of its own independent advisors and introduce a target to clean up the power sector by 2030. The decarbonisation amendment I have tabled on the energy bill will do just that. Unfortunately, the government seems prepared to gamble on gas prices going down instead. If fossil fuel prices were to rise due to growing global energy demand and when an inevitable international deal is struck to avoid the worst effects of climate change, this might may make gas even more expensive. Nick Molho, head of energy and climate change policy at WWF-UK: Like quitting smoking now for the benefit of your long-term health, this report shows that shifting early to a low-carbon power sector is a no-regrets policy. It's technically feasible, should deliver big savings to people's energy bills and create promising growth opportunities in areas like offshore wind where the UK is an industrial leader. In a world in which we’re serious about preventing dangerous levels of climate change, this report is also clear that gas can only have a limited role to play. If we want to unlock the many benefits of low-carbon investment, the energy bill needs to give investors confidence that the UK is the place to invest. Stable financial support and a long-term decarbonisation target will be key to giving businesses the clarity they need. Leila Deen, a Greenpeace energy campaigner: Every MP in British politics should take heed of this report, because in two weeks’ time they’ll be making the biggest changes to the UK’s energy system in a generation when they vote on the energy bill. The CCC’s advice is clear - a clean energy system is better for business and better for consumers. George Osborne has ripped a 2030 decarbonisation target from the bill, but with hundreds of businesses and investors crying foul, it’s up to Coalition MPs to vote it back in. Only that way can we ensure the UK is on a path to cleaner, safer, cheaper power. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises the UK government on meeting its emissions targets, has today published a report outlining why investing in low-carbon technologies will, over the longer term, be more cost effective than gas. As Fiona Harvey in the Guardian reports: The sooner the UK makes large investments in low-carbon generation – including offshore and onshore wind, nuclear power and energy from waste – the cheaper it will be, according to David Kennedy, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). The conclusions are likely to be controversial, as many MPs on the right of the Tory party have been clamouring for an end to onshore windfarms and reductions in renewable subsidies. They would prefer to see a new \"dash for gas\" that would require the UK to massively expand shale gas drilling and import tens of billions of pounds worth of fuel each year as North Sea reserves run down. They point to lower gas prices in the US that have resulted from the aggressive pursuit of shale resources. The report is published just a couple of weeks before MPs vote on the energy bill, which will help to determine the UK's energy strategy in the years and decades ahead. The CCC's report is rare in that it looks out to far beyond 2030 in its forecasting, arguing that investment now in low-carbon energy will pay dividends by the next decade and beyond, unlike gas which suffers - and will continue to suffer - from unpredictable price volatility. Do the sums add up for low-carbon technologies? Can we really know what prices are likely to be decades ahead? Is paying more now for low-carbon energy a sound investment over the longer term, compared to making a \"dash for gas\"? Please leave your own thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/mar/21/budget-2011-environment-green-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-22T09:30:00Z","webTitle":"Budget 2011: The key green announcements to watch for | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/mar/21/budget-2011-environment-green-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/mar/21/budget-2011-environment-green-bank","fields":{"headline":"Budget 2011: The key green announcements to watch for","bodyText":"\"If I become chancellor, the Treasury will become a green ally, not a foe.\" Those were the brave words spoken by George Osborne in opposition, before he'd met the stony-faced officials. Now he has to deliver. The budget on Wednesday is the make-or-break moment for some of the coalition's flagship green policies, specifically the green investment bank (GIB). The prime minister appears bullish, with David Cameron repeating his promise to be the \"greenest government ever\" twice on Monday, in support of Climate Week and WWF's Earth Hour, backed up by Greg Barker doing the same on this site. But the reality is shaping up to be rather different, according to those I have spoken to and the advance briefing to the press. On the GIB, fuel duty, air passenger duty and the carbon floor price - a tax on highly polluting activities - the likely result seems more brown than green. Green investment bank: This is the big one and the coalition has nowhere to hide. The GIB is intended to play a central role in driving the huge investment - £370bn by 2025, say some – needed in low carbon infrastructure in order to make the UK's economy green and sustainable. The GIB was a Conservative and LibDem manifesto pledge, and a coalition pledge. MPs on the environment audit committee made plain that only an independent bank that can borrow and issue bonds would be equal to the scale of the challenge. But Treasury officials have put up a fierce fight, not wanting to cede its control over government borrowing and adamant that allowing GIB borrowing is impossible, as it would add to the national debt. (The latter is an infuriating quirk of accountancy rules - GIB borrowing would not increase the UK's deficit – all money going out would be balanced by money coming in – but would count towards the national debt.) So the question is will Cameron, Clegg and Osborne face down the Treasury? The latest prediction is that the GIB will be able to borrow – good – but not till 2015 – bad. That stinks of a compromise that allows ministers to keep their word in letter but not in spirit. To re-use Chris Huhne's analogy – \"ducks quack, and banks borrow as well as lend\" – this fudge would mean the GIB could quack, but not fly. Air passenger duty: Greenhouse gas emissions from aviation are rising fast and make up the biggest part of the total carbon footprint of many in the developed world. The only green aviation policy is to make the price of flying match its impact – aviation fuel is untaxed, for example. But this government, like the last, will not put environmental principles above popular politics, saying in effect to voters \"times are hard, you need a cheap holiday\". Having abandoned a very sensible proposal to switch a per-passenger to a per-plane tax, discouraging empty flights, the government is now set to abandon a planned rise in the passenger tax. Fuel duty: This is the most widely signposted of all the budget measures and has a fiscal impact that dwarfs all the other green measures: the government will not impose the planned fuel duty rise, giving up £540m a year. Again, this is understandable politically: a vast number of people use their cars to get to work and rising fuels prices hit them hard and fast. But without measures to address the root of the problem – oil dependency, as articulated by Chris Huhne – this is a retrograde environmental step. What measures you ask? How about reversing the cuts to public transport or the faster deployment of electric cars? Carbon capture and storage demonstrations: The story of CCS in the UK is a sorry one to date. The nation has a unique combination of expertise (oil, gas, coal) and geography (empty North Sea reservoirs) and yet has dithered and dallied for years on making the crucial initial investment to get the technology from the experimental to the commercial stage. The coalition impressively found £1bn of real cash to fund the first demonstration, but still hasn't announce the winner of the competition (which has only one remaining contender). But the bigger question is whether the further three demonstrations promised by the government will get the funding as planned via a levy on energy customers bills? The problem for ministers is that there are already significant levies on bills – will they want to add more? The budget should give the answer. Carbon floor price: This, in theory, is a good thing. A transparent tax on activities that release CO2, putting a price on the damage the pollution causes and making clean alternatives relatively cheaper. But the consultation has a price that's too low to make any difference at one end and at the other end a price that, once passed from energy companies on to consumers, threatens to drive up those suffering fuel poverty. There is another pitfall too: the carbon floor price could deliver billions in windfall profits to the operators of existing nuclear power stations in the UK, which generate low carbon electricity. The green solution is a medium to high price linked to measures to address fuel poverty, to prevent huge nuclear windfalls and to make clear how the revenue raised would be used to increase energy security and sustainability. Green deal, planning, CRC: Other things to watch out for in the budget include changes to Decc's Green Deal. As it stands only the cheaper energy efficiency measures – eg cavity wall insulation – will pass the green deal's \"golden rule\", in which the cost savings in home energy bills must be more than the loan repayments. Some have mooted linking take up with a cut in stamp duty. Further \"simplification\" of the carbon reduction commitment (CRC) is expected, which the government \"simplified\" at the last budget by turning it from a potential incentive into a tax. Planning issues are also worth keeping an eye on - will the desire for growth mean Osborne hacks back planning regulations, even though greens say this approach doesn't work? Let me know what you think of the above, and what I have missed, now and on Wednesday. I'll be live tweeting (@dpcarrington) and blogging via the Guardian's budget live blog.

The president François Hollande vowed during the election campaign that in majority state-owned companies, the highest salary must not be 20 times more than the pay of the lowliest worker. The squeeze on state fat cats, expected to be enacted by decree next month, is part of the new government's quest for France to set a moral example in a crisis-hit Europe where top earners' stratospheric pay packages and benefits has exasperated workers and voters. The measure will sit alongside Hollande's promised new top tax rate of 75% on income over 1 million euros, which is extremely popular among the French public, and which he has described as an act of \"patriotism\" and \"morality\". Socialists brushed aside criticisms from the right that state pay-caps could make it difficult to recruit from private sector. The prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, aware of the unease at fat-cat excesses weeks before the parliament elections, took a hard line, announcing in an interview with the weekly L'Express that the executive pay-cuts would apply to those already in their posts rather than only new contracts. \"I believe in the patriotism of company leaders. They can understand the crisis requires the political and financial elite to set an example\". The president and cabinet have cut their own pay by 30%. The French state owns stakes in 52 companies, although only 23 are 100% state-owned, including the railway SNCF, the post office La Poste and various ports and airports. Companies where the state is a majority stake-holder, and which will be affected, include the energy giant EDF and nuclear power plant builder Areva, both currently expanding internationally including in Britain. Only companies controlled at more than 50% by the state will have to abide by pay changes. The state could also seek to pressure those where it has a minority stake, such as France Telecom, Air France and Renault, although there is no guarantee they must abide by government demands. One of the biggest hits could be taken by Henri Proglio, the chief executive of EDF, who currently earns around 1.55m euros, 64 times the lowest paid electrician. Proglio might have to take a 68% pay cut and see his package dip below 500,000 euros. According to the daily Liberation, the chief executive of the French post office could also lose 41% of his package. On over 600,000 euros, he currently earns 34 times the wage of the lowliest postal worker. Guillaume Pepy, head of the railways, SNCF, earns an estimated 250,000, around 15 times the lowest-paid rail workers, so would not face a cut. The finance minister Pierre Moscovici said a decree would be issued by cabinet within two weeks over the pay caps. But the state sought to send a clear message by announcing it would oppose a 400,000 euro indemnity payout to the former chief executive of the loss-making Air France, in which the state holds a 15.9% stake. \"It's called decency in pay,\" said Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for Industrial Recovery. Louis Gallois, outgoing chief executive of the European defence group EADS, in which the French government has a minority stake, said there shouldn't be \"tears\" on the part of executives, but told Europe 1 radio, \"I do recognise it's steep for some.\" He added: \"For me, it's a crisis measure, like the 75% tax on remuneration over one million euros … These are measures that should be provisional, an expression of a crisis situation and necessarily solidarity.\" He said in general, companies should be given more flexibility on setting pay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2012/jun/19/inside-guardian-weekly-22-june","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-19T13:09:17Z","webTitle":"Inside the 22 June edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jun/19/inside-guardian-weekly-22-june","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2012/jun/19/inside-guardian-weekly-22-june","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 22 June edition","bodyText":"With the freshly elected pro-austerity, pro-euro New Democracy party set to form a new government in Greece, can the eurozone finally breathe a sigh of relief?

This isn't true of course. After some well-deserved criticism, party activists have taken steps to change those stances. Yet some scientists keep attacking them. Yesterday, the Green London assembly member Jenny Jones said she was planning to attend the \"Take the Flour Back\" protest at Rothamstead Research, which is against genetically modified foods. Naturally a mini-storm of criticism on Twitter followed. Hi @mark_lynas The Green Party isn't supporting destruction, but I am supporting the protest. GM is oversold by corporate interests. — Jenny Jones (@GreenJennyJones) May 24, 2012 Green supporter Tom Chivers at the Telegraph vowed to stop voting Green and several people resigned from the party. \"Take The Flour Back\" are opposed to GM wheat. They aim to visit Rothamsted Park, where it is being grown as part of an experiment, and destroy the crops. In an unusual step, the scientists involved have tried to engage with the protesters too, to little avail. In this case I'll agree with the scientists that many of the assertions made about the GM trial are false. The Greens should accept that, even if they remain opposed to GM foods more broadly. But some of the criticism is unfair.First, the Conservatives and Ukip are far more scientifically illiterate than the Greens. They are actively trying to sabotage the debate on how to deal with climate change, and most deny it is even taking place. Given that scientists are utterly failing to engage or lead the debate on climate change – why not spend more time dealing with that bigger problem than attacking Greens over small things? Our planet is dying thanks to global warming and some scientists think this GM outrage should be a top priority? Really? Second a newsflash for scientists: none of the major political parties will take on board all your recommendations. If you want one, then vote for the minuscule Science party. Every political party has to weigh up a range of interests that sometimes conflict with each other. Last night I attended a talk entitled \"Science Communication and Political Divides\" (Storifyed here) and I was relieved to hear one scientist admit: \"Scientists are not very good at doing politics.\" She went on to say: \"Evidence has to be considered in a public light,\" which is exactly right. They were referring to drugs policy in that context (Prof David Nutt and his firing around drugs policy), but the point was the same: don't expect politicians and the public to formulate policy merely on the basis of scientific evidence. Science has real world results. In the case of GM foods, the industry has become concentrated in the hands of a few companies that have started patenting and exploiting farmers and consumers from developing countries. The divide is not between \"pro-science\" and \"anti-science\" political parties at all. Rather, politicians and parties will always side with science when it suits their constituency or aligns with their interests. Conservatives and Republicans will side with scientists when big corporations benefit (GM foods, nuclear power) and oppose it when big corporates are losing out (renewable energy). Greens support the science on climate change, but oppose GM food research and development for economic and sustainability reasons. Whether scientists like it or not, voters are also swayed by those concerns. The challenge for scientists isn't to merely focus on what the evidence says. It is also to convince the public that their suggested course of action is the right one, even when the public is sceptical for perfectly valid reasons. Ignoring those concerns and calling them \"luddites\" just doesn't work. Perhaps this is why scientists are failing to get faster action on climate change. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/grrlscientist/2012/aug/10/1","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-10T08:00:09Z","webTitle":"Holmium | video | @GrrlScientist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2012/aug/10/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/grrlscientist/2012/aug/10/1","fields":{"headline":"Holmium | video |","bodyText":"Who out there is familiar with holmium? Go on, raise your hand, don't be shy! This week's element is holmium, another rare earths metal which has the symbol Ho and the atomic number, 67. This element was named after Stockholm, the hometown of one of this element's co-discoverers. As you can see in the above image, holmium has a lovely metallic lustre and is silvery-white in colour. It also is fairly soft and malleable. Like the other rare earths metals, holmium is never found in its pure form in the wild. To this day, it remains quite challenging to separate from other rare earths metals, which it associates with. Holmium is another element that is not very interesting to biologists because it is neither essential to life, nor is it poisonous. However, that said, holmium does have medical applications, particularly in Ho-YAG (holmium yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers, which emits light of a wavelength that doesn't damage eyesight, thus, one of its medical uses is for eye surgery. There are several things that I especially like about holmium. First, its colours. Holmium oxide shows two dramatically different colours based on changes in ambient lighting. Under natural light, it's yellow, but under fluorescent lighting, it's pink. Holmium also bonds -- colourfully -- with the halogens; usually this pairing is yellow in colour, although holmium fluoride, HoF3, is pink. Second, its atomic number is 67, an odd (and prime!) number. Like nearly all odd-numbered elements, holmium is less abundant than the closest even-numbered elements, in this case, last week's element, dysprosium, and next week's element, erbium. This observation, known formally as the Oddo-Harkins rule, is true for all elements in the universe -- except one pair: hydrogen and helium. The reason for this phenomenon is thought to be because protons are most stable when paired, thus making odd-numbered elements less common than their even-numbered neighbors in the periodic table since odd elements may either lose or (more commonly) capture another proton to increase their stability, thereby changing their atomic number -- and identity. Third, since unpaired electrons are the source of magnetism and because it has such a large number of unpaired electrons, holmium has a number of unusual magnetic properties. In this video, our favourite chemists explain a little about the origin of holmium's magnetic qualities: [video link] Another use for holmium is in nuclear power rods because it absorbs runaway neutrons created by nuclear reactors, thereby controlling the rate of the reaction. Interestingly, all isotopes of holmium (and there are 35 of them) are predicted by nuclear theory to be radioactive, including its one apparently stable isotope, holmium-165.

After two hydrogen explosions at the Fukushima Daiichi reactor in Japan, the German chancellor has decided to re-examine her highly controversial decision last year to renew the country's 17 nuclear plants for an average 12 years, German media is reporting. Government sources are reported to have said that Merkel took the decision on Sunday night after a crisis meeting at the Berlin headquarters of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party. She is expected to confirm the suspension at a press conference with her foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, at 4pm (3pm GMT). Switzerland has announced it is suspending plans to build new nuclear power stations. The Swiss energy minister, Doris Leuthard, said the suspension would affect all \"blanket authorisation for nuclear replacement until safety standards have been carefully reviewed and, if necessary, adapted\". Swiss regulatory authorities had approved three sites for new nuclear power stations after the plans were submitted in 2008. Earlier on Monday, Westerwelle told reporters that he could imagine a temporary halt in Germany's nuclear renewal programme. \"You can't cut costs where safety is concerned,\" he said. Germany's environment minister, Norbert Röttgen, said: \"Even in the CDU, we are having to have a new debate [about nuclear power] because we are in a new situation.\" In Monday's newspapers, the opposition parties demanded a rethink on Germany's nuclear policy. Sigmar Gabriel, head of the Social Democrat party, said: \"We need to make clear that not only are the days of cheap oil over, but also the days of nuclear power.\" The Left party demanded an \"immediate, irreversible and systematic dismantling\" of Germany's nuclear power plants. The European energy commissioner, Guenther Oettinger, said safety at older German nuclear power stations must be checked rigorously, and he refused to rule out closures if necessary. He told Deutschlandfunk radio that the crisis at the Japanese nuclear plant had changed the world and put into question what had been regarded as safe and manageable. Oettinger, Germany's member of the European commission, said safety questions were primarily the responsibility of the 14 European Union states which used atomic energy, and that safety at Germany's older plants was constantly being upgraded. But asked if the older plants could be shut down, he said: \"If we take it seriously and say the incident has changed the world - and much that we as an industrial society have regarded as safe and manageable is now in question - then we can't exclude anything.\" Oettinger is a member of the CDU and a former premier of the south-western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where the party risks losing power in elections in two weeks, due partly to rising support for the Greens. Merkel called a crisis meeting with senior ministers on Saturday to discuss the consequences of Japan's nuclear crisis after the massive earthquake and tsunami. As thousands protested in Baden-Wuerttemberg against her nuclear policy, Merkel said Germany's nuclear plants were safe but the government was watching the situation in Japan to see if lessons could be learned. The decision last year to keep Germany's 17 nuclear plants running for about 12 years beyond their original shutdown date stirred large-scale protests and hit the ruling coalition's popularity. On Saturday, anti-nuclear protesters formed a 27-mile human chain from the city of Stuttgart to an older nuclear power plant that will be kept running longer because of the new policy. Between 50,000 and 60,000 demonstrators took part, according to police and organisers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2012/mar/06/mrs-camerons-diary-hilto-segway","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-06T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"Mrs Cameron's Diary: am missing Hilto and his Segway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/06/mrs-camerons-diary-hilto-segway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/06/mrs-camerons-diary-hilto-segway","fields":{"headline":"Mrs Cameron's Diary: am missing Hilto and his Segway","bodyText":"Actually I am only quite missing Hilto because tbh what's to like about men in bare legs except for sport, and though the cabinet boys are thrilled to wear whatever Dave is wearing, dear Govey even texts to find out if it is a purple or blue tie day, the jobsworths got so jealous you literally could not move for people in shorts shouting dude and leaving bikes in the hall.

Cohen specifically cites this statement from the Iranian president last week: \"Let's even imagine that we have an atomic weapon, a nuclear weapon. What would we do with it? What intelligent person would fight 5,000 American bombs with one bomb?\" Cohen's surprise notwithstanding, numerous Iranian leaders, including Ahmadinejad, have long made the same point. And it's a point so obvious it should not even need to be made. No rational person takes seriously the claim that Iran, even if it did obtain a nuclear weapon, would commit instant and guaranteed national suicide by using it to attack a nation that has a huge nuclear stockpile, which happens to include both the US and Israel. One can locate nothing in the actions of Iran's regime that even suggests irrationality on that level, let alone suicidal impulses. That Iran will use its nuclear weapons against the US and Israel is rather obviously the centerpiece of the fear-mongering campaign against Tehran, to build popular support for threats to launch an aggressive attack in order to prevent them from acquiring that weapon. So what, then, is the real reason that so many people in both the US and Israeli governments are so desperate to stop Iranian proliferation? Every now and then, they reveal the real reason: Iranian nuclear weapons would prevent the US from attacking Iran at will, and that is what is intolerable. The latest person to unwittingly reveal the real reason for viewing an Iranian nuclear capacity as unacceptable was GOP Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the US's most reliable and bloodthirsty warmongers. On Monday, Graham spoke in North Augusta, South Carolina, and was asked about the way in which sanctions were harming ordinary Iranians. Ayman Hossam Fadel was present and recorded the exchange. Answering that question, Graham praised President Obama for threatening Iran with war over nuclear weapons, decreed that \"the Iranian people should be willing to suffer now for a better future,\" and then – invoking the trite neocon script that is hauled out whenever new wars are being justified – analogized Iranian nukes to Hitler in the 1930s. But in the middle of his answer, he explained the real reason Iranian nuclear weapons should be feared: \"They have two goals: one, regime survival. The best way for the regime surviving, in their mind, is having a nuclear weapon, because when you have a nuclear weapon, nobody attacks you.\" Graham added that the second regime goal is \"influence\", that \"people listen to you\" when you have a nuclear weapon. In other words, we cannot let Iran acquire nuclear weapons because if they get them, we can no longer attack them when we want to and can no longer bully them in their own region. Graham's answer is consistent with what various American policy elites have said over the years about America's enemies generally and Iran specifically: the true threat of nuclear proliferation is that it can deter American aggression. Thomas Donnelly of the American Enterprise Institute and the New American Century Project has long been crystal clear that this is the real reason for opposing Iranian nuclear capability [my emphasis]: \"When their missiles are tipped with warheads carrying nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, even weak regional powers have a credible deterrent regardless of the balance of conventional forces … In the post cold war era, America and its allies, rather than the Soviet Union, have become the primary objects of deterrence and it is states like Iraq, Iran and North Korea who most wish to develop deterrent capabilities.\" He added: \"The surest deterrent to American action is a functioning nuclear arsenal … \"To be sure, the prospect of a nuclear Iran is a nightmare. But it is less a nightmare because of the high likelihood that Tehran would employ its weapons or pass them on to terrorist groups – although that is not beyond the realm of possibility – and more because of the constraining effect it threatens to impose upon US strategy for the greater Middle East. The danger is that Iran will 'extend' its deterrence, either directly or de facto, to a variety of states and other actors throughout the region. This would be an ironic echo of the extended deterrence thought to apply to US allies during the cold war.\" As Jonathan Schwarz has extensively documented, this is what US policy elites have said over and over. In 2001, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned: \"Several of these [small enemy nations] are intensely hostile to the United States and are arming to deter us from bringing our conventional or nuclear power to bear in a regional crisis.\" In 2002, State Department official Philip Zelikow said that if Iraq were permitted to keep its WMDs, \"they now can deter us from attacking them, because they really can retaliate against us.\" In 2008, Democratic Senator Chuck Robb and GOP Senator Dan Coates wrote an incredibly hawkish Washington Post op-ed all but demanding an attack on Iran, and wrote: \"[A]n Islamic Republic of Iran with nuclear weapons capability would be strategically untenable. It would threaten U.S. national security … While a nuclear attack is the worst-case scenario, Iran would not need to employ a nuclear arsenal to threaten US interests. Simply obtaining the ability to quickly assemble a nuclear weapon would effectively give Iran a nuclear deterrent.\" The No 1 concern of American national security planners appears to be that countries may be able to prevent the US from attacking them at will, whether to change their regimes or achieve other objectives. In other words, Iranian nuclear weapons could be used to prevent wars – ones started by the US – and that, above all, is what we must fear. (Graham's questioner said that she believed Iran was not committed to developing a nuclear weapon, and Graham responded that Israeli leaders had reached the opposite conclusion. That is simply false.) Whatever one thinks of Iran, the signal the US has sent to the world is unmistakable: any rational government should acquire nuclear weapons. The Iranians undoubtedly watched the US treatment of two dictators who gave up their quest for nuclear weapons – Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar Gaddafi – and drew the only reasoned lesson: the only way a country can protect itself from US attack, other than full-scale obeisance, is to acquire nuclear weapons. That is precisely why the US and Israel are so eager to ensure they do not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-fishermen-crippled-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-09T14:58:06Z","webTitle":"Fukushima fishermen battle to turn the tide on a crippled industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-fishermen-crippled-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-fishermen-crippled-industry","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima fishermen battle to turn the tide on a crippled industry","bodyText":"One by one they are unloaded, weighed and tipped into plastic vats of ice – hundreds of octopuses that flail and whip the melting ice into a foaming mollusk soup. In this state they look far from appetising, but the catch marks a critical step forward in the battle to save the local fishing industry almost a year and a half after the meltdown at nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. \"That's quite a good catch,\" said Kasunori Endo, general manager of the Soma-Futaba fisheries co-operative. Endo was hopeful that consumers would quickly grow accustomed to seeing even more Fukushima seafood reappear on supermarket shelves: \"I'm looking forward to increasing the number of species we can catch. We may soon be able to fish for crab and squid. We won't make serious progress until we bring in a bigger, more varied catch.\" The nuclear disaster heaped an extra layer of misery on the region's fishermen, who already had to contend with the destruction of fishing boats, equipment and ports by the tsunami that roared ashore on 11 March last year. Fishing co-operatives in Fukushima prefecture voluntarily refrained from venturing into local waters – an official ban on catching most marine species was imposed only recently – amid fears that radioactive leaks from the plant had made seafood too dangerous to consume. Then, 15 months after the start of the nuclear crisis, boats in Soma, which is about 30 miles north of the plant, were given permission on a trial basis to start catching two types of octopus and whelks, selected because they are thought to trap fewer radioactive particles than other species. After the catch was unloaded, samples were taken to a nearby lab, to which the Guardian was granted rare access. Staff dressed in white overalls, masks, hats and gloves sliced octopus tentacles into chunks, then wrapped them in plastic to be taken into an adjoining room for testing. On this occasion, as on every other day since fishing in Soma resumed at the end of June, the two radiation-measuring devices in the lab revealed not even the slightest trace of radioactive iodine-131, and caesium-134 and -137. In March, the government introduced stricter acceptable radiation levels in seafood, increased from 500 becquerels per kilo to 100 becquerels. \"There may be very tiny amounts, but they are so small they don't even register on equipment as sophisticated as this,\" says Noriaki Haga, the fisheries official in charge of testing. The octopuses are tested again after they have been boiled, in preparation for sale. Despite proof that this particular delicacy is safe, Fukushima's fishermen concede that the consumers they once depended on to make a living have yet to be convinced. For weeks after fishing resumed, octopus and whelks were sold only at supermarkets in Fukushima prefecture. Retailers reported that the items, priced about 40% lower than usual, quickly sold out as local shoppers put on a display of solidarity with their embattled fishermen. But the fisherman are concerned that the wider Japanese population will be harder to win round. Last month, the recovery reached another milestone when whelks and octopus went on sale in neighbouring Miyagi prefecture. Last week they were auctioned off at Tokyo's Tsukiji market for the first time since the disaster. But dozens of other types of seafood, including the region's prized squid, crab and flounder, are still off-limits while scientists attempt to gauge the nuclear accident's long-term impact on the marine food chain. Back in Soma, some fishermen fear that the recent sales are simply delaying the inevitable for an industry that was already in decline, due largely to its ageing, shrinking workforce, well before the tsunami. Annual sales of Fukushima-caught fish plunged from about 11bn yen in 2010 to 1.6bn yen last year, after fishing fleets were forced to suspend operations in the wake of the nuclear accident. As compensation, fishermen here have received about £80m from the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power. But compared with disaster-hit areas farther north, the cleanup operation has made little progress in places such as Soma. Debris in Fukushima cannot be transported outside the prefecture for burial or incineration, and the government has yet to reach agreement with communities near the plant about the construction of temporary storage sites. \"Most of our nets were washed away and our ice storage facility was ruined,\" said Tadashi Sakurai, a 73-year-old Soma fisherman as he repaired nets retrieved from the tsunami debris while bulldozers clear the building remains on the quayside. \"Selling octopuses and shellfish doesn't mean we're back in business,\" said Sakurai, who has been working on boats since he was 10. \"This isn't a recovery, and won't be until we increase our catch and people around Japan start eating it again.\" The total haul on a recent afternoon stood at five tonnes of octopus and a tonne of whelks, but that is less than a tenth of the overall catch Soma's fishermen brought in daily before the tsunami. \"We want to get back to those days as quickly as possible, and this is the first step,\" said Haga. \"If we'd only had to contend with the tsunami and not the nuclear accident as well, we'd be much farther along the road to recovery by now. Radiation is our invisible enemy. All we can do is test and test again, and try to reassure people. But as soon as they hear the word Fukushima … \""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2012/sep/15/us-election-obama-romney","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-14T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Simon Hoggart's week: Fever of election apathy grips US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/sep/15/us-election-obama-romney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2012/sep/15/us-election-obama-romney","fields":{"headline":"Simon Hoggart's week: Fever of election apathy grips US","bodyText":"✒We are just back from holiday in the US, which is mostly in a fever of election apathy. We started in Stonington, Maine, a lovely fishing village now shared between artists and lobstermen, the latter considerably richer, since they land around 14 million pounds of lobster every year, and the artists sell the odd canvas every week. There is a glut of lobsters, and I cannot imagine anything nicer. Nobody there was talking about the election. But our next stop was Washington, where they spoke of little else. Republicans loathe Obama, and his fans from four years ago feel deeply let down by his caution and conservatism. But then everyone dislikes Mitt Romney, not least his own party. Even his supporters make fun of his stiffness, his wealth and his inability to understand normal humans. \"Why does he need a car elevator?\" asked the New York Times, referring to this rich man's toy. \"Can't his cars use the stairs like everyone else?\" TV ads make fun of his wife's dressage horses; as they mince from side to side and back again, the Democrats list his endless policy changes. Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, makes David Cameron look like a socialist. Last week we took two days out on the Blue Ridge mountains of Virginia, staying on a small vineyard. At the start of the great depression the government built the Skyline Drive, along the top of the hills, a magnificent 105-mile highway that whisks you past some of the loveliest scenery in America. Thousands of men were employed to build the road, so keeping money flowing round the local economy and leaving the country with a priceless permanent attraction. But that sort of common sense is unfashionable now. Ryan and our own George Osborne are not just ignoring the past; they are uninventing the wheel. ✒We stayed at the Sharp Rock vineyard, one of a host of Virginian properties that make surprisingly good wine. It's a gorgeous part of the world, with great pillared mansions next to old farm shacks. Our host, Jim East, makes a dozen different wines, all very passable, and a Reserve Chardonnay that is delicious, rather like its west Australian equivalent. Soon after we got back to Blighty we went to a showing of a new film, A Year in Burgundy, which was all about the precious soil, the vines, the family traditions, and so forth. The wines we tasted there were also good, but they must be thanking God for the Chinese market, where the prestige of the label is everything, because the rest of the world is catching up fast and has often overtaken it. Burgundy growers now buy property in Oregon, and the same soil is found even in Bulgaria. The scale of the challenge facing France was obvious at the International Wine Trophy dinner in London this week. Since there were nine bottles of wine and two of sake on each table of 10, I may not remember very much, but I do know that of the 75 wines commended, only a third came from France. It's not a bad record, but it shows how ferocious the competition is. ✒One of the things I like about Americans is their absolute openness about their political beliefs. Some of them are so anxious for you to know every opinion they hold that they festoon every inch of their cars with messages, like the ads in Formula One. In Blue Hill, Maine, I saw the back of a family saloon which had a sticker saying \"peace\" in English, Arabic and Russian, another demanding the shutdown of a nuclear power plant, a question: \"Have you hugged your Shetland sheep today?\", a demand to protect a local river, and a placard declaring \"when the power of love overcomes the love of power, then there will be peace on earth.\" And others. Somehow they had room for an Obama sticker (of course) and the logo of the car – a Prius, in case you needed to ask. ✒Stephen Pile, the diffident writer who came up with the concept of the heroic failure, has a new book out, a compendium of his greatest flops. It's called The Not Terribly Good Book Of Heroic Failures (Faber, £12.99) and it's full of goodies. One of my favourites is the worst ever music critic, James William Davison, who edited Musical World magazine for 37 years in the Victorian era. Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet he called \"rubbishy\", Rigoletto would be forgotten \"after a night or two\", and Wagner, he declared, \"cannot write music\". Liszt was \"talentless fungi\", Berlioz \"a vulgar lunatic\" and Schumann's entire work could \"hardly be called music at all.\" He also detested and panned Schubert and Chopin. But there was one composer, he said, who would live on in the hearts of all music lovers – Mr Sterndale Bennett. Others mocked this choice, but Davison was certain posterity would vindicate him. ✒The war against jargon goes on, but I fear that like the Germans in 1918 we are losing, inch by inch. Take this ad for NHS posts, all paying over £100,000 a year. One is a \"director of insight\".

You will educate and inspire your peers in to the value of insight in enabling all business-critical decision making to be truly grounded on patient and public voice and evidence.\" Or, to put it another way, \"you'll find ways to save money and help patients.\" But that wouldn't be worth 100 grand.

The incumbency poured scorn on this, many of them professing that they had invented a new asset class – mortgage-backed securities and related complex derivatives – that represented an entirely new method of generating wealth. Today, rather more whistleblowers are saying that another incumbency, the oil and gas sector, has its asset assessment fundamentally wrong. The incumbency pours scorn on this, insisting that they have opened up another new asset class – unconventional oil and gas – and that it represents another unforeseen road to riches. Some go so far as to say that North America is en route to being self-sufficient in hydrocarbons. The first incumbency illusion proved to be a deadly bubble, the legacy of which still threatens to torpedo the global economy five years on. We will find out about the second within a few years. The UK industry taskforce on peak oil and energy security, which I convened, is among many groups forecasting a global descent in oil production by 2015 at the latest, notwithstanding all the incumbency rhetoric. Ahead of the credit crunch, commentators echoed the incumbency mantras right across the media. Ahead of the oil crisis, the same is happening. Just Google \"peak oil myth\" and see what comes up. Yesterday George Monbiot joined this group with an article entitled We were wrong about peak oil. There's enough to fry us all. The many misunderstandings he relays begin with the title. There is more than enough potential oil resource below ground to create the climate disaster he refers to. Peak oil is not about that. It is about when global production falls never again to reach past levels: a disaster, if the descent hits an oil-dependent global economy years ahead of expectations. This descent depends on flow rates in oilfields, not the amount of oil left. What worries those who believe the global oil peak is imminent is the evidence that the oil industry will not be able to maintain growing flow rates for much longer. The whistleblowing in the run-up to the credit crunch involved a few maverick economists and some far-sighted financial journalists. The peak-oil whistleblowing is different. Many within the incumbency itself are sounding alarms. Every year, when the Association for the Study of Peak Oil (ASPO) meets, recently retired oilmen queue to give their latest assessments of how their industry is getting its asset assessment wrong. The latest ASPO event was held a few weeks ago in Vienna, which I attended. There has been \"a boom in oil production\" of late, Monbiot says. Wrong. Global production has been essentially struggling along a plateau since 2004, as Bob Hirsch, an ex-Exxon advisor to the US Department of Energy describes. Hirsch expects the descent to begin in one to four years. Monbiot is correct that there has been a small increase in oil production in the United States in recent years. But can that continue, as he infers? Gas-industry whistleblower Art Berman describes how the shale gas gold-rush of recent years, now extending into shale oil, may well be a giant ponzi scheme: decline rates in wells are unexpectedly fast, meaning more and more have to be drilled at ever more expense, meaning ever more money has to be borrowed against cash flows from production that fall ever further behind. He looks at the resulting disaster in the balance sheets of oil and gas companies, and expects the bankruptcies to start any time soon. John Dizard has also warned of this particular bubble, in the Financial Times. Even if oil production in America could somehow grow all the long way back to self sufficiency, what of the global picture, when conventional oil peaked back in 2006, as the International Energy Agency (IEA) has shown? The six Saudi Arabias of new production that would be needed to lift production to 100m barrels a day by 2030, according to the IEA, are a laughable prospect to the whistleblowers of ASPO, as many presentations in Vienna showed. The IEA clearly does not believe it is feasible. Neither do many still active in the incumbency, not least Total's head of exploration, who recently warned that peak is just around the corner. Society ignores such warnings, and listens to potential bubble-backers like Monbiot, at its peril. Like his conversion to nuclear power during the Fukushima disaster, Monbiot has chosen an interesting time for a change of mind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
