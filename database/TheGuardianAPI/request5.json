You can see all our Ukraine news here. More than 6m households in Ukraine are still affected by power cuts, two days after targeted Russian strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Russian shelling on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson killed 15 civilians on Friday, officials said, as engineers across the country sought to restore heat, water and power to major cities. Thirty-five people had been injured, including a child, and several “private houses and high-rise buildings” damaged, city official Galyna Lugova said. The shelling of Kherson, a key eastern city recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces, was the deadliest Russian bombardment in recent days. Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, said 32 civilians had been killed in Kherson since 9 November, when Russian forces were forced to withdraw from the city that they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent reports.Since then, Russian troops have shelled Kherson frequently Ukraine accused the Kremlin of reviving the “genocidal” tactics of Josef Stalin as Kyiv commemorated a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. The prime ministers of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine – Ingrida Šimonytė, Mateusz Morawiecki and Denys Shmyhal, respectively – met in Kyiv on Saturday for talks to discuss and reiterate their commitment to work together “in countering Russia’s armed aggression”. Belarus’s foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, has died. Belarus has been an ally of Russia and a base for the invasion over the border in February. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram channel: “We are shocked by the reports of the death of the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Belarus Vladimir Makei.” Ukraine accused the Kremlin of reviving the “genocidal” tactics of Josef Stalin as Kyiv commemorated a Soviet-era famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33. The remembrance day for the “Holodomor” comes as Ukraine is battling to repel invading Russian forces and deal with sweeping blackouts caused by air strikes that Kyiv says are aimed at breaking the public’s fighting resolve. “Once they wanted to destroy us with hunger, now * with darkness and cold,” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram. “We cannot be broken.” From Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the “Grain from Ukraine” initiative demonstrated that global food security was “not just empty words” for Kyiv. Zelenskiy said Kyiv had raised about $150m (£124m) from more than 20 countries and the EU to export grain to countries including Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. “We plan to send at least 60 vessels from Ukrainian ports to countries that most face the threat of famine and drought,” Zelenskiy told the gathering. The summit was attended in person by the prime ministers of Belgium, Poland and Lithuania and the president of Hungary. Germany and France’s presidents and the head of the European Commission delivered speeches shown by video, Reuters reports. The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, expressed his condolences after the sudden death of the Belarusian foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, Reuters reports. But exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, commenting on the minister’s death, called Makei a traitor to the Belarusian people. “In 2020, Makei betrayed the Belarusian people and supported tyranny. This is how the Belarusian people will remember him,” Tsikhanouskaya said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram channel: “We are shocked by the reports of the death of the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Belarus Vladimir Makei. “Official condolences will be published soon.” Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, said on Saturday that 32 civilians had been killed in Kherson since 9 November, when Russian forces were forced to withdraw from the city that they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent reports. Since then, Russian troops have shelled Kherson frequently. On 24 November alone, the Russian military carried out 17 attacks on the city, killing seven people and injuring 21, according to a report by the Kherson Oblast governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Klymenko added that seven police departments resumed their work in the liberated territories of Kherson Oblast, four of them in the city of Kherson. The police’s demining officers have checked 450 hectares of land in Kherson Oblast and removed about 3,500 explosives. “It saved hundreds or even thousands of people’s lives,” he said. The prime ministers of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine – Ingrida Šimonytė, Mateusz Morawiecki and Denys Shmyhal, respectively – met in Kyiv on Saturday for talks to discuss and reiterate their commitment to work together “in countering Russia’s armed aggression”. The member states of the Lublin Triangle released a joint statement, condemning the “systemic war crimes committed by Russia’s forces in regions of Ukraine, including deliberate, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks against the civilian population and elements of the civilian infrastructure”. The statement also condemned forced deportations of Ukrainians, continued attacks around Ukrainian nuclear sites and “the organisation by Russia of illegal so-called referendums in regions within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine”. The Lithuanian prime minister, Ingrida Šimonytė, said on Twitter that the meeting had reconfirmed “the rules-based world order”. Here is some more detail on the sudden death of the Belarusian foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, from Reuters: [Makei] had attended a conference of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – a military alliance of several post-Soviet states – in Yerevan earlier this week and was due to meet Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Monday. Before the presidential elections and mass anti-government protests in Belarus in 2020, Makei had been one of the initiators of efforts to improve Belarus’s relations with the west and had criticised Russia. However, he abruptly changed his stance after the start of the protests, claiming they were inspired by agents of the west. “We are shocked by the reports of the death of the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the Republic of Belarus Vladimir Makei,” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram channel. “Official condolences will be published soon.” Belarus’s foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, has died, according to the country’s state media. This is relevant to the war in Ukraine because of Belarus’s role as an ally of Russia, and a base for the invasion over the border in February. In September, Makei repeated part of the Kremlin’s line about the reason for the war in Ukraine, blaming Nato and the west, who “overlooked the legitimate security interests of both Russia and Belarus”. More details have emerged about the prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine that we reported earlier (see 12.47pm). In exchange for the nine Russian prisoners of war, 12 Ukrainians have returned, including three civilians who were believed to be missing. Former British prime minister Boris Johnson urged people on Saturday to consider supporting an appeal for medical equipment for Ukraine, organised by the UK’s largest group of private hospitals. Nine Russian prisoners of war have been freed in a prisoner exchange with Ukraine on Saturday, the Russian Tass news agency said, according to Reuters, citing Moscow’s defence ministry. “On November 26, as a result of the negotiation process, nine Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger in captivity were returned from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime,” the ministry said in a statement. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, hosted an international summit in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss food security and agricultural exports with the prime ministers of Belgium, Poland and Lithuania and the president of Hungary. Zelenskiy opened the summit speaking at a panel flanked by his chief of staff and prime minister. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, delivered speeches that were shown by video, Reuters reports. Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander de Croo, tweeted, after arriving in Kyiv for his first visit since Russia began its invasion: “With the cold winter months ahead, Belgium is releasing new humanitarian and military aid.” Belgium pledged a further €37m (£32m) of financial aid for Ukraine, the Belga news agency reported. At least six people were injured in a Russian attack on the regional capital Dnipro, according to the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, who said that Russia had hit a residential area, partially destroying seven houses and causing a fire on Saturday. According to Reznichenko, a woman was hospitalised in critical condition following the attack, the Kyiv Independent reports. The Dnipro mayor, Borys Filatov, reported the attack at noon, saying that infrastructure was not damaged, but some power outages may occur. Denmark’s autonomous Faroe Islands have renewed a fishing quota deal with Russia for one year despite Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, a local minister said on Saturday. Home to about 54,000 inhabitants, the Faroe Islands have been largely autonomous from Denmark since 1948. “The Faroe Islands are totally right to extend their existing fishing agreement with Russia,” the North Atlantic archipelago’s minister of fisheries, Arni Skaale, told the Jyllands-Posten daily. He added, however, that the islands, which are not part of the EU, condemned “all form of war – also the war in Ukraine” after Russian forces invaded in February. The agreement has been in place since 1977 and is renewable each year. It lays out catch quotas for cod, haddock, whiting and herring in the Barents Sea north of Russia for Faroese fishermen, and in waters off the coast of the Faroe Islands for Russian fishing boats. The autonomous territory is highly dependent on fishing for its income, and the fisheries ministry says the deal with Russia covers 5% of its GDP, AFP reports. Russia has become a key commercial partner of the Faroe Islands since they and neighbouring Iceland fell out with the EU – including Denmark – between 2010 and 2014 over mackerel and herring quotas. An EU embargo on Faroese fish harmed the economy of the territory, which then turned to other markets. “Today we only have free trade agreements with six countries – and not with the European Union,” said Skaale. “If we cut ourselves off from one of these markets, it could be problematic for the whole of the next generation.” Authorities on the archipelago have, however, said they would think about alternatives to the deal with Russia after local parliamentary polls on 8 December. Last month, neighbour and Nato member Norway and Russia also agreed on catch quotas in the Barents Sea for next year. While efforts by Ukrainian authorities to restore power are gradually progressing, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, criticised the fact that progress was slow, especially in the capital, Kyiv. “Many Kyiv citizens were without electricity for more than 20 or even 30 hours,” he said on Friday evening, and stressed that he expects quality work from the mayor’s office, in remarks widely interpreted as rare open criticism of the Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko. Zelenskiy did not mention Klitschko’s name, but made clear that he was annoyed that there were too few heat rooms for the capital’s 3 million inhabitants, referring to “many complaints, especially in Kyiv”. Klitschko had reported earlier that 400 of these facilities had been set up to provide electricity, water, first aid and internet access to citizens, who could also warm up there. “There is still work to be done in other areas, to say the least,” the president said, adding: “The residents of Kyiv need more protection.” Electricity has been restored in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after its liberation earlier this month from Russian occupation, a senior presidential aide said on Saturday, Reuters reports. “First we are supplying power to the city’s critical infrastructure and then immediately to household consumers,” Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, wrote on Telegram. The city had been without electricity, central heating and running water when Ukrainian forces reclaimed it on 11 November. Russian troops seized Kherson shortly after the invasion began in late February and it was the only regional capital they had managed to capture. Their retreat marked a significant setback for Moscow, but Ukrainian officials say Russian forces are still shelling the city from across the Dnipro River. The head of the local administration said on Friday that 15 people had been killed and 35 wounded in the past six days. A “Grain from Ukraine” programme to subsidise exports of grain to poor and hungry countries has launched on the anniversary of Stalin’s man-made Holodomor famine. Up to 60 Ukrainian grain ships can be sent by the middle of next year to some of the world’s poorest countries in Africa, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said in a statement released to the Guardian, my colleague Patrick Wintour reports. The Ukrainian ministry of defence tweeted: My colleague Charlotte Higgins has written a feature on how Ukrainian artists have been weaponising their work to mount a cultural resistance, in defiance of Putin’s plan to eradicate Ukraine’s sense of identity and history. The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration said on Saturday that Russia would answer for a Soviet-era famine that left millions of Ukrainians dead during the winter of 1932-33. “The Russians will pay for all of the victims of the Holodomor and answer for today’s crimes,” Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram, using the Ukrainian name for the tragedy, which translates as “death by starvation”. German parliamentarians are planning to pass a resolution declaring the starvation of millions of Ukrainians under Joseph Stalin a genocide, a move the German Bundestag hopes will serve as a “warning” to Moscow as Ukraine faces a potential hunger crisis this winter. Kyiv regards the historical event as part of a deliberate campaign by Stalin’s regime to collectivise agriculture and root out Ukraine’s fledging nationalist movement, my colleague Philip Oltermann writes. Here is a Guardian interactive showing the extent of electricity blackouts in Ukraine caused by a devastating series of Russian missile strikes on civilian infrastructure on 23 November. Finland’s economy minister Mika Lintila told the Finnish Yle news channel that Finland may send the first batch of energy equipment to Ukraine next week. After Russia’s mass missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure earlier this week, Lintila said he had started conversations with Finnish businesses in the energy sector “to coordinate efforts to assist Ukrainians.” Lintila tweeted on Friday: Finnish companies send energy equipment aid to Ukraine. I asked the companies for equipment donations yesterday and today the companies have comprehensively responded to the request positively. The operation will be started immediately and the Ukrainian state has been informed about it. According to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast governor Valentyn Reznichenko, Russian troops fired almost 60 shells at Nikopol and surrounding villages in the south of the country overnight on 26 November. No casualties have been reported, Reznichenko said, the Kyiv Independent reports. Germany and France have pledged to provide each other mutual support in preventing a possible energy crisis after supplies from Russia dried up amid the war in Ukraine. As part of a joint agreement signed by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, Germany will provide France with electricity while getting much-needed natural gas in return, Associated Press reported. “Friends help each other in need,” Scholz said after the signing ceremony in Berlin. Borne echoed that sentiment, saying the friendship between the countries was crucial. It has already proved it can withstand tests and master many challenges. Germany was heavily reliant on Russian gas supplies before Moscow’s forces invaded Ukraine in February. Since then, Germany has scrambled to find other sources, including by ramping up imports of liquefied natural gas. France, meanwhile, is struggling to meet its electricity needs due to repairs at several of the country’s nuclear power plants. Volodymyr Zelenskiy went to the town of Vyshhorod, just north of Kyiv, on Friday to look at a four-storey building damaged by a Russian missile. The Ukrainian president also visited one of the many emergency centres that have been set up to provide heat, water, electricity and mobile communications, Reuters reported. Zelenskiy said in an earlier video statement: Together we will be able to go through this difficult path for our country. We will overcome all challenges and we will definitely win. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people were still in the dark on Friday after the most devastating Russian air strikes of the war. Reuters reported President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians to use energy sparingly. If there is electricity, this doesn’t mean you can turn on several powerful electrical appliances at once. Zelenskiy also said in his nightly video address that the 6 million people still without power was half as many as in the immediate aftermath of the Russian assault on Wednesday. The attacks caused the worst damage so far in the conflict, leaving millions of people with no light, water or heat even as temperatures fell below zero. The national power grid operator, Ukrenergo, said several hours earlier that 30% of electricity supplies were still out, and asked people to cut back on their energy use. It said in a statement on Telegram: Repairs crews are working around the clock. Russia’s stock of long-range missiles is so depleted that it is likely removing nuclear warheads from ageing nuclear cruise missiles and firing the unarmed rockets at Ukraine, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence update says imagery has shown the wreckage of an AS-15 Kent cruise missile – apparently shot down – that was designed in the 1980s “exclusively as a nuclear delivery system”. The ministry tweeted: The warhead had probably been substituted for ballast. Although such an inert system will still produce some damage through the missile’s kinetic energy and any unspent fuel, it is unlikely to achieve reliable effects against intended targets. Russia almost certainly hopes such missiles will function as decoys and divert Ukrainian air defences. Whatever Russia’s intent, this improvisation highlights the level of depletion in Russia’s stock of long-range missiles. Welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s an overview of the latest developments as it passes 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. More than 6m households in Ukraine are still affected by power cuts, two days after targeted Russian strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “As of this evening, blackouts continue in most regions [of Ukraine] and in Kyiv. In total, more than 6 million subscribers,” Zelensky said in his nightly address on Friday. The number of affected households had reduced “by half” since Wednesday. He said about 600,000 people were experiencing power cuts in Kyiv, the capital, with the Odessa, Lviv, Vinnytsia and Dnipropetrovsk regions also among the worst affected as temperatures approach freezing. Russian shelling on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson killed 15 civilians on Friday, officials said, as engineers across the country sought to restore heat, water and power to major cities. Thirty-five people had been injured, including a child, and several “private houses and high-rise buildings” damaged, city official Galyna Lugova said. The shelling of Kherson, a key eastern city recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces, was the deadliest Russian bombardment in recent days. Yarovslav Yanushovich, head of the Kherson military administration, said Russian forces “opened fire on a residential area with multiple rocket launchers”. The European Union will step up efforts to provide Ukraine with support to restore and maintain power and heating, the head of the European Commission said on Friday. Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement after a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the EU executive arm was preparing the delivery to Ukraine large donations from EU countries and from the EC’s reserves. Hungary’s President Katalin Novak is travelling to Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy, her Ukrainian counterpart, the website index.hu reported on Friday, adding that Novak would go by train via Poland. The Hungarian president’s office said it would neither deny nor confirm the information. Novak, a close ally of the nationalist prime minister Viktor Orban, would be the highest-ranking Hungarian politician to visit Zelenskiy since Russia’s invasion in February. Ukraine’s leaders would have to be “far-sighted” to secure peace, Pope Francis said, suggesting Kyiv would have to make concessions to end the war with Russia. In an open letter released on Friday to mark the war’s nine-month anniversary, the pontiff praised the strength of Ukrainians in the face of the onslaught. “The world has recognised a bold and strong people, a people that suffers and prays, cries and struggles, resists and hopes: a noble and martyred people.” Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants have been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. The facilities were all disconnected from the grid on Wednesday for the first time in Ukrainian history after the latest wave of Russian air strikes on vital infrastructure. In a statement on Friday, the nuclear watchdog said Ukraine had informed it on Friday that its Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyy plants had been reconnected. Ukraine reconnected its vast Zaporizhzhia plant on Thursday, Kyiv said earlier. Armenia has asked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to chair peace talks with Azerbaijan in a fresh challenge to Vladimir Putin’s increasingly loose grip on Russia’s regional allies in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The snub from a traditional ally to Putin comes immediately on the back of his disastrous summit with six former Soviet states. EU diplomats were meeting on Friday night in an effort to reach a deal on a price level at which to cap Russian oil exports, according to a report by Bloomberg. European governments have failed so far to find an agreement ahead of a 5 December deadline. A G7 proposal for a cap of $65-$70 a barrel is seen as far too high by some, and too low by others. Angela Merkel has insisted that her position as a lame duck in the last months of her time in office made it more or less impossible for her to influence the behaviour of Vladimir Putin. The former German chancellor appeared defensive and quietly defiant about her inability to change the course of the Russian president’s decision-making in the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine, telling German news magazine Spiegel she felt acutely aware that her ability to negotiate with Putin was minimal because it was known she would not stand for a fifth term. The head of the Russian mercenary outfit Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed a former US Marine general is working for the group. In response to a request for comment from Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Prigozhin said on Friday: “There are not very many Finnish citizens in the Wagner PMC, about 20 people … They are fighting in a British battalion [as part of Wagner PMC] which is commanded by a US citizen, a former general of the Marine Corps,” Prigozhin said, as quoted by the press service of his company Concord.

The military’s southern operational command said it had undertaken “aimed strikes with the use of various forces” and the military operation was continuing. The military situation for Ukraine’s defenders in the eastern Donbas is “extremely difficult”, officials have said. There are 568 civilians thought to be holed up in Sievierodonetsk’s Azot chemical plant, as Russian attacks intensify in an effort to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said Lysychansk was getting shelled “en masse”. Russian forces have captured several settlements near Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. The head of the Sievierodonetsk district military administration, Roman Vlasenko, said the frontline village of Toshkivka had not been under Ukrainian control since Monday. Russian forces also reportedly captured Pidlisne and Mala Dolyna, located south-west of Sievierodonetsk, and saw success near the Hirske settlement in Luhansk. A Russian missile strike has left at least one person dead in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv, according to its mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. The attack caused several fires and damaged a number of buildings including a school, Senkevych said on national television. Casualties to the forces of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic (DPR), one of Russias proxies in eastern Ukraine, may have amounted to about 55% of the original strength, British intelligence has claimed. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said its staff has seen evidence of a “shocking level” of “indiscriminate violence” being inflicted on civilians in Ukraine. The medical charity, which set up a hospital train in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, said it had seen an “outrageous” lack of effort to spare and protect civilians caught up in hostilities. One of the leaders of the authorities imposed in occupied Ukraine has described the border between Russia and Ukraine as “worse than the Berlin Wall for the Germans”. “Our reunification with Russia is inevitable, there should be no borders between us” Vladimir Rogov is quoted as saying. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is set to mark the day when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June, 1941. The date is significant in Russia and remembered as the ‘Day of Remembrance and Sorrow’. Putin will reportedly lay flowers to honour the dead. Moscow’s response to Lithuania’s ban on the transit of goods sanctioned by the EU to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad will not be exclusively diplomatic but practical in nature, foreign ministry press secretary Maria Zakharova has said. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has warned the west to stop talking about triggering Nato’s “article 5” mutual defence clause in the standoff between Lithuania and Russia. Finland’s armed forces chief, Gen Timo Kivinen, said his country was prepared for a Russian attack and would put up stiff resistance in the event that one should occur. Europe needs to prepare immediately for Russia to turn off all gas exports to the region this winter, according to the head of the International Energy Agency, who has called on governments to work on reducing demand and keeping nuclear power plants open. A Ukrainian photojournalist and a soldier who was accompanying him were “coldly executed” when they were killed in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion, according to a recently published investigation from Reporters Without Borders. The pair were reportedly searching Russian-occupied woodlands for the photographer’s missing image-taking drone, the agency said citing its findings from an investigation into their deaths. Granting Ukraine candidate status to join the EU would be a historic decision signalling to Russia it can no longer claim a sphere of influence over its eastern neighbour, Kyiv’s ambassador to Brussels has said. Vsevolod Chentsov, the head of Ukraine’s mission to the EU, said Russia’s war had united Kyiv with the bloc, while ending what he called a “mistake” about whether his country could belong to the union. Members of the Russian delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) have been denied British visas to attend the next session, according to Vladimir Dzhabarov, the first deputy head of Russian upper house’s international affairs committee. A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There are currently no restrictions or limitations for Russian nationals to work in the UK on long-term work visas.” The spokesperson said the UK was prioritising applications from Ukrainians, and that applications for study, work and family visas were taking longer to process. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, visited Ukraine on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s war crimes, a justice department official said. Garland met with Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, and announced a war crimes accountability team to identify and prosecute perpetrators. “There is no hiding place for war criminals,” Garland said. The Kremlin said Monday that two captured US volunteers are not covered by the Geneva conventions and could face the death penalty. Russian media claimed that two of three US volunteers missing in Ukraine had been captured and were being held by pro-Russian separatist forces. The Kremlin has denied it knows their locations. German self-propelled howitzers have arrived in Ukraine in the first delivery of heavy weapons promised by Berlin. “We have replenishment!” Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, announced. “The German Panzerhaubitze 2000 with trained Ukrainian crews joined the Ukrainian artillery family.” Turkey should be cautious about delivering more weapons to Ukraine, the head of Turkey’s weapons production agency said. The remarks by Ismail Demir to the Wall Street Journal show how Ankara is increasingly playing both sides of the war. Turkish-made drones have played a critical role in Kyiv’s defence. Turkey’s military delegation will travel to Russia this week to discuss a possible safe sea corridor in the Black Sea to export Ukrainian grain, according to Turkish presidency sources. A meeting between Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and the United Nations would be held in Istanbul in the coming weeks, possibly with the participation of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, the sources said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/02/french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-forced-to-defend-putin-links","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-02T11:25:46Z","webTitle":"French far-right leader Marine Le Pen forced to defend Putin links","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-forced-to-defend-putin-links","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/02/french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-forced-to-defend-putin-links","fields":{"headline":"French far-right leader Marine Le Pen forced to defend Putin links","bodyText":"The French far-right leader and presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has been forced to defend her links to Vladimir Putin after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Le Pen, who polls suggest will face Emmanuel Macron in the second round of the vote in April, has faced criticism after a campaign leaflet featuring a photograph of her with the Russian leader was released. Her Rassemblement National (RN) party, denied it had ordered local party offices to destroy the document after 1.2m copies were printed and distributed last month. A section of the eight-page campaign pamphlet highlights Le Pen’s international status, featuring photographs of her with world leaders, including Putin. It is still available on Le Pen’s campaign website. Le Pen travelled to Moscow where she met the Russian president in the run-up to the 2017 presidential election. In October 2014, the far-right party, then called the Front National, borrowed €9m from a Russian bank to finance its election campaigns. Le Pen has criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the pamphlet does not appear to have damaged her popularity. One recent opinion poll, by Ifop-Fiducial for Paris Match, suggests she has gained one percentage point, taking her to 17%, her highest score for a fortnight. That is well behind Macron on 28% but ahead of her rightwing rivals, Eric Zemmour and the mainstream opposition Les Républicains candidate, Valérie Pécresse, on 13% Libération reported that local party officers had been ordered to destroy the pamphlet, but the RN has denied giving any such order. “The document is still being distributed by our activists,” David Rachline, the RN vice-president, said. A party official said the RN would not be back-pedalling. “We are not going to deny our position on international politics. In 2017, we had to work with Russia to combat Islamic state … no major issue can have a lasting solution without the cooperation of at least the security council,” the official told BFMTV. He added the party had been asked whether local campaigners should destroy the pamphlet after Russia’s attack on Ukraine, but had told them “non”. However, Le Pen told French media the war had “partly changed” her view of the Russian president. “Yes, it’s an authoritarian regime, historically and in culture. Even if we are judging (it) by our western norms, which are not Russian norms,” she told BFMTV. She added the invasion of Ukraine was “a clear violation straight of international law and absolutely indefensible”. “We can try to explain what can explain it, but we cannot in any way excuse this behaviour,” Le Pen said, adding that it was for Europe, not the US, to manage the situation. “Russia is a great power, a great nuclear power, and it’s on our continent so it’s for us to find solutions to live with it,” she said. Of meeting the Russian president in 2017, she replied: “The Vladimir Putin of five years ago is not exactly that of today,” adding that he had “crossed a red line” in attacking Ukraine. Zemmour, who has condemned the Russian invasion but said “if Putin is guilty, the west is responsible”, and also that France should not welcome Ukrainians fleeing the conflict but that they should stay in Poland, lost 2.5 percentage points in two days, according to the Ifop-Fiducial poll. Jean-Yves Camus, a political analyst and far-right specialist, told Ouest France that sympathy with Russia was more damaging for Zemmour because Le Pen’s view of Putin was already well known to her supporters. “Le Pen can argue that she was obliged to take a €9m loan with a Russian bank because no French bank would lend her the money,” Camus said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/30/first-thing-oath-keepers-founder-guilty-of-seditious-conspiracy","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T11:43:13Z","webTitle":"First Thing: Oath Keepers founder guilty of seditious conspiracy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/30/first-thing-oath-keepers-founder-guilty-of-seditious-conspiracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/30/first-thing-oath-keepers-founder-guilty-of-seditious-conspiracy","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Oath Keepers founder guilty of seditious conspiracy","bodyText":"Good morning. Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the rightwing Oath Keepers militia, has been found guilty of seditious conspiracy, a charge arising from the attack on the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump. Rhodes and his co-defendant Kelly Meggs are the first people in nearly three decades to be found guilty of the rarely used civil war-era charge at trial. The trial was the biggest test yet for the Department of Justice in its efforts to hold accountable those responsible for the attack that shook the foundations of US democracy. Rhodes is a Yale Law-educated former paratrooper and disbarred attorney. In an eight-week trial, he and four associates were accused of fomenting a plot to use force to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. How significant is the case? Harry Litman, a former US attorney turned legal analyst, said the guilty verdicts represented “a huge, huge victory for the [justice department] in a challenging and deeply important, even historic, case”. US Senate passes bill protecting same-sex marriage The Senate has passed the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation to protect same-sex unions that Democrats are hurrying to get to Joe Biden to be signed into law before Republicans take over the House next year. Nearly 50 House Republicans supported the measure earlier this year. In the Senate, support from 12 Republicans was enough to override the filibuster and advance the bill to yesterday’s majority vote, which ended 61-36. Although the Respect for Marriage Act would not codify Obergefell v Hodges, the 2015 supreme court decision that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, it would require states to recognise all marriages that were legal when performed, including in other states. Same-sex marriage has been thought to be under threat since June, when the conservative-dominated supreme court struck down the right to abortion. Then, the hardline justice Clarence Thomas wrote that other privacy-based rights, including same-sex marriage, could be reconsidered next. Public support for same-sex marriage is at an all-time high of about 70%. But according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, if the supreme court did overturn the right, at least 29 states would be able to enforce bans. US rail unions decry Biden’s proposal to impose settlement through Congress Railroad workers have expressed dismay at Joe Biden’s proposed solution to a looming strike that threatens to derail the US economy, which they say belies his image as the most pro-union president in generations. As a 9 December deadline looms in the long-running labor dispute between the US’s largest railway companies and their unions, Biden has called on Congress to intervene and block a strike that could cost the economy about $2bn a day by some estimates. Today, Congress is expected to pass legislation that will force a settlement. But union leaders are unhappy that Biden’s solution appears to be the imposition of a settlement reached in September that has already been rejected by many for failing to address members’ concerns about pay, sick days, staff shortages and time off. “Joe Biden blew it,” said Hugh Sawyer, the treasurer of Railroad Workers United, a group representing workers from a variety of rail unions and carriers. “Sadly, he could not bring himself to advocate for a lousy handful of sick days. The Democrats and Republicans are both pawns of big business and the corporations.” Why are workers threatening industrial action? A lack of paid sick time and the rail companies’ disciplinary attendance systems, in which they are penalized for taking unpaid time off – an issue workers say has contributed to a lack of a work-life balance on the job. Covid restrictions lifted in Chinese city of Guangzhou after protests Authorities have abruptly lifted Covid restrictions in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, where protesters scuffled with police on Tuesday night, as police searched for demonstrators in other cities and the country’s top security body called for a crackdown on “hostile forces”. After days of extraordinary protests in the country that have prompted international demonstrations in solidarity, the US and Canada urged China not to harm or intimidate protesters opposing Covid-19 lockdowns. On Wednesday, authorities suddenly announced a lifting of lockdowns in about half of the districts across the southern city of Guangzhou. Official announcements told local officials to variously remove “temporary control orders” and to redesignate areas as low risk. They also announced an end to mass PCR testing. In lockdown or getting ready for lockdown: Beijing life under zero-Covid. A resident tells of days filled with health codes, constant threat of shutdowns and moments of hope.

World Cup: ‘up to 500’ migrant workers died on stadium building projects, says official USA’s adventure at the World Cup continues after they clinched a tense 1-0 victory over Iran to progress to the knockout stages, where they will face the Netherlands on Saturday. Not much was expected of this young American team, but they have impressed neutrals with their pace and technique, even if they struggle with the fairly important skill of scoring. The winning goal was scored by Christian Pulisic, who sustained an abdominal injury as he steered the ball home (some have speculated that “abdominal” may be a euphemism for an injury to a rather more delicate area). In Group B’s other game, England beat Wales to seal their place as group winners. They will play Senegal in the next round. Iran’s defeat ended a gruelling few weeks for the team’s players. As well as the small matter of playing three matches against elite-level competition, they had to deal with the political turmoil back home. They may have even involved themselves in that turmoil when they didn’t sing the national anthem in their opening match against England, which many interpreted as a gesture of defiance towards the country’s regime. On Tuesday, Iran supporters at the stadium smuggled in personal protests, the words “women life freedom” printed on T-shirts hidden under T-shirts and scrawled in marker pen on their bodies. Elsewhere at the World Cup: France are already through from Group D and will be joined by one of Australia, Denmark or Tunisia, whose matches kick off at 10am ET on Wednesday. At 2pm ET, Group C’s final matches kick off with Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland all in with a chance of progressing. You can read about the various permutations here. A Qatari official has said 400-500 migrant workers died on World Cup projects. The Guardian’s estimate puts the figure at closer to 6,500. Stat of the day: ‘At least 45 Australian soldiers killed themselves after PoW training’ At least 45 Australian defence force personnel who attended training to deal with potentially being captured, interrogated and tortured subsequently killed themselves, an inquiry has been told. But the force is yet to investigate whether the training was a direct trigger for the deaths in the two decades since 2001. Col Simon Dowse, from the Defence School of Intelligence, told the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide that the force’s conduct after capture (CAC) courses were designed to help members cope if kidnapped or taken hostage. To his knowledge, Dowse said, no ADF members had been captured. Don’t miss this: how Robert Downey Jr made peace with his maverick father In the twilight of his father’s years, Downey Jr wanted some answers about why his father didn’t take better care of him, writes Andrew Pulver. The resulting documentary – called Sr, with remorseless family logic – acts as part tribute, part therapy session and part last hurrah. “You did not give a mad fuck, did you?” Downey Jr tells his father. The elephant in the room of Sr is Downey Jr’s turbulent period as a cocaine- and heroin-dependent young movie star (before he miraculously cleaned up his act to become at one point the world’s highest-paid actor), and the extent to which Downey Sr may or may not be responsible for his son’s addictions. In fact, it’s the elephant in the room until it isn’t. Climate check: Science is making it possible to ‘hear’ nature. It does more talking than we knew Scientists have recently made some remarkable discoveries about non-human sounds, writes Karen Bakker. “With the aid of digital bioacoustics – tiny, portable digital recorders similar to those found in your smartphone – researchers are documenting the universal importance of sound to life on Earth. “As scientists eavesdrop on nature, they are learning some astonishing things. Many species that we once thought to be mute actually make noise – lots of it, in some cases. For example, research by Camila Ferrara at Brazil’s Wildlife Conservation Society has demonstrated that Amazonian sea turtles make more than 200 distinct sounds.” Last Thing: Japan weighs up plan to expand nuclear power In a sweeping change to Japan’s energy policy, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has announced plans to build next-generation reactors and restart those left idle after the 2011 triple meltdown, in an attempt to end Japan’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and help meet its net zero target by 2050, writes Justin McCurry. Kishida’s “green transformation”, which could include extending the lifespan of existing reactors beyond the current maximum of 60 years, underlines Japan’s struggle to secure an affordable energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine and a power crunch that led to warnings of potential blackouts in Tokyo during this summer’s heatwave.

Blasts were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Meanwhile, about 90 miles (150km) north-east of Kyiv in Chernihiv, a missile reportedly hit a residential building in the centre of the city, causing a fire to break out, the agency added. High-level talks between Ukraine and Russia that took place on the border with Belarus on Monday morning ended without a breakthrough. Both sides agreed to keep the negotiations going and a second round of talks could take place in the coming days. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke with Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, in a phone call on Monday, where he reiterated demands to halt Russia’s offensive in Ukraine and urged Putin to stop all strikes on civilians, preserve the civilian infrastructure and provide safe access to key roads. British intelligence appears to corroborate a recent report from Ukraine’s military that Russia had “slowed down” its offensive. Britain’s defence ministry has said Russia’s advance on Kyiv has been slowed by logistical failures and fierce Ukrainian resistance. The Russian central bank increased interest rates to 20% from 9.5% after the rouble plunged up to 40% on Monday following western sanctions. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had signed an official request for Ukraine to join the European Union. A senior EU official said leaders may discuss the possibility of Ukrainian leadership at an informal summit in March but added that no process had been started yet. The EU is preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years, EU officials said. Ukrainian ports will remain closed until Russia’s invasion ends, the head of Ukraine’s maritime administration said, adding that the port of Mariupol had sustained damage from Russian forces on Monday morning. Amnesty International has condemned Russia’s reported use of cluster munitions in Ukraine, saying an attack on a preschool “may constitute a war crime”. Russian invasion forces seized two small cities in southeastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday, but ran into stiff resistance elsewhere as Moscow’s diplomatic and economic isolation deepened. Ukraine’s western allies increased weapons transfers in support. Finland agreed to ship 2,500 assault rifles and 1,500 anti-tank weapons. The UK government announced a slew of measures “to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the Russian central bank, the Russian national wealth fund and the country’s ministry of finance”. The US blocked Americans from engaging in any transactions involving Russia’s central bank, National Wealth Fund and finance ministry in further punishment of Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. The US stepped up the flow of weapons to Ukraine, announcing on Sunday it would send Stinger missiles as part of a package approved by the White House. Fifa and Uefa have suspended Russia’s national and club teams from all international competitions until further notice, the two football bodies said in a joint statement. The International Olympic Committee’s executive board also recommended that international sports federations ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from competing in events. About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status in a referendum that raises the stakes at a time when the country has become a staging ground for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government said on Monday. Forty Ukrainian civil society groups have come together to call on the west to establish safe zones for refugees inside Ukraine, and to provide technology to help document Russian war crimes as part of a plan to make Putin and his inner circle face justice at the international criminal court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/20/germany-gas-deal-qatar-end-energy-dependency-on-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-20T17:39:56Z","webTitle":"Germany agrees gas deal with Qatar to help end dependency on Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/germany-gas-deal-qatar-end-energy-dependency-on-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/20/germany-gas-deal-qatar-end-energy-dependency-on-russia","fields":{"headline":"Germany agrees gas deal with Qatar to help end dependency on Russia","bodyText":"Germany has agreed a contract with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that will help the European country wean itself off its dependency on Russian energy. But the contract is a long-term solution and will do little to slow the current flow of European money into Russian coffers, estimated to be worth $285m (£217m) a day for oil alone. Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, announced the deal after discussions in Doha, where he was accompanied by German business leaders. “It is great that I can say it was firmly agreed to enter into a long-term energy partnership – a cooperation,” Habeck said. “The companies that are now involved in this journey will enter into contract negotiations with the Qatari side.” He gave no detailed figures on planned imports from Qatar. Habeck, a Green party leader in the German coalition government, has faced sharp criticism in recent weeks for refusing to accept a complete energy embargo on Russia, as sought by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a speech to the Bundestag last week, Zelenskiy accused Germany of having only three priorities: “economy, economy, economy”. Polling shows a majority of Germans would be prepared to make sacrifices, including higher gas prices, if it helped defeat Russia, but the German government either does not believe the polling or thinks the public do not understand the real risk of mass unemployment that an embargo would entail. Habeck’s visit to Qatar follows Boris Johnson’s apparently fruitless trip to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in an attempt to persuade two traditional British allies in the Gulf to boost oil production. Qatar is expected to almost double its production of LNG by 2025. Habeck promised that Europe was in the process of reducing its flow of energy from Russia to zero, but at present Germany has no LNG terminals. Two have just been given the go-ahead, at Brunsbüttel and Wilhelmshaven, but may take three years to build. Germany imported about 56bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia in 2020. Nearly 55% of its gas imports came from Russia, with 40% of the demand for gas in Germany coming from industry. The EU’s total gas imports from Russia are about 168bn cubic metres. In 2020, Qatar exported 106bn cubic metres, selling the bulk of the product to Asian markets. In Doha, Habeck stressed the future for Europe was to develop a diversity of suppliers, and there would be little point in Germany transferring its dependency from one supplier to another. Germany is also in talks with Norway, Canada and the US. He admitted previous German administrations had made a mistake by becoming so dependent on Russia. Moscow also provides 34% of German oil, predominantly along the Druzhba pipeline. As a result Germany has insisted the EU does not sanction two banks that service German purchases of Russian energy. The former head of the Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz, Andriy Kobolyev, believes Germany could take a tougher line by continuing to take Russian energy but refusing to pay for the gas until Russia pulled out of Ukraine. He said Russia cannot simply turn off the gas supplies, and there would be enough to get Germany through the next winter. Habeck has ruled out reversing the planned switch-off of nuclear power in Germany, scheduled for the end of 2022. But he is said to be open to extending the life of coal powered stations, all due to close by 2030. Disputes inside Germany rage over whether it would be possible to cut off Russian energy. Bruegel, a Brussels-based thinktank, has suggested the EU could survive next winter if all Russian pipeline imports were halted, though it would require painful measures including power rationing. The EU itself has said it aims to reduce the bloc’s gas imports from Russia by nearly two-thirds by the end of 2022, and to make Europe independent from all Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, hinted France was willing to go further, saying: “Should we immediately stop buying Russian oil, should, a little bit further down the line, we stop importing Russian gas? The president has never ruled out these options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/oct/21/australia-to-receive-uk-nuclear-waste-shipment-amid-bitter-dispute-over-national-storage-facility","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-20T16:30:04Z","webTitle":"Australia to receive UK nuclear waste shipment amid bitter dispute over national storage facility","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/21/australia-to-receive-uk-nuclear-waste-shipment-amid-bitter-dispute-over-national-storage-facility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/oct/21/australia-to-receive-uk-nuclear-waste-shipment-amid-bitter-dispute-over-national-storage-facility","fields":{"headline":"Australia to receive UK nuclear waste shipment amid bitter dispute over national storage facility","bodyText":"Two tonnes of nuclear waste will be shipped from the United Kingdom to Australia next year as debate continues over a national storage facility. The shipment of four 500kg canisters inside a forged steel container called a TN-81 is part of a waste swap deal with the UK. The intermediate-level waste is to be stored temporarily at Sydney’s Lucas Heights facility then sent to the national radioactive waste management facility the federal government plans to build near Kimba in South Australia. However that project is the subject of a bitter dispute, and is years away. It will take several years for all the regulatory approvals to pass, and the government has declined to nominate when it will start construction. In 1996 Australia sent spent fuel rods from its Hifar reactor – the predecessor to the existing Opal multi-purpose reactor – to the UK to be recycled into fuel for nuclear power plants. The “radiologically equivalent” waste will be sent to Australia under the 2022 waste repatriation project. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa) reported this week that it is working with the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation “for the inspection of radioactive waste containers, set to return to Australia from the Sellafield Reprocessing Plant”. “The waste relates to the processing of spent fuel sent to the UK in earlier years from Australia’s former research reactor,” Arpansa said. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) says it successfully repatriated radioactive waste from France to Australia in 2015 and that the TN-81s had been used successfully in 180 nuclear shipments around the world. The federal government says Lucas Heights does not have the room or the approvals to store the nation’s nuclear waste, which is spread across more than 100 sites, so it will commission a purpose-built dump. It settled on a site at Napandee, near Kimba in South Australia. That plan has been deeply divisive. A ballot run by the Australian Electoral Commission found more than 60% of people in the Kimba council area supported the facility, which would store mostly medical waste that is currently in separate sites all over the country. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the traditional owners, the Barngarla people, say many were excluded from that ballot because they lived outside the council area. In a separate ballot, Barngarla voters unanimously rejected the proposal. Chair of The Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation, Jason Bilney, later welcomed amendments to the legislation that leave open the possibility of a judicial review. Federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, has announced his intention to declare that Napandee will host the site. Before that declaration is made, however, there has been a consultation process for anyone who has a legal right or interest in the proposal. Submissions to that consultation will close on Friday. Pitt will consider any comments, and if he goes ahead and declares Napandee as the site, the federal government plans to acquire the land and begin preparations to build the facility – barring legal challenges. Conservation Council of SA chief executive officer, Craig Wilkins, said the UK shipment highlighted the overall issues with creating a national facility. The facility will mostly store low-level waste but will temporarily store intermediate-level waste such as that coming from the UK. Wilkins says Lucas Heights should store all waste until a permanent facility can be built. “If this is genuinely our waste and we have a responsibility to look after it, then we need to do that properly,” he said. “We need a genuine, long-term national approach to dealing with our waste, rather than this ad hoc temporary fix of shifting some of the waste across to SA to temporarily park it in above-ground sheds while they work out what to do with the waste long term. It makes sense to get the long-term solution first.” International best practice is to bury the waste in a deep disposal site in the safest place in the country, he said. “That work hasn’t been done yet, and until it’s done the waste should stay … at Lucas Heights.” The government says waste from more than 100 sites needs to be consolidated in a purpose-built facility and that neither Lucas Heights nor the CSIRO storage site at Woomera were intended for permanent storage. The industry department argues Lucas Heights “is not large enough” because any free space is needed for an expansion of research activities, and that it is only licensed for temporary storage. Debate over nuclear storage continues, as does debate over Australia’s planned acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, and debate over whether Australia needs nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/20/west-hits-vladimir-putins-fake-news-factories-with-wave-of-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-20T10:45:53Z","webTitle":"West hits Vladimir Putin’s fake news factories with wave of sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/west-hits-vladimir-putins-fake-news-factories-with-wave-of-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/20/west-hits-vladimir-putins-fake-news-factories-with-wave-of-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"West hits Vladimir Putin’s fake news factories with wave of sanctions","bodyText":"Twelve key disinformation outlets used to bolster Vladimir Putin have been hit with sanctions in an online crackdown on “false and misleading” reports claimed to be orchestrated by Russian intelligence. The Foreign Office announced last week that sanctions would be imposed on the Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian-based troll factory. Two other alleged disinformation websites, New Eastern Outlook and Oriental Review, were also targeted. The Internet Research Agency has been exposed in the past for paying Russia-based bloggers £500 a month to flood the internet with pro-Putin comments on chat forums, social networks and the comment sections of western publications. Government investigators also claim Russian intelligence supports international news and analysis websites which promote the Kremlin’s view of the Ukraine invasion. Tom Southern, of the Centre for Information Resilience, a non-profit UK social enterprise which counters disinformation, said the impact of Russian information manipulation campaigns in the Ukraine conflict was being blunted by concerted action by governments and social media companies. “This seems to be a turning point against this fake news,” he said. The US treasury has imposed sanctions on the three outlets identified by the UK authorities. It has also taken action against at least nine others, five of which have been targeted with sanctions since the Ukraine invasion. One of the websites sanctioned by the US is the Strategic Culture Foundation, which describes itself as a “platform for extensive analysis on Eurasian and global affairs”. The website has cited Russian claims of a “covert project” to turn Ukraine into a nuclear power. One of its authors also claimed the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March 2018 was likely to be a British “false flag” operation to “incriminate, demonise and delegitimise Russia”. The US treasury describes the website as an online journal registered in Russia which is directed by the country’s foreign intelligence service. It states: “It publishes conspiracy theorists, giving them a broader platform to spread disinformation, while trying to obscure the Russian origin of the journal so that readers may be more likely to trust the sourcing.” The Twitter and Facebook accounts of the website have been suspended since September 2020. The Strategic Culture Foundation did not respond to a request for comment, but says on its website that allegations it was connected with Russian intelligence services were “unsubstantiated” and were “a glimpse into the dystopian future of suppressing dissident voices by governments previously known as democratic”. American officials have also sanctioned three other outlets claimed to be linked to the Strategic Culture Foundation: the news outlets SouthFront, NewsFront and InfoRos. All three are alleged by US officials to be connected to Russian intelligence. Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a US group that tracks online disinformation, said it did not appear the tactics previously used to interfere in the American electoral system – with thousands of accounts on numerous platforms – were being widely deployed for the Ukraine conflict. He said Russia-backed websites were being used to get false information and propaganda more widely disseminated, but were being routinely blocked on social media. “They are trying to get dirty information into the online ecosystem and hope it is picked up by websites and individuals with larger reach,” he explained. The Russian state-backed news channel RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked by media regulator Ofcom last week. Analysts said the channel’s output was the “tip of the iceberg” in the Kremlin’s propaganda campaign. The Ukraine government has faced disinformation attacks, including a faked video circulated online last week of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy advising his soldiers to lay down their arms. It was quickly dismissed by Zelenskiy as a “childish provocation”. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, last week said the government was taking action against Russian propaganda, from both the Kremlin’s press office and online disinformation outlets. She said: “We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin – from major oligarchs, to his prime minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation. We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia’s crimes in Ukraine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-un-to-investigate-pow-deaths-us-ratifies-sweden-and-finland-nato-bids","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T18:21:41Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv calls Amnesty report that says Ukrainian forces are putting civilians at risk a ‘perversion’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-un-to-investigate-pow-deaths-us-ratifies-sweden-and-finland-nato-bids","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-un-to-investigate-pow-deaths-us-ratifies-sweden-and-finland-nato-bids","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv calls Amnesty report that says Ukrainian forces are putting civilians at risk a ‘perversion’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Here is the latest from our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Eight people have been killed and four have been wounded in Russian artillery shelling in the eastern Ukrainian town of Toretsk in Donetsk oblast on Thursday, the regional governor has said. The shelling hit a public transport stop where people had gathered, the governor for the area, Pavlo Kyrylenko, wrote on Telegram. Three children were among the wounded, he said. The UN is conducting a fact-finding mission in response to requests from Russia and Ukraine after 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion at a barracks in separatist-controlled Olenivka. The warring nations have accused each other of carrying out the attack. Ukraine claims it was a special operation plotted in advance by the Kremlin, and carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. Russia’s defence ministry, however, claims the Ukrainian military used US-supplied rockets to strike the prison. A US official accused Moscow of preparing to plant fake evidence to make it look like the recent mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners in an attack on a Russian-controlled prison was caused by Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over the strikes on the prison in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine, which Russia said took place overnight on 29 July. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wants to talk directly to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in the hope China can use its influence with Russia to bring the war to an end. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, Zelenskiy said: “It’s a very powerful state. It’s a powerful economy. So [it] can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” So far, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion and Xi Jinping told Putin it would support Russia’s “sovereignty and security”. Amnesty International has said the Ukrainian army is endangering the life of civilians by basing itself in residential areas, in a report rejected by Ukrainian government representatives as placing blame on it for Russia’s invasion. The human rights group’s researchers found that Ukrainian forces were using some schools and hospitals as bases, firing near houses and sometimes living in residential flats. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, accused Amnesty of “distorting the real picture”. A Moscow court has convicted the US basketball player Brittney Griner on drug charges, sentencing her to nine years in prison and a 1m rouble fine in a politically charged verdict that could lead to a prisoner swap with the United States. Griner, a basketball talent who played in Russia during off-seasons from the Phoenix Mercury, was arrested for cannabis possession in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport in February. The US Senate has ratified Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato, voting 95-1 in support. The US is the 23rd member state to ratify what would be the most significant expansion of the 30-member alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan US commitment to Nato, and to ensuring our alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” the president, Joe Biden, said in a statement. All 30 Nato members must ratify the accession before Finland and Sweden can become members. Ukraine is pulling out its 40 peacekeepers from the Nato-led mission in Kosovo, which totals 3,800 members, according to Ukrainian news. In March, Zelenskiy issued a decree for all missions to return to Ukraine to support the war. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog has again appealed for access to a Ukrainian nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces to determine whether it was a source of danger. Contact with the Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is at Zaporizhzhia and is being operated by Ukrainian technicians under occupation, was “fragile” and communications did not function every day, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head, Rafael Grossi, told a Swiss newspaper. The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship Razoni set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the UN. The ship has been inspected by members of the joint coordination centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosphorus Strait “shortly”. Ukraine failed to stop a Syrian-flagged vessel claimed to be carrying stolen Ukrainian grain from leaving Lebanon. The Lebanese government reported on Thursday that the Syrian-flagged Laodicea had left its territorial waters, despite appeals from Kyiv to reverse a court decision allowing its departure. Russia has denied stealing the grain on the ship, which was reported to be sailing to its ally, Syria. The Kremlin said on Thursday that the Turkish-brokered deal to unblock Ukraine’s grain exports from the Black Sea was not a “one-off mechanism”, and that it hoped it would continue to work effectively. The deal, which allows for Ukrainian grain to be shipped to world markets via Turkey, must be renewed every 120 days by agreement of the parties. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain to the UK since the war began is expected to arrive in 10 days, western officials said. Millions of tonnes of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since Russia invaded just over six months ago. The UN has said that there have been more than 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February. Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across Europe. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called the behaviour of the ex German chancellor Gerhard Schröder “disgusting”. The former German leader has come under fire after he went on holiday to Moscow and had a private meeting with Vladimir Putin. Schröder told German media in a lengthy interview he had nothing to apologise for over his friendship with the Russian president. Nato members are working closely with defence companies to ensure Ukraine gets more supplies of weapons and equipment to be prepared for the long haul in its war with Russia, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday. Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview: “We are providing a lot of support but we need to do even more and be prepared for the long haul.” We’re closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for joining us. Our blog on the situation in Taiwan is still live: Russia may launch an offensive in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson to try to wrest back momentum from Kyiv and has been visibly building up forces, the Ukrainian general Oleksiy Hromov said on Thursday. Russia holds swathes of Ukraine’s south that it captured in the early phases of its 24 February invasion, but Kyiv has vowed to mount a major counter-offensive and used sophisticated western weapons to hit Russian supply lines and ammo dumps, Reuters reports. Hromov said Russia had brought in a large amount of weapons and hardware to the north-east of the strategically important southern region of Kherson, much of which is occupied by Russia. He told a news conference: It’s possible the enemy may or will try to carry out offensive operations deep into our territory in order to seize the initiative and threaten the development of our success in order to force the [Ukrainian army] to stop expanding bridgeheads and go on the defensive. In the east, he said Ukraine had improved its tactical position around the eastern city of Sloviansk, recapturing two villages, but that Russian forces had been trying to take the eastern city of Avdiivka and village of Pisky. Ukrainian forces had been forced to concede territory there, switching to defending south of the city of Avdiivka and leaving the Butivka coal mine, he said. Amnesty International has said the Ukrainian army is endangering the life of civilians by basing themselves in residential areas, in a report rejected by Ukrainian government representatives as placing blame on it for Russia’s invasion. The human rights group’s researchers found that Ukrainian forces were using some schools and hospitals as bases, firing near houses and sometimes living in residential flats. The report concluded that this meant in some instances Russian forces would respond to an attack or target residential areas – putting civilians at risk and damaging civilian infrastructure. It also criticised the Ukrainian army for not evacuating civilians who could be caught up in the crossfire. “We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, accused Amnesty of “distorting the real picture” and of failing to understand the situation on the ground. She said Ukrainian soldiers were deployed in cities and populated areas to defend them from Russian attack. “There is no chronology of events [in the report]. The Russian Federation is committing the crime here. Ukraine is protecting its land. Moscow ignores all the rules of war. And unlike Ukraine, it doesn’t let in international organisations like Amnesty,” said Maliar. Speaking at a briefing in Kyiv, Maliar stressed that the Ukrainian armed forces laid on buses to evacuate civilians from the frontline. Some refused to go, despite repeated pleas and offers of transport to safer regions. Ukraine gave access to outside agencies, including the international criminal court, and carried out its own investigations into abuses committed by its troops, she said. Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s minister of defence, said “any attempt to question the right of Ukrainians to resist genocide, to protect their families and homes … is a perversion”, and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted that “the only thing that poses a threat to Ukraine is a Russian army of executioners and rapists coming to Ukraine to commit genocide”. Amnesty researchers investigated Russian strikes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv, Donbas and Mykolaiv regions between April and July. They found 19 villages and towns from where the Ukrainian forces had either launched strikes or were basing themselves. In these three regions, Amnesty found five locations where hospitals were “de facto” used as bases, and out of 29 schools visited by Amnesty, they concluded 22 had been used as bases. Schools were closed on the first day of the invasion and pupils have been learning remotely, where possible. The report noted that most of the civilian infrastructure repurposed by the Ukrainian army was located kilometres from the frontlines and argued that alternative locations were available. Maliar argued at the briefing that Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems needed to be based in towns to protect civilian infrastructure, and if Ukrainian forces were only based outside urban settlements “Russian armed forces would simply sweep in unopposed”. Ukrainian social media users also responded with examples of when Russian forces have hit buildings being used by civilians, as well as the scores of crimes committed against Ukrainian civilians under Russian occupation. Read more from my colleagues Isobel Koshiw and Luke Harding in Kyiv here: A US official accused Moscow of preparing to plant fake evidence to make it look like the recent mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners in an attack on a Russian-controlled prison was caused by Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over the strikes on the prison in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine, which Russia said took place overnight on 29 July. On Thursday the US official, who asked not to be named, said that intelligence reports show Russia will doctor the scene at the prison ahead of the possible visits by outside investigators. The official told AFP, without sharing the evidence: We expect that Russian officials are planning to falsify evidence in order to attribute the attack on Olenivka prison on 29 July to the Ukrainian armed forces. We anticipate that Russian officials will try to frame [Ukraine’s military] … in anticipation of journalists and potential investigators visiting the site of the attack. More than 50 soldiers died in the strike, including troops who had surrendered after weeks of defending the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Nato members are working closely with defence companies to ensure Ukraine gets more supplies of weapons and equipment to be prepared for the long haul in its war with Russia, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday. Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview: We are providing a lot of support but we need to do even more and be prepared for the long haul. Therefore we’re also now in close contact and working closely with the defence industry to produce more and to deliver more of different types of ammunition, weapons and capabilities. Stoltenberg said separately in a speech in Norway to local Labour party activists on Thursday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a “special military operation”, had created the most dangerous moment for Europe since the second world war and that Russia could not be allowed to win. He also accused Vladimir Putin of engaging in “reckless and dangerous” rhetoric regarding the potential use of nuclear arms. While Nato members are not directly involved in the war, the alliance is closely involved in coordinating the western response to the invasion. Stoltenberg reiterated his position that the war would probably end only after negotiations. He told Reuters: We know most wars end at the negotiating table. We also know that the outcome of those negotiations will be totally dependent on the strength on the battlefield. It’s not for me to tell Ukraine what those terms exactly should be. It’s for me and Nato to support them to strengthen their hands, so we maximise the likelihood of an acceptable solution. The war has led previously non-aligned Finland and Sweden to seek Nato membership, with the request so far ratified by 23 of the 30 member states, including the United States. Stoltenberg said: This is the fastest accession protocol in Nato’s modern history. I expect the other seven remaining allies to do the same. He said Turkey’s demand for extraditions from Sweden and Finland of terrorism suspects would have to be decided by courts in the two Nordic nations. “The rule of law applies in Finland and Sweden,” Stoltenberg said. Finland’s foreign minister has presented a plan for limiting tourist visas issued to Russians, after increasing tourism from its eastern neighbour spurred discontent due to the war in Ukraine. As flights from Russia to the EU have been halted, Finland has become a transit country for many Russians seeking to travel further into Europe. “Many saw this as a circumvention of the sanctions regime,” the foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told AFP. Finland is seeking Nato membership after political and popular support for the alliance soared following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, but the Nordic country remains Russia’s only EU neighbour without restrictions on tourist visas to Russian citizens. Although the Schengen regime and Finnish law do not allow for a outright ban on visas based on nationality, Finland can reduce visa numbers issued based on category, Haavisto noted. “Tourism category can be restricted in the terms of how many visas can be applied for in a day,” Haavisto said. Joe Biden said on Thursday that the sentencing of basketball star Brittney Griner to nine years in prison on drugs charges in Russia was “unacceptable” and called on Moscow to release her immediately. Biden said a statement: Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates. Griner’s defence said they will file an appeal on behalf of the US basketball star. Griner’s defence team said that in sentencing the court had ignored all evidence they had presented as well as Griner’s guilty plea. They said they were “disappointed” by the verdict. A Moscow court has convicted the US basketball player Brittney Griner on drug charges, sentencing her to nine years in prison and a 1m rouble fine in a politically charged verdict that could lead to a prisoner swap with the United States. Griner, a basketball talent who played in Russia during off-seasons from the Phoenix Mercury, was arrested for cannabis possession in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport in February. Her arrest came just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, launching frantic backdoor negotiations between the US and Russian intelligence services as her trial played out in a small courthouse just outside the Moscow city limits. Her formal conviction, which was a foregone conclusion, would be a necessary step towards a prisoner exchange. US officials say Russia wants to swap Griner and Paul Whelan, a former US marine arrested on spying charges in 2020, for the convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout. While she pleaded guilty to the drug charges, the US has classified Griner as “wrongfully detained”, launching a process similar to hostage negotiations with Iran and other countries. A senior US embassy official attended Thursday’s hearing and verdict, where police spetsnaz (special forces) and bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled the hallways. Prosecutors asked for a nine-and-a-half year prison sentence for Griner and a hefty fine, nearly the maximum in her case. In an emotional closing statement on Thursday, Griner apologised to her teammates and told the courtroom that she had made an “honest mistake”, adding “that is why I pled guilty to my charges but I had no intent of breaking the law”. She has also rejected the political implications of her case, making an emotional appeal directly to the judge, Anna Sotnikova. “I know everybody keep talking about ‘political pawn’ and ‘politics,’ but I hope that is far from this courtroom,” she said, asking for leniency. In the end, it was not shown. Read the full story here: The first shipment of Ukrainian grain to the UK since the war began is expected to arrive in 10 days, western officials said. Millions of tonnes of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since Russia invaded just over six months ago. A UN-brokered agreement last month allowed the first Ukrainian shipment to be cleared for travel this week, with the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni carrying corn and entering the Bosphorus strait on the way to Lebanon on Wednesday. Speaking about the newly re-established Ukrainian grain exports, a western official said the Malta-flagged Rojen is “due to arrive in the UK on August 14”, PA News reports. The official said: This will almost certainly be the first shipment from Ukraine to arrive in the UK since the end of February and the start of the invasion. The bulk carrier is expected to travel from the Port of Chornomorsk in Ukraine, where it is thought to be berthed and loaded, to the UK, but the official could not say which UK port is expected to receive it. However, according to the VesselFinder website, the ship is due to arrive in Teesport on August 17. The cargo is “probably corn or grain”, the official said, adding: What it does show is that there is – which perhaps people don’t realise – direct supply of agricultural produce to the UK from the Ukraine. Addressing the first shipment to leave Ukraine since the agreement, the official said: It is almost certain the success of its transit will result in more frequent transits. Clearing the backlog caused by the blockade that’s been in place since February will almost certainly remain a major logistical challenge. But another western official, when asked about the shipment, said there is limited information available about when ships will be leaving Ukraine, and decisions are still be negotiated among the parties to the agreement. They said: At some point soon they will agree which ships will leave and when. We don’t have those details yet. Ukraine has slammed a report by Amnesty International (See 13:56) which found that Ukrainian forces are endangering civilians as “unfair” and a “perversion”. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says in a video posted on Facebook: This behaviour of Amnesty International is not about finding and reporting the truth to the world, it is about creating a false equivalence - between the offender and the victim, between the country that destroys hundreds and thousands of civilians, cities, territories, and a country that is desperately defending itself. Top presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak insisted Ukraine’s armed forces take all measures to move civilians to safer areas and suggested Amnesty was complicit in spreading Kremlin disinformation. He tweeted: The only thing that poses a threat to Ukrainians is (Russian) army of executioners and rapists coming to (Ukraine) to commit genocide. Meanwhile, defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov called the report a “perversion” as he said it questioned the right of Ukrainians to defend their country. Back in the courtroom in Russia, US basketball player Brittney Griner has said she made an “honest mistake”. In a closing statement, Griner added, “that is why I plead guilty to my charges but I had no intent of breaking the law”. “I know everybody keep talking about ‘political pawn’ and ‘politics,’ but I hope that is far from this courtroom,” she said, asking the judge for leniency. In February, Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport after authorities found vape canisters containing cannabis oil – for which she had a doctor’s recommendation – in her bags. A verdict is expected later on Thursday. Ukrainian forces are violating international law and endangering civilians by establishing bases in residential areas, including in schools and hospitals, Amnesty International said on Thursday. The defenders’ tactics “in no way justify Russia’s indiscriminate attacks”, the rights group said in a new report, and some Russian “war crimes”, including in the city of Kharkiv, were not linked to the tactics, AFP reports. But Amnesty listed incidents when Ukrainian forces appeared to have exposed civilians to danger in 19 towns and villages in the Kharkiv, Donbas and Mykolaiv regions. Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard said: We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas. Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law. The report was met with anger on Twitter. Russian prosecutors have asked for the US basketball player Brittney Griner to be sentenced to nine and a half years in prison, as the Kremlin wraps up her politically charged trial before a potential prisoner exchange. Griner was arrested just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, which saw an already tense relationship between Washington and Moscow break down. Prosecutors in the Russian court said Griner’s arrest on drug charges was “fully proven” and demanded she serve nearly a decade in a high-security prison and pay a large fine. A verdict in Griner’s case was expected on Thursday evening, her lawyer, Maria Blagovolina, said. A guilty verdict appears to be a foregone conclusion as Griner’s conviction would be a necessary step towards a prisoner exchange with the US. US officials say Russia is seeking to exchange Griner and Paul Whelan, a former US marine arrested on spying charges in 2020, for the convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout. A lawyer for Whelan told the Guardian, however, that a final agreement did not seem to have been reached. Long lines of Russian shoppers formed outside H&amp;M stores in Moscow shopping centres this week when the Swedish fashion retailer reopened its doors to sell off stock before pulling out of the country for good. Along with a spate of other western brands, including Ikea, Nike and Zara owner Inditex, H&amp;M halted operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, but the retailer opened its doors one last time this week to clear out remaining goods. Exiting Russia, its sixth-biggest market, is costing the company 2bn Swedish krona (nearly £170m) and affecting 6,000 staff. Long queues were seen outside H&amp;M stores at Moscow’s Aviapark shopping centre, according to footage posted on Telegram by news outlet Baza, and at the Metropolis mall. One customer, Irina, told Reuters: Well, it is closing, that’s why we are standing here. I’m going to buy whatever there is. Another shopper, Ekaterina, said: Sadly, the reason why all this is happening is awful. Everything else is meaningless, like how we are going to manage [without H&amp;M]. While the Swedish furniture chain Ikea opted to hold an online-only sale from 5 July, H&amp;M decided to temporarily reopen its stores in August. The world’s second-biggest fashion retailer after Spain’s Inditex rents 170 stores in Russia and has operated them directly. Read the full story here: Russian shelling of a bus stop on Thursday in the frontline east Ukraine town of Toretsk killed eight people and wounded four, the regional governor said. Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Ukraine-run Donetsk region administration, wrote on Telegram: According to preliminary information, there was artillery fire. They hit a public transport stop, where there was a crowd of people at that time. He said that there were three children among the wounded. The attack comes as Kyiv orders civilians to leave the war-torn Donetsk region bearing the brunt of Moscow’s gruelling offensive in the east of the country, AFP reports. Kyrylenko wrote: I appeal to all residents of the region: do not turn yourself into a target for the Russians! Evacuate in a timely fashion! Ukrainian officials said Russian strikes continued to rain down on towns and cities across the sprawling frontline. The mayor of southern city Mykolaiv said early morning shelling had damaged residential buildings in two districts. Mykolaiv is the closest city to where Ukrainian forces are looking to launch a major counter-offensive and has been frequently hit by Moscow’s forces. Officials in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv said missiles launched from Russian territory across the nearby shared border had hit industrial areas. The UN is setting up a fact-finding mission to investigate the killing of dozens of prisoners of war at a prison in a Russian-occupied region of eastern Ukraine that Moscow and Kyiv accuse each other of carrying out. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, told reporters he did not have authority to conduct criminal investigations but could conduct fact-finding missions, and terms of reference were being prepared for the governments of Ukraine and Russia to approve. The mission was set up in response to requests from Russia and Ukraine. Russia claimed that Ukraine’s military used US-supplied rocket launchers to strike the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by Russian-backed separatists. The attack killed 53 Ukrainian PoWs and wounded another 75, separatist authorities and Russian officials said. The Ukrainian military denied carrying out any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka. The intelligence arm of the Ukrainian defence ministry claimed in a statement on Wednesday to have evidence that local Kremlin-backed separatists colluded with the Russian FSB, the KGB’s main successor agency, and mercenary group Wagner to mine the barrack before “using a flammable substance, which led to the rapid spread of fire in the room”. The Ukrainian military on Tuesday likewise claimed that the barrack had been blown up from the inside, citing the nature of damage, which it said was inconsistent with Russian claims that Ukraine had shelled the building. It was not immediately possible to verify these claims. The US, meanwhile, believes Russia is preparing to fabricate evidence pointing the finger at Ukraine. Guterres said he took the requests from Russia and Ukraine for a UN investigation of last Friday’s attack “very seriously” and expressed hope that both countries would agree to the terms of reference. At the same time, he said, the UN was looking for “competent, independent people” to take part in the mission. The UN chief also expressed hope the warring countries would facilitate the mission’s access and provide the data required “to clarify the truth about what happened”.

The Kremlin said on Thursday that the Turkish-brokered deal to unblock Ukraine’s grain exports from the Black Sea was not a “one-off mechanism”, and that it hoped it would continue to work effectively. The deal, which allows for Ukrainian grain to be shipped to world markets via Turkey, must be renewed every 120 days by agreement of the parties. The EU intends to put together another financing package for Ukraine by September that will amount to about €8bn (£6.7bn), German government sources said. Part of the package would be made up of grants that do not have to be repaid while another part will consist of loans, a government official told journalists on Thursday. Eight people have been killed and four have been wounded in Russian artillery shelling in the eastern Ukrainian town of Toretsk in Donetsk region on Thursday, the regional governor said. The shelling hit a public transport stop where people had gathered, the governor for the area, Pavlo Kyrylenko, wrote on Telegram. Three children were among the wounded, he said. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, said the attack was “another terrorist act” by Russia, and repeated his calls for other nations to declare Russia a state sponsor of terror, a move that would bring further sanctions on Moscow. Powerful explosions were heard in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv on Thursday amid Russian attacks in several regions, Associated Press reports. The agency is reporting the latest overview of the war from Ukraine’s presidential office. At least four civilians were killed and 10 more wounded over the past 24 hours, with nine Ukrainian regions coming under fire, the office said in its daily update. Two districts of Mykolaiv, which has been targeted frequently in recent weeks, were shelled. Russian forces reportedly fired 60 rockets at Nikopol, in the central Dnipropetrovsk region. Some 50 residential buildings were damaged in the city of 107,000 and some projectiles hit power lines, leaving city residents without electricity, according to Ukrainian authorities. Nikopol is located across the Dnieper river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which was taken over by Russian troops early in the war. Experts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War believe that Russia is shelling the area intentionally, “putting Ukraine in a difficult position”. It is nearly 1pm in Kyiv. Here is the latest from our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The UN is conducting a fact-finding mission in response to requests from both Russia and Ukraine after 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion at a barracks in separatist-controlled Olenivka. The warring nations have accused each other of carrying out the attack. Ukraine claims it was a special operation plotted in advance by the Kremlin, and carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. Russia’s defence ministry, however, claims the Ukrainian military used US-supplied rockets to strike the prison. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wants to talk directly to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in the hope China can use its influence with Russia to bring the war to an end. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, Zelenskiy said: “It’s a very powerful state. It’s a powerful economy. So (it) can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” So far, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion and its president, Xi Jinping, told Putin it would support Russia’s “sovereignty and security”. The US Senate has ratified Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato, voting 95-1 in support. The US is the 23rd member state to ratify what would be the most significant expansion of the 30-member alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan US commitment to Nato, and to ensuring our alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” the president, Joe Biden, said in a statement. All 30 Nato members must ratify the accession before Finland and Sweden can become members. Ukraine is pulling out its 40 peacekeepers from the Nato-led mission in Kosovo, which totals 3,800 members, according to Ukrainian news. In March, Zelenskiy issued a decree for all missions to return to Ukraine to support the war. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog has again appealed for access to a Ukrainian nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces to determine whether it was a source of danger. Contact with the Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is at Zaporizhzhia and is being operated by Ukrainian technicians under occupation, was “fragile” and communications did not function every day, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi told a Swiss newspaper. The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship Razoni set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the UN. The ship has been inspected by members of the joint coordination centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosphorus Strait “shortly”. Ukraine failed to stop a Syrian-flagged vessel claimed to be carrying stolen Ukrainian grain from leaving Lebanon. The Lebanese government reported on Thursday that the Syrian-flagged Laodicea had left its territorial waters, despite appeals from Kyiv to reverse a court decision allowing its departure. Russia has denied stealing the grain on the ship, which was reported to be sailing to its ally, Syria. The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February. Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across Europe. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has branded “disgusting” the behaviour of the ex German chancellor Gerhard Schröder. The former German leader has come under fire, after he went on holiday to Moscow and had a private meeting with Vladimir Putin. Schröder told German media in a lengthy interview he had nothing to apologise for over his friendship with the Russian president. A Syrian ship that Ukraine says is carrying stolen Ukrainian grain has left a Lebanese port after officials in Lebanon allowed it to sail following an investigation, Associated Press reports. Lebanon’s transport minister, Ali Hamie, tweeted on Thursday that the ship was now outside his country’s territorial waters. The Syrian-flagged Laodicea had been anchored at the port of Tripoli since it arrived last Thursday, carrying 10,000 tons of wheat flour and barley. Ukraine said the ship’s cargo had been stolen by Russia and urged Lebanon not to allow the vessel to leave the port. A court decided on Wednesday, however, that the vessel could sail, after Lebanon’s prosecutor-general concluded it was not carrying stolen Ukrainian grain. Russian diplomats have denied stealing the grain, while accusing Ukraine of lying and trying to damage relations between Moscow and Beirut. Young Ukrainians have been helping rebuild places destroyed during the Russian invasion. This photo essay from EPA shows a group of young people working in Ivanivka, a village in southern Ukraine that was under Russian occupation for months. Around 200 people work at weekends to repair war-damaged buildings and restore places that were under Russian occupation. Most of the volunteers are young Ukrainians from Kyiv, but some come from other parts of the country or abroad. Ukraine’s armed forces have reported explosions in the occupied city of Donetsk this morning. According to the Telegram channel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, “there are already victims and wounded”. The post reported explosions in the city centre near a hotel and a theatre. The reports have not been independently verified. Estonia’s foreign minister has called for further western sanctions against Russia to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war. In an interview with Politico’s National Security Daily newsletter, Ernas Reinsalu said the war would get worse for Ukraine and is partners, the longer the west waits to transfer weapons and impose further sanctions. My message is indeed that there is an immediate need for an additional package of sanctions, or several packages. The war will not end by itself. The war will only end if Putin ends the war. And Putin ends the war not because he somehow feels a sentiment about [what has changed in the] international order or his reputation. The EU has passed seven rounds of sanctions against Russia, but momentum is flagging as governments worry about a looming energy crisis. Estonia, one of the bloc’s smallest member states, which spends 0.8% of GDP on military aid for Ukraine, has long been in the vanguard of tougher action against Russia. Reinsalu made the comments, shortly before meeting Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the behaviour of Gerhard Schröder was “disgusting”, after the former German chancellor went to Moscow last week and claimed Russia wanted a “negotiated solution” to the war. Ukraine’s president made the comments on Wednesday during his nightly video address, after Schröder told German media in a lengthy interview he had nothing to apologise for over his friendship with Vladimir Putin, whom he met last week during a visit to the Russian capital. Zelenskiy said: It is simply disgusting when former leaders of major states with European values work for Russia, which is at war against these values. As the Guardian’s Kate Connolly reports from Berlin, Schröder has come under fierce criticism for his business links to the Russian state-run gas company Gazprom. He was one of the driving forces behind the construction of two Baltic Sea pipelines to carry gas to Europe, one of which was mothballed after the invasion of Ukraine. The other, Nord Stream 1, is only delivering 20% of the level of gas expected. In a five-hour long interview with the magazine Stern and the broadcaster RTL he gave no direct insight into the mindset of the Russian leader. However, he said after his discussions with Putin he thought the conflict with Russia was “resolvable” but required more negotiations – which Germany and France should lead – and a greater display of sensitivity by the west towards Russia’s “real fears of being hemmed in” by hostile countries, which “feed off historical events” and were “unfortunately also valid”. You can read Kate’s full report here: Ex-German chancellor Gerhard Schröder under fire for meeting Putin Ukraine has called on Lebanon to reverse a decision by a court in Tripoli to authorise the departure of a seized Syrian ship carrying what Kyiv says is stolen Ukrainian grain, Reuters reports. In a statement, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said it was disappointed by the court’s decision to clear the Syrian-flagged Laodicea for departure and said that Kyiv’s position had not been taken into account. The Syrian-flagged vessel has been anchored at the Lebanese port of Tripoli since last week, laden with 10,000 tons of wheat flour and barley. Ukraine has said the grain was stolen by Russia, but Lebanese officials have rejected this claim. The legal wrangling comes as the first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to to ease Russia’s naval blockade reached Turkey. Russia will introduce duty-free shops selling western imports to diplomats for foreign currency in a practice that will remind many Russians of the infamous beryozka stores that epitomised official privilege during the Soviet era, the Guardian’s Andrew Roth writes from Moscow. The shops, which could open as soon as the autumn, will sell imported goods that may become hard to find in ordinary Russian shops as foreign brands flee the country over the war in Ukraine. But in order to make a purchase, visitors will have to provide an official document to prove they are a foreign diplomat, employee of an international organisation or a family member. And the shops will also accept payment in dollars and euro, mimicking the beryozka stores’ function as a magnet for foreign currency. “It’s a total USSR!” wrote Sergei Smirnov, the editor-in-chief of the Russian outlet Mediazona, which wrote about the legislation after its announcement in Russia’s official parliamentary newspaper. You can read all of Andrew’s report here: Russia to open duty-free shops selling western imports to foreign diplomats The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog has again appealed for access to a Ukrainian nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces to determine whether it was a source of danger. Contact with the Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is at Zaporizhzhia and is being operated by Ukrainian technicians under occupation, was “fragile” and communications did not function every day, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi told Swiss paper Tages-Anzeiger. “We can’t afford faulty communication with the plant in areas relevant to safety. We know of allegations that live ammunition is stored in the plant, that there are attacks on the power plant,” Reuters reports he said in interview published in German. “Frankly, if I don’t have access, I can’t determine that. There are contradictions between the accounts of the Russian and Ukrainian sides. I receive information, I also mention it in my situation reports, but I have no way of determining whether it corresponds to the facts.” Russia has said it has offered for the IAEA to visit the plant, but Ukraine refuses to allow the co-operation. For its part, Ukraine does not want to legitimise the Russian occupation of the facility. Grossi said the UN discussions with parties to the conflict covered a proposed accord on security zones around nuclear plants but he saw no willingness to strike a deal at this stage. Ukraine’s state emergency service has just outlined on Telegram the work it did with discarded explosives and ammunition in the last 24 hours. In a statement it said: During the day, pyrotechnic units of the state emergency service were involved 117 times, 691 explosive objects were detected, removed and neutralised. The territory with an area of 92 hectares was surveyed. Japan’s foreign minister, Hayashi Yoshimasa, has raised the issue of Ukraine at a meeting of senior diplomats from the southeast Asian nations that is taking place in Phnom Penh in Cambodia. The Associated Press report he said that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has had far-reaching effects beyond Europe. It quotes him saying: Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has given rise to many challenges, including soaring prices of energy, food and other commodities, as well as supply chain disruptions. I think now is the time to address these challenges in a coordinated manner, and it is even more important to maintain and strengthen the free and open international order based on the rule of law. Among other attendees in Cambodia was China’s foreign minister Wang Yi. China has refused to condemn Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing about how it sees the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It says: Ukraine’s missile and artillery units continue to target Russian military strongholds, personnel clusters, logistical support bases and ammunition depots. This will highly likely impact Russian military logistical resupply and put pressure on Russian military combat support elements. It also suggests that Russia is actively defending the crossings over the Dnieper River which link the occupied city of Kherson with the rest of the southern portion of the Kherson region. It says: Russian forces have almost certainly positioned pyramidal radar reflectors in the water near the recently damaged Antonivskiy Bridge and by the recently damaged nearby rail bridge, both of which cross over the Dnieper River in Kherson, southern Ukraine. The radar reflectors are likely being used to hide the bridge from synthetic aperture radar imagery and possible missile targeting equipment. This highlights the threat Russia feels from the increased range and precision of Western-supplied systems. The Antonivskiy Bridge acts as a key Russian resupply route, and was attacked by a Ukrainian missile barrage last week. This is Martin Belam on the live blog now, you can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russian forces are engaged in considerable military activity, firing from tanks, barrel and rocket artillery in several parts of Ukraine, according to the Ukraine general staff’s Thursday update. Earlier, Ukraine had warned that Moscow could be preparing new offensive operations in southern Ukraine. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, governor of Sumy region, which borders Russia, said three towns had been shelled by Russian forces on Wednesday, with a total of 55 missiles fired. There were no injuries, but homes and commercial premises were damaged. He said eight artillery shells hit residential parts of Krasnopilska community. Mayor Yevhen Yevtushenko of Nikopol, to the west of Zaporizhzhia in central Ukraine, said on his Telegram channel that his city had been shelled overnight. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in an interview appearing on YouTube that the whole point of the Russian offensive in the east was to force Ukraine to divert troops from the area. The UN nuclear chief warned earlier this week that Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine “is completely out of control” and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to quickly allow experts to visit the sprawling complex to stabilise the situation and avoid a nuclear accident. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview Tuesday with the Associated Press that the situation is getting more perilous every day at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the south-eastern city of Enerhodar, which Russian troops seized in early March. “Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated” at the plant, he said. “What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.” US officials believe Russia is working to fabricate evidence concerning last week’s deadly strike on the Olevinka detention centre that killed 53 prisoners of war in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine. A US official familiar with the intelligence finding told The Associated Press the classified intelligence – which was recently downgraded – shows that Russian officials might plant ammunition from medium-ranged High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or Himars, as evidence that the systems provided by the US to Ukraine were used in the attack. Russia is expected to take the action as it anticipates independent investigators and journalists eventually getting access to Olenivka, the official added. The US Senate delivered near-unanimous bipartisan approval to Nato membership for Finland and Sweden on Wednesday, calling expansion of the western defensive bloc a “slam-dunk” for US national security and a day of reckoning for Vladimir Putin. The 95-1 vote for the candidacy of two European countries that, until Russia’s war against Ukraine, had long avoided military alliances took a crucial step toward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its 73-year-old pact of mutual defense among the United States and democratic allies in Europe. Joe Biden, who has been the principal player rallying global economic and material support for Ukraine, has sought quick entry for the two previously non-militarily aligned northern European countries. Read more here: Ukraine is seeking an opportunity to speak directly with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to help end its war with Russia, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the South China Morning Post. In an interview with SCMP, the Ukrainian leader urged China to use its outsize political and economic influence over Russia to bring an end to the fighting. “It’s a very powerful state. It’s a powerful economy,” the report quoted Zelenskiy as saying. “So (it) can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” Zelenskiy told the SCMP that Ukraine had officially asked for a conversation with Xi but had so far been unsuccessful. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is what we know so far. The UN is conducting a fact-finding mission in response to requests from both Russia and Ukraine after 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion at a barracks in separatist-controlled Olenivka. The warring nations have accused each other of carrying out the attack. Ukraine claims it was a special operation plotted in advance by the Kremlin, and carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. Russia’s defence ministry, however, claims the Ukrainian military used US-supplied rockets to strike the prison. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wants to talk directly to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in the hope China can use its influence with Russia to bring the war to an end. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, Zelenskiy said: “It’s a very powerful state. It’s a powerful economy. So (it) can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” So far, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion and its president, Xi Jinping, told Putin it would support Russia’s “sovereignty and security”. The US Senate has ratified Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato, voting 95-1 in support. The US is the 23rd member state to ratify what would be the most significant expansion of the 30-member alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan US commitment to Nato, and to ensuring our alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” the president, Joe Biden, said in a statement. All 30 Nato members must ratify the accession before Finland and Sweden can become members. Ukraine is pulling out its 40 peacekeepers from the Nato-led mission in Kosovo, which totals 3,800 members, according to Ukraine news. In March, Zelenskiy issued a decree for all missions to return to Ukraine to support the war. A Russian official in Ukraine has claimed Ukrainian forces are using western arms to attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Europe’s largest nuclear plant is now controlled by Russian forces and being used as a military base, according to Reuters. However, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Ukrainian forces are not firing against Russian forces “lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant”. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield accounts from either side of the war. The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship Razoni set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the UN. The ship has been inspected by members of the joint coordination centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosphorus Strait “shortly”. The Ukrainian president has dismissed the importance of the first grain export shipment from his country since Russia invaded, saying it was carrying a fraction of the crop Kyiv must sell to help salvage its shattered economy. In downbeat comments, Zelenskiy, via video to students in Australia on Wednesday, said more time was needed to see whether other grain shipments would follow. The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February. Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across Europe. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees. The former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder has come under fire for a private meeting held with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, after he travelled on holiday to Moscow to meet him. Schröder told German media in a lengthy interview he had nothing to apologise for over his friendship with Putin, whom he met last week during a visit to the Russian capital. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has insisted that Russia had no reason to hold up the return of a gas turbine for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. The turbine is stranded in Germany, following servicing in Canada, in an escalating standoff that has seen has flows to Europe fall to a trickle, just 20% of capacity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/jun/02/beaches-uk-britain-weirdest-sands-coast-shoreline","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-02T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Spooky shipwrecks and singing sands: 10 of the UK’s weirdest beaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jun/02/beaches-uk-britain-weirdest-sands-coast-shoreline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/jun/02/beaches-uk-britain-weirdest-sands-coast-shoreline","fields":{"headline":"Spooky shipwrecks and singing sands: 10 of the UK’s weirdest beaches","bodyText":"In about 1628 Mrs Thomasin Farrer, resident of Scarborough, made an incredible discovery: the town had a beach. Observant folk had previously noticed these distinctive sandy features of a coastal nature, but dismissed them as awful places where ships ran aground and monsters got washed up. They were wastelands. Thomasin’s genius was to see them differently. Under Scarborough’s South Cliff she had discovered a bubbling spring that allegedly cured many ailments, a conclusion soon backed up by many learned physicians (all with practices in the town, coincidentally). As the venue for this fount of restorative goodness, the beach and sea were obviously health-giving, too. By 1720, when Daniel Defoe pitched up, the trickle of sickly visitors had become a tidal wave. By 1735, hotels and bathing huts were transforming Scarborough into Great Britain’s first seaside resort. But even more significant, the beach had gone from unwanted dumping ground to pleasure park. Almost four centuries later, we still go down to the beach. Fashions, however, don’t stand still. The simple Thomasin beach of therapeutic water, sun and sand is fading away like a cheap fake tan. In the words of writer Marriott Edgar, concerning an infamous trip to Blackpool in The Lion and Albert: They didn’t think much to the ocean The waves they was piddlin’ and small There was no wrecks and nobody drowneded ’Fact, nothin’ to laugh at at all! Like Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom in the poem, we want more from our beaches, not a drowning of course, but something unexpected and marvellous, like a shipwreck or a washed-up monster. With all due respect to our long coasts, a swathe of sand and a few piddlin’ waves is no longer good enough: what is needed is weird and wonderful wilderness. Fortunately, in Britain we have some classics: beaches that are unusual, even downright strange, places that require exploration. Orford Ness, Suffolk On the face of it, Orford Ness is merely a long spit of shingle, notable for its flora and fauna. Hares and deer can be spotted gadding about the horned poppies and sea figs. Distressingly, gangs of ought-to-know-better fly-tippers have plonked a load of old concrete bunkers everywhere, plus large quantities of rusting iron. As if this wasn’t bad enough, the scabby concrete silos have attracted plagues of installation artists, conspiracy theorists and heritage experts who claim the scattered ruins are national treasures, relics of several top secret cold-war-era projects, rather than ugly mess. To deter curious tourists, the National Trust has made the place accessible only by a small ferry which must be booked on a Thursday (no kidding), and erected warning signs about bombs. Unexplained men in sunglasses gather along the designated walkways. Women in comfortable shoes pose as wardens on bicycles. It’s all very Midsomer Murders, and extremely weird. Visit with caution. Cafe: You would think the National Trust might open a 1950s-themed outlet on the Ness where Victoria sponge cake made with radioactive raspberry jam is washed down with dishwater tea, but no, you must return to Orford for refreshments. The Riverside Tearoom does superior paninis, toasties and cakes. Danes Dyke, Flamborough Head, East Yorkshire From a car park tucked away in deep woods, you wander down a steep-sided declivity that looks suspiciously man-made. It was. But no one knows who did it. Was it built to defend against Scandinavian visitors in horned helmets, or part of a bronze age northern powerhouse scheme? Whoever was responsible, they cleverly hid the evidence under woodland carpeted with wild garlic and bluebells. Then, quite abruptly, you emerge on a marvellous beach, one entirely made up of smooth white stones the majority of which have been pierced by one or two finger-size holes. Ignorant and illiterate peasants of yesteryear used to blame witches for this, and call the petrified artefacts hag-stones. However, since witches no longer exist, we have no explanation. Baffled scientists stand around, looking baffled. Children like to balance them in towers (I mean the stones). Leaving aside superstition, it is a fact that you cannot tell a lie when speaking through one of the holes in a hag-stone. Cafe: There is a good refreshment kiosk near the car park. Otherwise head for Scrumdiddlyumptious in Flamborough for top-notch cakes. Skrinkle Haven, Pembrokeshire Just because UFOs are infrequently sighted in Pembrokeshire doesn’t mean this stretch of coast isn’t weird. Eight kilometres west of Tenby is a wonderful and inexplicable beach. Take the long flight of steps down the cliff and you arrive in Church Doors, named after its pair of sea stacks that you can swim through when the tide is right. So far, so normal. But in the cliff face you will see a small cave entrance that turns out to be a tunnel, leading through to Skrinkle Haven’s sandy beach. This geological feature just happens to be the precise length of an alien landing craft. Once on the other side, there is an isolated beach accessible only by that one tunnel (except at low tide when you can simply walk round). South Pembrokeshire has several other contenders too: the sands on Barafundle have coughed up a shipwreck in recent years, but first prize goes to the inaccessible coves west of Stackpole where the ardent abseiler or keen kayaker will discover some very spooky caves indeed. Cafe: YHA Manorbier has the excellent Skrinkle Tearoom. Sandwood Bay, Sutherland The opportunity to be eaten alive by monsters is one that most savvy travellers welcome, and few British beaches can offer such a guarantee as Sandwood Bay. Hike the four miles across heathery hills to this idyllic stretch of sand on a cloudy summer’s day and you are basically serving yourself up as a feast for the legendary vampire of the Scottish west coast: the midge. However, like Dracula, these bloodsuckers do hate bright sunshine and strong winds so, with luck, can be avoided. On a good day this beach is a miracle of car- and boat-free beauty. Down one end is Am Buachaille seastack, a tower of stony silence; at the other, when I visited, was the body of a dead whale. What more could anyone want? Take head nets, wild camp near the dunes, and pretend you have it to yourself… but you probably won’t because newspapers keep mentioning the place. Cafe: Take a stove and cafetière. Seaham, County Durham Vane Tempest beach is a short walk north of Seaham, a sand-and-shingle stretch backed by earthy cliffs. And there ends the normality. On any sunny morning you will spot zombies, lots of them, shuffling at a snail’s pace in aimless circles, eyes on the ground. Occasionally an oncoming wave will jerk them comically into life and they will prance, as if operated by an invisible puppet master, for a few seconds. When approached they can be friendly, claiming to be hunting for glass beads, and not part of a zombie flesheater invasion. During the 19th century Seaham became a bottle-producing town, and for decades all the broken glass was dumped offshore. After years of rolling in the deep, the glass is transformed into beads and washed up, only to be pounced upon by collectors from all over the world (on my own visit I met visitors from Lithuania, New Zealand, Italy and Sunderland). Once your eye is attuned, you can pick up a bead every few minutes: most common are clear glass nuggets, but blue and red are the most prized. It’s great fun and if you set the children on it, they’ll zombie-walk for hours without complaining. Cafe: Seaham has a good selection. Cafe Humbles is excellent. Tusker Rock and Traeth Mawr, Glamorgan Travellers go far and wide to see a shipwreck on a beach, but what about a beach made of shipwrecks? The drawback is that Tusker Rock is over a mile off Ogmore-by-Sea and accessible only by experienced kayakers: most other boats try and avoid it. This deadly outcrop has claimed so many ships over the centuries that its surface is largely made of twisted metal and boiler plates from various 19th-century wrecks. Fortunately, there are interesting beaches nearby, although you do still need to check the tides for Traeth Mawr, a wonderful long, cliff-backed strand with tidal pools and fossils. As you head north-west, you might spot a mermaid – no, hang on, that’s a naturist. They do hang out around here. Cafe: The Plough and Harrow at Monknash is nearest and best. Cider is a speciality. Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex There is nothing like proximity to a nuclear power station to increase one’s appreciation of the natural world, and Essex has one of the best. Perhaps it is the sheer arrogance of planners who decided that this stretch of coast was so remote and worthless that no one would mind, and yet the shingles and mud flats that reach all the way around the Dengie peninsula are a cornucopia of rare wild flowers and fauna, among them a sea blite, a weevil and a jumping spider. OK, so the Dengie is not everyone’s idea of paradise, but aficionados love its vast open skies and austere tranquillity. The best spot for swimmers is near the power station itself, currently wrapped up like a Christo and subject to a proposed development by the China General Nuclear Power Group. What could go wrong? Cafe: Bradwell Marina has a clubhouse and restaurant with lovely views. Saltwick Bay, North Yorkshire A shipwreck on the beach used to be a mainstay of this coast. In the year 1869 there were 838 of these melancholy happenings on the rocks and beaches between Spurn Head and Teesmouth. Most of these old wrecks are soon lost and forgotten, although the occasional boiler from a steamship survives (pieces of the SS Rosa from 1930 are still visible at North Landing, Flamborough). The Admiral von Tromp is much more recent and still recognisably a boat, actually a trawler that got caught out in storms in the winter of 1976, leading to the tragic drowning of two men. When the tide is out, walk from the sandy beach at Saltwick Bay (a mile south of Whitby). The beach, incidentally, is one of a few where you can readily pick up gemstones: Whitby jet is washed out of the cliffs, particularly in winter storms, and ends up on the shoreline. Fossils are also plentiful. Cafe: Head south on the coastal path to the fog-signalling station and there is the Hornblower Tea Garden with the best view of any cafe in the UK. Otherwise Whitby has plenty of choice. Dulas Bay, Anglesey It is not perhaps the most stunning of Anglesey’s beaches, nor the best for swimming or sunbathing, but Dulas Bay is definitely the best for finding gold nuggets. In 1859 the ship Royal Charter was approaching Liverpool after a long voyage from Australia laden down with the fruits of the Ballarat gold rush. Unfortunately, a huge storm blew up and she was wrecked with the loss of around 450 lives (about 140 of them were buried in Llanallgo churchyard, about two miles south of the beach). Much of the treasure was salvaged at the time, but there have been rumours of gold washed ashore so stay alert for bright shiny objects. A little way south is the lovely sandy Traeth y Ora beach. The tragedy of the Royal Charter, plus the 133 other ships wrecked that night, inspired Captain Robert FitzRoy to develop gale warnings and, eventually, the Meteorological Office. Cafe: Coastal Cafe in nearby Moelfre has excellent fish and chips. Camas an Lighe, Ardnamurchan, Highlands Surely the last thing anybody would want is a noisy beach? But I’m not talking about loud music or drunken laughter; I mean the beach is actually making noise. There are a few places in the UK where the sand itself, moved by the wind or feet, emits a singing or whistling sound. Try Scotland’s Camas an Lighe on the Ardnamurchan peninsula, an isolated and beautiful spot, reputedly the site of a Jacobite battle back in 1745, and definitely some second world war commando training (watch out for unexploded munitions). Don’t expect Joan Sutherland; if the wind and humidity are right, you get an eerie distant whine, not unlike the sound made by an incoming midge mega-swarm. Other whistling sands are at Porthor on the Llyn peninsula and Studland Bay dunes. There are said to be 33 such places in the UK where the size of sand grains and roundness are just right. Cafe: The Ardnamurchan does not have a lot of cafes, but Cafe Tioram in Acharacle is excellent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2021/may/06/time-to-take-the-heat-off-cooling-towers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-06T16:00:58Z","webTitle":"Time to take the heat off cooling towers | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/06/time-to-take-the-heat-off-cooling-towers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/may/06/time-to-take-the-heat-off-cooling-towers","fields":{"headline":"Time to take the heat off cooling towers","bodyText":"Thank you for your fascinating first edition (5 May 1821).

The retired former chief sommelier at the Garrick Club said he had no choice but to back Emmanuel Macron for a second term. “I find him too arrogant, but I’m pro-European and anti-Le Pen so I had to go for him. It was not a vote for a politician, it was a vote against an idea.” Eskenazi added: “My mother survived Auschwitz but she saw her mother and father die there. She spent her life visiting schools as a witness against racism and xenophobia. She warned of the dangers of voting for the far right and the danger is still there.” Eskenazi, one of 116,595 French voters registered in the UK, is hoping that his fellow citizens will put up an electoral “barrage to stop Le Pen”. There was no sign of any support for Le Pen among London voters. After speaking to dozens of voters for three hours, the Guardian could not find a single voter for the far-right candidate. Jada Odero, a politics and history student at Manchester University, was affronted to be asked how she voted. “Of course there are no Le Pen supporters,” she said, “we’re in multicultural London and she’s just against that.” In 2017, Macron won 95% of the London French vote against Le Pen, after winning 51.4% in the first round. This time he could do even better here after winning 55% of first round preferences. Meanwhile, Le Pen came a distant seventh in the first round with only 2.63% across the UK. But Odero is anxious that in France, Le Pen’s popularity is on the rise. She said: “It won’t happen this time, but her stats are getting higher – people seem to be getting more and more ignorant.” Benjamin Fourmond, a London IT worker from Blois, agreed. “If anybody voted Le Pen here they probably wouldn’t tell you. I’m more worried about Le Pen winning in five years’ time, because Macron won’t be able to run then and she’ll still be around and that’s really scary.” Fourmond voted for the Green candidate, Yannick Jadot, in the first round. He said: “I don’t think Macron has done much for the environment. But he chose not to do anything about nuclear power stations, which in retrospect was probably a good move.” In the first round more than one in five UK-based French expats voted for the left-wing candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who only narrowly missed making it to the final two. Among them was marketing director Michel Lieke, who said he was drawn to Mélenchon’s promise to write off debts owed by African nations to France. On Sunday he voted for Macron to block Le Pen. “Working and paying taxes for anyone from an immigrant background is not going to be as straightforward if Le Pen wins.” Dual national sisters Manon, 21, and Léa Kilvington, 18, from Chertsey in Surrey were excited to be voting for the first time. Manon said: “I’ve been hearing that a lot of young people support Le Pen in France. There’s no way that we can let Le Pen get to power, so we wanted to make the effort to come out and vote.” Fatmire Bega-Shala, a French teacher in Feltham, also turned out to block Le Pen after troubling memories of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. She said: “My family is originally from Kosovo and growing up in France in the late 70s and 80s it was quite frightening to hear about Le Pen and the National Front. We were trying to be part of the society and he wasn’t welcoming. It is now important to stop his daughter.” Some of the voters emerging from the Lycée polling station were more positive about Macron. French teacher Michelle Pickard said: “The first priority is to block Le Pen, but I quite approve of Macron’s policy, and he is a true European and I am too. If he wins it will be a small victory, and he will have to take on board all these voters who are not happy with him.” Francesca Beausang, a City economist, closely allied herself with Macron. Peering from behind Chanel sunglasses she said: “Macron fits with my personal values. In 2017 I bought into the whole centrist argument he presented. And he did quite well in terms of managing Covid. He also did well in the debate whereas Le Pen struck me as absolutely venomous.” “No one in their right mind buys that she’s any different from her father.” Laurence Bemsafi, who also works in finance in the City, said Macron is popular in London because he is both pro-business and for social justice. She said: “I think he’ll be fine and I try not to think about the worst.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/30/zelenskiy-tells-russian-forces-to-flee-as-ukraine-counteroffensive-begins-in-kherson","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T15:19:14Z","webTitle":"Ukrainian adviser warns progress will be slow as southern counterattack begins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/zelenskiy-tells-russian-forces-to-flee-as-ukraine-counteroffensive-begins-in-kherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/30/zelenskiy-tells-russian-forces-to-flee-as-ukraine-counteroffensive-begins-in-kherson","fields":{"headline":"Ukrainian adviser warns progress will be slow as southern counterattack begins","bodyText":"A senior presidential adviser has told Ukrainians not to expect rapid gains, after his country began what it said was a long-awaited counteroffensive aiming to retake the southern province of Kherson from Russian forces. Ukrainian troops had broken through Russian defences in several areas of the frontline near Kherson city, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claimed. However, in a Telegram post, Arestovych cautioned against any expectations of a quick win, describing the offensive as a “slow operation to grind the enemy”. “Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about the capture by our military of a settlement in an hour,” he wrote. “But we don’t fight like that … Funds are limited.” The offensive was first announced on Monday by a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, who said it was taking place in “various directions”. Humeniuk said the operation needed “silence” as media attention could affect the results. So far, Ukraine’s authorities have not issued detailed information about the counteroffensive. At a press briefing on Tuesday, Humeniuk said Ukraine’s forces had succeeded in damaging bridges that join Kherson across the river, rendering them “impassable for heavy machinery”. Two Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines in Kherson, who have oversight of events, described a situation that differed from the Ukrainian officials’ statements. According to them, fighting is taking place in Kherson region, but it is not the major counteroffensive being touted by Kyiv. Ukraine’s authorities first announced the beginnings of a broader counteroffensive in July and since then, they have gained relatively little ground. Ukraine has reported capturing 40 villages – a village in Ukraine can be several streets or just one. Ukraine has, however, reported successfully destroying several ammunition depots and Russian headquarters in the Kherson region. CNN reported on Monday, quoting a Ukrainian military source, that four villages in Kherson region had been recaptured. The Ukrainian news site NV said it had only managed to confirm the liberation of one of the villages. NV reported that two were still occupied and it was unable to confirm the status of the fourth village. Unverifiable videos of explosions have been posted on Telegram groups in Kherson city and the neighbouring occupied town of Nova Kakhovka. Ukraine’s southern command, meanwhile, said Russia had suffered heavy losses in the last 24 hours, both in terms of fighters and equipment. The US state department cited an anonymous Pentagon official saying he did not want to “characterise the actions there as a counteroffensive just yet” and that it would take 24 to 36 hours for the clarity to emerge. The soldiers on the frontline in the Kherson region who spoke to the Guardian asked to remain anonymous because they are not allowed to talk to the media without permission. One soldier said there was no counteroffensive, the other said that battles were taking place but to halt a Russian offensive launched last week. Humeniuk said the fighters are not qualified to give assessments about operations and that such public comments should be left to high-level commanders. The soldiers’ accounts could not be verified but they appear to be in line with reports by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month that neither Ukraine nor Russia has what it needs for a decisive offensive. Instead “both are preparing for positional warfare”. “There is no counteroffensive and there won’t be,” said a fighter who has been serving on the frontlines in Kherson region since March. “There might be an imitation of one but there won’t be a real one. We absolutely do not have the weaponry for one.” “The Russians feel completely comfortable in their positions … they are not scared of us; there’s no reason to be scared of us,” the fighter said. “For each missile that we launch, they launch 50, 40, 30. Of course, the proportions can change depending on the situation,” he said. “We don’t have offensive equipment. You can’t launch an offensive with [US-made rocket system] Himars.” A commander also serving on the frontlines in Kherson said there were currently battles going on north of Kherson city and in the Beryslavskyi district to halt a Russian offensive that had started last week. “These are planned actions to hinder the enemy’s actions,” he said. He added, however, that efforts by Ukrainian forces over the last few days had yielded some successes. “It has been noticed that [Russian] units have retreated closer to the [River] Dnipro. Some [of their units] are crossing to [Ukraine’s left bank].” The commander said the Russians were now trying to regain their positions using missile strikes, including on Mykolaiv, the main city next to the frontlines. He said that the Russians did not have enough strength for a ground operation but could change the situation with a “missile terror”. “They are preparing to strike right now from Skadovsk and Oleshkiy,” he added, two towns in the occupied Kherson region. Zelenskiy did not address the counteroffensive specifically during his Monday evening address, but said: “The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Shortly after the announcement of the counteroffensive, on Monday afternoon, advisers to Ukraine’s presidential administration appeared to roll back on the announcement, asking for restraint from the media and commentators in order not to raise public expectations. One, Mykhailo Podolyak, warned politicians, experts and opinion leaders not to speculate about the progress of a military operation before Ukraine’s defence ministry and army issued official statements. “I understand our wishes and dreams … But war is not ‘content’. Let’s filter information and work professionally out of respect for our defenders,” he wrote on Telegram. The deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in the occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, said in a telephone interview that “everything in Kherson was under control”, claiming that Ukrainian spies and saboteurs were killed near Kherson’s Tavriiskyi neighbourhood on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, reports emerged that Stremousov had left Kherson after a video he posted appeared to indicate that he was in Voronezh, a Russian city 600 miles from Kherson. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Stremousov said that he was “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. “I don’t have to sit [in Kherson]. I am the deputy head of the region and have the opportunity to move around … These are working trips.” “Kherson will remain my base,” he added, denying that he left Kherson out of safety concerns. Stremousov became the most senior Russian-appointed official in Kherson, after the local governor, Volodymyr Saldo, was taken to hospital amid a suspected poisoning earlier in the summer. Stremousov’s apparent departure from Kherson comes after another Russian-appointed official in the region, Alexei Kovalev, was shot dead in his home over the weekend. In the past months, a number of Ukrainian nationals appointed by Russian forces in occupied territory have been killed or wounded in apparent partisan attacks. Russia’s defence ministry acknowledged a Ukrainian offensive had been launched in the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions but said it had failed and the Ukrainians had suffered significant casualties, the RIA news agency reported. The “enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably”, it said. A Ukrainian barrage of rockets left the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka just east of the city of Kherson without water or power, officials at the Russian-appointed local authority later told the outlet. The Guardian could not confirm their claims. The Kremlin press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said on Tuesday that Russia’s “special military operation” was going to plan, when asked at a press briefing to respond to news of the counteroffensive. On Monday, a mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived in Kyiv, according to Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The mission was to travel to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Russian-occupied territory for an inspection and to give technical assistance. The plant has been damaged by fighting. Russia captured it in early March but it is still run by Ukrainian staff. The world was on edge last week when fighting cut off vital electricity supplies to the plant, disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in history. The IAEA mission will spend four days at the plant, leaving on Saturday, according to the Wall Street Journal. It remains to be seen if the mission will be able to travel, as shelling continues in and around the nuclear plant. Both sides trade blame for the attacks. Ukraine claims they are false-flag attacks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-161-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:08:08Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 161 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-161-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-161-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 161 of the invasion","bodyText":"The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship, Razoni, set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the United Nations. The ship has been inspected by members of the Joint Coordination Centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosporus strait “shortly”. The Ukrainian president has dismissed the importance of the first grain export shipment from his country since Russia invaded, saying it was carrying a fraction of the crop Kyiv must sell to help salvage its shattered economy. Volodymr Zelenskiy’s downbeat comments, via video to students in Australia on Wednesday, came as an inspection of the ship was completed in Turkey before it continues to its final destination in Lebanon under a deal aimed at easing a global food crisis. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has insisted that Russia had no reason to hold up the return of a gas turbine for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. The turbine is stranded in Germany, following servicing in Canada, in an escalating standoff that has resulted in flows to Europe falling to a trickle, just 20% of capacity. Standing next to the turbine on a factory visit to Siemens Energy in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Scholz said it was fully operational and could be shipped back to Russia at any time – provided Moscow was willing to take it back. Russia has started creating a military strike force aimed at Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih and warned that Moscow could be preparing new offensive operations in southern Ukraine, Ukraine said on Wednesday. Russia holds swathes of Ukraine’s south that it captured in the early phases of its invasion, but Kyiv has said it will mount a counter-offensive. It said on Tuesday it had already recaptured 53 villages in occupied Kherson region, Reuters reports. The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its latest invasion of the country on 24 February. Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across Europe. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees. In its latest operation briefing, Russia’s ministry of defence has claimed that its strike on Radekhiv in the Lviv region “destroyed a storage base with foreign-made weapons and ammunition delivered to the Kyiv regime from Poland”. Earlier today, Lviv’s governor acknowledged the strike, and said “one building was damaged. Fortunately, no one was hurt.” The UK’s Ministry of Defence says there is likely to be an increase in civilians attempting to flee Kherson and the surrounding area as hostilities continue and food shortages worsen, putting pressure on transport routes. They have also said that a Ukrainian strike against a Russian ammunition train in Kherson oblast, southern Ukraine, means it is “highly unlikely” the rail link between Kherson and Crimea is operational. Mykola Tochytskyi, deputy minister of foreign affairs, has repeated Ukraine’s request for the skies over nuclear installations to be closed to prevent a potential accident and their misuse. He said: “For the first time in history, civil nuclear facilities have been turned into military targets and springboards for the Russian army in breach of the non-proliferation provisions on peaceful use of nuclear energy. The world witnesses how nuclear terrorism, sponsored by the nuclear-weapon state, is arising in reality. The robust joint actions are needed to prevent nuclear disaster at global scale. We ask to close the sky over the nuclear power plants in Ukraine.” The US embassy in Kyiv has criticised what it says is a decision by Roskomnadzor, the Russian government’s media agency, to block a US government website – share.america.gov. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said the US has not offered Russia to resume talks on the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty. Gerhard Schröder, a former German chancellor and friend of Vladimir Putin, said the Russian president wanted a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine and last month’s agreement on grain shipments might offer a way forward. “The good news is that the Kremlin wants a negotiated solution,” Schröder told Stern weekly and broadcasters RTL/ntv, adding he had met Putin in Moscow last week. “A first success is the grain deal, perhaps that can be slowly expanded to a ceasefire.” Ukraine has said any negotiated peace settlement with Moscow would be contingent on a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, brushing off comments by Schroeder. In response on Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described Schroeder derisively as a “voice of the Russian royal court”. Schröder has come under fire for a private meeting held with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, after he travelled on holiday to Moscow to meet him. Schröder is facing an investigation by the Social Democrats of which he has been a member since 1963, over his Kremlin links and his refusal to distance himself from Putin, and could yet be ejected from the party. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been accused of glorifying war after she retweeted a Ukrainian tweet listing Russia’s war dead – described in an embedded graphic as “eliminated personnel”, before she quickly deleted it. The original tweet from the Ukrainian defence ministry quoted a Robert Burns poem saying “tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty’s in every blow! Let us do or die!” Ukrainian refugees are likely to become victims of rising tensions and disinformation campaigns in their host countries, a report has warned. False reports exaggerating how much aid refugees receive compared with local people, as well as linking refugees with violent crime and political extremism, could cause a breakdown in relations with local communities, the charity World Vision said. A group of Russian soldiers have accused their commanders of jailing them in eastern Ukraine for refusing to take part in the war. About 140 soldiers were detained and four have filed complaints with an investigative committee, said Maxim Grebenyuk, head of Moscow-based group Military Ombudsman. Russia has accused the US of being “directly involved” in the war by supplying targeting information for Ukraine’s long-range missile strikes. Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s acting deputy head of military intelligence, denied US officials were providing direct targeting information but acknowledged there was consultation. The US has imposed sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s purported lover. Alina Kabaeva, 39, landed on the latest update to the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s specially designated nationals list – freezing any of her assets in the US and generally prohibiting Americans from dealing with her. Russia’s supreme court has designated the Azov regiment – a former volunteer battalion that was incorporated into Ukraine’s army – a “terrorist” organisation, allowing for lengthy jail terms for its members. The G7 is threatening to further deprive Russia of revenue by blocking services that enable the transportation of its oil globally if it doesn’t heed the proposed oil price cap. Russia has already stated it will not obey the cap and will ship to nations that don’t support the price ceiling. Russia has carried out deadly strikes against Ukrainians in the eastern Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions, according to Reuters, which said it was yet to verify the battle reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-blinken-hails-turkish-help-as-grain-export-deal-resumes","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-03T19:01:35Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow says UK ‘too deep’ in war and claims special forces involved in drone attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-blinken-hails-turkish-help-as-grain-export-deal-resumes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-blinken-hails-turkish-help-as-grain-export-deal-resumes","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow says UK ‘too deep’ in war and claims special forces involved in drone attack","bodyText":"It is 9pm in Ukraine. Andrei Kelin, the Russian ambassador to the United Kingdom, warned that that the UK was in “too deep” in the war in Ukraine, claiming that he had proof that UK special forces had been involved in a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Crimea. But when pressed to see this proof, Kelin said he handed it over to the British ambassador and that “it will become public pretty soon”, perhaps as soon as tomorrow. The UN nuclear watchdog said on Thursday it found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity at three sites in Ukraine that it inspected at Kyiv’s request, in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs ”strongly condemns” the forced relocation of Ukrainian citizens in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, calling them “deportations” and “war crimes”. Russian authorities in Kherson have been relocating civilians in the region, claiming it is for their safety as Ukrainian forces move closer. One week after Russian authorities relocated 70,000 civilians from the right bank of the Dnieper river to the left bank, Russian authorities said they were moving 70,000 civilians from the left bank to be “temporarily resettled deep into the Kherson region, as well as to other regions of the Russian Federation”. The reason, they said, was “possible damage to the dam of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station”. Ukraine and Russia held another prisoner of war swap today, exchanging 107 service personnel. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed that he will not attend the G20 summit taking place in two weeks in Bali if Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation will be participating in the conference. Lloyd Austin, the US secretary of defence, has said he believes that Ukrainian forces are able to retake Kherson, calling their work “methodical” and “effective”. US embassy officials in Russia today visited the US basketball star Brittney Griner, who is serving a nine-year sentence in a Russian prison. Last week, when a Russian court rejected an appeal by US basketball star Brittney Griner against her nine-year prison sentence, the Biden administration had strong words for Moscow, with Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, calling the rejected appeal “another sham judicial proceeding”. When pressed today, the White House said officials were continuing to work toward a prisoner swap offer with Russia for the release of Griner – but elaborated no further on what that meant, or how soon that could take place. Last week, when a Russian court rejected an appeal by US basketball star Brittney Griner against her nine-year prison sentence, the Biden administration had strong words for Moscow, with Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, calling the rejected appeal “another sham judicial proceeding”. “President Biden has been clear that Brittney should be released immediately,” he said. When pressed today, the White House said officials were continuing to work toward a prisoner swap offer with Russia for the release of Griner – but elaborated no further on what that meant, or how soon that could take place. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, has been in Russian custody since she was arrested on 17 February at a Moscow airport. Russian authorities said they found vape cartridges in her possession that contained cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. She was sentenced on 4 August to nine years in a penal colony. Her family has decried her detention as politically motivated, with many of her supporters raising concerns for her safety, in regards to her race and sexuality. Griner is married to a woman. The US has characterised Griner’s arrest and subsequent sentencing as a “wrongful detention”. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a strong statement against the forced relocation of Ukrainian citizens in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, calling them “deportations” and “war crimes”: Russian authorities in Kherson have been relocating civilians in the region, claiming it is for their safety as Ukrainian forces move closer. One week after Russian authorities relocated 70,000 civilians from the right bank of the Dnieper river to the left bank, Russian authorities said they were moving 70,000 civilians from the left bank to be “temporarily resettled deep into the Kherson region, as well as to other regions of the Russian Federation”. The reason, they said, was “possible damage to the dam of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station”. Now they are saying the relocation is over. Reminder: the act of an occupying force relocating civilians from a territory that the force has occupied is a violation of the Geneva conventions, whatever the purported reason behind it. There have also been reports of Russian forces relocating Ukrainian and Ukrainian children to Russian territories, with no discussion of eventual return. For this reason, media organisations such as the Kyiv Independent have been outspoken about not calling these relocations “evacuations”, as the Russian proxy government is calling them. In an interview with Sky News, Andrei Kelin, the Russian ambassador to the United Kingdom, warned that that the UK was in “too deep” in the war in Ukraine, claiming that he had proof that UK special forces had been involved in a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Crimea. When pressed to see this proof, Kelin said he handed it over to the British ambassador and that “it will become public pretty soon”, perhaps as soon as tomorrow. “It is dangerous because it escalates the situation,” Kelin said. “It can bring us up to the line of I would say no return, return is always possible. But anyway, we should avoid escalation.” Kelin continued: “And this is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means the situation is becoming more and more dangerous.” However, despite Russia’s accusations that the west was “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction”, Kelin said that Moscow would not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. “The nuclear war cannot be won and it should never be fought,” he said. “And we stick strongly to this statement.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed that he will not attend the G20 summit taking place in two weeks in Bali if Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation will be participating in the conference. Today, Zelenskiy said he had a call with Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, where they discussed preparations for the G20 summit, among other things. Russian forces launched three missile and 16 air strikes, and carried out more than 40 multiple launch rocket system attacks on more than 25 settlements today, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. In particular, Pavlohrad in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast and Avdiivka and Vuhledar in Donetsk oblast were hit hard. Lloyd Austin, the US secretary of defence, has said he believes that Ukrainian forces are able to retake Kherson. Austin called their work “methodical” and “effective”: “I certainly believe that they have the capability to do that. And most importantly, the Ukrainians believe that they have the capability to do that.” US embassy officials in Russia today visited the US basketball star Brittney Griner, who is serving a nine-year sentence in a Russian prison. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, has been in custody since she was arrested in February after Russian authorities said they found vape cartridges with less than a gram of hashish oil in them in her luggage. She and her family characterised her arrest and subsequent trial and sentencing as politically motivated. The US has determined that Griner has been “wrongfully detained”. Here’s footage of the prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia that took place today, in which 107 prisoners of war were exchanged between the two countries: More suspicious movement being reported out of the Kherson oblast: The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, today met representatives from the UN and USAid to discuss getting Ukraine through what is predicted to be a long and difficult winter. Already this week, much of the country has suffered from power outages after Russian forces targeted critical infrastructure in missile strikes. Officials expect matters to only get worse. Ukraine and Russia held another prisoner of war swap today, exchanging 107 service personnel: Denis Pushilin, the self-styled leader of the chiefly unrecognised pro-Russia Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), has given more details of the prisoner exchange that has taken place today, according to a report from Tass. It quotes him as saying: Today we are returning 107 of our fighters from Ukrainian dungeons. We are returning to Ukraine the same number of prisoners, mostly military personnel again. Of the total number of released 65 people, they are from the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (LPR). The DPR and LPR were recognised as legitimate authorities by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. The Russian Federation has claimed to have annexed both regions of occupied Ukraine. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, has given more details of those returning to Ukraine. He was quoted by the Kyiv Independent as saying: We’ve managed to exchange those who were seriously wounded in Mariupol … boys with shrapnel wounds in their arms and legs. There are people with amputated limbs and burns, who don’t feel part of their face. He added that 74 soldiers were defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has reacted strongly to the results of the nuclear inspection (see 2.29pm GMT), tweeting that Russia “has confirmed its status of the world’s top liar”. He wrote: The IAEA has checked three Ukrainian facilities in focus of Russian disinfo and found no evidence of any ‘dirty bombs’. I thank Rafael Mariano Grossi for IAEA’s excellent and prompt cooperation which helped counter Russian falsehoods. Russia has confirmed its status of the world’s top liar. The UN nuclear watchdog said on Thursday it found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity at three sites in Ukraine that it inspected at Kyiv’s request, in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. “Our technical and scientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at these three locations,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said, adding that environmental samples taken would be analysed, Reuters reports. Last week Vladimir Putin said Russia knew “about an incident with a so-called ‘dirty bomb’ being prepared”, and that Russia knew “where, generally, it was being prepared”. He gave no evidence of the alleged plot, which he said included the possibility of a device being loaded on to a Tochka-U or other tactical missile, detonated and then “blamed on Russia”. Kyiv has strongly denied the accusations. The Russian state-owned RIA Novosti news agency is reporting that 107 Russian soldiers have been returned from captivity in Ukraine. It quotes the Russian defence ministry as saying: On 3 November, as a result of the negotiation process, 107 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, who were in mortal danger in captivity. RIA reports that the ministry said the soldiers would be taken to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation, and provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance. Russia’s foreign ministry has issued a statement in which it has detailed the demarche given to the British ambassador in Moscow this morning. Deborah Bronnert was greeted by a small anti-British protest when she was summoned to Russia’s foreign ministry this morning. The statement in part says: A strong protest in connection with the British military specialists’ active participation in training and providing supplies to the units of the Ukrainian special operations forces, including with the goal of conducting acts of sabotage at sea, were expressed to the ambassador. Concrete facts of that kind of activities by London were provided. The demarche emphasised that such confrontational actions by the British pose the threat of an escalation and can lead to unpredictable and dangerous consequences. It was pointed out that such hostile provocations were unacceptable and a demand was put forward to stop them immediately. Should these acts of aggression that are fraught with direct implication in the conflict continue, the responsibility for their harmful consequences and the mounting tensions in relations between our countries will lie entirely with the British side. The statement goes on to criticise agreements between London and Kyiv to train navy personnel, lists specific joint training exercises that Russia claims took place in waters off the Ukrainian coast, and alleges: “We have information that the British navy has also transferred a certain number of UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] to Ukraine.” There has been suspicious movement in Kherson that may have some eager to celebrate what appears to be signs of a Russian retreat, but has others urging caution. The Russian flag has been removed from the Kherson regional administration building, located in the west bank area of the city where Ukrainian forces made significant advances a few weeks ago. Russian authorities who have been consistently forcibly relocating civilians in the region, claiming that it is for their safety as Ukrainian forces move closer, are now purportedly halting the relocations. But Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Command, is urging caution, saying Russia’s unusual manoeuvres in Kherson may be a trap to lure in Ukrainian forces. Russian attacks in the Donetsk oblast and Kharkiv oblast have killed at least five civilians in the past day, officials said. The armed forces of Ukraine are estimating that about 730 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday alone, bringing the total to 68,900 personnel lost so far in the invasion of Ukraine. Switzerland has committed to providing $106m for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure recovery. The White House has accused North Korea of covertly shipping a “significant number” of artillery shells to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine amid mounting evidence of shortages for key weapons systems. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she hoped that Elon Musk’s tweet about a peace deal to end the war with Russia was a “chance mistake”. “He supported Ukraine from the very first day and that’s why Ukrainians really admired him,” Zelenska told the Guardian in an interview at the Web Summit in Lisbon. “So it was extremely sensitive for us to read the tweet. Let’s be honest, even the smartest person can’t say the smartest things 24 hours a day. There are mistakes. And we hope it was a chance mistake.” Here are some of the latest images we have been sent over the newswires from the war in Ukraine and beyond. The White House has accused North Korea of covertly shipping a “significant number” of artillery shells to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine amid mounting evidence of shortages for key weapons systems. US National security council spokesperson John Kirby said the US believed North Korea “is covertly supplying” the ammunition to Russia and “trying to make it appear as though they are being sent to countries in the Middle East or north Africa”. Kirby declined to provide a specific estimate on the quantity of ammunition being sent to bolster the Russian effort. He said North Korea “is covertly supplying” the ammunition to Russia, adding, “We’re still monitoring this to determine whether the shipments are actually received.” Kirby said the North Korean shipments are “not going to change the course of the war,” citing western efforts to resupply the Ukrainian military. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she hoped that Elon Musk’s tweet about a peace deal to end the war with Russia was a “chance mistake”. Last month, Musk drew the ire of Ukrainians when he suggested in a tweet that a Ukraine-Russia peace deal should include formally annexing Crimea to Russia and holding UN-supervised elections in four Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine. Musk later denied a report that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin before floating the plan that he had presented as a Twitter poll. “He supported Ukraine from the very first day and that’s why Ukrainians really admired him,” Zelenska told the Guardian in an interview at the Web Summit in Lisbon. “So it was extremely sensitive for us to read the tweet. Let’s be honest, even the smartest person can’t say the smartest things 24 hours a day. There are mistakes. And we hope it was a chance mistake.” Read more here: The goings-on in Kherson – the removal of Russian flags, the forced relocation of civilians, then the purported halted relocation of civilians – have been raising eyebrows among Ukrainian forces.

Russian attacks in the Donetsk oblast and Kharkiv oblast have killed at least five civilians in the past day, officials said. In Donetsk, Russian forces killed three civilians in Bakhmut and one in Avdiivka, two strategically placed towns in Ukraine’s industrial heartland of Donbas, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk oblast. Bakhmut in particular has been hit hard in the past few weeks. At least five people in the region were injured, Kyrylenko said. Russian shelling also damaged power grids in Kurakhovo and two private houses in Zoryanye. There was intense shelling during the night on the outskirts of the Toretsk and Svitlodar communities and in the Soledar community, and six private houses were damaged in Rozdolivka. In the Kharkiv oblast, Russian shelling on the city of Kupiansk killed an 82-year-old woman, said Oleh Syniehubov, the governor of Kharkiv oblast. In addition to Kupiansk, Russian forces shelled Vovchansk, the village of Dvorichna and other settlements of Kupiansk, as well as Kharkiv city and Chuguyiv district, damaging residential buildings and public buildings. Three Russian missiles struck Kharkiv city, damaging an economic building and a trolley bus. There were no casualties from the missile strikes, Syniehubov said. Switzerland has committed to providing $106m for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure recovery. The Russian flag has been removed from the Kherson regional administration building, located in the west bank area of the city where Ukrainian forces made significant advances a few weeks ago. Russian forces moved their regional headquarters across the Dnieper River to the left bank are of Kherson city, according to Ukraine’s Centre of National Resistance under Ukraine’s ministry of defence. Russians are still holding their positions along their second line of defence, according to both sides. Russia has been moving residents out of occupied Kherson, claiming that Ukraine is planning to intentionally flood the region by hitting a dam in the Dnieper. Ukraine says Russia is planning to stage a false flag attack and flood the region itself. The Russian delegation resumed work at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) that runs the Black Sea grain deal operations in Istanbul and joined vessel inspections on Thursday, the UN secretariat at the centre said. It said the queue for inspections has been significantly reduced, with more than 120 ships waiting to move, mainly those planning an inbound voyage. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had said on Wednesday that Moscow would rejoin the grain export deal brokered by the UN and Turkey with Ukraine, but that it reserved the right to withdraw if necessary. “We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like this would happen again, that the humanitarian corridors would not be used militarily,” Putin said during a video meeting with his coordination council on Wednesday. Russia on Thursday urged the UN, which sponsored the deal, to help fulfil the parts of the deal intended to ease Russia’s food and fertiliser exports. “We still do not see any results regarding a second aspect: the removal of obstacles to the export of Russian fertilisers and grain,” the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told a news conference in Amman, Jordan. Russian agricultural exports do not fall explicitly under sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February, but Moscow says they are badly hindered by the restrictions imposed on its financial, logistics and insurance sectors. A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson said that, contrary to Russian claims, Ukraine had made no new commitments beyond the terms originally signed in July. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed Moscow’s humiliating U-turn and hailed “a significant diplomatic result for our country and the whole world”. He said in his Wednesday evening address: “Implementation of the grain export initiative continues. The Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. This shows both the failure of the Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united.” Ukraine’s grid operator Ukrenergo said Russian missile attacks hit energy infrastructure in the Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk late on Wednesday, further complicating the work of the energy system. Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Dnipropetrovsk region, described “a tense night of massive attacks” but said on Thursday morning there were no known casualties. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high-voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, according to the Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom. There are unverified images circulating on social media that appear to show that the Russian flag has been taken down from the city council building in the occupied city of Kherson. One of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupying authorities, Kirill Stremousov, posted to Telegram encouraging further civilian “evacuations” from the city – a move that has been described by Kyiv as forced deportations. A small anti-British protest in Moscow greeted the British ambassador Deborah Bronnert after she was summoned by Russia’s foreign ministry. Bronnert was summoned to discuss Moscow’s claims that Britain was involved in a Ukrainian drone strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Crimea, claims that have been dismissed out of hand by the British government. Hungary’s parliament will decide on when to schedule a debate on the ratification of Finland’s and Sweden’s applications to join Nato, its foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, told a press conference this morning. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. Vivian Ho will be with you shortly. Ukraine’s grid operator Ukrenergo has confirmed that Russian missile attacks hit energy infrastructure in the Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk late on Wednesday, further complicating the work of repairing the energy system, Reuters reports. Zaporizhzhia is one of the regions that Russia has claimed to annex, despite not fully occupying the territory there. The Russian delegation resumed work at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) that runs the Black Sea grain deal operations in Istanbul and joined vessel inspections on Thursday, the UN secretariat at the centre said. Reuters report it said the queue for inspections has been significantly reduced, with currently over 120 ships waiting to move, mainly those planning an inbound voyage. There are unverified images circulating on social media which appear to show that the Russian flag has been taken down from the city council building in the occupied city of Kherson. One of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupying authorities, Kirill Stremousov, posted to Telegram a short while ago encouraging further civilian “evacuations” from the city – a move that has been described by Kyiv as forced deportations. He wrote: The remaining residents of Kherson put themselves in danger. The Nazis, with the help of American weapons, do not stop shelling the peaceful infrastructure of the city. Residents of Kherson may continue to evacuate from the right-bank part of the Kherson region. The movement of civilian vehicles from the right to the left bank of the Dnipro will continue and will be carried out in the same way as before – through Rechport. You can go to the left bank of the Dnipro from there by water transport, as well as cross by private car by barge. The temporary cessation of transport communication will not affect the provision of the right bank of the Kherson region with food and essential goods. The supply of Kherson and settlements of the region will be carried out as before. Patrick Revell, a reporter for US news network ABC, says that in a video posted by Stremousov, he appeared to suggest that Russian forces may be staging a pullback across the river away from the city. Russia has urged the United Nations, which sponsored a deal to free Ukraine’s grain shipments from a Russian blockade of its Black Sea ports, to help fulfil the parts of the deal intended to ease Russia’s food and fertiliser exports. The arrangement is due to expire on 19 November, and Reuters reports Moscow has made clear it does not believe enough has been done to ensure it can export its own huge food and fertiliser output despite the barrage of western sanctions imposed in response to its invasion of Ukraine. “We still do not see any results regarding a second aspect: the removal of obstacles to the export of Russian fertilisers and grain,” the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told a news conference in Amman, Jordan. “We have once again called on the United Nations secretary general to ensure that he fulfils the obligations he agreed to through his own initiative,” Lavrov added. He said the situation needed to be resolved “in the very near future”. “If we’re talking about the volumes of fertilisers and grain in question, then these volumes from the Russian side are incomparably higher than from the Ukrainian side.” Russian agricultural exports do not fall explicitly under sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February, but Moscow says they are badly hindered by the restrictions imposed on its financial, logistics and insurance sectors. Here are some of the latest images we have been sent over the newswires from the war in Ukraine and beyond. Hungary’s parliament will decide on when to schedule a debate on the ratification of Finland’s and Sweden’s applications to join Nato, its foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, told a press conference this morning, Reuters reports. Szijjarto said the government had done its job by submitting the relevant bill to parliament. Hungary and Turkey are the only members not to have ratified the applications. A small anti-British protest in Moscow appears to have greeted the British ambassador Deborah Bronnert after she was summoned by Russia’s foreign ministry. Reuters reports that the ambassador was in the ministry for about 30 minutes. There was no immediate statement from either Russia or Britain on the details of what was discussed. Ukraine has made no new commitments that go beyond the terms of a deal signed in July to free up grain exports from its Black Sea ports after Russia’s invasion, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Thursday. Reuters reports that Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook that Ukraine had never used the Black Sea grain corridor for military purposes, and had never intended to do so. Russia had attempted yesterday to present its return to the deal as a result of receiving guarantees from Ukraine after a weekend attack on the Black Sea fleet at Sevastopol. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, said the evening passed quietly in his region with no air alarms. Similarly, Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, the governor of Sumy, said it was a quiet night. But the same was not true of Dnipropetrovsk oblast, where the governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, described “a tense night of massive attacks”. In a message on Telegram, he told residents: Our guys sent another flock of enemy drones to rest. The Russians struck the energy and water infrastructure facilities in Kryvyi Rih. There is serious destruction. All services are working. In Pavlohrad, the enemy targeted an industrial enterprise. Restoration work is ongoing. In the Nikopol region … shells damaged housing, a college, a furniture factory, and an industrial enterprise. Fortunately, there were no casualties or injuries everywhere. The Russian-imposed leader in Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, has reported that Ukrainian forces have destroyed the administration building in Hola Prystan, which is on the south bank of the Dnieper River. The Russian news agency Interfax quotes Stremousov from a video posted to Telegram in which he said: “No one was injured during the shelling, as the shelling took place at night. But the administration building was completely destroyed.” He again told residents in occupied Kherson – one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia has claimed to annex – that they should move from the right bank to the left bank of the Dnieper. Russian-imposed authorities have been describing this as an evacuation, while authorities in Kyiv have described it as a forced deportation of the civilian population in Kherson. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has issued its daily operational briefing. In it, the DPR claims that 11 settlements it occupies in Ukraine were fired on by Ukrainian forces in the last 24 hours. It claims three civilians were killed and two injured, and that 14 “housing constructions” and two “civil infrastructures” were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. The DPR is only recognised as a legitimate authority by three UN member states – Russia, Syria and North Korea – and is one of the occupied regions of Ukraine which Russia has claimed to annex. Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Dnipropetrovsk oblast, has posted to Telegram to say the region is experiencing scheduled power blackouts. “Damaged by enemy attacks, the system cannot cope with the load,” he says. Seven ships carrying agricultural products left Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Thursday, a day after the resumption of a grain deal aimed at delivering Ukrainian food to foreign markets, the infrastructure ministry said. Reuters reports that the ministry said the vessels were loaded with 290,000 tonnes of food products and were headed towards European and Asian countries, without elaborating further. Reuters reports that the British ambassador arrived at the Russian foreign ministry on Thursday morning, according to local reports. Deborah Bronnert was summoned to discuss Moscow’s claims that Britain was involved in a Ukrainian drone strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Crimea. Electricity supply has been restored to everybody in the Kyiv region after Monday’s Russian bombardment of energy facilities, according to the region’s governor, Oleksiy Kuleba. Despite that, the governor also said planned stabilisation outages started from 5am, saying: “This is necessary to reduce the load on networks and avoid emergency situations.” This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Russia’s grain deal U-turn offers a lesson in calling Vladimir Putin’s bluff, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth reports. In the end, Vladimir Putin backed down. Faced with blocking ships carrying grain from Ukraine or tacitly admitting that his threats to do so had been a bluff, the Kremlin leader opted not to rekindle a global food crisis. Russia’s exit from the deal that allowed exports of grain from Ukraine through the Black Sea was weeks in the making. Russia had threatened to do so after an explosion rocked the Crimea Bridge in October, and again after the drone attack on its Black Sea fleet last week. But once Russia finally suspended the deal, it quickly became clear that Moscow had no plan. Read the full story below: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has hailed Russia’s turnaround in rejoining the UN-backed grain export deal, just days after the Kremlin threatened to pull out, as a “significant diplomatic outcome” for Ukraine and the “whole world”. “Implementation of the grain export initiative will continue,” Zelenskiy said in his Wednesday evening address. Russia initially said it would abandon the brokered deal that allowed exports of grain from Ukraine through the Black Sea, following a dramatic drone attack on its warships in the port of Sevastopol. Russia’s defence ministry said it was satisfied it had received “sufficient” guarantees from Kyiv that it would not use the maritime corridor to carry out attacks. “We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like this would happen again, that the humanitarian corridors would not be used militarily,” Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said during a video meeting with his coordination council on Wednesday. However, Zelenskiy said the Kremlin’s call for guarantees showed “the failure of the Russian aggression”, noting: “Russian blackmail has led nowhere”. After eight months of war “the Kremlin is saying that they demanded security guarantees from Ukraine”, he said. “Two hundred and fifty two days ago Russia demanded security guarantees from the United States of America. “These are really striking changes. This shows both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong you and I are when we remain united.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken has shared his gratitude to Turkey’s leadership for facilitating Russia’s return to the UN-backed Ukraine grain export deal. We are grateful for the active role of the UN and our Turkish allies in facilitating Russia’s return to the Black Sea Grain Initiative. We urge all parties to renew the Initiative. Failure to do so would hurt the world’s most vulnerable.” Russian officials have reportedly announced that Moscow-installed authorities have begun integrating the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into the jurisdiction of Russian nuclear power plant operator Rosenergoatom. Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of Rosenergoatom, said the transition would occur after the plant uses up all available fuel reserves. The integration of the plant and its personnel into the jurisdiction of Rosenergoatom has begun, the Russian-installed head of the the adjacent city of Energodar, Alexander Volga, told Ukraina.ru. After the arrival of the operating organisation from the Russian Federation, work began on integrating the plant and the personnel themselves into the jurisdiction of the Rosenergoatom concern. The people who remained decided on the choice of the country in which they would live. Residents chose Russia as their place of residence, place of work. ZNPP is already an integral part of Russia.” Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrey Rudenko, claimed that ZNPP personnel who are “critical for the work of the ZNPP” signed contracts with Rosenergoatom and that Russian authorities are exploring the creation of a security zone around the ZNPP, according to a recent report released by the institute for the study of war. Ukraine’s Energoatom stated on 28 October that only 100 of the 6,700 Ukrainian personnel remaining at the ZNPP plant have signed new contracts with the Russian energy agency Rosatom (out of 11,000 personnel before 24 February). The Ukrainian State Inspectorate of Nuclear Regulation stated that Russian forces built an unknown structure at one of seven spent nuclear fuel storage sites at the ZNPP in violation of nuclear safety standards. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high-voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, according to the Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom. Energodar’s mayor, Dmytro Orlov. wrote in a Telegram update early this morning: Yesterday, November 2, 2022, as a result of racist shelling, the last two high-voltage communication lines of the Zaporizhia NPP with the Ukrainian power system were damaged. At 11.04pm, the station went into full blackout mode. All 20 diesel generators were switched on. Currently, the power supply scheme for ZNPP’s own needs is optimised, 9 diesel generators are left in operation. Power units 5 and 6 are transferred to a cold state. Fuel for the operation of diesel generators in the mode of complete blackout of the ZNPP remains for 15 days. The countdown has begun.” The power plant has 15 days’ worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said. The plant’s blocks 5 and 6 are being switched into cold state, it added. Orlov said that due to the occupation of the plant, the possibility of maintaining the ZNPP in a safe mode were “significantly limited”. The Kremlin has said it will rejoin the UN-administered grain export corridor from Ukraine, after pulling out over the weekend following a drone attack on Russian warships in the port of Sevastopol. Moscow’s humiliating climbdown came two days after a large convoy of ships moved a record amount of grain in defiance of Russia’s warnings that it would be unsafe without its participation, and after high-level diplomatic contacts between Turkey – one of the guarantors of the scheme with the UN – and Russia. Russia’s withdrawal had reignited fears over global hunger and high food prices that had been alleviated by the inauguration of the scheme earlier this year, which allowed cargo ships to move Ukrainian gain without fear of being targeted. The Russian defence ministry said on Wednesday it had received written guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia. “The Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,” the ministry statement said. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, confirmed the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, had told his Turkish counterpart that the 22 July grain deal brokered by Turkey and the UN would continue to operate as of midday on Wednesday. Erdoğan will be seen as having successfully called the Russian bluff to blockade Ukrainian ports or even sink civilian cargo ships carrying grain abroad. The Turkish leader had said exports of grain from Ukraine would continue with or without Russian approval and appears to have brokered the Russian climbdown. “The grain transports will continue as agreed before as of 12pm today,” said Erdoğan, who has emerged as a key intermediary between Kyiv and Moscow. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukraine’s grain export deal is set to resume just days after Russia suspended its involvement and threatened to withdraw. The UN coordinator for the deal said he expects loaded ships to depart Ukrainian ports on Thursday. If you have an update or any feedback to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Moscow would rejoin the grain export deal brokered by the UN and Turkey with Ukraine, but that it reserved the right to withdraw if necessary. “We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like this would happen again, that the humanitarian corridors would not be used militarily,” Putin said during a video meeting with his coordination council on Wednesday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed Moscow’s humiliating U-turn and hailed “a significant diplomatic result for our country and the whole world”. “Implementation of the grain export initiative continues,” he said in his Wednesday evening address. “The Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. This shows both the failure of the Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united”. The United States also welcomed the restoration of the deal and urged Russia to renew it later this month. State department spokesperson Ned Price praised UN and Turkish mediators but said it was important that the deal is “not only set back in motion, but it’s renewed later this month.” Secretary of state Antony Blinken thanked Turkey for its efforts and emphasised reminded Moscow of the “importance of continued adherence to UN-brokered agreements and its commitments to support global food security,” a statement said. A large convoy of ships moved a record amount of grain in defiance of Russia’s warnings that it would be unsafe without its participation. The Russian defence ministry said it had received written guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said exports of grain from Ukraine would continue with or without Russian approval and appears to have brokered the Russian climbdown. Zelenskiy thanked Erdoğan for his role in restoring the deal. A Russian jet fired two cruise missiles that flew over the Black Sea corridor being used to export Ukrainian grain on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said in a video address. “Every one of these Russian launches – and they occur almost daily – directly threatens food exports,” he said. Russia said it was fully committed to preventing nuclear war, and that avoiding a clash among countries that have nuclear weapons was its highest priority. The Russian foreign ministry said it feared the five declared nuclear powers were teetering “on the brink of a direct armed conflict” and that the west must stop “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences”. The White House has accused North Korea of covertly shipping a “significant number” of artillery shells to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine amid mounting evidence of shortages for key weapons systems. US National security council spokesperson John Kirby said the US believed North Korea “is covertly supplying” the ammunition to Russia and “trying to make it appear as though they are being sent to countries in the Middle East or north Africa”. Putin called for weapons used by Russia’s military to be modernised during a meeting of his coordination council on Wednesday. “Weapons must constantly, continuously improve and remain effective. To achieve this, I repeat, it is important to ensure that there is active competition between manufacturers and developers,” he said. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region have proceeded with a drive to persuade residents to evacuate. Residents who had collaborated with occupying forces were leaving and some departing medical staff had taken equipment from hospitals, the statement said, a statement released by the Ukrainian military said on Wednesday night. Residents of the town of Nova Zburivka in Kherson region had been given three days to leave and told that evacuation would be obligatory from 5 November. Moscow said it would summon the UK ambassador to Russia, Deborah Bronnert, over its accusation, that is unsubstantiated, that “British specialists” were involved in the Sevastopol attack. The UN security council has overwhelmingly rejected Russia’s attempt to establish a commission to investigate its unfounded claims that Ukraine and the United States are carrying out “military biological” activities that violate the convention prohibiting the use of biological weapons. Details have been published of the damage caused to the Nord Stream gas pipeline by explosions at the end of September. Nord Stream AG said that about 250 metres (820ft) of the pipeline in the Baltic Sea was “destroyed”. Two Russian oligarchs and business partners of Roman Abramovich have been added to the UK government’s sanctions list. Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov, whom the UK government said were “known to be business associates” of the former Chelsea FC owner, were on Wednesday among four new Russian steel and petrochemical tycoons added to the sanctions list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/sep/21/what-caused-the-uks-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-21T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"What caused the UK’s energy crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/21/what-caused-the-uks-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/sep/21/what-caused-the-uks-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"What caused the UK’s energy crisis?","bodyText":"The UK’s energy system has been plunged into chaos by a perfect storm of market forces which threatens to rip through the economy from home energy suppliers to heavy industry, and from factories to farmers. This has stoked fears that a wave of energy suppliers will collapse, and that households will be saddled with unaffordable bills. As the colder weather draws in, these are the factors shaping the energy crisis. China’s post-Covid bounce back China’s appetite for energy is always a key driver of global market prices. In 2021 its post-Covid economic ramp-up has coincided with an uptick in demand across Asia and Europe too. As economies begin to recover from the fallout of the pandemic, countries across the northern hemisphere, which experienced a long, cold winter in 2020-21 that depleted gas storage levels, have been left scrabbling to secure supplies. Gas prices in the UK have more than quadrupled over the last year to highs of 180 pence per therm, from around 40p/th this time last year. In the last month alone, prices have climbed by 70%. Market experts at S&amp;P Global Platts said earlier this year that China’s demand for gas was likely to rise to 360 billion cubic metres (Bcm) this year, up 8.4% from an estimated 332 Bcm in 2020. To satisfy its record demand for gas, China’s imports of gas via super-chilled tankers was expected to surge by almost a fifth, meaning fewer shipments travelling to Europe from countries such as Qatar. Russian gas games As shipments of gas have turned from Europe towards China, flows of pipeline gas to Europe from Russia have failed to make up the shortfall. On Monday gas prices across Europe surged by another 10% after Russia’s state-backed gas company, Gazprom, refused to increase its exports to Europe – despite record-high prices across the continent. The company has met its contractual obligations for gas delivery over recent months but Gazprom has come under fierce criticism for appearing to send little extra to help meet the enormous demand in Europe. EU lawmakers have called on the European Commission to investigate whether the company’s behaviour has been designed to keep market prices high, and put pressure on regulators to approve of its controversial plans to build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major gas line which would double its capacity to send gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea. Nord Stream 2 has faced US sanctions and provoked concern that the EU would increase its reliance on energy imports from Russia. Generation gap The global gas crunch is particularly bad news for the UK. Around half of the UK’s electricity is generated by burning fossil fuel in gas-fired power plants, a trend which has become more deeply entrenched over recent months after a string of problems in the UK electricity system. Ageing nuclear power plants have been forced to undertake unplanned outages for maintenance, a main power cable used to import electricity from France has shut down after a fire, and the UK’s wind turbines have slowed during some of the least windy months since 1961. The UK also relies heavily on gas for home heating and cooking. Yet despite the obvious reliance on fossil fuels for electricity, homes and in heavy industry, the UK has some of the lowest amounts of gas storage capabilities in Europe, leaving the market uniquely exposed to the supply crunch. Less than 1% of Europe’s stored gas is held by the UK. Britain has been forced to temporarily fire up coal power stations, paying millions of pounds to the likes of Drax in North Yorkshire, to plug some of this power shortfall. That fragile system faces further challenges in the years ahead, with most of the UK’s nuclear power plants, which supply up to 20% of electricity, to close by the end of the decade. Just one new nuclear power station, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, is being built to replace them. Uncapped entry to a capped energy market The UK can expect scores of suppliers to fold over the coming winter, leaving millions forced to switch to a new, more expensive supplier, as the government’s policy of tough regulation on prices collides with loose rules on which companies can join the market. The energy price cap sets out a maximum level for default energy tariffs twice a year based on the cost of supplying energy. It is to rise by more than 12% from 1 October and is likely to rise again next April. But the hikes will not come fast enough for dozens of small energy suppliers which don’t have deep enough pockets to survive the wait until the next cap increase. Many small suppliers joined the market after the regulator dropped the barriers to entry for the energy supply market in 2014 to make it easier for entrepreneurs to set up an energy company without strong links to big banks and investors. It was designed to increase competition for the legacy Big Six suppliers, and caused the market to swell from less than a dozen to about 70 at the beginning of the year. The regulator has already backtracked on the scheme, setting tougher financial stress tests for companies which hope to become energy suppliers. But the energy crisis may rewind seven years of loose regulation over six months, which some fear may leave only 10 suppliers standing by spring. Fossil-fuel heavy industry The impact of the energy crisis will not be contained to rising energy bills and struggling suppliers. Large steelmakers, chemical factories and manufacturers are all vulnerable to the impact of energy costs and are already feeling the financial pain of the energy price shock. The steel industry association UK Steel has warned that steelmakers are already halting work during the hours of peak power demand to avoid record high prices. The soaring cost of gas has caused two fertiliser companies in Teesside and Cheshire to shut for the winter, and another in Hull to reduce production by 40%. This has knock-on effects for farming, meat production and the food and drinks industry. One of the byproducts of fertiliser factories is carbon dioxide which is used to make fizzy drinks and dry ice to keep food cold during transport. It is also used in abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter. The government faces rising calls to tackle the problem of unaffordable energy before it erodes the UK’s post-Covid economic recovery. The UK may not run out of gas, but running out of affordable gas would be problematic too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/01/ukraine-russia-peace-talks-continue-amid-fresh-bid-to-help-mariupol-residents-flee","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T07:38:23Z","webTitle":"Mariupol officials say Russians blocking aid reaching besieged Ukraine city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/ukraine-russia-peace-talks-continue-amid-fresh-bid-to-help-mariupol-residents-flee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/01/ukraine-russia-peace-talks-continue-amid-fresh-bid-to-help-mariupol-residents-flee","fields":{"headline":"Mariupol officials say Russians blocking aid reaching besieged Ukraine city","bodyText":"An aide to the mayor of Mariupol has said the besieged southern Ukrainian city remains closed for anyone trying to enter and is “very dangerous” for anyone trying to leave. Petro Andryushchenko said Russian forces had since Thursday been preventing even the smallest amount of humanitarian supplies reaching trapped residents, making clear a planned “humanitarian corridor” had not been opened. “The city remains closed to entry and very dangerous to exit with personal transport,” he said on the Telegram messaging app on Friday. “In addition, since yesterday the occupiers have categorically not allowed any humanitarian aid – even in small quantities – into the city.” A convoy of buses that set out for Mariupol did not reach the city, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday evening. Russia had promised a limited ceasefire along the route from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Repeated efforts to set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of up to 170,000 people who remain in Mariupol, which has suffered four weeks of bombardment and dwindling supplies, have failed. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of shelling supposedly safe routes outside of several fighting hotspots, claims that Moscow denies. In other developments, peace talks were due to resume by video on Friday, the Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said, focusing on the peace framework Kyiv presented during a face-to-face meeting in Istanbul this week that Moscow described as constructive. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, further upped the diplomatic stakes, signing a decree requiring foreign buyers to pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday or have their energy contracts halted – a demand Germany, France and the UK instantly rejected and that Berlin described as blackmail. The move follows “a personal request from the French president and German chancellor to Russian president Vladimir Putin”, said Russia’s defence ministry. On Thursday night, Volodymyr Zelenskiy repeated his warning that Russia was preparing for “powerful strikes” in the Donbas region after appearing to withdraw from an assault on Kyiv. The Ukrainian president dismissed the withdrawal of Russian forces near Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy as tactical. The Pentagon also said Russia might be repositioning some of its forces to send them to the Donbas. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was pulling forces out of Georgia to reinforce its invasion of Ukraine in a move it said was unplanned and “indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion”. Both the US and UK have suggested Putin is becoming increasingly frustrated, with the US president, Joe Biden, saying Putin “seems to be self-isolated” and noting that “there’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers”, without citing evidence. The White House director of communications, Kate Bedingfield, said the war had been a “strategic disaster” for Russia and it was “working to redefine the initial aims” of the invasion. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Putin was “not the force he used to be” and was “now a man in a cage he built himself”. Despite the ongoing talks, there is mounting western scepticism about Russia’s intentions in the talks, more than five weeks into its invasion of Ukraine. There has been no real sign of the partial military pullback in northern Ukraine it had promised as a goodwill gesture, suggesting the Kremlin may be playing for time. Kyiv’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, insisted, however, that the Kremlin was considering Ukraine’s proposals, which included an international treaty under which Ukraine would remain neutral, with its security guaranteed by third countries. In other developments: The UN atomic watchdog is investigating Ukrainian claims that Russian soldiers occupying Chernobyl nuclear power station left after receiving high doses of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it could not confirm the claims by the Ukrainian state power company Energoatom and was seeking an independent assessment. Australia is to send Bushmaster armoured vehicles to Ukraine following an address to MPs by Zelenskiy. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said: “We will send our armoured vehicles, Bushmasters … and we will fly them over in our C-17s to make sure they can be there to support [Ukraine].” Morrison suggested further aid would follow. EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions. EU officials close to the preparations of the summit said any help given to Russia would damage China’s international reputation and jeopardise relations with its biggest trade partners – Europe and the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jan/31/uk-food-and-drink-firms-warn-of-shortages-bailout-c02-industry-ends-meat-beer","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-31T18:16:22Z","webTitle":"UK food and drink firms warn of shortages as ‘bailout’ of C02 industry ends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/uk-food-and-drink-firms-warn-of-shortages-bailout-c02-industry-ends-meat-beer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jan/31/uk-food-and-drink-firms-warn-of-shortages-bailout-c02-industry-ends-meat-beer","fields":{"headline":"UK food and drink firms warn of shortages as ‘bailout’ of CO2 industry ends","bodyText":"UK food producers and brewers have warned of shortages of meat, beer and fizzy drinks, as well as higher prices, after the government opted not to renew support for the carbon dioxide industry. Meat processors, brewers, bakers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is also required for the humane slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said last autumn it had brokered a deal between businesses in the CO2 sector, to ensure supplies of the gas to the food and drink industry, as well as hospitals and nuclear power plants. It came after the government was forced to use taxpayer money to fund a short-term bailout for CF Industries, which accounts for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies, to prop up the company and stave off supply chain chaos. CF Fertilisers, which is owned by a private firm in the US, had halted production at two of its plants, Billingham on Teesside and Ince in Cheshire, as a result of rocketing prices of gas required to power its operations. However, the three-month deal came to an end on 31 January, and BEIS said it was now up to the CO2 industry to work together. A spokesperson from the department said: “We welcome industry’s agreement in October to ensure CF Fertilisers on Teesside can continue to operate even during the current period of high global gas prices. It is for the CO2 industry to ensure supplies to UK businesses.” During the three-month deal, customers of CF Fertilisers had agreed to pay a set price for CO2 until at least the end of January. The deal was intended to give the industry time to develop alternative sources of food-grade CO2. The Guardian understands that while some extra production has become available – such as from anaerobic digestion at biomass plants – and there have been extra imports of the gas, this has been limited and food industry remains concerned over the reliability of supply. CF Industries said on Monday that negotiations with its industrial gas customers over pricing agreements were continuing. Industry analysts said continued CO2 availability was reliant on a new deal between CF Industries and UK distributors of the gas, Nippon Gases and Air Liquide. On Friday, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) sent a letter to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the environment secretary, George Eustice, outlining its worries about the impact of further CO2 shortages in the absence of a new industry deal. “It is critical that together we ensure supply can continue and that we build long-term resilience into the production of food-grade CO2,” said Kate Halliwell, the FDF’s chief scientific officer, as she called on ministers to work with industry. Halliwell said that without guaranteed supplies, “this could lead to shortages in the products we find on our supermarket shelves – adding further pressures to families already coping with high food-price inflation”. The British Meat Processors Association said its industry had been assured by government that animal welfare would be a priority, and that supplies to abattoirs would take precedence, along with those to the NHS and the nuclear sector. Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, said the sector needed a long-term solution as it struggles to recover from repeated closures during the pandemic. “After a devastating winter period for our pubs and brewers, ongoing supply chain disruption could add to the burden of additional costs or seriously hinder our recovery as a sector,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/sep/28/carbuncles-king-charles-iii-royal-familys-supertroll-architecture","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T12:04:09Z","webTitle":"Carbuncles and King Charles: was the royal family’s meddling supertroll right about architecture?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/28/carbuncles-king-charles-iii-royal-familys-supertroll-architecture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/28/carbuncles-king-charles-iii-royal-familys-supertroll-architecture","fields":{"headline":"Carbuncles and King Charles: was the royal family’s meddling supertroll right about architecture?","bodyText":"‘The most prominent architecture critic in the world” is how the New York Times once described King Charles III. It was 1989, and the then Prince of Wales was enjoying a wave of publicity after the launch of his spiritual crusade against the heresies of modern architecture. It was a high-profile, three-pronged attack, comprising a prime-time 75-minute BBC documentary, a dedicated V&amp;A exhibition, and an accompanying coffee table book, grandly titled A Vision of Britain. As architecture criticism goes, it was an unprecedented assault. “The prince’s performance, even sermon, was startling by television standards,” wrote critic Charles Jencks, “and I don’t know of any comparable use of the medium in our time. He looked straight into the camera, and six million viewers’ eyes, and told them what was wrong with them and what they should do about it.” The prince relished his position as the high priest of taste. He gleefully scolded the royally chartered professions of architecture and town planning for creating “godforsaken cities” littered with “huge, blank and impersonal” buildings. His words were carefully tuned to grab headlines. Birmingham city centre was damned as “a monstrous concrete maze,” with a library that looked like “a place where books are incinerated, not kept”. The brutalist National Theatre on the South Bank was “a clever way of building a nuclear power station in the middle of London”. The British Library looked “more like the assembly hall of an academy for secret police”. Like an accomplished shitposting troll, the prince knew how to rile his targets. He had tested his strategy a few years earlier, in an address to the Royal Institute of British Architects, on the occasion of its 150th birthday. Styling himself as a defender of popular opinion, he chided the audience for “ignoring the feelings and wishes of the mass of ordinary people in this country,” and famously damned a proposed glass and steel extension to the National Gallery as “a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend,” nixing the scheme in the process. Four decades on, the c-word continues to be hurled by outraged local residents at everything from luxury flats in York to a station revamp in Lowestoft. To further his campaign, the prince launched an architecture magazine, Perspectives (which folded four years later), and founded his own architecture institute, to teach “the spiritual harmony of classical form”. Over time, his opinions made him an unofficial, and undemocratic, part of the planning process. His comment that a City office tower by Mies van der Rohe would be a “glass stump” saw the project canned; his criticism of an Arup masterplan for Paternoster Square as “half-hearted and grudging” signed its death warrant; and he scuppered several proposals by his bete noire, Richard Rogers, most notably Chelsea Barracks – writing to its Qatari royal developer, Sheikh Hamad, that “quite frankly, my heart sank when I saw the plans”. But these interventions sometimes had welcome consequences. Where the mute Miesian slab would have risen, identical to his towers the world over, we instead have the riotous No 1 Poultry, designed by James Stirling and Michael Wilford, like a slice of candy-striped stone battenberg, listed in 2016. The mixed-use, mid-rise Paternoster Square is arguably an improvement on Arup’s office behemoth. And instead of ABK’s National Gallery extension – which the prince described, not inaccurately, as “a kind of municipal fire station, complete with the sort of tower that contains the siren” – stands the Sainsbury Wing, designed by American PoMo doyens Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown as a witty riff on its neoclassical neighbour, listed in 2018. The building is now subject to a fervent campaign to save it from a mindless modernist makeover by Annabelle Selldorf (purveyor of “facelifts for failing museums,” in the words of one critic). Ironically, the pleas for protection are coming from the very same people who railed against the prince’s interventions in the first place. Which raises the question: might Charles have been right about some things all along? Just as postmodernism has undergone a reappraisal in recent years, is it time to look again at some of his outsider views? And could a king with strong opinions about the built environment turn out to be an unexpected boon? During his decades-long apprenticeship to accede the throne, Charles was always typecast as the comedy villain of architecture, chief agitator in the “style wars” between Mods and Trads. His outbursts were dismissed as illiterate, his Poundbury development in Dorset ridiculed as the kitsch folly of a duke, like Marie Antoinette playing peasant with her rustic hamlet at Versailles. His pleas for traditional building were deemed as harebrained as his passion for organic farming and alternative medicine. But, if you read his 1984 “carbuncle” speech in full, what follows might come as a surprise. Far from issuing a decree for more corinthian columns and pumped-up pediments, he outlines principles that are now found in practically every best-practice design guide. He argues for the retention and rehabilitation of existing buildings; increased accessibility for disabled people; the importance of community consultation and resident-led housing cooperatives; restoring historic street patterns and reviving traditional housing types, such as terraces and courtyards. He even advocates arches, predicting the design trend that has recently swept our cities and inundated the pages of design website Dezeen. Most striking, however – and most hard to stomach for critics (myself included) – is how his own Duchy of Cornwall developments, just like his approach to farming, preempted what has now become accepted thinking. Visit Poundbury today and you will find a place that combines housing, startup workspace and industry, a world away from the monocultural dormitory suburbs churned out by Britain’s volume housebuilders. Along with 2,260 homes, there are now 240 businesses employing over 2,400 people, ranging from an electric bike workshop to a tech company making components for plane wings, with a high-level cancer research and treatment institute on the way. Affordable housing makes up 35%, scattered “tenure-blind” throughout the development, while photovoltaic slates dot the rooftops, EV charging points line the walkable streets, and gas comes from a biomethane digestion plant on a nearby farm, powered by locally grown grass and maize. The architecture may offend those who still cling to a moral position of “honesty”, but it is more varied than any new-build suburb in the country, ranging from arts and crafts terraces to Scots-baronial courtyards, Palladian apartments to fake Victorian warehouse conversions, arranged along irregular winding streets, designed to slow traffic. It’s a place where the designers have clearly had fun rifling through the pattern books. As one Poundbury architect told me: “HRH loves things that are quirky.” When shown a colour palette, his response was: “Make them bolder.” (That explains the miniature pink gothic castle, then.) Of course there are shortcomings. While each neighbourhood is planned to be a five-minute walk to its centre, cars still clog the streets. The main public space, Queen Mother Square, is essentially a car park for the neoclassical Waitrose. The professed use of “traditional materials” rings hollow when you realise that some of the decorative metalwork is painted fibreglass, the stone is reconstituted, and behind the quaint facades are the usual breeze blocks. But no housing estate is built any differently – and few come with their own 30-acre “Great Field”, with wild flower meadows, play areas, an amphitheatre and allotments. The principles are now being rolled out on an even bigger scale in Nansledan, a Duchy development near Newquay, where 4,000 homes will be built, along less fussy lines than Poundbury. Here, the mandate for local materials means slate roofs and granite kerbs come from nearby quarries, increasing employment and boosting local supply chains. Younger residents have flocked here, drawn by the environmental ethos, which includes edible gardens planted outside the homes. As the Times observed of the young people, somewhat bemused: “They don’t find anything odd about the prince’s much-lampooned ‘holistic’ approach; on the contrary, they seem to love it.” The same is true at Poundbury: on a recent visit, millennial hipsters appeared to outnumber pensioners. As king, Charles III has promised he will hold his tongue. Yet, when the Guardian requested access to his lobbying letters in 2012, the Conservative attorney general refused, explaining that a monarch has not just a right but a “duty” to make his views known to the government. That may come back to bite them. In the face of a wilfully retrograde Tory cabinet, bent on burning fossil fuels, lining developers’ pockets and deregulating the planning system, the presence of a climate-conscious, conservation-minded, planning-literate king may turn out to be the unlikely voice of sanity we never knew we needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-17T15:12:29Z","webTitle":"UK green economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","fields":{"headline":"UK green economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data","bodyText":"The UK’s low-carbon and renewable energy economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data showing a fall in the number of green jobs. In a blow to the government’s pledge to boost net-zero employment opportunities, the Office for National Statistics said its latest figures, covering 2020, showed “no significant change” in turnover and job numbers in the sector compared with six years earlier. Employment in the low-carbon and renewable energy economy – which includes manufacturing, energy supply and construction – fell by about 28,000 across the UK over the period, to just 207,800. Among the steepest declines were in factories producing energy-efficient products, onshore wind, and solar energy. Trade unions raised questions over the government’s plan to boost Britain’s low-carbon economy after years of limited progress. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the UK had an opportunity to be a pioneer on the path to net zero. “But we will miss out on these opportunities if ministers do not step up public investment and action. And we could see existing jobs lost to other countries who modernise their industry faster,” she added. Although the latest snapshot includes the first year of the coronavirus pandemic – when the British economy plunged into the deepest recession for 100 years – the figures show that in 2019, before the health emergency struck, green business turnover also fell compared with a year earlier. According to the latest data, the sector with the largest growth in jobs was in low-emission vehicles and infrastructure, where employment more than doubled to 19,100. However, this was not enough to offset bigger falls elsewhere, including a decline of more than a quarter, or 32,000, in the number of jobs in energy-efficient product manufacturing. The number of green businesses operating in the UK fell by 13% over the six-year period, while the combined turnover for the low-carbon economy fell by almost 6% to £41.2bn. The ONS said the fall in turnover was largely driven by the energy-efficient products and low-emissions vehicles sectors. The majority of businesses in the low-carbon and renewable energy sectors are in manufacturing and construction, both of which suffered a downturn in 2020. However, it said employment should have been less affected than turnover because the figures included staff on furlough. While green sectors including offshore wind have recorded substantial growth in recent years, with a sharp rise in renewable energy production, critics argue that much of the activity has been driven by foreign companies, with a reliance on the UK importing turbine blades and components manufactured abroad. Boris Johnson announced an ambition in late 2020 to create 250,000 green jobs across the country through a 10-point plan, as part of a wider government drive to hit net zero and embed a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Ministers are seeking to encourage the growth of green jobs in sectors such as offshore wind, including through the creation of freeports in an attempt to boost investment and jobs in the low-carbon economy. However, experts and campaigners have warned the government’s net zero plans lack the required ambition and are not backed up with adequate funding from the Treasury, instead relying on the private sector. A UK government spokesperson said: “Over the last three decades, the UK has achieved record clean growth. Our economy has grown by 77%, while our emissions have decreased by 44% - faster than any other G7 nation. “Against the backdrop of the worst economic recession in a lifetime and an unprecedented pandemic, the low carbon economy has continued to support 430,000 jobs across the UK. We’ve already seen 56,000 jobs created and supported in green sectors last year, including in offshore wind and electric vehicle manufacturing. “As we recover from the pandemic, we are unlocking £90bn of private investment to continue to support the creation of new jobs in new British industries, such as Gigafactories, offshore wind, and nuclear power generation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/26/anne-webster-will-stand-for-nationals-deputy-saying-party-needs-not-just-queensland-leadership","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T22:59:51Z","webTitle":"‘Time for change’: Darren Chester confirms he will challenge Barnaby Joyce for Nationals leadership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/anne-webster-will-stand-for-nationals-deputy-saying-party-needs-not-just-queensland-leadership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/anne-webster-will-stand-for-nationals-deputy-saying-party-needs-not-just-queensland-leadership","fields":{"headline":"‘Time for change’: Darren Chester confirms he will challenge Barnaby Joyce for Nationals leadership","bodyText":"Nationals MP Darren Chester has confirmed he will run for the party’s leadership in a ballot next week, setting up an explosive showdown with his rival Barnaby Joyce - a man Chester once described as “incoherent”. The Nine newspapers reported Chester saying it was “time for a change” in the party, and that the Nationals needed to “take some responsibility for the Liberal losses in the city”. It appeared a clear shot at Joyce, the former deputy prime minister, whose personal unpopularity and reluctance to embrace climate change action was seen as a factor in the heavy toll inflicted on Liberal moderates in inner-city seats. Joyce sacked Chester from his position as veterans affairs minister soon after the spill, in a move that was seen as punishment for supporting McCormack. At the time, Chester claimed the phone call he had with Joyce “was so incoherent yesterday, I couldn’t actually explain what he was even saying to me.” Chester is a more moderate voice than Joyce. He was a supporter of former Nationals leader Michael McCormack in a spill motion in June 2021 that saw Joyce re-elevated to the party leadership. On Friday, Chester told ABC he was “not here to tip a bucket on Barnaby Joyce, he’s our leader and has done the best he can do in that job”. However he said “it’s important we listen to the message we received over the weekend from the Australian people”. “I think they want us to be perhaps more moderate and more respectful in public debates in this country. They want a calmer democracy I guess and I think I can offer that to the room.” On Thursday, Mallee MP Anne Webster said she will run for the deputy leadership of the National party, acknowledging Joyce’s “polarising” style and urging the party to back “stable and reasonable” leadership. “I am definitely sticking my hand up, I have nothing to lose,” Webster told Guardian Australia. Webster said the combination of new MPs and the “caginess” of the existing ones meant she did not know whether she would have support. In a clear reference to the domination of northern interests in the party, Webster said that all regional electorates needed Nationals leadership representation, “not just Queensland”. “Barnaby has stated that he’s polarising. You know, it’s just who he is,” Webster said. “No doubt that has reaped him rewards over time or he wouldn’t continue in that vein. But I think, you know, Australians are sick and tired, they are election-exhausted, they’re politician-tired, and they do want the country to move forward with some stability. “And the Nats have a part to play in that as well, even though we’re in opposition. I think people need to be a little more collaborative, you know, in terms of Coalition.” She said while her views might “rile” some people who wanted to see the Coalition fall apart, some stability was needed in the next parliament. “I just think that there is work to be done on all of our parts and we need reasonable and stable leadership to do that,” Webster said. “I’m not saying that that’s not possible with the current leadership. But I think that, the reality is that after an election, the Nats always reset leadership.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Webster’s move may force the hand of the current deputy, David Littleproud, who is yet to declare his leadership intentions. All positions are spilled as a matter of course in the Nationals party room after an election, and MPs and senators will meet on Monday to vote. F McCormack is also considering running again for leadership. Webster’s electorate of Mallee represents one-third of Victoria and she attracted a swing of more than 4% on a two party-preferred basis, though that was off the 2019 base, when there was also a Liberal candidate in the race. She noted that her Victorian colleague Chester also got a swing towards him, as did Kevin Hogan in his northern NSW electorate of Page, which was devastated by flooding. All three members backed the 2050 net zero target. Webster said the swings to more moderate members of the party gave her more confidence. “It gives us confidence to step up and say, listen, you know, there are things that would help us in the north as well,” she said. Webster pointed out while she did not have a coalmine in her electorate, she had 11 windfarms and 44 solar farms, with more in the planning stage. But she said the marginal seats in Queensland were “driving a lot of the activity in the campaign”. Webster described Matt Canavan’s statement that the net zero 2050 target was dead as “provocative” and unnecessary, given the party room had “been there, done that”. “Barnaby said it this last week, you know that we’ll be having the discussion in the party room again. One of my hopes is that we stick with what was agreed to because it matters in the long term,” Webster said. “It’s just what can I do to ensure that Mallee’s voices are heard and the people in my electorate and the businesses in my electorate are represented and supported in the best possible way,” she said. Webster said she was by no means “a raving climate change enthusiast” but rather a pragmatist. She said the moratorium on nuclear power should be lifted. “Labor has shown no interest in going down that path. And I believe it’s the most honest conversation to have. You know, if we’re going to be talking clean energy, then let’s really genuinely talk all options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/06/german-thinkers-war-of-words-over-ukraine-exposes-generational-divide","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-06T04:00:04Z","webTitle":"German thinkers’ war of words over Ukraine exposes generational divide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/german-thinkers-war-of-words-over-ukraine-exposes-generational-divide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/06/german-thinkers-war-of-words-over-ukraine-exposes-generational-divide","fields":{"headline":"German thinkers’ war of words over Ukraine exposes generational divide","bodyText":"The war in Ukraine is laying bare a generational divide over what lessons Germany should draw from its own history of waging bloody conflicts, as some of the country’s leading artists and intellectuals line up in favour of or against supplying Kyiv with weapons in a series of open letters. The first, published in the feminist magazine Emma on Friday last week, days after the German government announced it would send about 50 Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, urged the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to refrain from directly or indirectly contributing further heavy weapons systems to the conflict. Signed by 26 prominent artists and intellectuals including Emma’s feminist publisher, Alice Schwarzer, the novelists Martin Walser, Juli Zeh and Robert Seethaler, the film-makers Andreas Dresen, Alexander Kluge and Helke Sander and the actor Lars Eidinger, the letter condemned Russia’s war of aggression as a “breach of the basic norms of international law”. Nonetheless, the letter argued it was a mistake to assume that the responsibility for Vladimir Putin’s war potentially escalating into a nuclear conflict “would lie purely with the original aggressor and not also those who with open eyes offered him a motive for potentially criminal acts”. The signees urged Scholz to heed Germany’s “historic responsibility” by helping the two sides find a “compromise that both can accept”. The letter drew some angry responses, including from the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, accused Schwarzer and her co-signees of “vulgar pacifism”. “What is the conclusion of such an argument?” the Green politician asked. “It’s basically that a little bit of occupation, rape and execution should be acceptable and that Ukraine should capitulate swiftly. I don’t think that’s right.” Another open letter, published on Wednesday in the weekly broadsheet Die Zeit, expanded this counter-argument, urging Scholz to continue supporting Ukraine’s defence with military hardware. Initiated by the former Green politician Ralf Fücks and signed by 58 artists and intellectuals including the Nobel literature prize recipient Herta Müller, the pianist Igor Levit and the German PEN’s president, Deniz Yücel, the letter said preventing a Russian victory in Ukraine “lies in Germany’s interest”. “Those who want a negotiated peace that doesn’t result in Ukraine’s submission to Russian demands must increase [Ukraine’s] defensive capabilities and weaken Russia’s belligerency as much as possible,” it said. The Booker-nominated German novelist Daniel Kehlmann, who was another of the Zeit letter’s signees, told the Guardian he had been motivated to put his name to the appeal after seeing the “deep shock and horror” among his eastern European friends at reading the Emma letter. “It seemed to urge Ukraine to capitulate as quickly as possible to end the war,” Kehlmann said. “That may have been an understandable view on the first or second day of the invasion. Now the reality is different: there is a chance that Ukraine can win this war, and we have to support its defensive effort in any way we can, both for moral and tactical reasons.” Kehlmann said he felt some sympathy with German hesitancy at embracing martial rhetoric in light of its own violently aggressive past. “When Scholz announced that he would increase military spending, I too instinctively felt strange at the thought of supporting German armament,” he said. In a long essay published in Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on the same day as the Emma letter, the sociologist and philosopher Jürgen Habermas had framed the German debate over arms exports as a generational divide over applying “aggressively self-confident” and “shrill” language to a military conflict. A younger generation, personified to Habermas by Germany’s 41-year-old foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had been “raised to exhibit sensitivity on normative questions” and only managed to “view war through the lens of victory or defeat”, he said. His own generation, the 92-year-old philosopher seemed to suggest, “know that a war against a nuclear power cannot be ‘won’ in the traditional sense of the word”. He said the “broad pro-dialogue, peacekeeping focus of German policy” was a “hard-won mentality” given its track record as an aggressively militaristic state, and which had been historically denounced from the right. But the ability of some Germans to look at the Ukraine war solely through the lens of their experience in the second world war has also drawn criticism. In a radio interview, Kluge, 90, announced that he had been happy to see US troops march into his home town in 1945 and that there was therefore “nothing evil about capitulation if it ends the war”. The interview was met with widespread disbelief for muddling up the historic lessons of an aggressor nation and those of states that had come under German attack. With an average age of 54, the signatories of the letter in Die Zeit are noticeably younger and have more multicultural backgrounds than those of the preceding letter in Emma, who average 76. “One of the lessons of German history has to be that you cannot defeat fascism with appeasement,” Kehlmann said. The novelist, whose grandparents were Jewish, added: “It is noticeable that the argument for a strictly pacifist foreign policy is rarely brought forward by Germans whose relatives died in the Holocaust.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/18/un-to-review-japans-plan-to-release-fukushima-water-into-pacific","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-18T10:43:47Z","webTitle":"UN to review Japan’s plan to release Fukushima water into Pacific","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/un-to-review-japans-plan-to-release-fukushima-water-into-pacific","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/18/un-to-review-japans-plan-to-release-fukushima-water-into-pacific","fields":{"headline":"UN to review Japan’s plan to release Fukushima water into Pacific","bodyText":"A UN nuclear taskforce has promised to prioritise safety as it launches a review of controversial plans by Japan to release more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water into the ocean from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Japan’s government announced last April that it had decided to release the water over several decades into the Pacific Ocean, despite strong opposition from local fishers and neighbouring China and South Korea. Lydie Evrard, the deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], speaking after a team of experts visited the plant to collect water samples, said on Friday: “We listen very carefully to local people’s concerns and the inspection is designed to provide answers about safety in a transparent manner.” . The controversy comes almost 11 years after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. Tsunami waves crashed into Fukushima Daiichi, knocking out its backup electricity supply, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors and sending large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere. More than 150,000 people were forced to flee their homes, and evacuation orders in communities closest to the plant have only recently been partially lifted. The Tokyo Electric Power company (Tepco) says its treatment technology can remove all radioactive materials from water except tritium, which is harmless in small amounts. It said the gradual release of the water, diluted with seawater, would not pose a threat to human health or the marine environment. In 2020, however, Greenpeace said the water still contained contaminants beside tritium and would have to be treated again. The wastewater is being stored in about 1,000 tanks that officials say need to be removed so the plant can be decommissioned, an operation expected to take several decades. The tanks are expected to reach their capacity of 1.37m tonnes this summer. The liquid includes water used to cool the damaged reactors, as well as rain and groundwater that seeps into the area. Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist for Greenpeace East Asia, said he did not believe the IAEA would fully investigate and address safety and environmental concerns in its report. Noting that the agency had welcomed the discharge option when it was announced last year, Burnie said: “The IAEA is not an independent agency in nuclear affairs – under statute its mission is to promote nuclear power. It has sought to justify radioactive marine pollution as having no impact and safe. But the IAEA is incapable of protecting the environment, human health or human rights from radiation risks – that’s not its job. “The IAEA taskforce should be investigating the root cause of the contaminated water crisis and exploring the option of long-term storage and the best available processing technology as an alternative to the deliberate contamination of the Pacific.” The IAEA team, which includes experts from South Korea and China, will report its findings at the end of April. South Korea, which has yet to lift an import ban on Fukushima seafood introduced in 2013, has said that discharging the water would pose a “grave threat” to the marine environment. Pacific peoples have challenged Japan to prove the water is safe by dumping it in Tokyo. Local fishers also oppose the water’s release, saying it would undo a decade’s work to rebuild their industry and reassure nervous consumers their seafood is safe. Junichi Matsumoto, a Tepco official overseeing management of the treated water, said the utility was prioritising safety and the effect on the Fukushima region’s reputation. “Ensuring transparency and objectivity is crucial to the project,” he said this week. “We hope to further improve the objectivity and transparency of the process based on the review.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/12/treated-as-a-third-class-citizen-patients-who-need-medicare-most-struggle-to-find-a-gp-who-bulk-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:20Z","webTitle":"‘Treated as a third-class citizen’: patients who need Medicare most struggle to find a GP who bulk bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/treated-as-a-third-class-citizen-patients-who-need-medicare-most-struggle-to-find-a-gp-who-bulk-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/treated-as-a-third-class-citizen-patients-who-need-medicare-most-struggle-to-find-a-gp-who-bulk-bills","fields":{"headline":"‘Treated as a third-class citizen’: patients who need Medicare most struggle to find a GP who bulk bills","bodyText":"“I don’t understand why all my bones and all of my organs are not covered by Medicare,” says Megan Watts. “It’s very frustrating.” Watts, 56, lives in the ACT, where GP bulk-billing rates are some of the worst in the country. In her local area of North Canberra she is not aware of any GP clinics that bulk bill people without a healthcare card. Watts works 15 hours a week as an administration officer for her local Anglican church and has multiple health conditions. She says she goes to the GP for script renewals about six times a year. “But then you add in the flu shot, and the fact that I have a chronic back condition that flares up, at which point I need serious painkillers,” says Watts. “My mental health care plan requires regular renewal – and those require long appointments. It all adds up.” Watts estimates her out-of-pocket costs just to keep herself healthy add up to nearly $2,000 a year. And she considers herself lucky. “There are so many people who have it worse than I do,” she says. Stories like Watts’ are common. Guardian Australia has heard from numerous people whose bulk-billing doctors have announced recently that they will now charge for appointments. Patients are finding it increasingly difficult to find a GP who bulk bills, with some people in regional areas travelling long distances to access affordable care. Department of Health data tabled in the Senate in 2019 showed that an average of 39.1% of patients in the ACT had their GP visits bulk billed, with an average out-of-pocket cost of $45.19 a visit. When Guardian Australia requested updated data on bulk-billing rates across the country, the department declined to supply it. But Dr Tim Senior, a general practitioner who regularly works with people experiencing poverty, says with the rising cost of living and freezes on Medicare indexation, the system has hit “a perfect storm”. “Medicare looks expensive because an awful lot of money gets spent on it, but if you don’t have it, it’s much more expensive,” Senior says. He says good primary health care systems – in which patients see a GP in their local community who knows them well – have been shown to be fairer, more effective and to cost less than secondary care, which involves hospital visits and referrals to specialists. “It feels like we’re accidentally wandering into a secondary-care-based system.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Senior is also concerned about a general reluctance to acknowledge poverty as a key factor in health inequity, noting that the clinics in areas where bulk billing is most needed are also those where there is the most pressure to maximise Medicare funding to make ends meet. “To make Medicare pay, you need lots of short consultations, which is exactly what you don’t need in vulnerable communities,” Senior says. “Chronic diseases are more common in people who have less money, disability comes in at a younger age, and people have more complex interacting conditions, and you need longer consultations for those.” Joe, who asked that his surname not be used, lives in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley. The 64-year-old has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a number of other conditions that require regular medical attention. He’s on the disability pension. “I stay with the one medical practice,” Joe says. “They try to help me out as much as they can but with having to pay the money upfront now, even though it’s not much, you’ve got to have that money there.” The rising cost of living has made things harder. “I got the pension this morning, but when you’ve paid all the bills you’ve got $150 for the whole fortnight. Even when you get your medications, you get subsidised, but you’ve got to have that bit of money. When you’re strapped for cash, even 5c is a fair bit.” Joe’s doctor told him at his most recent visit that he would cease bulk billing as of 1 August. “I informed him that due to financial constraints, I will now have to limit my visits no matter what the outcome,” he says. “My house bills need to come first, then food comes second, and doctors will have to come third. “I’ve cut my gas and electricity usage as far as you can – I can’t cut that any lower, the only way I can cut it lower is by turning off the fridge – and I have been spending a lot of time in my man-cave with the log fire going. My doctor was concerned because the wood fire’s doing me no good, but I said, well, I’ve got to stay warm.” Jade Bryan, who moved to the Queensland town of Gladstone a year ago, has tried to get an appointment at multiple bulk-billing clinics locally. Every time, she says, she has been told they are not taking any new patients. Bryan most commonly interacts with the medical system to manage a mental illness. She’s also trans, so she requires regular prescriptions for her hormone therapy. She is currently receiving jobseeker due to a disability that has rendered her unable to work. She says she ought to be seeing a doctor for her sleep apnoea, but she can’t afford it, and so has tried to manage it herself. She says she is lucky her previous doctor in Hervey Bay has agreed to continue bulk billing her for telehealth appointments, but says she has had scares, usually around refilling her scripts. “There was a time when I was out of my antidepressants, and fronted up to the hospital and they’ve only been able to give me three days’ worth,” Bryan says. “If you’re on jobseeker, you’re treated as a third-class citizen these days.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-sends-first-power-equipment-to-ukraine-eu-breaks-hungary-stalemate-to-approve-18bn-aid-plan","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T19:00:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: US finalising plans to send Patriot missile defence system to Ukraine, reports say – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-sends-first-power-equipment-to-ukraine-eu-breaks-hungary-stalemate-to-approve-18bn-aid-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/13/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-sends-first-power-equipment-to-ukraine-eu-breaks-hungary-stalemate-to-approve-18bn-aid-plan","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: US finalising plans to send Patriot missile defence system to Ukraine, reports say – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces may be capable of launching a “large offensive” in Ukraine by the end of January or February despite successive defeats and military problems, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, warned. He said Vladimir Putin’s goals had not changed since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, and he called on western allies not to listen to the Kremlin’s “empty statements”. The US is finalising plans to send the Patriot missile defence system to Ukraine which could be announced as soon as this week, according to US officials. The plan is awaiting approval by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, before it is sent to President Joe Biden for his signature. Approval is expected, two US officials and a senior administration official told CNN. Generators are as important as armour in helping Ukraine survive Vladimir Putin’s energy terrorism this winter, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Ukraine needed an additional €800m (£686m) to survive the winter and €1.5bn to restore the long-term damage to the energy grid, its president told an emergency conference in Paris convened to coordinate infrastructure and humanitarian aid to the country over the next four months. More than €1bn was raised to support Ukraine this winter at the aid conference in Paris, France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said. The money, pledged by 46 countries and 24 international organisations, would be split between restoring Ukraine’s depleted energy network, the food sector, water supply, health and transportation, Colonna said. Ukrainian forces have reportedly damaged a key bridge outside the southern city of Melitopol, a key objective for Kyiv in the region. Video posted online showed two supports of the bridge had been damaged during the attack, just two days after Ukraine hit a Russian barracks sited in a resort in the city, with Himars rockets causing substantial damage and casualties. Ukrainian officials gave the all clear on Tuesday after air raid sirens blared across the country following warnings that Russia may carry out a new wave of missile strikes. Ukrainian media said the alerts may have been triggered by MiG fighter jets that took off from Ryazan, near Russia’s border with Ukraine, and flew towards Belarus. Russia and Ukraine pounded each other’s forces in heavy fighting in the eastern region of Donetsk on Tuesday. Moscow is battling to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, two of four territories the Kremlin claims to have annexed in votes rejected by most countries as illegal. Ukraine must take into account the new territorial “realities” that include Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin has said. Ukraine’s president said on Monday that Russia could begin to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine to show they are capable of abandoning their aggression. In response, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there could be “no question” of Moscow beginning to pull out its troops by the end of the year. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, will hold talks to discuss the events of 2022 in late December, the Russian business daily Vedomosti reported. Dmitry Peskov told the newspaper that the date and the agenda of the meeting are already known, but an official announcement will come later. The talks will unlikely be face-to-face, the paper said. The Belarusian ministry of defence has announced a “sudden combat readiness check” of its troops. The exercises are mostly taking place in the north-west of the country, not close to Ukraine’s border. This is one in a string of announcements by Belarus since mid-October which Kyiv say is designed to stoke fear in Ukrainians and disinform Ukraine’s army. Germany will approve another €50m in winter aid for Kyiv following Russia’s missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said. She said Berlin was working to deliver generators, blankets and heating fuel to Ukraine over Christmas. The UK Foreign Office announced it was imposing sanctions on 12 Russian commanders for their role in attacks on Ukrainian cities. They include Maj Gen Robert Baranov, identified by Bellingcat as the commander of programming and targeting Russian cruise missiles, as well as four Iranians, including the co-owner and managing director of MADO, an Iranian drone engine manufacturer. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday that there was an agreement on removing heavy weapons from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Talks were under way, he said, adding: “We managed to protect Chornobyl and our goal is to protect Zaporizhzhia. The coming weeks will be crucial.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said he did not expect to have contact with the US regarding further prisoner exchanges, Russian media reported. The White House said on Monday that senior US officials plan to hold talks this week with Russian counterparts to discuss the case of the detained American Paul Whelan. Ryabkov was quoted as saying that he didn’t know what the Americans “have in mind”. Ukraine’s parliament has adopted a law on national minorities, a key requirement for the country’s accession to the EU, it said in a statement. The bill is designed to “improve the protection of the rights of national minorities”, including “the rights to self-identification, the use of languages of national minorities, education, participation in political, economic, social, and cultural life, etc”, the New Voice of Ukraine reported. Two Ukrainian journalists have been awarded for their coverage of the Russian bombardment of the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol during the early weeks of the war. Freelance photojournalist Evgeniy Maloletka and Associated Press videographer and photojournalist Mstyslav Chernov spent three weeks documenting the impact of the fighting and artillery bombardments in Mariupol, including the shelling of a maternity hospital as well as the struggle of residents to survive. Russian forces may be capable of launching a “large offensive” in Ukraine by the end of January or February despite successive defeats and military problems, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said today. Moscow is preparing to mount a major offensive at the start of 2023 as it continues to attack Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Kuleba said. Speaking to reporters from a bomb shelter in central Kyiv, he said: I think the Russian capability to conduct an offensive, maybe a large offensive, may be restored somewhere by the end of January, February. That’s what they’re trying to do. And we, of course, do everything possible to prevent it from happening. Russia “definitely still hopes they will be able to break through our lines and advance deeper in Ukraine”, he said, pointing to “the conscription they have announced, and the training of new conscripts, and the movement of their heavy weapons across the country”. He said Vladimir Putin’s goals had not changed since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, and called on western allies not to listen to the Kremlin’s “empty statements”. He said: No one should be fooled. Russia has not changed its ultimatums and still wants to conquer all of Ukraine. What they want right now is not peace, but a pause in aggression to continue it later. We will not play this game. Ukraine’s immediate concern was restoring electricity to the entire country following waves of Russian missile attacks on crucial infrastructure which aimed to “destroy the Ukrainian energy system and leave millions of people without access to power, water and heating amid freezing temperatures”, he said. Putin hopes that without power, water and heating, Ukrainians will stop resisting and accept Russian ultimatums, but this is a grave miscalculation. Russian missile terror will not break Ukraine down. Ukraine’s parliament has adopted a law on national minorities, a key requirement for the country’s accession to the EU, it said in a statement. A total of 324 members of parliament voted in favour of repealing an old bill and adopting the new one, a Ukrainian MP, Yaroslav Zhelezniak, said on Telegram. The bill is designed to “improve the protection of the rights of national minorities”, including “the rights to self-identification, the use of languages of national minorities, education, participation in political, economic, social, and cultural life, etc”, the New Voice of Ukraine reported. Oleksandr Korniyenko, the Ukrainian parliament’s first deputy speaker, said it had “voted for all the necessary laws that pave the way for us to join the EU”, adding: We are looking forward to positive decisions for Ukraine. Ukraine is Europe! Ukraine was granted EU candidate status in June, a historic move that opened the door to EU membership for the war-torn country. The move from applicant to candidate usually takes years, but the EU has dramatically accelerated the process in the context of Moscow’s war against Kyiv. The US is finalising plans to send the Patriot missile defence system to Ukraine which could be announced as soon as this week, according to US officials. The plan is awaiting approval by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, before it is sent to President Joe Biden for his signature. Approval is expected, two US officials and a senior administration official told CNN. Once the plans are approved, the Patriots are expected to ship quickly and Ukrainian forces will be trained to use them at a US army base in Grafenwoehr, Germany, officials said. The Patriot defence system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, CNN writes. It can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine. As Russian forces have launched waves of missile and drone attacks across Ukraine, Kyiv has pleaded with its western allies for additional, sophisticated air defence systems. Recent attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure have put renewed pressure on the Biden administration to send these systems. The “reality of what is going on on the ground” led the Biden administration to make the decision, an official said. Ukraine’s economy could shrink by 50% this year if Russia continues to attack the country’s national power grid and other critical infrastructure, its prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said. Shmyhal was quoted by Interfax Ukraine news agency as saying: If Russia’s terrorist activities against our infrastructure continue, we may lose another 10% to these figures – that is, up to 50% of our GDP. The Ukrainian government estimated that damage from the war could reach $700bn by the end of the year, he said. All sectors of the economy were impacted, he added. Two Ukrainian journalists have been awarded for their coverage of the Russian bombardment of the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol during the early weeks of the war. Freelance photojournalist Evgeniy Maloletka and Associated Press videographer and photojournalist Mstyslav Chernov were the only journalists on the ground during the Russian invasion and siege of Mariupol. The pair spent three weeks documenting the impact of the fighting and artillery bombardments in Mariupol, including the shelling of a maternity hospital as well as the struggle of residents to survive, before they were smuggled out of the city. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said Maloletka and Chernov have been awarded the Press Freedom Award by Reporters Without Borders. He thanked the two journalists, adding: In this war, we defend our freedom of speech, our right to the truth. And journalists bring it to the world. Maloletka and Chernov “worked in extremely difficult conditions, with the Russian army looking for them because of the impact of their photos”, Reporters Without Borders said. Their photo of a pregnant woman injured in the shelling of a maternity hospital went around the world and drew international public opinion’s attention to what was happening in the besieged city. In its three decades in British retail, the lingerie brand Agent Provocateur, the 1990s brainchild of Dame Vivienne Westwood’s son, has rarely shied away from controversy. Whether it be its daring window displays or that 2001 TV advert featuring Kylie Minogue riding a velvet bucking bronco, the brand has stirred up some strong emotions. But it had not, until now, been accused of inadvertently helping to finance a war in Europe. The continued presence of Agent Provocateur-branded stores in Russia has, however, politicised the peekaboo bras, barely there corsets and sex toys, as the company has been placed on a database of firms that are said to be at risk of aiding and abetting Russian aggression, albeit unwittingly. The Leave Russia project at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) argues that “international companies may exercise their influence by putting economic pressure and refusing to cooperate with the aggressor”. Otherwise, it is argued, they add value to the Russian economy. There appear to be 10 Agent Provocateur franchise stores in Moscow, as listed on agentprovocateur.ru, a Russian-language website. Typically, a franchisee pays a royalty in order to operate under a brand name and sell its products. Denis Dovgopoliy, a prominent venture capitalist in Ukraine who has backed efforts to persuade western firms to leave Russia, said a franchise model allowed “Russian entrepreneurs to build businesses and pay taxes”, although he said he held particular scorn for those that were “actively involved in the supply or technology chain of entire industries”.

Arms shipments to Ukraine will end as soon as peace talks to end the Russian invasion begin, Italy’s defence minister told parliament. “I am aware that military aid will have to end sooner or later, and will end when we will have the peace talks that we are all hoping for,” said the defence minister, Guido Crosetto, while addressing the upper-house Senate. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that there was an agreement on removing heavy weapons from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Talks were underway, he said, adding: “We managed to protect Chornobyl and our goal is to protect Zaporizhzhia.

Ryabkov was quoted as saying that he didn’t know what the Americans “have in mind”. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with you today. Don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have anything to flag that you think we should be covering. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said he does not expect to have contacts with the US regarding further prisoner exchanges, Russian media has reported. The White House yesterday said senior US officials plan to hold talks this week with Russian counterparts to discuss the case of the detained American, Paul Whelan. Jake Sullivan, the White House’s national security adviser, told reporters on Monday: We will have an engagement with them this week. We have had regular engagement of course along the way and the next conversation at a high level will take place this week. But Ryabkov was quoted by Russia’s Interfax news agency as saying: I don’t know what they have in mind. As the president has already said, we have a department dealing with this matter. According to my information, no contacts are expected on this subject through the lines that I know about. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has vowed his country “will persevere” with the support of allies after the announcement by France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, that a conference for Ukraine raised more than €1bn. The Belarusian ministry of defence announced a “sudden combat readiness check” of its troops on Tuesday. The exercises are mostly taking place are in the north-west of the country, not close to Ukraine’s border. This is one in a string of announcements by Belarus since mid-October which Kyiv say is designed to stoke fear in Ukrainians and disinform Ukraine’s army. Spokespeople for Ukraine’s army said its chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, had a call with his Polish counterpart, Tomas Piotrowski, in which they discussed the announcement on Tuesday. Belarus borders Ukraine as well as Poland. In mid-October, Belarus announced a joint military taskforce with Russia to deal with what its president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, described as the Ukraine-Nato threat. Belarus and Russia have said they are creating joint military training centres in Belarus and Russia has been sending in troops and equipment. As it stands, Belarus has not sent forces into Ukraine but it allows Russia to regularly launch missiles from its territory into Ukraine and was one of the key launchpads for Russia’s February attack. Analysts say that a potential attack on Ukraine from the north would probably be aimed at cutting off or disrupting supplies coming in from Poland as well as stretching Ukrainian forces across the country. Ukraine has not ruled out the possibility of such an attack but Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in November that Ukraine is confident it can repel any attempt. On Tuesday, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s border service, Andriy Demchenko, said that they had not observed the type of offensive military formation on Ukraine’s border with Belarus that would indicate an attack is imminent. Ukrainian officials gave the all clear on Tuesday after air raid sirens blared across the country following warnings that Russia may carry out a new wave of missile strikes. No new attacks were reported despite the air alerts, officials said. Russia has launched several waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure since October that have caused power outages across the country. Ukrainian media said the alerts may have been triggered by MiG fighter jets that took off from Ryazan, near Russia’s border with Ukraine, and flew towards Belarus. More than €1bn was raised to support Ukraine this winter at an aid conference in Paris, France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said. The money, pledged by 46 countries and 24 international organisations, would be split between restoring Ukraine’s depleted energy network, the food sector, water supply, health and transportation, Colonna said. She said these were “new commitments, thanks to the holding of this conference. It is aid, or gifts in kind. It is not loans.” Earlier we reported that air sirens had been heard across Ukraine, including Kyiv, this afternoon. There have been no immediate reports of attacks, and Ukrainian media said the alerts may have been triggered by MiG fighter jets that took off from Ryazan, near Russia’s border with Ukraine, and flew towards Belarus. Ukraine must take into account the new territorial “realities” that include Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin has said in response to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s three-step proposal for peace. In a statement to G7 countries yesterday, the Ukrainian leader said Russia could begin to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine to show they are capable of abandoning their aggression. Zelenskiy told G7 leaders he was offering Moscow an “opportunity to make a real, meaningful step towards diplomatic settlement” of the conflict. He said: The holidays are ahead, celebrated by billions of people around the world: Christmas of the Gregorian calendar, New Year, Christmas of the Julian calendar. This is the time when normal people think about peace, not about aggression. I offer Russia the opportunity to at least try to demonstrate that they can abandon the way of aggression. It would be right to start withdrawing Russian troops from internationally recognised borders of Ukraine this Christmas. If Russia withdraws its troops from Ukraine, it will ensure a lasting cessation of hostilities. Russia does not have full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed in September, but which most UN member countries have condemned as illegal. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine needed to accept new territorial “realities”, including that the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk provinces of Ukraine were Russia’s “new subjects”. Asked about the proposed Russian troop withdrawal, Peskov said: The Ukrainian side needs to take into account the realities that have developed during this time. And these realities indicate that new subjects have appeared in the Russian Federation. They appeared as a result of referendums that took place in these territories. Without taking these new realities into account, no kind of progress is possible. There could be “no question” of Moscow beginning to pull out its troops by the end of the year, he said. Air raid alerts have been reported across Ukraine, including its capital Kyiv. People are being urged to stay in shelters. Talks between the Chinese and Russian presidents later this month will unlikely be face-to-face, according to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. Earlier we reported that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will hold a meeting to discuss the events of 2022 in late December. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has confirmed to the paper that the date and the agenda of the talks are already known, and an official announcement will come later. Xi and Putin were “in constant communication”, he told reporters during his daily briefing today. He added: We are preparing to continue this communication. We will inform you in a timely manner as to when and how future contacts will take place. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Generators are as important as armour in helping Ukraine survive Vladimir Putin’s energy terror this winter, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told an emergency conference convened in Paris to coordinate short-term infrastructure and humanitarian aid to Ukraine for the next four months. Zelenskiy said his country needed an additional €800m to survive the winter and €1.5bn to restore the long-term damage to the energy grid. The aim of the conference is to set up an international coordination mechanism to ensure the €800m needed secures Ukraine the right mix of generators, transformers, equipment for the restoration of high voltage networks, and gas turbines. Zelenskiy vowed that “we will do everything to counter the blackout and the energy terror. Most of our power plants are damaged or destroyed by the bombings,” he said addressing the conference by video link. Every day our engineers have to disconnect millions of Ukrainians for these repairs. Currently there are 12 million. And every day we expect new Russian strikes. That’s why the generators have become as important as armour to protect the population. He was addressing a French-inspired conference designed to coordinate humanitarian aid to the country attended by more than 40 countries and 30 multilateral bodies. In the afternoon France was holding a separate conference on the long-term reconstruction of the country. Energy experts say the key task for Ukraine is not to avoid black-outs but to ensure that each day all neighbourhoods are receiving at least three hours of electricity, something that requires difficult distribution of the grid. Latest figures from the EU Frontex cited by the Polish migration expert at Warsaw University Maciej Duszczyk show the Russian bombardment has not led to a second wave of mass refugees. He said there had been only a slight net increase of 10,000 Ukrainians crossing their border in the past week, with 65% still going to Poland. He added: The next two months are crucial, but the exodus may be lower than in April because Ukraine’s morale about winning the war is higher. He added although the temperature was projected to drop below freezing at night it was due to be about five degrees by day, relatively mild for a Ukrainian winter. Olena Zelenska, the president’s wife, addressing the conference in person, asked Europeans to imagine being under the Russian bombardment. The first lady of Ukraine said in a rare address: But how do you feel what this war is doing to our country and our people? how do you feel what more than 4,000 missiles that hit Ukrainian cities mean? What does 50,000 missiles launched in a single day against our country mean? What are 2,719 educational establishments affected or destroyed? How do you feel over 1,100 medical establishments destroyed or affected? Can you imagine half of France without electricity? Macron, often accused of trying to secure a premature peace said “it is up to Ukraine, the victim of this aggression, to decide on the conditions for a just and lasting peace”. He added the 10-point peace plan proposed by Zelenskiy at the G20 in Bali “constitutes an excellent basis on which we will build together”. Germany will approve another €50m in winter aid for Kyiv following Russia’s missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said. Baerbock said Berlin was working to deliver generators, blankets and heating fuel to Ukraine over Christmas, as Russia’s pummelling of power facilities causes power shortages in many parts of the country. “We will not allow” Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to break the people of Ukraine, she told reporters at a donors’ conference in Paris. The UK Foreign Office announced it was sanctioning 12 Russian commanders for their role in attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Major General Robert Baranov, identified by Bellingcat as the commander of programming and targeting Russian cruise missiles. The Foreign Office view the dozen as the most senior officers directly involved in the assault on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. The sanctioning makes them prime targets for war crimes tribunals in the event of such trials ever being held. The UK said it was sanctioning four Iranians including the co-owner and managing director of MADO, an Iranian drone engine manufacturer. The Foreign Office, citing UK defence intelligence reports, claimed: Russian armed forces are struggling to replenish their missile reserves, while they are increasingly forced to rely on second rate drones supplied by Iran to keep up their inhumane bombardments of the Ukrainian people. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said: The Iranian regime is increasingly isolated in the face of deafening calls for change from its own people and is striking sordid deals with Putin in a desperate attempt to survive. The UK has announced a fresh package of sanctions targeting Russian military commanders implicated in missile strikes on Ukrainian cities, as well as Iranian businessmen involved in the production and supply of drones to the Kremlin. My colleague Patrick Wintour tweets: Ukrainian forces have reportedly damaged a key bridge outside the southern city of Melitopol, a key objective for Kyiv in the region. The crossing over the Molochna River is situated between Melitopol and the village of Kostyantynivka just to the east of the city on the M14 highway and was struck overnight. Video posted online showed two supports of the bridge had been damaged during the attack, with the span partly collapsed by the blast, making it reportedly unusable for heavy military traffic. The strike on the bridge comes just two days after Ukraine hit a Russian barracks sited in a resort in the city, with Himars rockets causing substantial damage and casualties. The increase in Ukrainian pressure on Russian forces in Melitopol appears to be following a similar pattern to tactics used against Kherson before its liberation, with the targeting of both Russian troops and supply lines, including logistics links to the Crimean peninsula and to the east via the Russia-occupied cities to Berdiansk and Mariupol. With Ukrainian forces now operating east of the Dnieper River, Melitopol is seen as a key objective for Kyiv in the south of the country after the recapture of Kherson. Read the full story here: The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories so far: The United States has shipped the first part of its power equipment aid to Ukraine, US officials said on Monday, as Washington works to support the country’s energy infrastructure against intensifying attacks from Russia. The first tranche was power equipment worth about $13m, one of the officials said. Another source familiar with the matter said two more planeloads of equipment would leave from the United States this week. Russia and Ukraine pounded each other’s forces in heavy fighting in the eastern region of Donetsk on Tuesday. Moscow is battling to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, two of four territories the Kremlin claims to have annexed in votes rejected by most countries as illegal. There were unverified reports on social media of an attack on a bridge behind the frontlines in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, which is seen as vital to Russia’s defence of territory it holds in the south, including Crimea, Reuters reports. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Zaporizhzhia region, shared video on his Telegram channel of what he said was the bridge and blamed Ukrainian “terrorists” for the damage. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, also shared video showing damage to what appeared to be the same bridge. The town of Klintsy in Russia’s southern Bryansk region was shelled overnight by Ukraine, the regional governor claimed, adding that there were no casualties or damage. “As a result of the work of the air defence systems of the Russian Armed Forces, the missile was destroyed, some parts hit the territory of an industrial zone,” governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. Global economic powers have pledged to beef up Kyiv’s military capabilities with a focus on air defence, as Russian missiles, artillery and drones hammered targets in Ukraine. The Group of Seven promised to “meet Ukraine’s urgent requirements” after president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed for modern tanks, artillery and long-range weapons to counter Russia’s devastating invasion, Reuters reported. Arms shipments to Ukraine will end as soon as peace talks to end the Russian invasion begin, Italy’s defence minister told parliament on Tuesday. “I am aware that military aid will have to end sooner or later, and will end when we will have the peace talks that we are all hoping for,” said the defence minister, Guido Crosetto, while addressing the upper-house Senate. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that there was an agreement on removing heavy weapons from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and that talks were under way on the modalities around this. “We managed to protect Chornobyl and our goal is to protect Zaporizhzhia. The coming weeks will be crucial,” Macron said, as he arrived to attend an international conference France is hosting an international conference in Paris to provide urgent aid to help Ukraine get through freezing winter temperatures as Russian forces target civilian infrastructure across the country, Reuters reported. European Union countries’ energy ministers must decide on Tuesday if they are ready to reach a deal on an EU-wide gas price cap, the Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Sikela, said. “This is now purely up to the ministers to show if they are ready to reach an agreement or not,” Sikela said on his arrival to a meeting of EU energy ministers in Brussels, where they aim to agree on the price cap. Belarus has launched an unannounced inspection of its troops’ combat readiness, its defence ministry said on Tuesday. “The activities will be comprehensive in nature; troops will have to move to the designated areas as soon as possible, carry out their engineering equipment, organise protection and defence, and set up bridge crossings over the rivers Neman and Berezina,” the defence ministry said. Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will hold talks to discuss the events of 2022 in late December, the Russian business daily Vedomosti reported on Tuesday. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told the newspaper that the date and the agenda of the meeting are already known, but an official announcement will come later. European Union governments on Monday struck a deal with Hungary that sorts out financial aid for Ukraine in 2023 and gains Budapest’s approval for a global minimum corporate tax, all in exchange for EU flexibility about funds paid to Hungary. The complex deal came after months of wrangling between EU institutions, member countries and Hungary and was spelled out on Monday by the council that represents EU member governments and by diplomats speaking anonymously. Ukraine has called for the west to supply Patriot missiles batteries and other modern air defence systems. The country’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, made the appeal to western allies amid growing concerns that attacks by Russia on its electricity grid could create a new wave of refugees. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council said he expected another wave of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine to go to Europe over the winter because of “unliveable” conditions. Millions of people in Ukraine have been left without heat, clean water or power amid plummeting temperatures, following Russian missile strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Arms shipments to Ukraine will end as soon as peace talks to end the Russian invasion begin, Italy’s defence minister told parliament on Tuesday. “I am aware that military aid will have to end sooner or later, and will end when we will have the peace talks that we are all hoping for,” said the defence minister, Guido Crosetto, while addressing the upper-house Senate. Earlier this month, Italy’s cabinet adopted a decree allowing it to keep supplying Ukraine with weapons for the whole of next year without seeking formal approval from parliament for each new shipment. Russia and Ukraine pounded each other’s forces in heavy fighting in the eastern region of Donetsk on Tuesday. Moscow is battling to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, two of four territories the Kremlin claims to have annexed in votes rejected by most countries as illegal. Moscow is also attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with waves of missile and drone strikes, at times cutting off electricity for millions of civilians enduring Europe’s deadliest conflict since the second world war. “A little more than 50% of the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic has been liberated,” Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed administrator of the portion controlled by Moscow, told Russian state-owned news agency RIA. Reuters was unable to independently verify the report. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that there was an agreement on removing heavy weapons from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and that talks were under way on the modalities around this. “We managed to protect Chornobyl and our goal is to protect Zaporizhzhia. The coming weeks will be crucial,” Macron said, as he arrived to attend an international conference France is hosting an international conference in Paris to provide urgent aid to help Ukraine get through freezing winter temperatures as Russian forces target civilian infrastructure across the country, Reuters reported. European Union countries’ energy ministers must decide on Tuesday if they are ready to reach a deal on an EU-wide gas price cap, the Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Sikela, said. “This is now purely up to the ministers to show if they are ready to reach an agreement or not,” Sikela said on his arrival to a meeting of EU energy ministers in Brussels, where they aim to agree on the price cap. The Czech Republic holds the EU’s rotating presidency and is responsible for drafting negotiation texts for EU countries. Sikela said the country had put a “feasible” proposal on the table, which addressed countries’ various concerns over the gas price cap. Belarus has launched an unannounced inspection of its troops’ combat readiness, its defence ministry said on Tuesday. “The activities will be comprehensive in nature; troops will have to move to the designated areas as soon as possible, carry out their engineering equipment, organise protection and defence, and set up bridge crossings over the rivers Neman and Berezina,” the defence ministry said. It added that military equipment and personnel will be moved and movement along certain public roads would be restricted. The town of Klintsy in Russia’s southern Bryansk region was shelled overnight by Ukraine, the regional governor claimed, adding that there were no casualties or damage. “As a result of the work of the air defence systems of the Russian Armed Forces, the missile was destroyed, some parts hit the territory of an industrial zone,” governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. Klintsy is a town of about 60,000 people, about 45km (28 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Reuters was not able to immediately verify the report. Global economic powers have pledged to beef up Kyiv’s military capabilities with a focus on air defence, as Russian missiles, artillery and drones hammered targets in Ukraine. The Group of Seven promised to “meet Ukraine’s urgent requirements” after president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed for modern tanks, artillery and long-range weapons to counter Russia’s devastating invasion, Reuters reported. Zelenskiy also urged G7 leaders gathered at a virtual meeting to support his idea of convening a global peace summit dedicated to bringing peace to his country. The summit would be focused on the implementation of Kyiv’s 10-point peace plan that insists on, among other things, Russia’s withdrawal of all its troops from Ukraine and no territorial concessions on Kyiv’s part. The British defence minister Ben Wallace said on Monday he would be “open-minded” about supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles to target launch sites for Russian drones that have hit infrastructure if Russia carried on targeting civilian areas. US president Joe Biden told Zelenskiy on Sunday that Washington’s priority was to boost Ukraine’s air defences. The US also shipped the first batch of power equipment to Ukraine under an aid package agreed last month. Russia is “deliberately trying to freeze Ukrainians to death as we enter winter”, a senior US official said. “Our strategy right now first is to help Ukraine protect itself against this deliberate attacks on civilian energy infrastructure because it could be a humanitarian catastrophe.” Moscow has denied targeting civilians but the war has displaced millions and killed thousands of non-combatants. There were unverified reports on social media of an attack on a bridge behind the frontlines in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, which is seen as vital to Russia’s defence of territory it holds in the south, including Crimea, Reuters reports. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Zaporizhzhia region, shared video on his Telegram channel of what he said was the bridge and blamed Ukrainian “terrorists” for the damage. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, also shared video showing damage to what appeared to be the same bridge. The Guardian has not independently confirmed the reports. Ukraine’s chances of surviving the winter without a mass exodus of refugees into Europe rest on a resilience conference being jointly co-chaired by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris on Tuesday. With as many as 47 countries and 22 multilateral institutions attending, France and Ukraine hope to set up a small coordinating mechanism to process Ukrainian requests for funding and help in kind to survive winter after Russia mounted a series of massive missile strikes on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. French diplomatic sources said the aim was for each country and entity to appoint an official responsible for supplying the help Ukraine requests between now and March. The French will provide a platform so Ukrainians requests can be processed and countries can come forward to fill gaps in a process analogous to the regular conferences at which a group of allies meeting in Ramstein airbase coordinate military aid to Ukraine. The requests at the Paris resilience conference will centre on energy, water, food, transport, and health.The UK is expected to focus its offer on helping to restore crippled Ukrainian power stations, including by providing transformers. The UK is also expected to slap further sanctions on Iran for supplying drones to Russia for use in Ukraine. The G7 in a joint statement described the attacks as a war crime. The statement added, “We are determined that Russia will ultimately need to pay for the restoration of critical infrastructure damaged or destroyed through its brutal war. There can be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities. We will hold President Putin and those responsible to account in accordance with international law”. Macron sees the conference as a chance to reassert his fully fledged support for Ukraine’s right to regain its lost territories. There will be no explicit discussion of how Europe should cope with a second refugee influx, but the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland said on Monday he anticipates another wave of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine in Europe because of “unliveable” conditions. He said: “Nobody knows how many but there will be hundreds of thousands more as the horrific and unlawful bombing of civilian infrastructure makes life unliveable in too many places,” Jan Egeland told Reuters by phone after returning from a trip to Ukraine earlier this month. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will hold talks to discuss the events of 2022 in late December, the Russian business daily Vedomosti reported on Tuesday. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told the newspaper that the date and the agenda of the meeting are already known, but an official announcement will come later. European Union governments on Monday struck a deal with Hungary that sorts out financial aid for Ukraine in 2023 and gains Budapest’s approval for a global minimum corporate tax, all in exchange for EU flexibility about funds paid to Hungary. The complex deal came after months of wrangling between EU institutions, member countries and Hungary and was spelled out on Monday by the council that represents EU member governments and by diplomats speaking anonymously. It means Ukraine will get €18bn from the EU budget next year. Budapest had been vetoing making payments by that stable, predictable and cheaper means, rather than by the bilateral loans that member countries have been extending to Kyiv. It also agreed to drop its veto over the OECD-agreed global minimum corporate tax of 15% to be applied to large international corporations where they make money, rather than where they set up offices for tax purposes. The United States has shipped the first part of its power equipment aid to Ukraine, US officials said on Monday, as Washington works to support the country’s energy infrastructure against intensifying attacks from Russia. The first tranche was power equipment worth about $13m, one of the officials said. Another source familiar with the matter said two more planeloads of equipment would leave from the United States this week. A US official said the equipment departed from a US military base. The first tranche is part of the $53m aid announced last month, after Ukraine said it needed transformers and generators as well as air defence systems. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments for the next while. It’s 7.30am in Kyiv. Our main stories this morning: the European Union reached a deal in principle to send an €18bn ($18.93bn) financial aid package to Ukraine and approve a minimum tax on major corporations in a big move that narrowed a rift between the bloc and recalcitrant member Hungary. And the United States has shipped the first part of its power equipment aid to Ukraine, US officials said on Monday, as Washington works to support the country’s energy infrastructure against intensifying attacks from Russia. Here are the other key recent developments. Ukraine has called for the west to supply Patriot missiles batteries and other modern air defence systems. The country’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, made the appeal to western allies amid growing concerns that attacks by Russia on its electricity grid could create a new wave of refugees. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council said he expected another wave of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine to go to Europe over the winter because of “unliveable” conditions. Millions of people in Ukraine have been left without heat, clean water or power amid plummeting temperatures, following Russian missile strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged leaders of the Group of Seven nations on Monday to support his idea of convening a special global peace summit in winter dedicated to bringing peace to his country. Zelenskiy also appealed to the G7 nations for an additional 2bn cubic metres of natural gas as well as long-range weapons, modern tanks, artillery units and shells. Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout has joined the Kremlin-loyal ultranationalist Liberal Democratic party (LDPR), its leader said. Bout, once nicknamed “the Merchant of Death”, was freed last week after 14 years in US custody in a high-profile swap with the American basketball star Brittney Griner. The move could see Bout seek a seat in the Russian parliament. The exiled mayor of Melitopol claims Russian troops are “redeploying” and “panicking” following Ukrainian attacks on the Russian-occupied city over the weekend. Russian forces “are busy moving their military groups to other places to try to hide them”, Ivan Fedorov said without providing evidence. Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has warned that Russia has enough missiles to launch another three to five waves of strikes on the country. Vadym Skibitsky also claimed Russia is using old Ukrainian missiles against Kyiv and outlined the four general directions from which Russia is launching missiles into Ukraine. Two civilians have been killed and 10 more injured after Russian rocket attacks on the town of Hirnyk in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces struck the centre of the town “with cluster munitions and Uragan MLRS [multilaunch rocket systems]”, the prosecutor general’s office said. Two people were killed and another five wounded after Russian troops shelled the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, according to local authorities. “The enemy again attacked the residential quarters of Kherson,” governor Yaroslav Yanushevich said on Telegram, adding the Russian forces hit a maternity ward, a cafe and apartment buildings on Saturday. Vladimir Putin will not hold a year-end press conference for the first time in at least a decade, in what Kremlin watchers view as a break with protocol due to his war in Ukraine. There would also be no New Year reception at the Kremlin, officials said. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he would be “open minded” about supplying Ukraine with longer-range weapons if Russia continued to target civilian areas. Wallace said he “constantly” reviewed the weapons systems the UK sends to Ukraine, and that he “will be open minded to see what we do next” if Moscow tries to “break those Geneva conventions”. The EU has secured enough gas for this winter but could face a gas shortage next year if Russia further cuts supplies, the European Commission and the International Energy Agency (IEA) have warned. An international team of legal advisers has been working with local prosecutors in Ukraine’s recaptured city of Kherson to gather evidence of alleged sexual crimes by Russian forces. A team from Global Rights Compliance, an international legal practice headquartered in The Hague, are conducting a full-scale investigation part of a broader international effort to support overwhelmed Ukrainian authorities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/20/french-elections-macron-le-pen-what-next","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-20T12:40:35Z","webTitle":"Five takeaways from the French elections – and what could happen next","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/20/french-elections-macron-le-pen-what-next","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/20/french-elections-macron-le-pen-what-next","fields":{"headline":"Five takeaways from the French elections – and what could happen next","bodyText":"Emmanuel Macron’s alliance remains the largest force in France’s parliament, but the president – comfortably re-elected eight weeks ago – lost his overall majority amid a strong electoral showing by a new leftist coalition and a historic far-right surge. Here are five key takeaways from a shock legislative election that leaves the centrist leader needing to strike difficult deals with other parties to deliver his promised reforms – and that could yet plunge France into political chaos. 1. A triumph for the far right Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN), which routinely scores 20% or more in national elections, had just eight of the 577 MPs in the last parliament. In the new assembly it will have 89, an elevenfold increase and a historic total (its previous high was 35 in 1986, under a short-lived period of proportional representation). The unprecedented score, double what polls predicted, qualifies the far-right party as a political group under the assembly’s rules, giving it significant speaking rights and representation on parliamentary committees, and will allow it to pay off its debts and build up a campaign warchest for future elections. RN also cleared the thresholds required to be able to launch parliamentary investigations and challenge bills before the constitutional court. In the words of many commentators, its score represents a seismic breakthrough. 2. A dire night for Macron The president’s coalition, Ensemble (Together), finished up with 245 deputies, by far the largest bloc in parliament but well short of the 289 seats needed for a majority and more than 100 down from the previous parliament. There were a few bright spots, such as the first-time election of the Europe minister, Clément Beaune, but Macron also lost a string of heavy hitters. Analysts say the 44-year-old president must take much of the blame, accusing him of throwing away a solid projected parliamentary lead after his re-election in April with an all but nonexistent campaign in which he seemed to rely on the tradition of French voters usually giving newly elected presidents a majority. Rapidly rising inflation and cost of living concerns also revived popular resentment of Macron and his style, widely perceived as arrogant, top-down and “president-of-the-rich”. Macron, used to ramming his pro-business reforms through parliament with little regard for opposition views, will have to learn the art of political consensus-building; he faces weeks of negotiations and may yet fail to form a functioning majority. 3. The left’s tactics paid off, but not completely The Socialist and Communist parties, the radical-left Unbowed France (LFI) and the Greens (EELV) scored no more votes in combination than in the previous 2017 election, but their decision to jointly field a candidate in each constituency as part of a new alliance under the hard-left veteran Jean-Luc Mélenchon paid off, allowing them to win 131 MPs, more than double their previous total (they can also count on the support of some of the 22 deputies from non-allied leftwing parties). The performance makes Nupes, as the alliance is known, the largest opposition force in parliament. Most observers, however, believe that with major differences over everything from the EU to nuclear power and policing, Nupes will struggle to stay united for long if Macron tries to peel off more moderate MPs: less than 24 hours after polling stations closed, it was already showing signs of strain. Mélenchon also fell far short of his target of a left-leaning parliamentary majority (with himself as prime minister) and it is unclear how far his disruptive LFI, as the major force in the alliance, will be able to dictate to its less radical allies. 4. Low turnout and a ‘republican front’ hit by a bitterly divided electorate Abstention played a crucial role. As in the first round, more than half of eligible voters stayed away from the polls, with turnout at just 46%. Young and less well-off people abstained en masse: only 29% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 36% of people in households earning less than €1,200 a month voted, compared with 66% of those over 70 and 51% of those with higher incomes. France’s so-called republican front, in which moderate voters traditionally ally to keep out the extremes, also failed at the local level. Divided in effect into three mutually antagonistic blocs (far right, left/far left and centre), many voters – faced with a two-horse second round that did not feature their preferred candidate – simply stayed away. This explains much of the far-right surge: according to the pollster Ipsos, for example, such is the mutual loathing of leftist and centrist voters that “a very large percentage” of Macron supporters abstained or spoiled their ballot rather than vote for Nupes candidates in run-offs against the National Rally, while a similar number of Nupes voters declined to vote for Ensemble candidates in head-to-heads with the far-right party. 5. A more representative – but potentially paralysed – parliament For some, the upsides in Sunday’s results are that power in France will now necessarily shift from president to parliament; that the makeup of the assembly more accurately reflects the political views of country’s electorate; and that French MPs will be forced to reach consensus in the national interest. Unlike in Scandinavian countries, Germany or the Netherlands, however, France’s modern national assembly has no tradition of compromise, and many other commentators fear a fatally hung parliament, paralysis and political crisis at a time of major European – and global – challenges. … Where now? The three main options ahead To form a majority, Macron could seal a pact with the centre-right Les Républicains (LR) party, which has 64 MPs but is split between a moderate, pro-European wing and a harder-right, more nationalist faction. Senior LR leaders, however, have for the time being ruled out a formal coalition. The party may yet break up, with some MPs rallying to Macron. Alternatively, the president may seek support from right and/or left on a bill-by-bill basis (as the Socialist president François Mitterrand once did, with some legislative success). LR has said it would be open to this; Nupes has been less forthcoming. But if the assembly parties fail to work constructively together (LFI and the National Rally, in particular, could prove particularly obstructive), deadlock will ensue and a snap election, which Macron can call at any time, may prove to be the only way out – possibly within months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/oct/15/uk-poised-to-confirm-funding-for-mini-nuclear-reactors-for-green-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-15T15:23:27Z","webTitle":"UK poised to confirm funding for mini nuclear reactors for carbon-free energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/15/uk-poised-to-confirm-funding-for-mini-nuclear-reactors-for-green-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/oct/15/uk-poised-to-confirm-funding-for-mini-nuclear-reactors-for-green-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK poised to confirm funding for mini nuclear reactors for carbon-free energy","bodyText":"The government is poised to approve funding for a fleet of Rolls-Royce mini nuclear reactors that the prime minister hopes will help the UK reach his target of zero-carbon electricity by 2035. A consortium led by the British engineering firm had already secured £210m in backing from private investors for the small modular reactor (SMR) project, a sum that the government is expected to match or better. Confirmation is expected before the spending review on 27 October, according to well-placed sources. The consortium, known as UK SMR, will rebrand as Rolls-Royce SMR to coincide with Westminster’s blessing. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said: “Match-funding for Rolls-Royce would be a huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero. It would also show investors that the government believes in nuclear as a green technology.” Backing from the government will pave the way for the consortium’s multibillion-pound plan to build 16 SMRs around the country, the first of which could be plugged into the grid by 2031. Each reactor, designed to be easy to build and install, will have a capacity of 470 megawatts (MW), enough to power nearly 1.3m homes, based on average household usage. Boris Johnson visited Rolls-Royce’s Bristol factory on Friday, where he was shown round the facility by the engineering firm’s chief executive, Warren East. Neither Rolls-Royce nor No 10 would comment on whether the future of SMRs was discussed during the visit but the firm this week touted the technology as a means of providing carbon-free power for producing sustainable aviation fuel. SMRs are understood to be a key component of the prime minister’s pledge to eliminate fossil fuels from electricity generation by 2035, a landmark promise he made last month in the run-up to the UK’s hosting of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. Rolls-Royce is being advised by HSBC, which has helped it secure £210m from private investors, a condition of the government stumping up the same amount. Confirmed support for SMRs could signal a concerted effort within government to reverse the scheduled decline in the UK’s nuclear power capacity. About 20% of the nation’s electricity comes from 13 nuclear reactors capable of producing 7.8GW of power. But more than half of that capacity comes from reactors due to retire by 2025, and plans to replace them have stalled. Toshiba pulled out of a plant at Moorside in Cumbria in 2020, and Hitachi withdrew planning consent for a project at Wylfa Newydd, on Anglesey, this year. While Hinkley Point C is due to start generating electricity from 2026, only one new project, Sizewell C, is now in the works, with no final investment decision yet made. Britain’s ability to build new nuclear reactors has been further complicated by the government’s unwillingness to allow any further involvement from the state-backed China General Nuclear. CGN has a 20% stake in Sizewell C but ministers have been looking into ways to remove it from the project before it moves to the construction phase. The Chinese company was due to take a lead role in the Bradwell reactor in Essex, which is now highly unlikely to go ahead. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said last week that weaning the nation off fossil fuels would involved building at least one new nuclear project, alongside renewables such as wind and solar. The prediction is likely to hinge on whether the Treasury, which has clashed Kwarteng’s department over household support for energy suppliers, backs a new funding model for the industry. Industry players are keen to see the government legislate to approve the regulated asset base (RAB) model, which allows private investors a more reliable stream of revenues from nuclear power plants – which typically require tens of billions of pounds to build – by piling costs on to household energy bills. Greatrex said RAB funding “could at last mobilise the funding for nuclear large and small to restore a backbone of clean, reliable British power to our energy system”. Rolls-Royce has said it could create 6,000 UK jobs within five years if the government backs its SMR plans. It has also reportedly held discussions with customers overseas, including companies such as Amazon that operate energy-hungry datacentres. The nine-strong consortium also includes the National Nuclear Laboratory and Laing O’Rourke, the construction firm, alongside Assystem, SNC Lavalin/Atkins, Wood, BAM Nuttall, the Welding Institute and Nuclear AMRC. Small modular reactors were first developed in the 1950s for use in nuclear-powered submarines.

The state of mutual energy dependence seemed too entrenched. On one side, the EU could not decouple itself easily from the source of 38% of its natural gas imports. On the other, Russia under financial sanctions would need cash. Old hands reflected that, even in the long decades of the cold war, the Soviet Union and Europe maintained commercial relationships in energy. A week later, such thinking looks naive. The “shock and awe” financial sanctions, especially those aimed at Russia’s central bank, exceed anything previously seen, but the shortcoming is obvious: if you really want to hit the Russian economy hard, the place to aim is its energy export sector, a part that has been spared sanctions so far and generates hundreds of millions of dollars daily. The point is made repeatedly by Ukrainian officials in their appeals for the trade to cease, and its moral force is hammered home with every fresh Russian atrocity. The White House said on Wednesday it is “very open” to the idea of energy sanctions on Russia. One might say cynically that it is easier to air such sentiments from Washington than Europe, but even German ministers are publicly taking about what would happen if Russia halted gas supplies suddenly. “We are prepared for that. I can give the all-clear for the current winter and summer,” said Robert Habeck, economy minister. Nuclear power stations, currently set for imminent closure, could be kept switched on and coal-fired stations could be used as back-up, he argued. If that’s really the case, the obvious question is why the west shouldn’t just get on with imposing a few energy sanctions – even if only caps on imports initially – and accept the financial pain. There is a foretaste already amid the various “self-sanctioning” measures taken by European refineries to avoid buying Russian oil and by European gas suppliers (including Centrica) to disentangle themselves from Gazprom. The price of a barrel of Brent hit $113 on Wednesday, the highest for seven years. UK natural gas prices returned to last autumn’s sky-high levels and pump prices are setting records. Prices would probably go even higher if full-blown energy sanctions were imposed, but what about security of supply? Here’s Brussels thinktank Bruegel: “If the EU is forced or willing to bear the cost, it should be possible to replace Russian gas already for next winter without economic activity being devastated, people freezing, or electricity supply being disrupted.” It also, it should be said, described the challenge as “momentous”, said rules would have to be rewritten and concluded “exceptional measures” may be needed to reduce demand. But the shorthand version seems to be: yes, if you are prepared to accept the costs, it’s doable. That, one suspects, is where the sanctions debate is rapidly heading. It should probably have been there from the off. Lack of faith in Aviva Aviva’s plan to return £4.75bn to shareholders didn’t quite reach the target of £5bn set by activist investor Cevian Capital, but the sum should be enough. The £250m gap can be mentally covered by Aviva’s accompanying £385m purchase of UK financial adviser firm Succession Wealth. Even activists tend not to object to conventional bolt-on acquisitions. The missing bit in the script is a higher share price. At 410p, Aviva stands roughly where it was three years ago, before chief executive Amanda Blanc got to work with a series of major overseas disposals and a heavy cost-cutting programme. It’s a slightly odd position. The fresh element of the return of capital represents a quarter of Aviva’s stock market value and Blanc’s dividend promise of 33p for 2023 represents a fat yield in the offing, which ought to get the attention of income investors. Put it down to a lack of faith in the idea that Aviva can really emerge as a reliable generator of cash. That’s hardly the fault of Blanc, who has done everything she promised and has now set a few financial targets to be judged on. But, yes, after 20 years of disappointments for shareholders, the idea that Aviva might be fixed may take a while to become truly believable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/27/iranian-ambassador-to-uk-removed-from-post-over-hijab-incident","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-27T12:01:07Z","webTitle":"Iranian ambassador to UK removed from post over hijab incident","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/iranian-ambassador-to-uk-removed-from-post-over-hijab-incident","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/27/iranian-ambassador-to-uk-removed-from-post-over-hijab-incident","fields":{"headline":"Iranian ambassador to UK removed from post over hijab incident","bodyText":"The Iranian ambassador to the UK has been ordered back to Tehran and is to be removed from his post after a video circulated showing an embassy reception at which some women did not have their heads covered. News of Mohsen Baharvand’s return to Tehran was reported by the ILNA news agency in Iran. At the event commemorating the 43rd Iranian Revolution, a woman playing a piano alongside a violinist was not wearing a hijab. Another video of the event showed a more conventional gathering at which speeches were given. An Iranian in London tweeted a video of the event, attended largely by diplomats, asking whether the party would “with the presence of these people have the slightest benefit for the Iranian people?”. He later tweeted: “It is gratifying that our voice was heard in Iran. Please send an ambassador to London who is pragmatic and worthy of serving Iran and working only for the benefit of the Iranian people.” The news circulated first in pro-regime newspapers, and some claimed it was part of a wider reorganisation of the Iranian diplomatic service being carried out by the new more hardline government led by Ebrahim Raisi, elected last June. Baharvand was appointed by the foreign ministry before the presidential elections, but took up his London posting in July after the change in leadership of the department. He was previously the deputy head of the legal department in Iran under Mohammad Javad Zarif, the former foreign minister. In his dealings with reporters in the UK, the ambassador did not stray from the official government position on the Iran nuclear talks, but tried to explain the context of Iranian thinking. His departure comes at a critical time in British-Iranian relations. Iran is on the cusp of deciding whether to accept Washington’s terms for a US return to the Iran nuclear deal, including the lifting of many sanctions. Alongside the nuclear talks, Britain is seeking to secure the release of three British-Iranian dual nationals detained in Iran. The Islamic Consultative Assembly, Iran’s parliament, met in private session on Sunday to review the state of the talks that many say could finally reach a conclusion this week. Ali Bagheri, the Iranian chief negotiator, is due to return on Sunday to Vienna, where the Iran talks are taking place, with fresh final instructions. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, is to meet Iran’s supreme national security council on Monday, and there is talk of a special session of Iran’s parliament on Tuesday. The foreign minister said the talks were continuing, stressing nothing was agreed until everything was agreed. Issues remain around assurances on the US’s long-term commitment to the deal, and the extent of sanction suspension. Both sides seem to be trying to prevent the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to spill into the critical last days of the Vienna talks. Russia has, as a signatory to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – the technical term for the 2015 deal – acted as a key mediator in the months-long talks in Vienna between European powers, the US and Iran. The Russian ambassador in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, has been a passionate defender of the invasion. Opponents of the deal, not necessarily party to the negotiations, fear an agreement will give Iran leeway to become a nuclear power relatively quickly and argue that the west’s experience with Russia shows that appeasement of fundamentally hostile powers does not work, and only emboldens them. Some Iranian political scientists have urged Iran not to be too outspoken in its support of Russia, fearing it will make it more difficult for the Biden administration to win political support for the deal. But Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, said the war was the direct responsibility of the west’s drive to threaten the security of other countries. Amir-Abdollahian has also criticised Nato provocations without endorsing the violence. Iran takes the view that the era of cold war blocs is over, and America is in long-term decline, but that it is important for Iran to steer an independent course and not become a client of China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/09/ukraine-news-russia-war-ceasefire-broken-humanitarian-corridors-kyiv-russian-invasion-live-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskiy-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-10T04:53:47Z","webTitle":"Strike on children’s hospital ‘ultimate evidence that genocide is happening’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/09/ukraine-news-russia-war-ceasefire-broken-humanitarian-corridors-kyiv-russian-invasion-live-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskiy-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/09/ukraine-news-russia-war-ceasefire-broken-humanitarian-corridors-kyiv-russian-invasion-live-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskiy-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Strike on children’s hospital ‘ultimate evidence that genocide is happening’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for joining today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. We have moved our live feed to a new blog which you can view below. Russia’s war on Ukraine has entered its third week. Hundreds have been reported to be dead or wounded while more than two million Ukrainian refugees have so far fled their homeland, according to UN estimates. It is 6.45am in Ukraine and here is where the crisis currently stands: A children’s hospital and maternity ward in Mariupol was destroyed by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday afternoon, Ukrainian officials said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the attack “the ultimate evidence of genocide” adding that children are buried under rubble while the regional governor said 17 people have been wounded. “A children’s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation?” Zelenskiy added. The Guardian was unable to fully verify Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. Western officials warned of their “serious concern” that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv. In an assessment, they said an “utterly horrific” attack on the Ukrainian capital could be unleashed as Russian forces attempt to overcome the logistical issues that have apparently plagued troops headed towards Kyiv. The US House of Representatives approved $13.6 billion in US aid to Ukraine and its European allies. Britain is planning to supply Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons and “a small consignment” of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine as Russian forces close in on Kyiv, the British defence secretary said. Canada will also provide Ukraine with an additional $50m in lethal and non-lethal military aid. The United States has seen indications that Russia is dropping “dumb bombs” – unguided munitions with no precise target – on Ukraine, a senior US defence official said. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has landed in Turkey for the face-to-face talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since Russia invaded. Kuleba warned in a Facebook video his expectations were “limited”. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the city, where conditions are described as “apocalyptic”, was still being shelled by Russian troops despite an agreement to establish a safe evacuation corridor for civilians. Overnight strikes in the north-eastern city of Okhtyrka, Sumy region, reportedly killed a 13-year-old boy and two women, according to regional officials. Ukrainian authorities have said the power supply has been cut to the defunct Chernobyl power plant. The UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent concern. Still, the news is raising concerns that a lack of external power to the site could compromise nuclear safety. More than 40,000 civilians were evacuated from across Ukraine on Wednesday but authorities struggled to get people away from conflict zones around the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, a Ukrainian negotiator said. Ukrainian authorities said earlier that the corridors should allow residents of the heavily bombarded cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to leave, calling on Russian forces to respect an “official public commitment” to cease fire. The International Monetary Fund has approved $1.4 billion in emergency financing for Ukraine to help meet urgent spending needs and mitigate the economic impact of Russia’s military invasion. Mining giant Rio Tinto has become the latest corporation to cut ties with Moscow saying it was ending all commercial relations with Russian businesses. Another video shared by Ukrainian media outlet NEXTA TV, purports to show a 61-year-old Scottish man bearing arms in Kyiv in the fight against the Russian invasion. “My name is Rob. I am a 61-year-old grandfather from Scotland,” the man says. “I travelled from Edinburgh to Kyiv to help in the fight against the Russians. I will do anything in my power to stop Russia from capturing Kyiv.” The terrifying moment two Ukrainian explosive disposal specialists defuse a Russian bomb with just their hands a bottle of water has gone viral after the footage was shared by Ukrainian media outlet NEXTA TV. The 31-second clip, which has since been viewed more than 1.4m times, was captioned “bomb defusing process” and shows two men kneeling beside the weapon while carefully unscrewing the seal using just a small water bottle and gloves. Charles Lister, senior fellow and the director of the Syria and countering terrorism and extremism programs at the Middle East Institute, shared the video, describing the moment as an act of “mind boggling bravery”. “This Russia-dropped bomb would flatten a building — and yet these Ukraine EODs defuse it with 2 hands and a bottle of water, while shells audibly land nearby,” Lister said. “Mind boggling bravery.” The US House of Representatives has approved a massive spending bill that would rush $13.6 billion in US aid to battered Ukraine and its European allies, the Associated Press is reporting. After approval in the House on Wednesday night, Senate approval is expected by week’s end or perhaps slightly longer. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters: “We’ve got a war going on in Ukraine. We have important work that we’re doing here.” She said with her party in the 50-50 Senate needing at least 10 GOP votes to pass legislation, Democrats “are going to have to know there has to be compromise.” The House approved the overall bill in two separate votes. The measure’s security programs were overwhelmingly approved by 361-69, the rest by 260-171, with most Republicans opposed. The Ukraine aid included $6.5 billion for the US costs of sending troops and weapons to eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion and repeated, bellicose threats. There was another $6.8 billion to care for refugees and provide economic aid to allies, and more to help federal agencies enforce economic sanctions against Russia and protect against cyber threats at home. Biden had requested $10 billion for the package. Pelosi said she talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 45 minutes Wednesday. She said they discussed the weapons and other assistance his country needs and “the crimes against humanity that Putin is committing,” including a Russian airstrike that destroyed a maternity hospital. “This is the beast that Putin is,” Pelosi said. Overnight strikes in the north-eastern city of Okhtyrka, Sumy region, reportedly killed a 13-year-old boy and two women, according to regional officials. “Enemy aviation hit residential houses. 5 people were rescued from the falls, 2 of them children. Also partially destroyed police department,” Sumy regional state administration head Dmytro Zhyvytsky said, citing a report from the Sumy regional military administration. Zhyvytsky said that just after midnight local time on Thursday residential areas and a gas pipeline were hit. “The enemy artillery fired at the former Electrobutprilad plant. The result of the shelling killed three villagers, including a minor boy,” he said. “Great Pisarívka suffered a night bombing. Power lines are torn, lying on the ground. A 13-year-old boy and 2 women were killed as a result of an artillery shelling.” Zhyvytsky also says three humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians are expected to open from 9am local time. On Wednesday, about 5,000 people were evacuated from Sumy, the regional capital that has been under heavy Russian bombardment for days. Carlsberg, the world’s third-largest brewer, has said it will stop selling its flagship beer brand, cease all advertising in Russia and will donate profits from its Russia business where the company has already halted investments. The Carlsberg Group’s Baltika Breweries, headquartered in St Petersburg, will be run as a separate business and continue operating its eight breweries in Russia, where it has around 8,400 employees. “Baltika Breweries will be run as a separate business, with the purpose of sustaining our employees and their families,” Carlsberg said, as reported by Bloomberg. Heineken NV also stopped the production and sale of its own brand beer in Russia. “Heineken will no longer accept any net financial benefit derived from our Russian operations,” the company said in a statement in Wednesday. Asian shares surged on Thursday, tracking Wall Street’s gains as planned diplomatic talks between Russia and Ukraine buoyed sentiment, although analysts warned the rally could be susceptible to a sharp reversal as risks remain, Reuters reports. Oil prices also regained some footing, having fallen more than 12% on the previous session as United Arab Emirates pledged to support hiking oil output to ease mayhem in energy markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.6% in early trade. Japan’s Nikkei surged 3.4% while Australian shares were up 1%. Chinese blue chips rose 1.96% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rallied 1.8%. US crude ticked up 1.37% to $110.19 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 2% to $113.2 per barrel. European Union leaders will phase out buying Russian oil, gas and coal, a draft declaration showed on Thursday, as the bloc seeks to reduce its reliance on Russian sources of energy. The United States banned oil and gas imports from Russia on Tuesday, while Britain said it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Data due later on Thursday is expected to show US consumer inflation racing at a 7.9% annualised clip, according to a Reuters poll. “From a central bank perspective, the war in Ukraine is likely to lead to further upward pressure on consumer price inflation that could result in a supply side shock,” said David Chao, Hong Kong-based global market strategist at Invesco. “US equities could be in a holding pattern with higher levels of volatility as investors assess the impact of the Ukraine conflict on inflation and possible Fed actions.” US stocks surged overnight, led by financial and tech shares. The Nasdaq Composite added 3.59% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2%. The British newspapers have once again led with Zelenskiy’s war effort against Russia’s invasion. The United States is rapidly processing requests from Americans to export firearms and ammunition to Ukraine, the US Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Americans are collecting weapons for Ukraine after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on his citizens to defend the country from invading Russian forces and promised to arm them. The Commerce Department said it had imposed export controls on Russia to “degrade its ability to sustain military aggression” and Americans should check agency regulations to see if a license was needed to ship specific firearms to Ukraine. “The department has been processing requests rapidly for the export of firearms and ammunition to Ukraine under its existing processes and authorities,” a department spokesperson said, Reuters reports. Americans are donating thousands of sets of body armour and millions of rounds of ammunition in response to Ukraine’s pleas for military support. Equipment donors and US volunteers for Ukraine’s armed forces must navigate US export license requirements for items like military-grade bullet proof vests. Controls at airports on volunteers carrying such body-armour appear to have eased, a US volunteer in Poland said. “From the latest wave of people carrying plates this week, not a single person has been stopped,” said the volunteer, who asked not to be named, referring to the ceramic plates that make vests bullet-proof. Two Americans shipping military supplies to Ukraine, who asked to remain anonymous, said they had seen rapid export license approvals. At least 35,000 civilians were evacuated from besieged Ukrainian cities on Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, adding that three humanitarian corridors had allowed residents to leave the cities of Sumy, Enerhodar and areas around Kyiv. Evacuations will hopefully continue on Thursday with three more routes set to open out of the cities of Mariupol, Volnovakha in the southeast and Izium in eastern Ukraine. The UN refugee agency UNHCR has estimated the total number of refugees at 2.1 to 2.2 million. Mining giant Rio Tinto has become the latest corporation to cut ties with Moscow saying it was ending all commercial relations with Russian businesses. “Rio Tinto is in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business,” a spokesman said in a message sent to Reuters. The announcement from the Anglo-Australian firm comes after a top executive said the company was looking for alternative fuel sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi but did not believe it can stop buying from Russia altogether. The company did not immediately respond to questions on whether it would continue to buy Russian fuel and other products through non-Russian third parties. Leading US companies like McDonald’s, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Starbucks stopped trading with Russia this week. Canada will provide Ukraine with an additional $50m in lethal and non-lethal military aid, including Canadian-made cameras used in military drones and other specialised equipment, according to defence minister Anita Anand. Prime minister Justin Trudeau earlier announced another shipment of highly-specialised military equipment to Ukraine. US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, in a phone call on Wednesday, discussed additional security and humanitarian support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, the state department said in a statement. Blinken and Kuleba also discussed Russia’s “unconscionable attacks harming population centres,” the statement said. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov about the continued provision of defensive security assistance to Ukraines military, the Pentagon said in a statement. Britain may escalate its military aid to Ukraine by sending state-of-the-art anti-aircraft missile systems. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said that “in response to a Ukrainian request” the government was exploring the donation of Starstreak high-velocity man-portable anti-air missiles, according to PA Media. Starstreak, the portable missile which works by a laser being pointed at a target to shoot down helicopters and fighter jets, would help Ukraine to “better defend their skies”, Wallace said. The weapons were in response to a change in Russian tactics, “so the Ukrainians need to, too”, the defence secretary said. He also confirmed that 3,615 Nlaw anti-tank weapons had been supplied - up from the previously-announced figure of 2,000 - and “small consignments” of the Javelin system would also be sent to Ukraine, The Times reports. In answer to questions from MPs about how long the supply decision would take, Wallace said: “We are in principle going to do it.” He acknowledged that Ukrainian soldiers would need to be trained to use the missiles. “How we are doing it [training] is sensitive,” he said. The government has already supplied Ukraine with 3,615 anti-tank weapons and soon would be sending a “small consignment” of Javelin anti-tank missiles, Wallace told MPs. Index provider Morningstar will remove Russia securities from its fixed income indexes beginning 31 March and immediately move the country from emerging markets to unclassified, Reuters reports. Earlier this week, JPMorgan - which runs the most widely used emerging market bond indexes - also said Russia will be excluded from all its fixed income indexes on 31 March. Index providers FTSE Russell and MSCI said last week they were taking similar steps as deepening sanctions and public pressure isolate Russia’s economy from western investment and trading partners. Morningstar said its indexes will remove cash and accrued interest from all Russian issuers regardless of payment status, from 9 March for all indexes except the Morningstar Infrastructure Bond Indexes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he believes Putin will eventually cease hostilities and enter negotiations after seeing invading Russian forces encounter fierce resistance from Ukrainians, according to an interview with VICE News. “I think he will. I think he sees that we are strong,” Zelenskiy told the publication. “He will. We need some time.” Zelenskiy suggested that he believes Putin will be forced to recalculate and end the conflict through negotiations, saying: “How to stop this war? Only dialogue.” The Ukrainian president said his message to Putin right now would be: “Stop the war. Begin to speak. That’s it.” “Can you trust Putin?” Zelenskiy was asked. “Trust [Putin]? Oh, no. I trust only my family,” he replied. In case you missed this earlier, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Vladimir Putin will fail in his effort to subjugate Ukraine, and will instead lead Russia into a ‘strategic defeat’ that is already unfolding. The secretary of state said: I’m absolutely convinced that Putin will fail, and Russia will suffer a strategic defeat no matter what short-term tactical gains it may make in Ukraine. You can win a battle, but that doesn’t mean you win the war. On the contrary, you can take a city but you can’t take the hearts and minds of its people and Ukrainians are demonstrating that every single day.” Watch the video from his earlier press conference below. The United States has warned that Russia could soon use biological weapons in Ukraine, rejecting Moscow’s claims that the US supports a bioweapons program. US state department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement: The Kremlin is intentionally spreading outright lies that the United States and Ukraine are conducting chemical and biological weapons activities in Ukraine. We have also seen PRC officials echo these conspiracy theories. This Russian disinformation is total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country. Also, these claims have been debunked conclusively and repeatedly over many years. As we have said all along, Russia is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine. Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating. These tactics are an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attacks on Ukraine. We fully expect Russia to continue to double down on these sorts of claims with further unfounded allegations.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the claims were “preposterous” and noted that “we’ve also seen Chinese officials echo these conspiracy theories.” Taking to Twitter, she said: This is preposterous. It’s the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent. Now that Russia has made these false claims... we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.” On 6 March, Moscow’s foreign ministry tweeted that Russian forces found evidence that Kyiv was erasing traces of the military-biological program in Ukraine, allegedly financed by the United States. The United States said Tuesday however it was working with Ukraine to prevent invading Russian forces from seizing biological research material in the country. The International Monetary Fund has approved $1.4 billion in emergency financing for Ukraine to help meet urgent spending needs and mitigate the economic impact of Russia’s military invasion. The global lender said Ukrainian authorities had cancelled an existing stand-by lending arrangement with the IMF, but would work with the fund to design an appropriate economic program focused on rehabilitation and growth when conditions permit, Reuters reports. “The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement after the meeting, predicting a deep recession in Ukraine this year. “Financing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues,” she said. Once the war was over, Ukraine was likely to need additional “large support.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the Russian strike on a maternity hospital “the ultimate evidence of genocide”. The children’s hospital and maternity ward in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol was been destroyed by a Russian airstrike this afternoon, Ukrainian officials said. Zelenskiy said children are buried under rubble and the regional governor said 17 people have been wounded. Russia’s foreign ministry has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine, Britain said. The UK’s ministry of defence said the system uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects. The United States has seen indications that Russia is dropping “dumb bombs” – unguided munitions with no precise target – on Ukraine, a senior US defence official said. They added that the US was observing “increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties”. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the city, where conditions are described as “apocalyptic”, was still being shelled by Russian troops despite an agreement to establish a safe evacuation corridor for civilians. Ukrainian authorities have said the power supply has been cut to the defunct Chernobyl power plant. The UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent concern. Still, the news is raising concerns that a lack of external power to the site could compromise nuclear safety. More than 40,000 civilians were evacuated from all over Ukraine today but authorities struggled to get people away from conflict zones around the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, a Ukrainian negotiator said. Ukrainian authorities said earlier that the corridors should allow residents of the heavily bombarded cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to leave, calling on Russian forces to respect an “official public commitment” to cease fire. Western officials warned of their “serious concern” that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv. In an assessment, they said an “utterly horrific” attack on the Ukrainian capital could be unleashed as Russian forces attempt to overcome the logistical issues that have apparently plagued troops headed towards Kyiv. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Gloria Oladipo, Maanvi Singh When a Russian spokesperson took to a podium in Moscow on Wednesday and warned of a “biological weapons programme” in Ukraine, fighters on another battlefield – Syria – understood what she meant. The anti-Assad opposition groups that still held northern Syria had heard it all before. From 2015, when Russia took a prominent stake in the conflict, and throughout the gruesome years that followed, claims that they, instead of the Assad regime, had used chemical weapons were a ready-made slur that put them on notice of an imminent assault. The allegations were made by Moscow, whenever ground forces it was supporting wanted to clear a town or city. Brutal, indiscriminate bombardment followed. So did impunity. Even in its infancy, the Russian war in Ukraine has many parallels with the conflict in Syria: barely restrained savagery, the mass flight of terrified civilians, and wanton destruction. Now the use of foreboding pretexts can be added to a growing list, which was born amid the ruins of Grozny, Crimea and Donbas and fine-tuned on the civilian population of Syria’s beleaguered north. The Pentagon and Ukraine’s leadership both disdainfully denied the Russian claim, which had been accompanied by a call for answers, and there seemed little likelihood of it cutting through an international discourse that has run heavily against the Kremlin and its disinformation programmes. It was a very different story in Syria, where each claim of chemical weapons use by rebels was received with credulity in parts of the UK and Europe and there was little interest in exposing Moscow’s lies. Winning the war of misinformation was a Russian success in Syria, in a theatre that wasn’t short of wins for a military with no one apart from outgunned rebels and jihadists willing to stand in its way. “Ukraine today is part of a much longer continuum than Syria,” a former senior Nato officer told the Guardian. “It goes back further than Chechnya – politically, in terms of foreign policy, in terms of Russia’s internal dynamics and in terms of the tactics of the Russian war machine. The only surprise over the past fortnight is quite how useless the Russian armed forces have been – thankfully. They have been utterly dire in every respect, which is very good news all round.

As Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmitryo Kuleba, accused Russia of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol, much of whose population has been without power, heat, water or phone signal for over a week, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, denounced an atrocity. “Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,” Zelenskiy tweeted. “People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Stop the killings! You have the power but you seem to be losing humanity.” Amid western warnings that Moscow’s invasion was about to become even more brutal as the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, seeks to regain stalled momentum, local authorities described the damage to the hospital – a combined 600-bed complex with children’s and maternity wards – as “colossal” and said at least 17 people had been wounded, including women in labour. The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said the city was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.” The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. Read more: Boris Johnson committed to tightening sanctions “in order to impose the maximum economic cost on Russia”, in a call with Zelenskiy. Per a statement from Downing Street, the two discussed the strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol Both leaders condemned the horrifying attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol and the failure by Russian forces to respect ceasefire agreements in humanitarian corridors. The Prime Minister noted that this was yet further evidence that Putin was acting with careless disregard for International Humanitarian Law. Johnson also “outlined the work the UK is doing to provide the military equipment Ukraine needed to defend itself,” according to the statement. In his latest address, Zelenskiy thanked Johnson for his support and urged western nations to help Ukraine “to finally secure our sky”. NATO has rejected Ukraine’s calls for a no-fly zone. “Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian bombs, or give us fighter jets so that we did it ourselves. The pause of indecision has become murderous,” Zelenskiy said. Speaking in Russian, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy decried the bombing of a children’s hospital and maternity ward in Mariupol. In an apparent appeal to Russians, Zelenskiy said: A children’s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them? Were there little Banderovites? Were pregnant women going to shoot on Rostov? Did anyone in the maternity ward humiliate Russian speakers? Or was it de-Nazification of a hospital? Switching back to Ukrainian, Zelenskiy called the bombing “beyond atrocity”, in an address posted on Telegram. “Europeans, Ukrainians, Mariupol residents, we have to stand united in condemning Russia for this crime that reflects all evil that the invaders have brought on us, on all destroyed cities: Volnovakha, Izyum, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Zhytomyr and tens of our Ukrainian cities that never posed any threat to Russia,” he said. ‘Hospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. Air bombing on a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.” The United Nations Population Fund condemned the strike on the hospital. Footage of the attack shared online by Zelenskiy shows the hospital’s windows being blown out, and parts of the structure collapsing. Ukraine confirmed that the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant has been disconnected from the electricity grid, raising concerns that a lack of external power to the site could compromise nuclear safety. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) issued a statement: The IAEA agreed with the Ukrainian regulator that its disconnection from the grid would not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located. Specifically, regarding the site’s spent fuel storage facility, the volume of cooling water in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal from the spent fuel without a supply of electricity. The site also has reserve emergency power supplies with diesel generators and batteries. Nevertheless, the lack of power is likely to lead to a further deterioration of operational radiation safety at the site and create additional stress for around 210 technical experts and guards who have not been able to rotate for the past two weeks, in effect living there around the clock. “From day to day, we are seeing a worsening situation at the Chornobyl NPP, especially for radiation safety, and for the staff managing the facility under extremely difficult and challenging circumstances,” Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said. “I repeat my urgent appeal to the forces in effective control of the plant to respect internal radiation protection procedures, to facilitate the safe rotation of staff and to take other important steps to ensure safety.” IAEA said it had also lost remote data transmission from its safeguards systems at the Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhya, another Ukrainian nuclear power plant overtaken Russia More than 1 million children have left Ukraine and fled to neighboring countries in the less than two weeks since Russia began its war on Ukraine, reported Reuters: More than 1 million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries in the less than two weeks since Russia started its invasion of Ukraine, the head of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said on Wednesday. At least 37 children had been killed and 50 injured, Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement. Russell said that she was “horrified” by the reported attack on a children’s hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where officials said a Russian air strike buried patients under rubble despite an agreed ceasefire. “This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine*s children and families,” Russell said. The bombing, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an “atrocity,” took place despite an agreed ceasefire to enable thousands of civilians trapped in the city to escape. Mariupol city council said the hospital had been hit several times by an air strike, causing “colossal” destruction. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets.” More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on Feb. 24. Moscow calls its action a “special military operation” to disarm its neighbor and dislodge leaders it calls “neo-Nazis.” Most of those who fled are women and children, as able-bodied men have been ordered by the Kyiv government to stay home to fight. Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal specialists (EODs) reportedly defuse a Russian bomb with their two hands a bottle of water. From Charles Lister, senior fellow and the Director of the Syria and Countering Terrorism &amp; Extremism programs at the Middle East Institute: More photos coming out of civilians on the ground in Ukraine as Russia’s invasion continues: Industrial conglomerate 3M announced that it is suspending its business in Russia, the latest Western company to do so following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. From Reuters: “After re-assessing our business in Russia, we have decided to suspend all business operations there,” the company told Reuters in an email, adding that its focus continues to be on the safety of its employees and their families. Rival industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc had also announced the suspension of its business in Russia, as the West continues to pressure Kremlin with severe economic sanctions. Today, Nestle as well as tobacco brands Philip Morris and Imperial Brands temporarily stopped business in Russia, with McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo making similar announcements yesterday. Russian’s delegation at peace talks with Ukraine “will not concede a single negotiating point,” reported a RIA news agency today. From Reuters: Russia’s delegation at peace talks with Ukraine “will not concede a single negotiating point,” RIA news agency cited negotiator Leonid Slutsky as telling a television station on Wednesday. The two sides have carried out three rounds of talks since the start of the Russian invasion. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is scheduled to have talks in Turkey on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, has been talking about the plan to deliver Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. In short, the plan is off. He said the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin had being talking to his Polish counterpart, and had “stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force at this time, and therefore had no desire to see them in our custody either.” Kirby went through the reasons, the US was against the transfer of combat aircraft. “First, we believe the best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression, in particular, anti-armor and air-defense. We, along with other nations, continue to send them these weapons and we know that they’re being used with great effect. The slow Russian advance in the north and the contested airspace over Ukraine is evidence alone of that.” “Although Russian air capabilities are significant, their effectiveness has been limited due to Ukrainian strategic operational and tactical ground-based air-defense systems surface to air missiles, and Manpads [shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles]. Secondly, the Ukrainian Air Force currently has several squadrons of fully mission capable aircraft. We assess that adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities. Therefore, we believe that the gain from transferring those MIG-29s is low.” “Finally, the intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in a significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with Nato. Therefore, we also assess the transfer of the MiG 29 to Ukraine to be high risk. We also believe that there are alternative options that are much better suited to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia. We will continue to pursue those options.” Systems of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that were monitoring nuclear material at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine have stopped transmitting data, said the agency today, reported Reuters. Yesterday, the same interruption of data was reported at the Chernobyl power plant amid an urgent request by Ukraine to the IAEA, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, about rotating the 210 technical personnel and guards working at the plant. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi “said he was concerned about the sudden interruption of such data flows to the IAEA’s Vienna headquarters from the two sites, where large amounts of nuclear material are present in the form of spent or fresh nuclear fuel and other types of nuclear material,” said the IAEA in a statement. The US is reportedly considering sanctions against Russian nuclear power supplier Rosatom. From Bloomberg’s Ari Natter: SCOOP: The Biden administration is considering sanctioning Russian uranium supplier Rosatom. Huge implications for domestic uranium mining and nuclear power operators. No decision has been made yet. Ukraine is preparing to potentially move its sensitive data and servers to another country if Russia’s invasion continues deeper into the country, said a senior cybersecurity official to Reuters. Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, emphasized his department was planning for a contingency, but that it is being considered at all suggests Ukrainians want to be ready for any Russian threat to seize sensitive government documents. “We are preparing the ground,” Zhora said. Plan A was to protect IT infrastructure within Ukraine. Removing it to a another country would only be a “Plan B or C”. The move could only happen after regulatory changes approved by Ukrainian lawmakers, Zhora said. Government officials have already been shipping equipment and backups to more secure areas of Ukraine beyond the reach of Russian forces, who invaded on Feb. 24 and are laying siege to several cities. Last month Zhora told Politico there were plans to move critical data out of the capital Kyiv should it be threatened, but preparations for potentially moving data abroad go a step further. Ukraine has received offers to host data from a variety of countries, Zhora said, declining to identify them. For reasons of proximity “a European location will be preferred,” he said. “There are a lot options,” he said. “All the proposals are highly welcome and worth considering.” Zhora gave few details of how such a move might be executed, but he said past efforts to keep government data out of Russia’s grasp involved either the physical transport of servers and removable storage devices or the digital migration of data from one service or server to another. Hilton Worldwide Holdings, the multinational hospitality company, said today it would be stopping all new developmental activity in Russia. Hilton also said that it had closed all its Moscow offices, citing the ongoing war in Ukraine. Here is Hilton’s full statement: Hilton joins those around the world in shock and disbelief at the tragic events unfolding in Ukraine. Our hotels have always been part of the fabric of our communities that we serve, and we take seriously our promise to positively impact the places where we live and work. In addition to the steps we have already taken to protect our Team Members and guests, we are taking the following further actions in response to the current crisis: We are donating up to 1 million room nights to support Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian relief efforts across Europe, in partnership with American Express, #HospitalityHelps, and our community of owners. We have closed our corporate office in Moscow and will ensure continued work and pay for any impacted Team Members. We are suspending all new development activity in Russia. We will donate any Hilton profits from business operations in Russia to the humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine. And as previously announced, the Hilton Effect Foundation has contributed $50,000 to World Central Kitchen and Project Hope to further assist with humanitarian aid. Hilton continues to monitor the situation as it evolves. We are keeping our Team Members and all those impacted by these events in our thoughts and hope for a peaceful resolution to this crisis.

From the Kyiv Independent: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has rejected every off-ramp offered by the US to de-escalate and has, instead, ramped up Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, reported Reuters. “We’ve sought to provide possible off-ramps to President Putin. He’s the only one who can decide whether or not to take them. So far, every time there’s been an opportunity to do just that, he’s pressed the accelerator and continued down this horrific road that he’s been pursuing,” Blinken said at a joint news conference with his British counterpart, Liz Truss. “He has a clear plan right now to brutalize Ukraine but to what end?” Blinken said, adding that Ukrainians have shown that they would not accept any “puppet regime” that Putin might try to install to replace the elected Ukrainian government. “If he tries to enforce such a puppet regime by keeping Russian forces in Ukraine, it will be a long, bloody, drawn-out mess,” Blinken said. Senior US defence officials last month assessed that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was designed to “decapitate” Ukraine’s government. Read the full article here (paywall). Nestle as well as tobacco brands Philip Morris and Imperial Brands are the latest multinational corporations to pull out of Russia as pressure mounts for western companies to take a stand given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reports Reuters: The world’s biggest packaged food group fell into line with rivals Procter &amp; Gamble (PG.N) and Unilever (ULVR.L) in halting investment in Russia, while cigarette maker Philip Morris said it would scale down manufacturing and Imperial went further and suspended it. These announcements follow similar ones from McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo yesterday that they would be suspending business in Russia. Previously, Estée Lauder and Shell announced that they were pulling out of Russia amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Read the full article here (paywall). Russia’s stock market will not open on Thursday, but the foreign exchange market, money market and repo market will open at 10am Moscow time, said Russia’s central bank, reports Reuters. An announcement on the exchange’s opening hours on Friday will be made by 9am Moscow time on Friday. The exchange has closed several times since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is 9pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: Russia’s foreign ministry has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine, Britain said. The UK’s ministry of defence said the system uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects. The United States has seen indications that Russia is dropping “dumb bombs” – unguided munitions with no precise target – on Ukraine, a senior US defence official said. They added that the US was observing “increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties”. A children’s hospital and maternity ward in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been destroyed by a Russian airstrike this afternoon, Ukrainian officials say. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said children are buried under rubble and the regional governor said 17 people have been wounded. The Guardian could not independently verify this. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the city, where conditions are described as “apocalyptic”, was still being shelled by Russian troops despite an agreement to establish a safe evacuation corridor for civilians. Ukrainian authorities have said the power supply has been cut to the defunct Chernobyl power plant. The UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent safety concern. More than 40,000 civilians were evacuated from all over Ukraine today but authorities struggled to get people away from conflict zones around the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, a Ukrainian negotiator said. Ukrainian authorities said earlier that the corridors should allow residents of the heavily bombarded cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to leave, calling on Russian forces to respect an “official public commitment” to cease fire. Western officials warned of their “serious concern” that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv. In an assessment, they said an “utterly horrific” attack on the Ukrainian capital could be unleashed as Russian forces attempt to overcome the logistical issues that have apparently plagued troops headed towards Kyiv. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today. My colleague Gloria Oladipo will continue to bring you all the developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. More than 40,000 civilians were evacuated from all over Ukraine today, but authorities struggled to get people away from conflict zones around the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said. In a post on social media, Arakhamia said: Over 40,000 women and children were evacuated from all over Ukraine in one day. Tried 100,000, but failed. Thousands of dockworkers at ports along the US west coast are refusing to handle any Russian cargo in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Dani Anguiano writes. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents about 20,000 workers at 29 ports from Bellingham, Washington, to San Diego, California, announced the policy last week, calling the invasion “an act of aggression that endangers a population of more than 40 million people”. With this action in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, we send a strong message that we unequivocally condemn the Russian invasion, said Willie Adams, the ILWU International president. West coast dockworkers are proud to do our part to join with those around the world who are bravely taking a stand and making sacrifices for the good of Ukraine. The Russian ministry of defence has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine, which harnesses the power of thermobaric rockets, Britain said. The US has seen indications that Russia is dropping “dumb bombs” – unguided munitions with no precise target – on Ukraine, a senior US defence official said. Ukrainian officials are increasingly accusing Russia of intentionally targeting civilians. Russia has insisted it is using precision munitions and hitting military targets. The official told reporters: We do have indications that the Russians are in fact dropping some dumb munitions. They added that the US was observing “increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties”. The comments came shortly after Ukraine accused Russia on Wednesday of bombing a children’s hospital in the besieged port city of Mariupol. The US official declined to comment on whether Wednesday’s hospital strike was a result of their use, saying: We don’t have visibility into their targeting process. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, were both asked today about the possibility of a no-fly zone over humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Truss pointed to the anti-tank weapons and anti-aircraft system that the UK announced today it would be supplying to Ukraine: The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between Nato and Russia, and that is not what we are looking at. What we are looking at is making sure that the Ukrainians are able to defend their own country with the best possible selection of anti-tank weapons and anti-[aircraft] systems. Blinken said he agreed with everything Truss said, later adding: If I were in president Zelenskiy’s position, I’m sure I would be asking for everything possible, in his mind, to help the Ukrainian people and, as the foreign secretary and I have laid out, both of our countries, and so many others, have done extraordinary things to make sure that the Ukrainians have in their hands the means to effectively defend themselves against this war of choice from Russia. The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 18 attacks on healthcare facilities, health workers and ambulances in Ukraine, resulting in 10 deaths and 16 injuries, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The WHO chief told a press conference: These attacks deprive whole communities of healthcare. Ukraine’s health system was proving “remarkably resilient” but the violence was creating a multi-pronged health crisis, the WHO emergencies director, Michael Ryan, said. Some 1,000 health facilities, including hospitals and health clinics, are situated within 10km of the frontlines, he said. Western officials have warned of their “serious concern” that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv. In an assessment, they say an “utterly horrific” attack on the Ukrainian capital could be unleashed as Russian forces attempt to overcome the logistical issues that have apparently plagued troops headed towards Kyiv. One western official said: I think we’ve got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non-conventional weapons, partly because of what we’ve seen has happened in other theatres. As I’ve mentioned before, for example, what we’ve seen in Syria, partly because we’ve seen a bit of setting the scene for that in the false flag claims that are coming out, and other indications as well. So it’s a serious concern for us. It is 7.30pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: A children’s hospital and maternity ward in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been destroyed by a Russian airstrike this afternoon, Ukrainian officials say. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said children are buried under rubble and the regional governor said 17 people have been wounded. The Guardian could not independently verify this. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the city, where conditions are described as “apocalyptic”, was still being shelled by Russian troops despite an agreement to establish a safe evacuation corridor for civilians. Ukrainian authorities have said the power supply has been cut to the defunct Chernobyl power plant. The national power company Ukrenergo said it was impossible to restore the power lines because of fighting in the surrounding areas. The UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent safety concern. Ukrainian authorities said earlier that the corridors should allow residents of the heavily bombarded cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to leave, calling on Russian forces to respect an “official public commitment” to cease fire. But Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko says Moscow has “largely failed” to adhere to these agreements. Civilians have been unable to evacuate from Izyum because of continued Russian shelling in the eastern Kharkiv region, said the regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, adding that buses intended to evacuate them were still waiting at the entrance to the town. Zelenskiy said the international community would be responsible for a mass “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not agree a no-fly zone and warned that the country was at maximum threat level. In his daily televised address, he said Ukrainians had shown throughout the last two weeks that they would never give in. More than 3 million Ukrainians will need food assistance, the head of the World Food Programme said. David Beasley, executive director of the UN agency, met Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, to discuss helping refugees arriving in Poland. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has been asked about the apparent fiasco surrounding the plan to deliver Polish MiG-29s to Ukraine. I think what we’re seeing is that Poland’s proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security assistance. We have to make sure that we’re doing it in the right way. Blinken said at a joint press conference with UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss. Departing from a US Nato base in Germany to fly into airspace contested with Russia over Ukraine raises some serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance. So we have to work through the specifics of these things going forward. It’s simply not clear to us that there’s a substantive rationale for doing it in the way that was put forward yesterday. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has been comparing the bombardment of Ukrainian cities with the wartime Blitz that Britain endured, Julian Borger reports. I believe one reason we’re seeing such an outpouring of support from the British people is because they’ve been through something similar, the harrowing Blitz during World War Two, which inflicted colossal suffering on the country’s people killing more than 60,000 British civilians, wounding 86,000 more, Blinken said, standing alongside UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, at the state department in Washington. It’s impossible to see the images of people seeking refuge in the Kyiv Metro in 2022 and not think of those who sheltered in the London Underground in 1942. He added: The grit, the compassionate determination that Britain exhibited eight decades ago that inspired the world, is exactly what we see in the people of Ukraine today, and it’s why we need to stand with them. Boris Johnson has described the reported attack by Russia on a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol as “depraved”. Some 17 people have been wounded after a Russian airstrike reportedly hit a children’s hospital and maternity ward in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol this afternoon, the governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said. Some of those injured included women in labour, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. He accused Russia of carrying out the strike during an agreed ceasefire period that was meant to allow the evacuation of civilians from the besieged southern city. Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special operation” in Ukraine. At least 516 civilians have been killed since Russia began its invasion on 24 February, the UN human rights office has said. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had verified 1,424 civilian casualties – 516 killed and 908 injured since the Ukraine conflict began two weeks ago – up from 1,335 reported (474 killed and 861 injured) reported on Tuesday. The real casualty figures from Ukraine are “considerably higher”, especially in government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. Most civilian casualties were caused by explosive weapons including shelling and missile and airstrikes, it said. Britain is planning to supply Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons and “a small consignment” of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine as Russian forces close in on Kyiv to the east, the UK’s defence secretary has said. The UK would also continue to supply NLAW short-range anti-tank weapons, Ben Wallace told the Commons, and had already given Ukraine 3,615 of the portable missile systems – nearly double the 2,000 figure previously disclosed. Wallace said Ukraine had already received “900 man-portable anti-air missiles” – a reference to Stingers supplied by other Nato countries – but was desperately seeking more arms as Russian forces attempted to encircle Kyiv. “The capability needs strengthening,” Wallace said. So in response to Ukrainian requests, the government has taken a decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity man-portable anti-air missiles. Later, in response to questions from MPs as to how long the supply decision would take, Wallace said: We are in principle going to do it. He acknowledged Ukrainian soldiers would need to be trained in how to use the missiles. How we are doing it [training] is sensitive. Starstreak is the British army’s equivalent to the better known US-made Stinger air-to-ground missiles that have been supplied to Ukraine by the US, Germany and the Netherlands among others since the Russian invasion. They are laser-guided with a range of 7km, unlike Stingers, which rely on infrared, and are designed to be harder to jam. An adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says women in labour and children are under the wreckage after Russia reportedly carried out an airstrike that severely damaged a children’s hospital in the southern port city of Mariupol. From Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak: Note: events are moving fast and the above footage has not been independently verified by the Guardian. Russia’s defence ministry has admitted some conscript soldiers are taking part in the Russian invasion of Ukraine – despite multiple denials by its president, Vladimir Putin. The ministry said some conscripts – soldiers compulsorily drafted into the army – had been taken prisoner by the Ukrainian army. We have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia. Just yesterday, Putin had said Russia would not use any conscript soldiers in Ukraine in a televised message to mark International Women’s Day: I emphasise that conscript soldiers are not participating in hostilities and will not participate in them. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says children are buried under rubble after a Russian airstrike hit a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Mariupol city council earlier said in a Facebook post that a children’s hospital had been destroyed by Russian forces on Wednesday. The destruction is colossal. The building of the medical facility where the children were treated recently is completely destroyed. Information on casualties is being clarified. In a Facebook video, the head of the regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said: The maternity ward in the city centre, the children’s ward and the therapy ward at the hospital - all destroyed in a Russian air raid on Mariupol. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify these reports yet. A children’s hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol has reportedly been destroyed by Russian air strikes, according to the city council. Mariupol council described the damage on the hospital as “colossal”, adding that it did not yet know any casualty figures. In an online post today, the city council said: The Russian occupying forces have dropped several bombs on the children’s hospital. The report could not immediately be verified by Reuters. Russia has denied targeting civilians in its assault on Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said it sees “no critical impact on safety” at Chernobyl after reports that Russian forces had disconnected the nuclear power plant from the grid. It also reiterated a previous statement in which it said that sufficient time has passed since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster that it can “maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply”. The 3 March statement reads: Due to time elapsed since the 1986 Chornobyl accident, the heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply. Meanwhile, James Acton, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that while the loss of power at the site was concerning, “mitigations should be straightforward”. He tweeted: He also said the risks at Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants were “much higher than at Chernobyl”. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, is due to arrive in Poland later today to meet leaders in Warsaw about the Ukraine crisis before travelling on to Bucharest. Reuters reports that she will collaborate with Poland and Romania on next steps to respond to Russia’s invasion and to reassure them of Washington’s support. But, as Joan E Greve reports on the Guardian’s US politics blog, her trip comes as the US and Poland have publicly clashed over providing fighter jets to Ukrainian forces: Poland’s foreign minister announced Tuesday that the country was “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their Russian-made MiG-29 jets to the [US] Ramstein air base and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America”. It was originally expected that the US would receive the planes and then donate them to Ukraine, but the Pentagon released a statement hours after Poland’s announcement saying that was not a feasible plan. “The prospect of fighter jets ‘at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America’ departing from a US/NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. “We will continue to consult with Poland and our other Nato allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.” A senior administration official said Tuesday night that the White House has been in consistent communication with the Polish government about how to best provide security assistance to Ukraine. “That’s a dialogue that absolutely will continue up to and as part of the vice-president’s trip,” the official said. “This is a key priority for us and for all of our Nato allies, and so we expect that we will continue talking about how to achieve this really important objective.” Ramstein air base in south-western Germany is headquarters for the US air forces in Europe and Nato allied air command. The head of the World Food Programme has said it will need to help over three million people from Ukraine with food donations. David Beasley, executive director of the UN agency, spoke in Warsaw where he met Poland’s foreign minister Zbigniew Rau to discuss helping refugees arriving in Poland, reports Reuters. BBC Kyiv correspondent, James Waterhouse, reports a “mixed picture” on humanitarian corridors, saying some have made it from Irpin to Kyiv, but others are trapped in Bucha. Waterhouse also reports shelling blocking the Mariupol route. Guardian journalist Luke Harding reports on comments from the deputy mayor of Mariupol, Sergei Orlov, who has just been speaking: Civilians have been unable to evacuate from the Ukrainian town of Izyum because of Russian shelling in the eastern Kharkiv region, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said. An evacuation of civilians was scheduled to take place today from Izyum to Lozova as one of the six “humanitarian corridors” today, but Synehubov said buses were still waiting at the entrance to the town. He added that negotiations with the Russians were under way with the support of the Red Cross. The loss of power at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine does not have any critical impact on safety, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. In a statement this afternoon, the IAEA said: Heat load of spent fuel storage pool and volume of cooling water at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sufficient for effective heat removal without need for electrical supply. French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said France is in contact with the IAEA to assess the situation at Chernobyl. France has asked Russia to cooperate, he said: We are trying to clarify these reports together with the International Atomic Energy Agency. A German environment ministry spokesperson said Germany had no knowledge of radiation leaking from the Chernobyl plant. A local Kyiv orchestra performed the Ukrainian national anthem as Russian forces advance on the capital city from several directions. The Kyiv-Classic Symphony Orchestra played to a small crowd on Kyiv’s central Maidan Square today, who applauded when the national anthem was finished and a woman cried out: “To Ukraine!” The orchestra also played an excerpt from Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy”, on which the European Union’s anthem is based. Boris Johnson has refused to drop visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the country as Russian forces continued to bombard Ukraine’s towns and cities. The European Union has allowed visa-free travel for Ukrainians, but the UK prime minister insisted that the UK was right to require the paperwork to be completed. Speaking in the Commons today, Johnson said: We’ve already got 1,000 people in under the existing scheme, that number will climb very sharply. No one has been turned away. Johnson said security checks were vital to prevent Russian agents from entering the UK. We know how unscrupulous Putin can be in his methods, it would not be right to expose this country to unnecessary security risk and we will not do it. We are going to be as generous as we can possibly be, but we must have checks. Meanwhile, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, promised extra military equipment for the Ukrainian forces, with fresh supplies of anti-tank missiles and the possibility of anti-aircraft systems.

Ukrainian service personnel are also seen inspecting captured boxes of ammunition in the footage, which was filmed on Tuesday after Russian bombing of the north-east city of Sumy killed at least 21 civilians, including two children. More than 400,000 people are being “held hostage” in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol by Russian forces who are blocking humanitarian aid and evacuation, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said. Conditions in the port of Mariupol have been described as “apocalyptic”. Hundreds of thousands of residents there have been sheltering from brutal Russian shelling and missile attacks for more than a week without water, power or heating. Phone signals are also down. Attempts on Tuesday to begin the process of bussing about half the besieged city’s 400,000 desperate inhabitants out via a “humanitarian corridor” were abandoned after the Ukrainian government accused Russian forces of shelling it. Ukraine has appealed to Russian forces to observe their “official public commitment” to hold their fire during a 12-hour window today, in order to evacuate civilians. Kuleba accused Russia of holding 400,000 residents of Mariupol hostage by shelling the city despite efforts to establish a safe evacuation corridor. Almost 3,000 newborn babies lack medicine and food. Russia continues holding hostage over 400,000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues. Ukraine’s foreign minister has called for a ceasefire to allow repairs to be carried out to restore the electricity supply to Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s state power operator earlier said Russian forces had disconnected the nuclear power plant from the grid, Reuters reported. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company, warned the situation could lead to the release of radioactive substances from the plant. It warned in a Telegram post: The wind can transfer the radioactive cloud to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Europe. If the situation continued, “all personnel there will receive a dangerous dose of radiation”, it continued. Work to repair the connection and restore power to the plant, which has been occupied by Russian troops, had not been possible because fighting was under way, it said. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said reserve diesel generators at Chernobyl nuclear power plant had a 48-hour capacity. After that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent. A convoy of civilians, consisting mainly of women, children and the elderly, have been evacuated from the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar through a “humanitarian corridor” after a temporary ceasefire was agreed with Russian forces, its mayor said. Enerhodar is the site of Europe’s largest nuclear power station, which has been held by Russian troops since they captured the plant late last week. Mayor Dmytro Orlov said “mostly women and children, the elderly, left the city”. Orlov earlier welcomed the announcement of a humanitarian corridor to and from the town, and said insulin, some medicines and food would be delivered to the city. More than 400 Ukrainians who protested against the occupation of Kherson by Russian forces have been detained by Russia’s national guard, Ukraine’s military high command said. In a statement, the Ukrainian military high command said hundreds had been arrested for protesting in the now Russian-occupied Kherson. Due to the furious resistance of the residents of Kherson, the occupiers are attempting to introduce an administrative-police regime. Russia has repeated allegations that the United States supported a military biological programme in Ukraine involving deadly pathogens including plague and anthrax – claims that the Pentagon has described as “absurd”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said evidence of the alleged programme had been uncovered in Russia during what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Zakharova said: We can already conclude that in Ukrainian biological laboratories in direct proximity to the territory of our country, development of components of biological weapons was being carried out. She went on to allege that Russia had documents showing that the Ukrainian health ministry had ordered the destruction of samples of plague, cholera, anthrax and other pathogens after 24 February. Both the Pentagon and the Ukrainian government has strongly denied these allegations, and Reuters reports that it was not possible to independently confirm the authenticity of any such documents. Zakharova said the alleged programme was financed by the Pentagon, and demanded transparency from Washington. We are not talking here about peaceful uses or scientific goals ... What were you up to there? Russia “demands details”, she continued: The US Defence Department and the presidential administration of the United States are obliged to officially explain to the global community, officially, not through talking heads, about the programmes in Ukraine. In response to earlier Russian allegations about the purported military biological programme in Ukraine, a Pentagon spokesperson said on Tuesday: This absurd Russian misinformation is patently false. A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson said Ukraine “strictly denies any such allegation”. Following Zakharova’s remarks earlier today, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia considers its claims that Ukraine conducted military biological programmes as an important issue for the whole world. Hello from London, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Lumen Technologies, one of the companies that comprises the backbone of the internet, said on Tuesday it was pulling the plug on Russia because of an “increased security risk”. Lumen attempted to downplay the impact of the decision, saying in a brief statement it provides “extremely small and very limited” business services in Russia. But it is part of the network that allows data to flow through the infrastructure of the internet. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that the international community would be responsible for a mass “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not agree a no-fly zone and warned that the country was at maximum threat level. In his daily televised address, he said Ukrainians had shown throughout the last two weeks that they would never give in. Ukraine’s state power operator says that Russian forces have disconnected the Chernobyl nuclear power plant from the grid, reports Reuters. Kyiv authorities hoped to evacuate many more people from Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, the Ukrainian capital’s deputy mayor said today. He also said that heat, water, power supplies and phone connections were working normally in Kyiv. EU member states have agreed new sanctions against Russian leaders and oligarchs over the invasion of Ukraine, reports Reuters. The French presidency of the EU said members approved the sanctions at a meeting and that they would be formally adopted by the EU summit on Thursday and Friday in Versailles. The Russian foreign ministry has claimed that its goals in Ukraine would be better achieved through talks and that it does not plan to overthrow the country’s government, reports Reuters. It said about 140,000 Ukrainians had fled to Russia and that its actions in Ukraine were strictly following its plan. Congressional leaders in the US reached a bipartisan deal early this morning to provide $13.6bn to help Ukraine and European allies. The president, Joe Biden, originally requested $10bn for military, humanitarian and economic aid, but the backing from both parties was so strong that the figure climbed to $12bn on Monday and $13.6bn yesterday. Ukraine’s government has banned exports of rye, barley, buckwheat, millet, sugar, salt, and meat until the end of this year, according to a cabinet resolution published on Wednesday. It will put food security across Europe into sharp focus, leading to shortages of grain and price rises of staples including bread. Civilians have started leaving Sumy in private cars after a “humanitarian corridor” was established for a second consecutive day. The mayor of the north-eastern city, Oleksandr Lysenko, made the announcement in televised comments. EU leaders gathering for a summit in Versailles on Thursday and Friday will say that Russia’s aggression “constitutes a tectonic shift in European history”, according to a draft communique seen by the Guardian. They will decide, the draft statement says, to “take more responsibility for security and take further decisive steps towards building our European sovereignty”. A Russian airstrike that reportedly killed 47 civilians as they queued for bread in Chernihiv on Thursday may constitute a war crime, an investigation by Amnesty International has found. At around 12.15pm on 3 March a square was hit by multiple bombs, killing civilians and severely damaging buildings. The number of people who have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion has reached 2.1-2.2 million people, the UN refugee agency said today. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said during a visit to Stockholm that rather than talking about which countries refugees will go to, “the time is now to try to help at the border”. Britain has announced a series of new aviation sanctions, giving the government power to detain any Russian aircraft in the UK. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister has said that Russian armed forces have agreed to stop firing in areas of humanitarian corridors from 9am to 9pm local time (7am-7pm GMT) today. Iryna Vereshchuk said the evacuation corridors would be open on Wednesday in several areas including Mariupol, but warned Russian forces against shooting in those areas. That’s it from me for now. Handing over to Leonie Chao-Fong. Thanks for reading. Lumen Technologies, one of the companies that comprises the backbone of the internet, said on Tuesday it was pulling the plug on Russia because of an “increased security risk.” It follows a similar move by fellow US firm Cogent Communications which said on Friday that it cutting internet service to Russian clients, raising concerns that Russia will be cut off from news sites and social media platforms based in the west (although the Kremlin has made several moves of its own on that front). Lumen attempted to downplay the impact of the decision, saying in a brief statement it provides “extremely small and very limited” business services in Russia. “We decided to disconnect the network due to increased security risk inside Russia,” the company said in a statement. “We have not yet experienced network disruptions but given the increasingly uncertain environment and the heightened risk of state action, we took this move to ensure the security of our and our customers’ networks, as well as the ongoing integrity of the global Internet.” Lumen and Cogent are both part of the network that allows data to flow through the infrastructure of the internet. However, access to information sources has been blocked in Russia regardless of Lumen and Cogent’s actions. Facebook and Twitter have been blocked by the Kremlin in the wake of those platforms blocking Russian state news services across Europe. Meanwhile, Twitter is launching a new service on Tor - which allows users to surf the net anonymously - that could help users circumvent the Russia ban. Twitter is launching an “onion” service which can be accessed over Tor. The Irish government has just slashed excise duty on fuel to soften the blow of price hikes in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that the international community would be responsible for a mass “humanitarian catastrophe” if it does not agree a no-fly zone and warned that the country is at maximum threat level. “Russia uses missiles, aircraft and helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. It is the humanitarian duty of the world to respond,” he said in his daily televised address, reports Reuters. He said Ukrainians have shown throughout the last two weeks that they will never give in. The new EU sanctions (reported earlier) will include travel bans and asset freezes for around 100 Russians, reports Reuters. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said a decision could be made later today. “Member states are working on a package of sanctions, around 100 people responsible at different levels of government,” he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He said he hoped for agreement “by the end of this session today”. The UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, is to make a statement in parliament on Ukraine, the house of commons leader has announced, reports Reuters. More on Chernobyl, Ukraine’s state power operator says that Russian forces have disconnected the nuclear power plant from the grid, reports Reuters. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, also called for Britain’s visa requirement to be lifted for refugees. PA reports that he told the Commons home affairs committee: I understand how sensitive it is for your society...how reasonable, how justified it is with your own system, that’s frankly for you to decide. We will be happy if all the barriers are dropped for some period of time when we can get maximum (numbers) of people, then we will deal with that. Ukrainian authorities say they do not know what the radiation levels are at Chernobyl nuclear power plant and have no control of Zaporizhzhia since they were seized by Russian troops. The energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, on Wednesday said that Ukraine has not heard about what is happening there since it was seized and that the country has no control over what is happening at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, reports Reuters. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, has suggested that fighter jets would be more useful to Ukraine than Britain sending a plane to collect refugees. Asked whether he would like to see a plane travel to Poland or Romania to bring back refugees, PA reports that Vadym Prystaiko told the Commons home affairs committee: “If you want to send planes, send F-16s.” He said the UK could expect at least 100,000 people coming from Ukraine to the UK to reunite with relatives. “I would expect 100,000 - at least - to come here to their relatives, some of them just members of families of your citizens who have no Ukrainian blood but for different reasons they have connections... which we are not aware of,” he told MPs. Kyiv authorities hope to evacuate many more people from Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, the Ukrainian capital’s deputy mayor said today. “We have places to house (refugees), we have trains to send people west,” Mykola Povoroznyk, said on television, reports Reuters. But, he added, it was unclear how many people they would be able to help escape. He also said that heat, water, power supplies and phone connections are working normally in Kyiv. EU member states have agreed new sanctions against Russian leaders and oligarchs over its invasion of Ukraine, reports Reuters. The French presidency of the EU said members approved the sanctions at a meeting and that they will be formally adopted by the EU Summit on Thursday and Friday in Versailles. They said the new measures clarify questions over cryptocurrencies, exclude three Belarus banks from Swift and target the maritime sector. The Russian foreign ministry has claimed that its goals in Ukraine would be better achieved through talks and that it does not plan to overthrow the country’s government, reports Reuters. It said about 140,000 Ukrainians have fled to Russia and that its actions in Ukraine is strictly following its plan. Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, said its goal is for Ukraine to have neutral status, which it would prefer to attain through talks, and that it hopes to make more significant progress in the next round. The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has warned against British soldiers traveling to Ukraine to illegally fight, saying it is a “dangerous situation”. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: You cannot go and fight if you’re in the British Army, you cannot just get up and go and fight. Of course that’s inappropriate behaviour and you would expect the army to have some very, very strict rules in place, as they do. Asked what Russia might do if a British soldier was captured or killed, PA reports that Shapps said: There’s a big difference between Britain sending its army in and some people who are breaking with our law and going to do it. But, clearly, this is a dangerous situation. And clearly, we want to make sure that the assistance we’re providing is done in an official way - like the anti-tank missiles that we provided prior to and during this conflict, and like the 22,000 Ukrainians that we’ve trained. Congressional leaders in the US reached a bipartisan deal early this morning to provide $13.6bn to help Ukraine and European allies, reports the Associated Press. President Joe Biden originally requested $10bn for military, humanitarian and economic aid, but the backing from both parties was so strong that the figure climbed to $12bn on Monday and $13.6bn yesterday. “We’re going to support them against tyranny, oppression, violent acts of subjugation,” Biden said at the White House. Party leaders are hoping to get the 2,741-page measure through the House today and the Senate by the end of the week, but the timing of the latter remains unclear. International students and Ukrainians were among those who managed to escape Sumy by train last night after two weeks trapped under fire in a basement with insufficient food. Around 7,000 people were safely evacuated yesterday, the BBC’s Sarah Rainsford reports. Ukraine’s government has banned exports of rye, barley, buckwheat, millet, sugar, salt, and meat until the end of this year, according to a cabinet resolution published on Wednesday, Reuters has reported. It will put food security across Europe into sharp focus, leading to shortages of grain and price rices of staples including bread. Russia and Ukraine combined are responsible for about 30% of the world’s wheat and barley exports. Ireland’s agriculture minister Charlie McConalogue told RTE that farmers, many dairy and beef producers, should consider growing grain this year. He said the country imports 60% of its grain. Exiled Belarus opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, is in London today meeting with representatives of the UK government to discuss support for the Belarusian anti-war movement and free media, she says. Here’s a recent interview with Tsikhanouskaya by the Guardian’s associate editor for Europe, Katherine Butler: Poland is ready to supply MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine - but only within the framework of Nato, an adviser to the president has said. It comes after the US rejected a proposal to provide Washington with Polish planes, reports Reuters. “The USA does not want these planes to come to Ukraine from American bases,” Jakub Kumoch, an adviser to Andrzej Duda, told public broadcaster TVP Info. “Poland is ready to act, but only within the framework of the alliance, within the framework of NATO.” Ukraine has asked western countries to provide fighter jets to respond to the Russian invasion. But yesterday, after Poland said it was ready to deploy all of its MIG-29 jets to Ramstein airbase in Germany for the US and urged other Nato members to do the same, the Pentagon dismissed the offer as not “tenable”. Civilians have started leaving Sumy in private cars after a “humanitarian corridor” was established for a second consecutive day. The mayor or the northeastern city, Oleksandr Lysenko, made the announcement in televised comments, reports Reuters. EU leaders gathering for a summit in Versailles on Thursday and Friday will say that Russia’s aggression “constitutes a tectonic shift in European history”, according to a draft communique seen by The Guardian. They will decide, the draft statement says, to “take more responsibility for security and take further decisive steps towards building our European sovereignty”. On defence, the leaders are expected to agree to “resolutely bolster... investment in defence capabilities and innovative technologies” and “increase substantially defence expenditures”. They will collaborate more and take steps to “strengthen and develop our defence industry”. There will be a commitment to continue to help Ukraine by purchasing lethal weapons for use in the war with Russia. On energy, they will agree to phase out dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports” by accelerating transition from fossil fuels, diversifying energy supply through liquified natural gas shipments, biogas and hydrogen and improving energy efficiencies and storage supplies. Not contained within the communique is any mention of the EU membership applications made in recent days by Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. A separate intervention on this issue is expected with the EU member states divided on how best to answer the calls. A Russian air strike that reportedly killed 47 civilians as they queued for bread in Chernihiv on Thursday may constitute a war crime, an investigation by Amnesty International has found. At around 12.15pm on 3 March a square was hit by multiple bombs, killing civilians and severely damaging buildings. Analysis by the NGO’s crisis response team has concluded that the attack was most likely a Russian air strike that used at least 8 unguided aerial bombs known as “dumb bombs”. Alina, a 21-year-old student who lives nearby with her family told Amnesty International: “I heard a very, very loud buzzing, and I felt our building shaking. It was as if our flat was inflating… And then after two seconds, I heard the windows get blown out into the courtyard. Our building shook a lot; I thought there would be no walls left. “When I heard the buzz, I called my grandma into the corridor with me. We laid on the ground and that’s likely what saved us.” She said her parents, who also survived, had been in the line for bread but decided to leave because the queue was too long. “The people who were in that line are no more.” Oksana Pokalchuk, director at Amnesty Ukraine, today said: “The attack should be investigated as a war crime.” The race to save Ukraine’s cultural heritage. Luke Harding in Lviv and Harriet Sherwood report: “If we lose our culture we lose our identity,” said Onyschenko, the head of Lviv’s city council heritage protection office. “Lviv has always been multicultural. Poles, Germans, Jews, Armenians and Hungarians built it. It’s Unesco listed.” She said she and her colleagues were working their way through a long list of objects that needed to be protected. Russia’s war on Ukraine has been an all-round disaster. Its army had shelled densely populated cities, killing hundreds. More than 2 million refugees have fled abroad in Europe’s biggest exodus since the second world war. In besieged Mariupol, families have spent more than a week living in desperate conditions without heat, water or power. Alongside this humanitarian catastrophe, cultural assets have been bombed and damaged. They include a museum in the city of Ivankiv, north-west of Kyiv, which housed dozens of works by the Ukrainian folk artist Maria Prymachenko, some now lost forever. Last week Russian forces shelled the assumption cathedral in Kharkiv, hurling debris into its nave. The number of people who have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion has reached 2.1-2.2m people, the United Nation’s refugee agency said today. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said during a visit to Stockholm that rather than talking about which countries refugees will go to, “the time is now to try to help at the border”. Grandi said Moldova, which is not in the EU, is especially vulnerable in the crisis. Britain has announced a series of new aviation sanctions, giving the government power to detain any Russian aircraft in the UK. Making the announcement, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss said: The sanctions will enable the UK to do the following: Detain Russian aircraft and remove aircraft belonging to designated individuals and entities from the UK register. Ban export of aviation and space-related goods and technology, including technical assistance. Further ban UK companies providing insurance and re-insurance services in relation to these goods and technology. It comes after the UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, last night said he had made it a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to enter UK airspace, tweeting: “We will suffocate Putin’s cronies’ ability to continue living as normal while thousands of innocent people die.” China has accused Nato of pushing tensions between Russia and Ukraine to “breaking point”. At a daily news briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian urged the US to take China’s concerns seriously and avoid undermining its rights or interests in handling the situation in Ukraine and ties with Russia, reports Reuters. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister has said that Russian armed forces have agreed to stop firing in areas of humanitarian corridors from 9am to 9pm local time (7am-7pm GMT) today, reports Reuters. Iryna Vereshchuk said the evacuation corridors will be open on Wednesday in several areas including Mariupol, but warned Russian forces against shooting in those areas. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine and Poland, where most refugees have fled: Twenty-two people - including three children - were reportedly killed on Monday in a Russian airstrike in Sumy. Sumy’s regional governor, Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, told the BBC that Russia bombed a residential area in the north-east of the city overnight, accusing them of “mass murder”. He told BBC Ukrainian: “Three bombs in one evening... It was a terrible night.” Nine people in a single house were reportedly killed, six houses completely destroyed and around 20 more partially so. Around 5,000 people have been evacuated from the city after a pause in bombardment to open up a humanitarian corridor. Russia has warned that it is working on a broad response to western sanctions that it claimed would be ‘swift’ and felt in the most sensitive areas, reports Reuters. “Russia’s reaction will be swift, thoughtful and sensitive for those it addresses,” Dmitry Birichevsky, the director of the foreign ministry’s department for economic cooperation, said, according to the RIA news agency. Russia has again claimed it will provide humanitarian corridors today for Ukrainians fleeing Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol, saying forces would “observe a regime of silence” from 9am in Ukraine (7am GMT). It comes as the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since world war two surpassed two million. However, as the Guardian’s Julian Borger and Patrick Wintour report, authorities in Kyiv have previously accused Moscow of shelling a refugee corridor intended for residents trying to escape Mariupol. It was also unclear whether the proposed routes would pass through Russia or Belarus, conditions previously opposed by the Ukrainian government. “The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook on Tuesday, adding that the Russian army “did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city”. The International Committee of the Red Cross said many Mariupol residents face an “apocalyptic” situation, with no water, power or heating. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said 5,000 civilians were evacuated from the Sumy region yesterday, where 21 people were killed in airstrikes. Hi, I will be looking after the liveblog for the next few hours. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@guardian.co.uk Good morning to our readers who are just tuning in. We’ve been tracking the latest from Ukraine overnight as the situation continues to unfold. Here are the main developments from the past few hours: Ukrainians looking to escape shelling could have a chance to evacuate after Russian forces said they will still firing from 10am Moscow time to provide humanitarian corridors out of Kyiv and four other cities. Several previous ceasefire promises have not been kept, however. The UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest update that Russia is struggling to breakthrough to the north of Kyiv while Ukrainian defence forces continue to shoot down Russian aircraft. The International Atomic Energy Agency has lost contact with safeguard monitoring systems at Chernobyl and has expressed concern about the welfare of over 200 workers and guards at the facility. The US government has dismissed as “untenable” a suggestion by Poland that it could make 29 of its Soviet-era MIG fighter jets available to the Americans to help defend Ukraine. But the US will be sending two Patriot anti-missile batteries stationed in Europe to Poland to bolster its defences against attack. Russia’s military is solving some of its logistical problems and could launch an attack on Kyiv within days, according to experts. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been described as a hero by the British press after he invoked the fight against Nazism in an impassioned video address to MPs to do more to help protect his country. Ukraine accused Russia of breaking a ceasefire agreement, by shelling a route intended to allow civilians to escape the besieged city of Mariupol. Residents of the port city are living without heat, water, sanitary systems or phones. The US is banning imports of Russian oil “to inflict further pain on Vladimir Putin”, Joe Biden has said. The EU has not joined the ban, but the British government promised to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Russia’s war in Ukraine is being bolstered by $285m in daily oil payments from European countries, a thinktank has found. Venezuela has released at least two Americans from jail in an apparent goodwill gesture toward the Biden administration following a visit to Caracas by a high-level US delegation. Chinese president Xi Jinping called for “maximum restraint” in Ukraine overnight and said China is “pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe” in his strongest statement to date on the conflict. The British papers have lapped up Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speech to the House of Commons yesterday in which the Ukrainian president deliberately invoked the spirit of Winston Churchill to act as a rallying cry for more help for his embattled nation. My colleague Martin Farrer has had a look at the front pages and has this story: And if you want a bit of a reminder of what Zelenskiy said, here’s a video of his address: Russia forces have failed to make a significant breakthrough to the north of Kyiv, and Ukrainian forces appear to be succeeding in shooting down enemy planes, according to the latest battleground intelligence update from Britain’s Ministry of Defence. It said on Twitter: “Fighting north-west of Kyiv remains ongoing with Russian forces failing to make any significant breakthroughs. “Ukrainian air defences appear to have enjoyed considerable success against Russia’s modern combat aircraft, probably preventing them achieving any degree of control of the air.” However, it added that “Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled by Russian forces and continue to suffer heavy Russian shelling”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will travel to Turkey on Wednesday for talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, Reuters reports. The diplomats will meet at the resort city of Antalya after repeated offers by Turkey to host talks and mediate between the two sides. The New York Times will have no reporters on the ground in Russia for the first time in a century after the news organisation joined those pulling out of the country. Russian authorities made reporting from the country impossible when it recently criminalised the act of describing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “war” with those who commit the offence facing up to 15 years in prison. As a result Russian media outlets have been forced to close, while global news organisations have pulled out their teams owing to the risk of arrest. Former NYT Moscow bureau chief, Neil MacFarquhar, said on social media Russia has always been considered a “important country, an important story” but the recent turn. had “just killed off that long tradition”. “We’ve had reporters there continuously since 1921, with one or two short interruptions due to visa hiccoughs. Not Stalin, not the Cold War, nothing drove us out,” MacFarquhar said. Some images from the evacuation of Sumy: Regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said a humanitarian corridor out of the besieged Ukrainian city of Sumy will continue to function on Wednesday, Reuters reports. About 5,000 people rode buses out of the northeastern city on Tuesday after Moscow and Kyiv agreed on the corridor. Zhyvytskyy said about 1,000 cars were also able to leave, moving towards the city of Poltava. The successful evacuation comes days after New York Times reporters witnessed a Russian mortar strike in the city of Irpin that killed four people, including a mother and her teenage son and eight-year-old daughter, as they attempted to flee to safety in Kyiv. The Ukrainian general staff says it continues to hold Kyiv despite attacks by Russian forces overnight while fighting continues across the country. The latest update says there is fighting in the north and north-west with “combat operations” taking place in Polisky and Volyn, along Ukraine’s border. It also says there is also fighting in the settlements of Nizhyn, Ivanytsia, Trostyanets and also in the city of Chernihiv. In the south it says operations are continuing to secure “airports and critical infrastructure”, while the Ukrainian airforce is targeting artillery shelling civilian ares while providing air cover. The update also alleges a propaganda campaign is underway to “aimed at discrediting the military and political leadership of our state” and that Russian forces have taken up firing positions next to hospitals in Chernihiv. The International Atomic Energy Agency says it has lost contact with Chernobyl nuclear data systems as the plant is no longer transmitting to the UN’s atomic watchdog. In a statement on Tuesday, IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said “remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chernobyl NPP had been lost,” and that the agency was currently “looking into the status of safeguards monitoring systems in other locations in Ukraine”. Grossi also raised concerns about the well-being of 210 technical personnel and guards at the plant when Russian forces seized control two weeks ago. The agency could only reach the plant by email and the staff had not been rotated out, which is “crucial for nuclear safety”. “I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety. I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there,” Grossi said. Investors are turning to clean energy stocks as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to further raise oil prices and highlights Europe’s dependence on Russian oil and gas. US markets are closed right now but on the Australian exchange the price of the Global Clean Energy ETF offered by VanEck, which tracks the price of big renewable energy companies that are on an index maintained by S&amp;P, is up more than 8% so far today. The index itself was up 5.6% overnight. The Russian market, which is heavy with oil and gas companies, has already been devastated by sanctions imposed by the US and European countries, although so far western powers have steered clear of doing anything that could stop customers paying for Russian oil and gas. Russia itself is also about to default on its sovereign debt due to the sanctions and the threat of more to come, ratings agency Fitch said. VanEck senior associate Alice Shen said the US’s decision to ban imports of Russian oil could further boost prices, adding to the attractiveness of renewables. “This trend towards clean energy stocks too will likely gain momentum as energy consumers seek substitutes for fossil fuels and the demand for renewable energy rises to meet climate change carbon emissions targets,” she said. “The Russia-Ukraine war highlights the vulnerability of countries that rely on fossil fuels, arguably raising the importance of clean energy as an energy supply and it could be an important impetus for the acceleration to clean energy globally.” Sumy mayor Dmytro Zhyvytskyi says one person has been killed, fourteen missing and others missing following shelling in Okhtyr overnight. Posting photos of the damage to social media, he reported that civilian infrastructure had been targeted including a railway station, executive committee building, local department stores and shops. Zhyvytskyi said the city is without power, water and has experienced disruption to its sewerage system. Humanitarian corridors from Sumy were opened overnight to allow residents caught in the fighting to flee. It is a new morning in Kyiv but residents in the Ukrainian capital have been greeted with air raid sirens and explosions. Any strike against supply lines from Nato members supporting Ukraine with arms and ammunition will be considered an escalation of the conflict, CBC News reports. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that while supply lines inside Ukraine were vulnerable to attack, those leading up to the border fell under the protection of the alliance. “An attack on Nato territory, on Nato forces, Nato capabilities, that would be an attack on Nato,” Stoltenberg said. There have been concern among some in US intelligence services that Russia may attempt to stem the flow of support to Ukraine with an airstrike or long-range artillery. Article 5 of Nato’s founding treaty states that an attack on one member state is an attack on all 30 members. Hello – I’m Royce Kurmelovs and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Ukraine-Russia war. Here are the main developments in the past few hours: The US government has dismissed as “untenable” a suggestion by Poland that it could make 29 of its Soviet-era MIG fighter jets available to the Americans to help defend Ukraine. But the US will be sending two Patriot anti-missile batteries stationed in Europe to Poland to bolster its defences against attack. Russian forces say they will stop firing starting 10 am Moscow time on Wednesday and are ready to provide human corridors so civilians can evacuate Kyiv and four other cities. Russia’s military is solving some of its logistical problems and could launch an attack on Kyiv within days, according to experts. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been described as a hero by the British press after he invoked the fight against Nazism in an impassioned video address to MPs to do more to help protect his country. Ukraine accused Russia of breaking a ceasefire agreement, by shelling a route intended to allow civilians to escape the besieged city of Mariupol. Residents of the port city are living without heat, water, sanitary systems or phones. The US is banning imports of Russian oil “to inflict further pain on Vladimir Putin”, Joe Biden has said. The EU has not joined the ban, but the British government promised to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Russia’s war in Ukraine is being bolstered by $285m in daily oil payments from European countries, a thinktank has found. Venezuela has released at least two Americans from jail in an apparent goodwill gesture toward the Biden administration following a visit to Caracas by a high-level US delegation. Chinese president Xi Jinping called for “maximum restraint” in Ukraine overnight and said China is “pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe” in his strongest statement to date on the conflict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/nov/09/ms-warns-more-challenging-2024-madecom-enters-administration-us-markets-midterm-elections-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-09T15:28:43Z","webTitle":"Meta to cut 11,000 jobs as Zuckerberg says he ‘got it wrong’, M&S warns of ‘gathering storm’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/nov/09/ms-warns-more-challenging-2024-madecom-enters-administration-us-markets-midterm-elections-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/nov/09/ms-warns-more-challenging-2024-madecom-enters-administration-us-markets-midterm-elections-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Meta to cut 11,000 jobs as Zuckerberg says he ‘got it wrong’, M&S warns of ‘gathering storm’ – as it happened","bodyText":"European and US shares have drifted lower, as investors are still waiting for results from the US mid-term elections. The Republicans’ red wave has failed to materialise but Florida’s right-wing governor Ron DeSantis, who would make a strong challenger to Donald Trump for the next Republican presidential nomination in 2014, has won a landslide re-election victory in Tampa. “The Republicans are on course to win only the narrowest of majorities in the House, and control of the Senate will probably be decided by another run-off election in Georgia in a month’s time,” said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. Our main stories today: Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is cutting 11,000 jobs, more than one in eight staff, after a disastrous collapse in revenue has left the company behind Facebook overstaffed and “inefficient”, the chief executive said in a note to staff. Marks &amp; Spencer has said it faces a “gathering storm”, with next year likely to be more challenging than this after reporting a near 24% fall in profits. The online furniture retailer Made.com has collapsed into administration after weeks of speculation, leading to 320 redundancies and leaving customers worried about their orders. The company’s brand, domain names and intellectual property were immediately bought by the fashion and homeware retailer Next. Shares in ITV fell steeply after the broadcaster forecast a lukewarm revenue boost from airing the World Cup, heightening investor fears that the cost of living crisis will crash the UK advertising market. The pub chain JD Wetherspoon is planning to sell a further 39 pubs after getting rid of five sites over the past three months amid a slow recovery in trading since the pandemic shut down hospitality. A strike on London Underground will halt virtually all tube services and slow much of the capital to a crawl on Thursday, in the ongoing dispute over jobs and pensions. Some London Overground and Docklands Light Railway services may also be affected by the 24-hour walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union, while buses are expected to be extremely busy and roads congested. Elizabeth Line trains will run as normal. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK The Russian steelmaker Evraz said today that its auditor EY, one of the UK’s big four accounting firms, has terminated its services because of the sanctions imposed on the company following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February. Evraz said it had been unable to find a UK audit firm willing to replace EY. Britain sanctioned the Russian firm in May, and its London-listed shares were suspended from trading. India’s Tata Motors is expecting profits and cashflow to bounce back in the second half of the year thanks to strong demand for its Jaguar Land Rover cars, and a decline in domestic steel costs. Carmakers have seen a surge in demand for cars since the pandemic, and easing costs of its key raw material, steel. Tata’s chief financial officer PB Balaji told reporters: We are seeing continued increase in the demand side at JLR. The order book is strong because of the new Range Rover, and Range Rover Sport and Defender models. The company sold 142,755 vehicles, up 69% year on year, while JLR wholesale volumes, excluding its joint venture in China, rose 17.6% to 75,307. This was below analysts’ expectations because of chip shortages. Tata, India’s third-largest carmaker, has doubled its market share in passenger vehicles to 14% over the past two years, according to India’s Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. At the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, nuclear energy supporters are arguing that atomic power can play a safe and cost-efficient role in decarbonising the planet, Reuters reports. The International Atomic Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that promotes nuclear power, opened an exhibit at the UN climate gathering of global leaders in Sharm El-Sheikh, for the first time in 27 years of international climate negotiations. The IAEA said: Many countries faced with sharply rising energy costs and heightened security of supply concerns are turning to nuclear power. US special climate envoy John Kerry announced the US Export-Import Bank’s formal interest in providing $3bn in financial support for a nuclear plant in Romania. He told reporters: We have a viable alternative in nuclear… This is one of the ways in which we can achieve net-zero. We don’t get to net zero by 2050 without nuclear power in the mix. Kerry also announced the creation of a carbon offset plan designed to help developing countries speed up their transition away from fossil fuels. He launched the Energy Transition Accelerator with the intention of funding renewable energy projects and accelerating clean energy transition in emerging markets. In the US, the Republicans’ red wave has failed to materialise but Florida’s right-wing governor Ron DeSantis, who would make a strong challenger to Donald Trump for the next Republican presidential nomination in 2014, has won a landslide re-election victory in Tampa. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, has sent us his thoughts on the US mid-term elections – and what they mean for US policy going forward. While the results remain too close to call, the Republicans are on course to win only the narrowest of majorities in the House, and control of the Senate will probably be decided by another run-off election in Georgia in a month’s time. Perhaps the biggest implication of the midterms is that the chances of Donald Trump returning as president in 2024 appear to have taken a hit. Despite rampant inflation and President Joe Biden’s low approval rating, the Democrats have avoided the heavy defeat that many anticipated. Although the Republicans are still expected to win control of the House, they look set for a majority of five seats or fewer, leaving presumptive Speaker Kevin McCarthy beholden to Marjorie Taylor Greene and other members of the Freedom Caucus. Recall that the Freedom Caucus scuppered McCarthy’s bid for the speakership after John Boehner resigned in 2015. Boehner’s post-retirement warning that the Freedom Caucus “can’t tell you what they’re for. They can tell you everything they’re against. They’re anarchists. They want total chaos,” could come back to haunt McCarthy. The race for the Senate stands on a knife-edge, with each party on 48 seats and the remaining four races potentially unlikely to be called for days. As happened in 2020, overall control of the Senate will probably not be decided until a likely run-off election in Georgia on 6th December. Regardless of which way that race goes, a narrow Republican victory in the House would spell the end for President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda, and the potential for further big shifts in fiscal policy. It would also raise the risks of another crisis over the Federal debt ceiling next summer although, for that reason, the Democrats are likely to try and raise the ceiling themselves during the lame duck session. The House Republicans will launch investigations of the administration and could attempt impeachment, but that wouldn’t go anywhere with the Senate set to remain close to 50-50 either way. Perhaps the most important takeaway from the midterms is the disappointing performances of many Republican candidates publicly backed by Trump, which came alongside a resounding re-election victory for Republican Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis. With DeSantis already seen as Trump’s main challenger for the Republican nomination in 2024, and tipped to beat Biden if he progressed to the final ballot, there may now be a higher chance of a Republican victory in 2024 – potentially heralding the return of market-friendly tax cutting policies, but without the chaos that characterised much of Trump’s first term. The funeral services company Dignity reported a 14% drop in underlying revenue to £204.7m in the 39 weeks to 30 September, when the number of deaths in the UK fell 3% to 469,000. Underlying operating profits fell sharply, by 68%, to £14.1m. The group conducted 58,200 funerals in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 59,900 a year earlier. The average revenue per funeral has gone down to £2,095 from £2,505, as more people opted for lower-cost funerals such as direct cremations (with no service, mourners or ceremony). As demand rose, the average price per cremation dropped to £863 from £891. Dignity noted that in the last few weeks deaths had risen almost a fifth above the five-year average, adding: The reason for this spike in the death rate is currently unknown. The impact of Covid-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021 could possibly mean we experience a fluctuating number of deaths than originally anticipated by the Office of National Statistics in 2022 and 2023. James Brumby, financial analyst at Langton Capital, tweets: Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Meta faces a “monumental task” to claw back revenue. Mark Zuckerberg’s ‘mea culpa’ statement is unlikely to do the trick of reassuring investors, instead they may be further rattled by his admission he over-estimated the company’s prospects. It’s clear he expected the surge in online advertising experienced during the pandemic to continue and under-estimated just how quickly rivals could entice users away. Given that the jobs cuts were already expected and had largely been priced in, the focus will now be on the monumental task Meta faces to claw back revenue. It faces an uphill battle in its attempt to attract younger audiences who are now dancing to the Pied Piper tunes of TikTok, or setting up groups and channels on Discord and Telegram. At the same time Meta funds are being poured down into the dark plumbing of the metaverse, and it’s highly unclear when revenues will emerge from this expensive venture. He may have taken responsibility for the current situation, but he is still using the same language of shifting resources to high priority growth areas, and the metaverse still features on that list. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, said: Shares in Meta are trading higher by more than 4% after Facebook’s parent company confirmed speculation that it is planning to slash the size of its workforce in an attempt to rein in costs amid this year’s share price plummet. Meta is cutting staff by over 11,000 this year as it grapples with softening ad revenues and cost inflation. It follows Meta’s extremely disappointing quarterly earnings report last month which sent shares down 20% after it forecast a weak Christmas quarter and higher costs next year. Meta is the latest company in the tech sector to announce major layoffs, following similar moves from Twitter, Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon lately. Within Big Tech, Meta is the standout underperformer this year, shedding more than 70% of its stock market value. Meta has also been facing criticism for betting too heavily on the Metaverse, a gamble that so far has not paid off. Its Reality Labs division, which hosts its VR headsets has lost over $9bn during the first three quarters of the year. The wider tech sector has been in turmoil lately on the back of higher inflation and rising interest rates with the removal of the punch bowl of cheap money turning investors away from tech, which has long been the stock market’s favourite sector until an abrupt sea change came about this year. Here is our full story, by UK technology editor Alex Hern. The Facebook owner Meta said it would axe more than 11,000 staff, equivalent to 13% of its workforce, as its founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted he “got [it] wrong” and things are much worse than he expected. The job losses come after thousands of layoffs at other big tech companies, including Microsoft and Twitter following the latter’s purchase by the world’s richest man Elon Musk. The pandemic boom for technology companies turned to bust this year with sky-high inflation, rising interest rates and a cost of living crisis. The first round of redundancies in the company’s 18-year history comes after its workforce peaked this year at 87,314 people. In a message to employees, Zuckerberg said that the company had over-invested at the start of Covid, banking that the increase in online activity would continue after the pandemic. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I’d expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that. He said the company would shift resources to “high priority growth areas” such as its AI discovery engine, ads and business platforms, and its metaverse project. Meta said it would pay 16 weeks of base salary plus two additional weeks’ pay for every year of service as part of its severance packages, and all remaining paid time off. Employees will also get cost of healthcare for six months and those affected will receive their 15 November vesting. The company plans to cut discretionary spending and extend its hiring freeze through the first quarter of next year. Facebook shares rose 3% in pre-market trading. “Made.com’s collapse is likely to be the first of many, with online retailers experiencing the perfect storm of supply chain pressures and a looming recession,” warned Sean Moran, insolvency partner at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau. With the company warning of job losses as early as July this year, it is clear that the business has been struggling for some time. Brand reputation and customer service are integral to the success of any business, particularly in the current climate. Operating in such a fiercely competitive space as homewares provides additional challenges. After increasingly lengthy delivery times caused by supply chain and logistic issues, it appears that many customers began to cancel orders and seek refunds. With a business like Made.com much of the value lies in its intellectual property, technology, and branding. The administrators have maximised that value by way of a sale. Popular high street retailer Next has bought the brand, websites and intellectual property after the company’s co-founder and former boss’s offer to purchase was rejected. Economic pressure continues to mount for the e-commerce sector, with the share price of online fashion giant ASOS also reportedly falling by more than 80% earlier this year, as well as the recent demise of online mattress retailer Eve Sleep. As consumers continue to tighten their belts due to of the cost-of-living crisis, retailers will have to work harder to entice purchasers, particularly for luxury or high-value items. Nicola Thompson, chief executive office of Made.com, said: I would like to sincerely apologise to everyone - customers, employees, supplier partners, shareholders and all other stakeholders - impacted as a result of the business going into administration. Over the past months we have fought tooth and nail to rapidly re-size the cost base, re-engineer the sourcing and stock model, and try every possible avenue to raise fresh financing and avoid this outcome. The brand will now continue under new owners. I hope that a reconfigured Made will prove to be sustainable and will continue to be loved by customers. Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and partner at PwC, said: It is with real regret that redundancies will need to be made. We would like to thank all the employees for their hard work. We will continue to support those affected at this difficult time, including assisting the HR team’s efforts to secure staff new roles. A small number of employees have been retained to support the orderly closure of the business. The collapse of the online furniture retailer Made.com into administration will result in 320 redundancies across the business today, according to the administrators PwC. A further 79 employees who had resigned and were working their notice have been let go with immediate effect. The business has 573 permanent employees, warehouses in the UK and Belgium, alongside offices and showrooms in London, Europe and Vietnam. The sale of the brand, website and intellectual property of the company to the fashion and homewares chain Next does not include staff. You can read the full PwC statement here. It also has some information for customers who are waiting for outstanding deliveries: Close to 4,500 customer orders in the UK and Europe which are already with carriers are being delivered. However, a large proportion of customer orders are still at origin in the Far East at various stages of production. Due to the impact of the business entering administration, these items cannot be completed and shipped to customers. In this case you will need to submit a claim in the administration, details about how to submit a claim are available in the creditor section above. Marks &amp; Spencer also said this morning that there is no threat to Christmas turkey supplies from avian flu. CEO Stuart Machin told reporters: We’ve got very strong plans in place so I think we’re in good shape. Christmas is protected around turkeys. The company typically sells one in four fresh turkeys eaten in the UK at Christmas in its food halls or M&amp;S Simply Food shops. Shares in ITV fell sharply after the broadcaster forecast a lukewarm revenue boost from airing the World Cup, heightening investor fears that the cost of living crisis is set to hit the UK ad market. The UK’s largest commercial broadcaster said on Wednesday that total ad revenues, including TV, digital and sponsorship, fell 2% in the nine months to the end of September. In its last financial report the broadcaster said it expected income to be “broadly flat” for the period. ITV’s figures show a steady deterioration in the UK ad market since the middle of the year with August down 21% and September falling 14%. Overall, third quarter ad revenue will be down 14% year-on-year. Forecasts for November and December - which with the World Cup and the annual Christmas marketing blitz traditionally means an advertising bonanza - will see a modest boost of just 3% and 5% to 10% year-on-year. “Relative to the overall UK ad market ITV has done ok,” said one senior executive at a media agency. “The problem is the rapid decline in the second half which was not expected. Overall the fourth quarter is going to be flat, and that is with a World Cup, which nobody was expecting when forecasting ad spend in the summer. When the World Cup is in June it drives double digit growth, and ITV’s December forecast will only hold up if England progress to the quarter finals and beyond. ITV will have hoped for much better.” Rattled investors sent ITV’s share price down more than 6% in morning trading on Wednesday, making it one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE-250. Strong double-digit growth at ITV Studios, which makes shows including I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here. Hell’s Kitchen and A Spy Among Friends, failed to temper market sentiment. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: The pace of transformation at M&amp;S continues to accelerate and is feeding through to some notable progress. For once, it is not the food business, but the revitalised clothing &amp; home unit which is showing the greatest signs of promise. Previously seen as a dowdy and limited shopping experience, M&amp;S has invested heavily in changing perceptions of style, while also adding an increasingly strong online alternative to the offering. Indeed, the M&amp;S app now has four million users and accounts for 32% of overall clothing &amp; home sales. For all of the progress, and even with the traditionally strongest final quarter in play, the outlook for the next year is cloudy for reasons which are largely outside the company’s control. The festive period and a rarely timed World Cup competition should provide a shorter term boost, while M&amp;S is at pains to point out that a fair proportion of its customers are ones with a higher income and age demographic. Even so, the deteriorating economic outlook has ravaged the share prices of retailers in general, and M&amp;S is no exception, with the shares having fallen by 38% over the last year, as compared to a decline of 20% for the wider FTSE-250. Despite an increasingly attractive valuation in historical terms, the tide has not yet turned in the company’s favour, with the market consensus stuck for the moment at a hold [rating on the shares]. M&amp;S shares have fallen 6% as the retailer warned of more challenging times ahead, its first-half profits fell 24% and its joint venture with Ocado slipped into the red. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It’s not been a good year for the M&amp;S share price, down over 50%, and wiping out all its gains from 2021… While the shares have slipped back in early trading today, on the back of the rise in costs and the losses in the Ocado business, some of the recent pessimism seems somewhat overdone given the changes that have taken place over the last few years under the tenure of previous CEO Steve Rowe, with the current Marks &amp; Spencer a very different animal from the business two to three years ago. The hope is that new CEO Stuart Machin will be able to pick up where Rowe left off and complete the job. So far, the signs look promising in what is set to be a challenging economic environment. Last month M&amp;S announced it would be speeding up the closure of some of its main stores, while opening more food halls. This process is expected to do this in the next three years, instead of the previous five-year timeframe. Here is some reaction to the M&amp;S results. John Coldham, retail partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said: M&amp;S is undergoing a significant turnaround as the business restructures its operations. This has consequently impacted on profits, but the retailer is putting itself on solid ground for moving forward. It is expanding its Simply Food stores which have continued to experience market share growth over the past 12 months, and has acquired its long-term food logistics partner to take full control of its food supply chain. The business will be aiming to create greater efficiency and remove contractual costs through the purchase - a tactical move as external factors are putting more pressure on supply chains. In terms of clothing, M&amp;S has introduced the hiring of outfits for up to a month to meet shifting consumer demands and combat the cost of living crisis. This provides a more sustainable and economical way for consumers to shop which may well draw in younger customers who haven’t considered the retailer previously. With an array of economic uncertainties currently being faced, including rising energy costs and interest rates, as well as weaker consumer confidence, shareholders will be hoping the investment that has been made and changes to its strategy will help M&amp;S to maintain its sparkle in the coming years. The comments came as an interactive guinea pig which has babies and a “booty shaking” disco giraffe are predicted to be among the bestselling toys this Christmas as retailers battle for custom with toy ranges tailored to suit “every budget”. With the cost of living crisis looming large, the DreamToys list drawn up by the Toy Retailers Association (TRA), features a selection of cheaper toys this year, with eight of the top 12 under £35. The cheapest item on the list is an £8 Squishmallow, a cuddly toy expected to be a popular stocking filler. Nearly £1bn will be spent on toys between now and Christmas Eve. Paul Reader, chair of the DreamToys selection committee, said that the committee had paid heed to the challenging economic climate. “We know many use the DreamToys list for guidance when it comes to making purchasing decisions and we feel we have selected the best toys to delight children this Christmas while suiting different budgets.” At the more expensive end of the list is the £65 Mama Surprise guinea pig. Careful grooming makes her heart light up and is a sign that a baby is on the way. The pups arrive behind closed hutch doors (mercifully they drop out of the roof) and in “normal” mode arrive over two days. For shorter attention spans, in “fast” mode they drop every 10 minutes. M&amp;S co-chief executive Stuart Machin said customers were definitely prioritising Christmas in their spending plans. Consumers are (cleverly) spreading out the cost of Christmas, buying gifts early so they don’t face a major squeeze in December. Several retailers have noted in recent days how shoppers, desperate to still enjoy the festive season despite the cost of living crisis, have started shopping for presents early. Katie Bickerstaffe, co-chief executive, told reporters on a call that customers have already bought about 30% of their Christmas gifts. That echoes similar trends seen at supermarket Sainsbury’s and fashion retailer Primark. George Weston, the CEO of Primark owner Associated British Foods, told Reuters yesterday: People are spreading their Christmas purchases across three or four pay days, rather than relying on cash that they have in hand in December. European stock markets are drifting lower as investors wait for more results from the US mid-term elections. The UK’s FTSE 100 index is down 24 points, or 0.3%, to 7,281. Germany’s Dax is also down 0.3%, while the French bourse has edged 0.15 lower and the Italian borsa is 0.4% higher. Oil prices have dipped after industry data showed US crude stockpiles rose more than expected last week, and amid worries about Chinese demand. Last week, there were hopes that China might move towards relaxing its stringent Covid-19 restrictions but over the weekend health officials said they would stick to the current policy in response to new infections. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has fallen 36 cents to $95 a barrel while US light crude has lost 48 cents to $88.43 a barrel. Sterling has inched up 0.1% to $1.1552 against the dollar and is flat versus the euro, at €1.1464. Wetherspoons said it was selling 39 more pubs, as sales slowed and the pub chain warned of “substantially higher” costs for staff, food and repairs. Like-for-like sales in the 14 weeks to 6 November were 9.6% higher than in the same period last year, and 0.4% higher than pre-pandemic levels. In the last five weeks, sales were up 8.9% year-on-year, but 1.1% lower than the same period in 2019. Wetherspoons fell more than 4%. The company, run by Tim Martin, said: Trading has been broadly in line with expectations, although October has been a slightly slower month. The company wants to sell 39 pubs that are close to other Wetherspoons and has sold five other outlets. Martin said: In my comments on the full year results released on 7 October 2022, I set out various threats to the hospitality industry and these continue to apply. Those caveats aside, in the absence of further lockdowns or restrictions, the company remains cautiously optimistic about future prospects. Here are our full stories on Marks &amp; Spencer and Made.com: Marks &amp; Spencer has said it faces a “gathering storm”, with next year likely to be more challenging than this after reporting a near 24% fall in profits. The clothing, food and homewares retailer said sales rose 8.8% to £5.6bn in the six months to 1 October but underlying pre-tax profits sank 23.7% to £205.5m as its Ocado online grocery joint venture fell into the red and it pulled out of Russia. The online furniture retailer Made.com has collapsed into administration after weeks of speculation, putting about 500 jobs at risk and leaving customers disappointed. The company’s brand, domain names and intellectual property were immediately bought by the fashion and homeware retailer Next. The Guardian understands that Next offered £3.4m to buy the brand but has not taken on the company’s workers or any of its stock of furniture, lighting and homeware. Made.com’s remaining 500 employees will be told the sad news by administrators at PwC between 9am and 10am this morning, reports my colleague Joanna Partridge. The failed furniture chain’s shares, which were suspended on 1 November, will be cancelled, any residual value will be distributed to shareholders and the company will be wound up. It stopped taking orders in September, and thousands of customers are anxiously waiting to see if they will get any refunds for items they have ordered. Susanne Given, chair of Made.com, said: Having run an extensive process to secure the future of the business, we are deeply disappointed that we have reached this point and how it will affect all our stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. We appreciate and deeply regret the frustration that MDL going into administration will have caused for everyone. I want to sincerely thank all our employees, customers, suppliers and partners for your support throughout the past 12 years and especially during this difficult time where we have tried so hard to find a workable solution for the company and all its stakeholders. Just last year, Made.com was valued at almost £800m when it listed on the stock exchange in June, and was heralded as the future of furniture retail. One of its founders wanted to turn it into an alternative to Ikea, leading a similar revolution in stylish and affordable furniture. Li said in 2017 that Made.com wanted to be the new Ikea, “the pioneer of the next trend of how people shop for their home”. But while the business enjoyed booming orders during the pandemic when people were stuck at home, sales fell away when Covid restrictions came to an end. The company has also been caught up in the global supply chain crisis, and customers complained about long waits and delayed deliveries of their made-to-order velvet sofas and armchairs. To help struggling consumers, M&amp;S relaunched its ‘Remarksable’ value range at the start of the year. The range includes ‘bigger packs, better value’ on 40 lines offering 5% savings per unit volume and this month it locked the prices of 100 family favourites through to 2023. The dine-in programme has been expanded to include the Gastro range in an ‘always on’ family meal deal for four, for £12. More evidence that the housing market is entering a downturn: After Persimmon yesterday, Taylor Wimpey, one of the UK’s largest housebuilders, has also reported slower sales for its new-build homes and a sharp rise in the cancellation rate, to 24% in the last six months (its second half) from 14% a year earlier. Its net sales rate for private homes fell to 0.51 from 0.91 a year earlier, “reflecting customer response to heightened levels of economic uncertainty”. It expects sales over the year as a whole to be flat compared with the previous year, but says it remains on track to deliver a full-year operating profit of £922m. Taylor Wimpey’s total order book excluding joint ventures has shrunk to £2.6bn from £2.8bn at this stage last year, and is comprised of 9,153 homes versus 10,643 in 2021, of which 79% is exchanged. Jennie Daly, the chief executive, said: We have further increased cost control, increased management controls and focused our sales teams for selling in a tougher market. Customer visits to our website continue to be at good levels, albeit with conversions taking longer. Where customers have locked in mortgage rates, they remain keen to complete their purchase. With resilient pricing in the order book and a focus on cost discipline, we expect to deliver operating profit in line with our expectations. We expect group volumes to be at broadly similar levels to 2021, given the uncertainty in the market. Higher mortgage rates will contribute to the wider cost of living challenges affecting our customers. Veteran property journalist Peter Bill tweets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Marks &amp; Spencer has reiterated that full-year profits will be below last year’s because of higher costs and pressure on household budgets, and warned that the following year will be even more challenging as it faces a “gathering storm”. The retailer reported a 24% decline in profit before tax and adjusting items to £205m for the six months to 1 October. Food sales rose 5.6% while clothing &amp; home sales were up 14%. Stuart Machin, the chief executive, said: Across all M&amp;S markets it is highly likely that conditions will become more challenging in the financial year 2024. As we enter what is traditionally our strongest quarter the business continues to trade well. In the last four weeks, trading has been in line with forecasts, with clothing &amp; home sales up 4.2%, food sales up 3.0% and international up 4.1%. In other retail news, the furniture chain Made.com has appointed PwC as administrators after failing to find a buyer, and entered into an agreement with Next to acquire the brand, domain names and intellectual property. On 1 November, it announced that it had lined up administrators and its shares were suspended from trading. The business employed about 700 people then but was in the process of making a third of them redundant. In China, factory gate prices fell last month for the first time since December 2020, and consumer inflation slowed, as strict Covid curbs, a property slump and global recession risks hammered the economy. The producer price index fell 1.3% year-on-year, following a 0.9% gain in September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Consumer price inflation slowed to 2.1% from a 29-month high of 2.8% in September, mainly driven by falling food prices. Asian stock markets are mixed, as investors await the results of the US mid-term elections, and US inflation data later this week. Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.56% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng declined nearly 1.9% and China’s Shanghai Composite lost 0.5%. The Australian market gained 06%. Our politics live blog says: Only one word is fit to sum up the results from the Senate, House and governorship races that have come in thus far: surprise. The 8 November midterm elections were expected to be rough for Joe Biden’s allies, potentially costing them control of one or both chambers of Congress. Instead, Democrats are showing surprising strength, holding on to Senate seats and beating back Republican challengers in several crucial House races. Full results are not in yet, and when the dust settles, the GOP may well have eked out the majorities they were expected to have. But it’s plain tonight has not gone as expected for many Republicans across the country – and may end up defying the historical trend of voters using the midterm elections to punish the party in the White House.

Although Johnson’s key guarantee is necessarily a political declaration, as opposed to an international treaty guarantee, the British commitment was of high value at a time of great tension, Anna Wieslander, the Atlantic Council’s northern Europe director said on Wednesday. Johnson’s visits were designed to reassure the populations of both countries that in practical military defence terms key Nato countries, if not Nato collectively, are committed bilaterally to the Nordic countries’ defence if subject to attack or sustained Russian intimidation. The UK statement goes further than any bilateral guarantees made so far by any other Nato country and is designed to cover the potentially vulnerable transition period between Nato membership application and full membership, the point at which Nato’s full article 5 collective defence protections kicks in. That transition is perceived as the moment of maximum risk for Stockholm and Helsinki and could last as long as 12 months as each of the 30 Nato states must ratify their membership. In a visit to Washington last week Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, was given a broad security assurance by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor also promised to back the Nordics’ Nato membership when the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and her Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin, travelled to Berlin last week. Björn Fägersten, senior research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, said the British offer “gives an extra layer of assurance in the event of an attack. It is written down and Boris Johnson was quite specific in terms of talking about increased deployments by the military, air force and naval operations.” Wieslander said “at a time of very high tension in the region, it is of great value, and partly because it builds on what exists already through the agreements made at the time of the setting up of the joint expeditionary force in 2015. It also sends a signal to Russia that a nuclear power is willing to do this. I would expect the US to do something similar.” The declaration could not come in the form of a fully fledged treaty since that might take as long to ratify as Sweden’s Nato membership. In a decision that cuts deep into Swedish self-identity, the ruling Social Democrat board will decide on Sunday whether to end 200 years of neutrality, although many say the cooperation between Finland and Sweden with Nato members has been so close it was tantamount to Nato membership. Leftwing critics have said Sweden is behaving like a reindeer in a herd, running in the same direction as the rest. Fägersten said the meeting of the Social Democrats governing board was “the key decision point”, and predicted the party would join the non-left opposition parties in backing membership. “The statements from former foreign ministers such as Margot Wallström and the fact that Social Democrats have brought forward the decision to coincide with Finland’s timetable suggest there will be support.” Asked if he thought Johnson was the best message carrier to take into the Swedish social democratic debate, he said: “I don’t think Brexit or Partygate will affect Sweden’s thinking. We have seen that Britain has been pretty supportive of Ukraine from an early stage, and that has increased its credibility. Britain is a pretty popular country here. We would still like you to be EU members, but we cooperate a lot.” Support for Nato membership has not trailed off in Sweden since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A poll conducted by Demoskop for the daily newspaper Aftonbladet showed support for Nato membership still rising and reaching 61 %. The same organisation’s poll published on 20 April showed 57% of Swedes in favour of joining Nato, up from 51% in March. In addition, more than two-thirds of the Finnish parliament, according to surveys, now supports Nato membership. Finland, an EU member, has managed to balance criticism of Russia with a bridge-building role with Moscow, but may find that role harder to play once inside an alliance seen as Russia’s enemy. Defence experts are stressing that Sweden could maintain its special role in advocating peace and disarmament by following Norway and Denmark, two founding Nato members, in making a condition of membership a ban on their soil of both nuclear weapons in peacetime and permanent foreign troops. In practice this does not prevent near permanent rotational forces or pre-positioning of supplies. Security service chiefs have been surprised by the lack of direct Russian disinformation efforts in the Nordic debates, and Fägersten said it was possible that future Russian interference would focus instead in one of the 30 Nato states that would have to ratify the treaty possibly over the next 12 months. He said it was also possible Russia, preoccupied by the Ukraine front, simply did not have the resources to respond to the unforeseen emergence of a new Nato flank. Asked what kind of disruption was possible, Wieslander said: “The expectations are cyberattack, disinformation campaigns, electronic jamming, intrusions in our airspace, even something more official, that they have moved Iskander missiles into Kaliningrad [a Russian exclave sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic coast], but they have played with this card before. Their methods are designed to be ambiguous.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-wagner-forces-taking-tactical-pause-in-bakhmut-says-us-thinktank","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-10T19:07:01Z","webTitle":"Wagner head says Russian forces facing ammunition shortages – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-wagner-forces-taking-tactical-pause-in-bakhmut-says-us-thinktank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-wagner-forces-taking-tactical-pause-in-bakhmut-says-us-thinktank","fields":{"headline":"Wagner head says Russian forces facing ammunition shortages – as it happened","bodyText":"As the time approaches 9pm in Kyiv, that’s all for today, after the founder of the Russian Wagner mercenary group warned about a shortage of ammunition despite increased production, and Ukrainian cities restored power following a wave of rocket attacks on Thursday. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, said on Friday he had thanked the Russian government for a “heroic” increase in production of ammunition, but that he was still worried about shortages for his fighters and the Russian army as a whole. Prigozhin also said Wagner had opened recruitment centres in 42 Russian cities. “In spite of the colossal resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces, we will go forward. Despite the sticks in the wheels that are thrown at us at every step, we will overcome this together,” he said. Most of Kyiv’s power supply has been restored, officials said, as Ukraine again responded swiftly and defiantly to the latest Russian missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure, Associated Press reports. US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its daily update on Thursday that Wagner appeared to be taking a “tactical pause” in Bakhmut. The ISW believes that Wagner is waiting until enough reinforcements of conventional Russian troops have arrived before taking a back seat in the fierce battle. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, said the energy situation was difficult following Russia’s barrage of attacks on Thursday. In a message on Telegram, he said “the energy system has suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, critical infrastructure has already been restored in the city, and water supply has been almost completely restored.” However, public transport remained closed. Switzerland’s government said it would not change its longstanding policy banning the transfer of Swiss-made arms to a third country despite growing pressure from countries to export them to Ukraine. “The federal council is committed to the values of Swiss neutrality and will continue to work to ensure the benefits of neutrality are realised,” it said in a statement. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-country board of governors backed the reappointment of Argentina’s Rafael Grossi to a second four-year term as director general, diplomats at the closed-door meeting said. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, visited Kyiv and met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. They attended a church service at St Michael’s Golden Dome Cathedral in memory of the soldier Dmytro Kotsiubailo. Thousands of people gathered in Kyiv to attend the funeral of the well-known Ukrainian military commander Dmytro Kotsiubailo, nicknamed ‘’Da Vinci’’ and hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance. Kotsiubailo, who in 2021 was awarded the top military honour of the Order of the Golden Star by Zelenskiy, giving him the title “Hero of Ukraine”, was killed near Bakhmut on Tuesday at the age of 27. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said the war in Ukraine would end at the negotiating table. Sunak said he would support Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks”. Ukraine handed suspicion notices to three former senior managers of the aircraft manufacturer Antonov for obstructing the country’s military and allowing Russia to destroy the giant Mriya cargo plane at the start of the war. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, congratulated Xi Jinping after the Chinese leader secured an unprecedented third term as president. In a telegram, Putin said he was sure the two leaders could advance their cooperation on the most important regional and international issues. The Kremlin said it saw risks of possible “provocations” in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia, after days of protests in Georgia over a “foreign agents” bill. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was watching the situation “with concern”. The war in Ukraine is driven by the interests of several “empires” and not just the “Russian empire”, Pope Francis said in an interview. The newly installed president of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, barely 10 days after he assumed power. In his first interview with a foreign TV channel, Christodoulides told Greece’s state broadcaster, ERT, that opposing Moscow’s self-styled “special military operation” put the island on the “right side of history”. Canada has banned the import of all Russian aluminium and steel products in a move aimed at denying Moscow the ability to fund its war against Ukraine. “Ukraine can and must win this war. We continue to do everything we can to cut off or limit the revenue used to fund Putin’s illegal and barbaric invasion of Ukraine,” the Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, said in a statement, Reuters reports. Here are some photographs of the scenes outside the funeral of Dmytro Kotsiubailo in Kyiv earlier on Friday Here’s a dispatch from Helena Smith in the Greek capital, Athens, after Cyprus’s new president criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Over in Cyprus the newly installed president, Nikos Christodoulides, has gone out of his way to denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, barely 10 days after he assumed power. In his first interview with a foreign TV channel, Christodoulides told Greece’s state broadcaster, ERT, that opposing Moscow’s self-styled “special military operation” put the island on the “right side of history”. “As a country that has suffered something similar, we could not have a different stance,” he said, referring to the 1974 Turkish invasion, which saw the northern third of the island being seized by troops sent in by Ankara. The invasion was ordered after Greek rightwingers staged a coup aimed at uniting the Mediterranean country with Greece – a move that prompted Ankara to invade in the name of protecting the island’s Turkish Cypriot community. Talks aimed at reuniting the island have repeatedly foundered ever since. Before last year’s invasion, Greek Cypriots enjoyed strong ties with Russia, so much so that the island had earned the moniker of “Moscow on the Med”. Limassol, the republic’s second-largest city, has long been home to a flourishing Russian community including companies closely connected to allies of Putin. The extent of the ties are such – economically, politically and culturally – that the new president’s predecessor, Nicos Anastasiades, hesitated condemning the invasion last February. Cyprus’s about–turn as an EU member state has incensed Russia, as has that of Athens. Unlike Greece, Cyprus is not a Nato member. As a member of the alliance, Greece has not only criticised the invasion but allowed US bases on its soil to be used to deliver weapons, including tanks, to Ukraine. Hours before the ERT interview was aired, Moscow’s ambassador to Cyprus, Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB operative and close Putin ally, told Russia’s state-run news agency he believed relations between the two countries were still strong despite “temporary political adventures”. In a noticeable change of tone that may speak to Moscow’s increasing sense of isolation, Zyazikov said: “I’d like to stress that the people of Cyprus were, are, and will always remain friendly with us. These are not just words … The friendship between our two peoples is based on mutual feelings of affinity between common people, on the close historic, spiritual and cultural relations between our two countries over centuries. I don’t think that any temporary political adventures can hurt this friendship.” Most of Kyiv’s power supply has been restored, officials said on Friday, as Ukraine again responded swiftly and defiantly to the latest Russian missile and drone barrage targeting critical infrastructure, Associated Press reports. In what has become a familiar Russian tactic since early October, the Kremlin’s forces struck Ukraine from a distance on Thursday while the ground battles in the country’s east largely remained mired in a grinding stalemate. The apparent aim of attacking power stations and other infrastructure is to weaken Ukraine’s resolve and compel the Ukrainian government to negotiate peace on Moscow’s terms. Ukrainian authorities scrambled to counter the consequences of the latest bombardment, part of a recurring cycle of urban smash-and-repair that has brought little change in the course of the war, which recently entered its second year. The Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the Russians were striking civilian infrastructure because they could not efficiently target Ukrainian military assets. “The Russians lack data about the location of Ukrainian troops and weapons, so they are targeting civilian infrastructure and using the same old methods of attacking civilians to sow fear and panic in the society,” he said. “Ukraine has survived the winter and Russia’s strikes on the energy system in the spring hardly make any sense.” Power and water were restored in Kyiv, said Serhiy Popko, the head of the city’s military administration. Popko said that about 30% of consumers in the capital remained without heating and that repair work was continuing. The electricity supply was restored to more than nine in 10 consumers in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region, local officials said, while power was also restored to a third of consumers in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region. In another sign of normality quickly returning, Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Friday. Marin echoed other western leaders who have accused Russia of war crimes in Ukraine and said Russian soldiers and leaders would be held accountable in a courtroom. “Putin knows he will have to answer for his crime of aggression,” the Finnish leader said during a news conference. “The future tribunal must bring justice efficiently and answer Ukrainians’ rightful demands.” Thousands of people gathered in Kyiv on Friday to attend the funeral of the well-known Ukrainian military commander Dmytro Kotsiubailo, nicknamed ‘’Da Vinci’’ and hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance. Kotsiubailo, who in 2021 was awarded the top military honour of the Order of the Golden Star by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, giving him the title “Hero of Ukraine”, died near Bakhmut on Tuesday at the age of 27. In 2014, he was seriously wounded by a tank shell in Pisky, Donetsk oblast. ‘’After recovery and three months of rehabilitation, he returned to the front, where he continued to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the Ukrainian armed forces said. St Michael’s Golden Dome Cathedral reached full capacity owing to the large number of mourners who arrived from several regions to pay their last respects and bring flowers. As a result, hundreds of people were forced to attend the funeral from the courtyard outside the church. After the ceremony at the cathedral, a military procession carried his casket to the Maidan (Independence Square) for a larger public memorial. In 2016, Kotsiubailo became the youngest commander in the history of the Ukrainian army. Zelenskiy attended the funeral at the church as well, alongside Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, who is the latest foreign leader to visit Kyiv. “One of the youngest heroes of Ukraine. One of those whose personal history, character and courage have forever become the history, character and courage of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. More than a year after the beginning of the war, the Ukrainian resistance continues to seek examples to boost the morale of its troops grappling with the bloody and uncertain battle of Bakhmut. On Tuesday, the Servant of the People party announced it had sent an appeal to Zelenskiy to posthumously grant the title of Hero of Ukraine to another soldier, the Ukrainian prisoner of war shot dead by Russian troops in a graphic 12-second clip that spread quickly across Ukraine and much of the world. The video, allegedly posted to Telegram by Russian soldiers on Monday, has led to a war crimes investigation and, within Ukraine, contention over the man’s identity, which has not yet been conclusively established because of the low quality of the video. As a result, two families, two battalions and two different home towns have each to varying degrees claimed the man as their own. Military authorities are considering exhuming a soldier’s body in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, said on Friday he had thanked the Russian government for a “heroic” increase in production of ammunition, but he was still worried about shortages for his fighters and the Russian army as a whole. Prigozhin also said Wagner had opened recruitment centres in 42 Russian cities. “In spite of the colossal resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces, we will go forward. Despite the sticks in the wheels that are thrown at us at every step, we will overcome this together,” he said. Reuters reports Prigozhin said his men had started to receive ammunition deliveries labelled as produced in 2023. He said ammunition was now being produced “in huge quantities, which cover all the necessary needs”. In the same audio message he also expressed concerns by saying: “I am worried about ammunition and shell shortages not only for the Wagner private military company but for all units of the Russian army.” Switzerland’s government said on Friday it will not change its longstanding policy banning the transfer of Swiss-made arms to a third country despite growing pressure from countries to export them to Ukraine. “The federal council is committed to the values of Swiss neutrality and will continue to work to ensure the benefits of neutrality are realised,” Reuters report it said in a statement. The Russian state-owned news agency, Tass, is reporting more words from Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, this time about Georgia and Moldova. In particular, Lavrov accused the west of hypocrisy in its attitude to the situations. Tass quotes Lavrov as saying on Russian television that “in Moldova protests against the current government are condemned”, but that the west is supporting protest in Georgia “because the opposition in Georgia reflects western interests, and the opposition in Moldova reflects other interests”. He put the blame on demonstrations in Georgia on outside interests, saying: “Events in Georgia, of course, are orchestrated from outside. This is the same desire to create an irritant on the borders of Russia.” Lavrov compared the situation to Ukraine in 2013, saying: “Moreover, the irritant in a country where the current government, just like the government of [ex-president of Ukraine Viktor] Yanukovych in 2013, thinks primarily about the economic interests of the country and refuses to join anti-Russian sanctions. Motivating not at all by the fact they are pro-Russian politicians, but by the fact of their economic and trade relations with the Russian Federation.” Also from the journey to the summit in Paris, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said the war in Ukraine will end at the negotiating table. Sunak said he would support president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be in the “best possible place to have those talks”. While the prime minister indicated that now is not the time for those peace talks, he recommitted to providing additional support to Ukraine to ensure they have an advantage on the battlefield. Sunak’s comments on his way to the first UK-France summit in five years, marked a clear divide in stance on how the war against Russia will end from that of his predecessor Boris Johnson. The former prime minister heaped pressure on Sunak, urging the UK to send jets and tanks to help Ukraine “finish the job”. Speaking on the Eurostar to Paris hours before meeting his “friend” Emmanuel Macron, Sunak said: “We’re providing training to use those capabilities. That’s all under way, as well as just helping defend themselves against the attacks that they’re facing, particularly on their critical national infrastructure. Now, that should be everyone’s focus. “Of course, this will end, as all conflicts do, at a negotiating table, but that is a decision for Ukraine to make. And what we need to do is put them in the best possible place to have those talks at an appropriate moment that makes sense for them. “But at the moment, the priority has got to be giving them the resources the training and the support they need to push forward and create advantage on the battlefield.” Security in Europe is “intertwined” with peace in the Indo-Pacific, the UK prime minister has said, as he warned China to stay out of Ukraine-Russia conflict. During the UK-France summit in Paris, Rishi Sunak and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are expected to unveil a plan for increased allied activity in the Indo-Pacific. No 10 said it will include establishing France and the UK as the “backbone” to a permanent European maritime presence there. The approach will include coordinating regular deployment of France’s Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier and the UK’s HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales carriers across the region. Sunak, speaking to reporters on board the Eurostar to the summit, according to PA Media, said Paris and London were aligned when it came to their approach to the Indo-Pacific, with both declaring they want to be “active participants in the region”. Sunak confirmed he and Macron wanted to stress to China and other countries “not to be providing support to Russia” after its invasion of Ukraine. The prime minister said he would be discussing the west’s approach to Beijing before the French president’s visit to China, a trip he said was due to happen soon. He said: “One thing that we’ve talked about previously in our G7 meetings as well, is a) about our collective economic security, but also ensuring that, as we support Ukraine, part of that is making sure that other countries – we’d urge all countries not to be providing support to Russia, or trying to circumvent sanctions.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, is the latest foreign leader to visit Kyiv, and has met the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Friday morning. They attended a church service at St Michael’s Golden Dome Cathedral in memory of soldier Dmytro Kotsiubaylo who was killed near Bakhmut on Tuesday. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said that a conversation with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in New Delhi last week was “constructive”. In an interview on Russian state TV he said he heard nothing new from the U.S. side. Lavrov said the pair spoke for 10 minutes and discussed nuclear arms issues and the conflict in Ukraine. It was the first meeting between the pair since Russia invaded Ukraine last February. “We spoke constructively, without emotions, we shook hands,” Lavrov said. “Everything I heard was a position that has already been expressed and underlined in public many times before. I gave my honest, detailed assessment about the New Start treaty, and why we saw it necessary to suspend it,” he said. President Vladimir Putin suspended the New Start nuclear arms treaty last month, accusing the United States of trying to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Russia in Ukraine. Russia said on Friday it was still in contact with Washington over the treaty, but held out little prospect of returning to it. The private mercenary group Wagner appears to be taking a “tactical pause” in Bakhmut, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its daily update. The ISW believes that Wagner is waiting until enough reinforcements of conventional Russian troops have arrived before taking a backseat in the fierce battle. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has said the energy situation is difficult after Russia’s barrage of attacks on Thursday. In a message on Telegram, he said “the energy system has suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, critical infrastructure has already been restored in the city, and water supply has been almost completely restored”. However, public transport remains closed. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors on Friday backed the reappointment of Argentina’s Rafael Grossi to a second four-year term as director general, diplomats at the closed-door meeting said.

I will be back later. Harry Taylor will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors on Friday backed the reappointment of Argentina’s Rafael Grossi to a second four-year term as director general, diplomats at the closed-door meeting said. Reuters reports the decision was a formality since there was no challenger. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s board approved his reappointment by acclamation, meaning that no vote was held and no country expressed opposition, diplomats said. The decision is subject to approval by the IAEA’s general conference, an annual meeting of all member states held in the autumn. The general conference is expected to approve it. Grossi’s current term ends in December. Earlier this week Grossi was vocal about the dangers posed by military action around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine which has been occupied by Russia since the earliest days of the war, and which on six occasions has become disconnected from external power and had to rely on emergency generators, raising the risk of an accident. Ukraine handed suspicion notices on Friday to three former senior managers of the aircraft manufacturer Antonov for obstructing the country’s military and allowing Russia to destroy the giant Mriya cargo plane at the start of the war. Reuters report the prosecutor general’s office and the SBU security service said the former officials prevented the Ukrainian national guard from building fortifications at a key airport on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv in January to February last year as the threat of Russia’s full-scale invasion loomed. The SBU and prosecutors said in statements that two of the suspects were detained and the former general director of Antonov was declared a wanted person. The suspects, who were not named, could face up to 15 years in prison. A notice of suspicion indicates to the recipient they are a person under investigation by law enforcement. The Kremlin said on Friday it sees risks of possible “provocations” in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia, after days of protests in Georgia over a “foreign agents” bill. Georgia’s parliament on Friday dropped plans for the legislation, which had triggered three consecutive days of huge street protests in the capital Tbilisi. Reuters reports the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that Moscow was watching the situation “with concern”. My colleague Pjotr Sauer has a useful explainer here on the situation in Georgia: Why did protesters in Georgia oppose the ‘Russian law’ bill? An air alert has again been declared in southern Ukraine, covering Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has posted to his Telegram channel a clip of him being interviewed, in which he discusses the current energy situation. He writes: The situation with energy supply in Kharkiv is difficult, because the energy system has suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, critical infrastructure has already been restored in the city, and water supply has been almost completely restored. The region is more than 90% healed. Electric transport does not yet have enough voltage and does not work. The energy industry is working hard to fully restore the energy supply. The air alarm that has been in place in Ukraine for just over an hour and 15 minutes has ended. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has said on Telegram that 892 people left for Przemyśl in Poland yesterday, with a further 55 internally displaced people arriving in his region on evacuation trains from the east of Ukraine during the day. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires. Suspilne’s morning news bulletin has been published on its official Telegram channel. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reports: At night, Russian troops hit the Nikopol district of the Dnipropetrovsk region with rockets and artillery. As a result of one of the hits, there was significant destruction of the energy facility, three settlements were left without electricity. There are no victims. Heat supply continues to be restored in Kyiv after yesterday’s shelling: as of this morning, 30% of houses remain without heating, the local authority reported. The entire Kharkiv region, except for a few communities, has already recovered power. There may be outages during the day. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, congratulated Xi Jinping on Friday after the Chinese leader secured an unprecedented third term as president. Reuters reports that in a telegram to Xi, Putin said he was sure the two leaders could advance their cooperation on the most important regional and international issues, the Kremlin said. “I am confident that, working together, we will ensure the expansion of fruitful Russian-Chinese cooperation in various fields,” Putin said to Xi. An air raid alert has been declared across Ukraine. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that Znob-Novhorodske in the Sumy region in Ukraine’s north-east was struck six times overnight by mortar fire. It states that no damage or casualties have been reported by the local authority. The claim has not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

The UK Ministry of Defence said the death toll from yesterday’s mass strikes stands at 11, which is two more people than the last update on Thursday from emergency services. The ministry cites Ukrainian officials. The Guardian columnist Rafael Behr has written this opinion piece on the Russian dissenters we must not forget: Last April, Masha Moskaleva, a 12-year-old girl from the Tula region south of Moscow, drew a picture in her school art class that upset the teacher. The teacher ran to the head; the head called the police; the police told the FSB, Russia’s state Security Service, which interrogated Masha. Her father, a single parent, was arrested, beaten, fined and placed under house arrest. His daughter was taken into state care. Moskaleva’s crime was “discrediting the military” – an offence passed into law after the invasion of Ukraine to criminalise dissemination of the truth. It carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Masha’s picture showed a woman and child, hand in hand, next to a Ukrainian flag. Missiles fly towards them from a Russian flag, on which is written “No to war”. Those words alone – net voine in Russian – are sufficient to trigger criminal prosecution. And not just the words. You can be arrested for holding a sign that merely hints at the slogan with asterisks – *** *****. When a repressive state’s demand for ideological uniformity meets the human capacity for free thought, the result is terror but also absurdity. As the gap between official versions of the truth and reality widens, the central power insists on ever more grotesque levels of acquiescence. Passive obedience is no longer sufficient. Citizens must abase themselves with displays of loyalty. Masha Moskaleva’s art teacher had not asked the class to draw just any picture. The instruction was to produce something celebrating the “special military operation” in Ukraine. The demand for performance of ideology, not mere submission, signals the path from authoritarian to totalitarian government trodden by Vladimir Putin’s regime since the invasion of Ukraine. The war in Ukraine is driven by the interests of several “empires” and not just the “Russian empire”, Pope Francis said in an interview published on Friday. Francis said the conflict was fuelled by “imperial interests, not just of the Russian empire, but of empires from elsewhere”. The pontiff was speaking to the Italian Swiss television channel RSI, in an interview due to be broadcast on Sunday. It is unclear what exactly Pope Francis meant by his comments. The graphic 12-second clip spread quickly across Ukraine. A Ukrainian prisoner of war, unarmed, is derided by his Russian captors, who are recording the scene. He calmly puffs on his cigarette, looks his tormentors in the face and says: “Glory to Ukraine.” Within an instant, multiple shots can be heard. He slumps dead to the ground. The video, allegedly posted to Telegram by Russian soldiers on Monday, has led to a war crimes investigation and, within Ukraine, a battle over the identity of a man hailed as a national hero and symbol of resistance. Two families, two battalions and two different home towns have each to varying degrees claimed the man as their own. Military authorities, to resolve the dispute, are considering exhuming a soldier’s body. At stake is not just a posthumous medal for valour, but the pride of claiming a figure to whom mayors and cities across Ukraine are already preparing to dedicate monuments and streets. The final verdict will not bring the prisoner back to life, but it will write his name into Ukrainian history: Private mercenary group Wagner appears to be taking a “tactical pause” in Bakhmut, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its daily update a short while ago. The ISW believes that Wagner is waiting for until enough reinforcements of conventional Russian troops have arrived before taking a backseat in the fierce battle – the most violent fight of the war. “The arrival of an increased number of conventional #Russian forces to the area may suggest that Russian forces intend to offset the possible culmination of #Wagner’s offensive operations in #Bakhmut with new conventional troops,” the ISW said. Provt Hello, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, says that Wagner forces appear to have “entered a temporary tactical pause” in the fierce battle for Bakhmut. Wagner may be waiting for reinforcements of Russian troops to arrive, the ISW said. “It remains unclear if Wagner fighters will retain their operational preponderance in future #Russian offensives in the city.” We’ll have more from Bakhmut shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: Russia unleashed its largest missile bombardment against Ukraine in three weeks in the early hours of Thursday, including six hypersonic missiles able to evade air defences. At least nine civilians were reported killed. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions were hit, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. “The occupiers … won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done.” At least six of the dead were killed in a strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 700km (440 miles) from the frontline, Ukrainian emergency services said. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the missile attack and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. The attacks also briefly disconnected Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant from the grid. Ukraine said the Zaporizhzhia plant was forced on to emergency diesel power to prevent a meltdown. It was later reconnected to Ukraine’s energy grid, operator Ukrenergo said. The UN’s nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the Zaporizhzhia plant’s safety and security. Russia’s defence ministry said it had carried out a “massive retaliatory strike” as payback for a cross-border raid last week. It claimed to have hit all its intended targets, destroying drone bases, disrupting railways and damaging facilities that make and repair arms. Ukrainian authorities insist they will continue to try to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, despite suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day. Ukraine’s national security chief, Oleksiy Danilov, has said that one Ukrainian is killed for every seven Russians, and claimed that Ukrainian soldiers are killing as many as 1,100 Russians a day. Western officials have estimated Russian casualties in Bakhmut at 20,000-30,000. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass claims security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria have foiled an assassination attempt on its internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Tass reported Transnistria’s security forces claimed Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. According to Variety, Zelenskiy had been hoping to appear on this Sunday’s telecast following on from previous cultural appearances but the request has been denied. Ukraine will take part in a European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2bn cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said. Belarus’s authoritarian president has signed a bill introducing capital punishment for state officials and military personnel convicted of high treason. The amendments to the country’s criminal code endorsed by President Alexander Lukashenko envisage death sentences for officials and service personnel who cause “irreparable damage” to Belarus’s national security through acts of treason. Russia has introduced personal sanctions against 144 government officials, journalists, lawmakers and other public figures from the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – deemed “most hostile” to Moscow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/oct/23/fukushima-reactor-water-could-damage-human-dna-if-released-says-greenpeace","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-10-23T04:34:30Z","webTitle":"Fukushima reactor water could damage human DNA if released, says Greenpeace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/23/fukushima-reactor-water-could-damage-human-dna-if-released-says-greenpeace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/oct/23/fukushima-reactor-water-could-damage-human-dna-if-released-says-greenpeace","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima reactor water could damage human DNA if released, says Greenpeace","bodyText":"Contaminated water that will reportedly be released into the sea from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant contains a radioactive substance that has the potential to damage human DNA, a Greenpeace investigation has said. The environmental group claims the 1.23m tonnes of water stored in more than 1,000 tanks at the plant contains “dangerous” levels of the radioactive isotope carbon-14, in addition to quantities of tritium that have already been widely reported. The publication of the report Stemming the Tide 2020: The reality of the Fukushima radioactive water crisis comes days after Japanese media reported that the government was close to giving its approval to release the water into the Pacific ocean, despite objections from local fishermen who say the move will destroy their livelihoods. “We cannot postpone the issue forever,” the prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, said this week. “We would like to make a decision responsibly as soon as possible.” While most attention has been focused on tritium – which cannot be removed by the on-site filtration system used by the plant’s operator Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] – Greenpeace Japan and Greenpeace East Asia said that radioactive carbon contained in the stored water would also be discharged. Carbon-14 has a half life of 5,370 years and becomes “incorporated into all living matter”, the report said. “It concentrates in fish at a level thousands of times higher than tritium. Carbon-14 is especially important as a major contributor to collective human radiation dose and has the potential to damage human DNA.” The Japanese government and Tepco refer to the water – which becomes tainted when it is used to cool the plant’s tsunami-damaged reactors – as “treated water” and give the impression that it contains only tritium, it added. Tepco’s advanced liquid processing system removes highly radioactive substances from the water but is unable to filter out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that nuclear power plants routinely dilute and dump along with water into the ocean. Greenpeace said it had confirmed with Tepco that the system was not designed to remove carbon-14. “Nearly 10 years after the start of the disaster, Tepco and the Japanese government are still covering up the scale of the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi,” said Shaun Burnie, author of the report and senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace Germany. “They have deliberately held back for years detailed information on the radioactive material in the contaminated water. They have failed to explain to the citizens of Fukushima, wider Japan and to neighbouring countries such as South Korea and China that the contaminated water to be dumped into the Pacific ocean contains dangerous levels of carbon-14. “These, together with other radionuclides in the water will remain hazardous for thousands of years with the potential to cause genetic damage. It’s one more reason why these plans have to be abandoned.” Japan’s government is expected to announce a decision on the water’s fate next week. Media reports said the project would begin in 2022 at the earliest and take decades to complete. The water at Fukushima Daiichi will be diluted inside the plant before it is released so that it is 40 times less concentrated, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said. Pressure for a decision has been building as storage space on the nuclear plant site shrinks, with Tepco estimating all of the available tanks will be full by the middle of 2022."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/05/boris-johnson-blows-cold-on-onshore-wind-faced-with-100-plus-rebel-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-05T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson blows cold on onshore wind faced with 100-plus rebel MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/boris-johnson-blows-cold-on-onshore-wind-faced-with-100-plus-rebel-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/05/boris-johnson-blows-cold-on-onshore-wind-faced-with-100-plus-rebel-mps","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson blows cold on onshore wind faced with 100-plus rebel MPs","bodyText":"Pro-green cabinet ministers are frustrated by Boris Johnson’s decision to back away from ambitious onshore windfarm plans for England, as it emerged more than 100 Tory MPs are lobbying against the policy behind the scenes. The prime minister, who is to announce his energy strategy later in the week, will announce big targets for increasing nuclear power and offshore wind, as well as exploiting more North Sea oil and gas. But he has been hit by a cabinet split over onshore wind, with Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, and Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, in favour, and others including Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, branding onshore turbines “an eyesore”. Another nine ministers sitting in cabinet – Steve Barclay, Nadine Dorries, Simon Hart, Chris Heaton-Harris, Brandon Lewis, Priti Patel, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Mark Spencer and Nadhim Zahawi – signed a letter calling for a cut in support for onshore wind in 2012. The letter was orchestrated by Heaton-Harris, now responsible for party discipline, who co-ran a campaign called Together Against Wind and wrote a manual that was a “step by step guide on opposing a windfarm in your area”. A spokesperson for Heaton-Harris would not comment on his communications with the prime minister about the issue of onshore wind. One cabinet source said those cabinet ministers and Tory MPs arguing against the expansion in England said they “should look at the polling in favour of onshore wind. They are fighting a war from 10 years ago.” The prime minister is expected to approve financial incentives to encourage communities to accept windfarms in exchange for lower energy bills, but changes to planning laws in England to make permission easier to get are less likely. One government source said: “If you strip away the theatrics, everybody is talking about community consent. The PM has spoken about that, Kwasi has spoken about that. That’s one thing ministers would want to ensure that communities are to be paid to directly share in community infrastructure close by.” He added: “The workhorse of Britain’s future energy needs is and will be offshore wind. There will be more onshore wind and it will be in windy parts of Scotland. Let’s see what happens in England.” John Hayes, the Tory MP and former energy minister who led the charge against onshore wind in 2015, warned the government against overturning the moratorium put in place at that point. “To reverse that would be extremely politically unwise but also the argument does not stand up in terms of environmental efficiency and energy efficiency,” he said, arguing against an expansion of onshore wind on the grounds of cost, protecting wildlife, and aesthetics. One Tory MP said there was a WhatsApp group of more than 140 anti-onshore wind Conservative MPs, who would make it very hard for any energy bill with stretching onshore wind targets to pass. “It’s certainly way more than his [Johnson’s] majority,” he said. Another Conservative MP put the number of rebels at more than 100, adding that the prime minister was not politically strong enough to get such proposals through his own party. But Chris Skidmore, a Tory MP who runs the net zero support group, said: “We are at a fork in the road here. We either need to double down as Kwasi is doing and saying we need secure forms of homegrown clean energy. You could say look at the North Sea – but it’s gone. We’ve extracted most of it. Fracking – we’re not the States. So what you need is the tripartite plan of wind, nuclear and energy efficiency. There is public support for onshore that there wasn’t 10 years ago.” Renewable industry sources were not downcast about the government’s plans. “[Johnson] needs to get energy bills down quickly, he’s not going to rule out onshore wind and solar. It’s a case of how you go about doing that in a way that gets it past the nimbys. He was interested in local electricity discount schemes, where the closer you live, the more you get off your bill,” the source said. It comes as energy scientists criticised Shapp’s comments, in which he claimed onshore wind would be an “eyesore” and destroy the view in beautiful areas. Dr David Toke, from the University of Aberdeen, said this is false, and that there is plenty of land, for example next to train lines, that is ripe for use. He told the Guardian: “Only a small proportion of England is classified as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Yet, for, example, there’s very few wind turbines near to motorway routes, which can hardly be classed as beautiful. As you go from England to Scotland by road or rail you will notice a definite increase in the use of land close to transport corridors for windfarms. “The rules effectively banning windfarms in England are unique to planning in the UK and are a testament to the government’s political inability to mobilise this very cheap and clean source of renewable energy to reduce our energy bills.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/dec/05/australia-news-live-greens-voting-age-minimum-politics-cost-of-living-energy-power-prices-coal-gas","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T07:51:45Z","webTitle":"PM tests positive for Covid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/dec/05/australia-news-live-greens-voting-age-minimum-politics-cost-of-living-energy-power-prices-coal-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/dec/05/australia-news-live-greens-voting-age-minimum-politics-cost-of-living-energy-power-prices-coal-gas","fields":{"headline":"PM tests positive for Covid – as it happened","bodyText":"We will wrap up the live blog there for the night. Here’s what made the news today: Labor’s internal review of May’s election campaign has concluded “the unpopularity of Scott Morrison and his government was the most significant” factor in driving Labor back into power. Scott Morrison and Marise Payne won’t be the only former Coalition ministers who will be called to front the robodebt royal commission, with ministers including Alan Tudge, Stuart Robert, Christian Porter, Michael Keenan and Dan Tehan potentially being called in subsequent hearings. China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has suggested that the bilateral relationship between the two countries “is becoming increasingly more mature and stable” as this month marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations. MyGov has launched an app, shifting away from the website-exclusive government services portal for the first time. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet said it was “pleasing to see” climate protester Deanna “Violet” Coco jailed after she blocked a lane of traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in April, and warned others against taking part in protests that “inconvenience people”. The NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, says he does not regret supporting the laws. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will work from home at Kirribilli House after testing positive to Covid-19 for the second time this year. National cabinet, which was scheduled for Wednesday, will be delayed. We will be back again with all the news tomorrow. WA introduces renewable hydrogen into network Renewable hydrogen has been introduced into Perth’s natural gas network for the first time as part of Western Australia’s renewable energy strategy, AAP reports. Natural gas company ATCO will supply about 2700 businesses and households in Perth’s south with a blend of 98% gas and 2% hydrogen from Monday. The company plans to increase the blend up to 10% hydrogen in the future. Energy minister, Bill Johnston, said hydrogen would play a lead role in WA’s transition to net zero emissions by 2050. “ATCO’s hydrogen blending project shows how emerging technology can be integrated with existing assets in the gas distribution system and balance energy needs,” he said. “Blending renewable hydrogen with natural gas creates a pathway to lower emissions and drives us towards our net zero future.” ATCO and Fortescue Future Industries also on Monday opened WA’s first renewable hydrogen refuelling station. The station can fill hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in five minutes, providing for a range of up to 500 kilometres, emissions-free. NSW Health urges parents to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease NSW Health has urged parents and young people to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease and act immediately if they appear. There have been 29 cases reported in NSW this year. A woman in her late teens has died from the disease – the third such death in NSW this year. Infections are uncommon thanks to vaccination, but NSW Health said that given there are different strains, the disease can occur in people even if they have been vaccinated. The symptoms include: Severe, unexplained limb pain Difficulty waking up High-pitched crying in babies Severe headache Upset by bright lights Stiff neck Red-purple rash which doesn’t disappear with gentle pressure on the skin NZ PM Jacinda Ardern losing ground to opposition National party The last major public poll of 2022 has underscored the tough task ahead for Jacinda Ardern’s Labour party to win a third term at next year’s NZ election, AAP reports. A TVNZ-Kantar poll released on Monday night confirms opposition party National’s ascendancy, with 38% support to Labour’s 33%. If those numbers are repeated at the 2023 election, National would govern with a majority in coalition with the right-wing ACT party, which polled 11%. Citing rising cost of living and inflation, Ardern told TVNZ there was “no question it is a difficult time to be in government”. “Our job is to crack on because we have the privilege of governing, and that is what we’re doing,” she said. The figures stand in stark contrast to where Ardern and Labour finished the year, with a 41 to 28 lead over the centre-right National. National has led Labour in the last six polls published by New Zealand’s broadcasters, TVNZ and Three. A major difference is opposition leader Chris Luxon, who took the helm 12 months ago, which correlates to the start of National’s soaring support. The former Air New Zealand chief executive recorded his best-ever personal support in the TVNZ poll at 23%. While Ardern remains ahead, she clocked her worst result of 29%. Darling Harbour live site to open for Sydney World Cup fans Sydney soccer fans will be able to watch the World Cup semi-finals and final at the live site in Darling Harbour. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced the use of the Tumbalong Park precinct for the three matches on Monday following its debut as a live site on Sunday morning when about 20,000 fans gathered to watch the Socceroos take on Argentina. Perrottet said: The thousands of people who screamed, cheered and punched the air for the Socceroos might not have their team to cheer on in the finals but the best footballers in the world are still competing for the ultimate trophy so it is fitting that we can turn the live screens back on at Darling Harbour for the finals. Final national cabinet meeting likely to be virtual after PM’s Covid result Just a quick note from Canberra – Anthony Albanese’s Covid diagnosis presents some complications for national cabinet as well, where the state and territory leaders are being asked to help solve the energy cost crisis. There had been a leaders’ dinner planned, as a bit of soft diplomacy, as well as one last gathering before the end of the year. That is obviously no longer going ahead – but the entire final national cabinet meeting on Wednesday will probably be held virtually now, which is not what Albanese wanted as he negotiates with Queensland and NSW to help cap coal prices. There’s nothing like being in the room to make some of these deals work. It’s not a hostile situation, by any means – but Albanese’s second bout of Covid makes things a little more difficult. The prime minister is isolating at Kirribilli House. A spokesman said he was up to date with boosters. The prime minister tested positive for Covid-19 today. It’s the second time this year for Anthony Albanese, after first testing positive in the first week of the federal election campaign. Albanese said he would work from home while isolating. Antoun Issa’s latest afternoon update is up now if you want to catch up on the day’s news. Poll review warns of ‘importance of Labor governing well’ The Labor election review, released today, warns that the party cannot afford to be complacent, even though the “path back to government for the Coalition appears difficult at present”. It says it is “reasonable to expect that the Coalition will target Labor-held outer-suburban and regional electorates – a strategy that Labor must anticipate and counter”. The review urges federal and state Labor to focus on delivering demonstrable improvements for communities in areas of long-standing support for Labor, as these communities must not be taken for granted: The most consistent advice received by the review for the next election was straightforward: the importance of Labor governing well. By governing well, placing a high value on internal unity and stability, and drawing together voting constituencies around well-designed policies that attend to peoples’ needs, concerns and Australia’s national interest, the opportunity to establish a long-term Labor government can be realised. Competent, trustworthy government, and parliamentarians actively and consistently engaging their constituents, will be rewarded by voters. The report makes 27 recommendations, including to clearly and consistently articulate the values of the Albanese government. It also urges the party to “develop a policy, political and communications strategy that unites growing support in inner and middle-suburban electorates alongside measures that address the needs of families and working people in outer-suburban and regional areas”. It says Labor should “aim to align the interests of inner-suburban, outer-suburban and regional voters on climate policy by demonstrating that emissions reductions and job security/economic growth are not mutually exclusive”. After the loss of the seat of Fowler – where Kristina Keneally was the high-profile Labor candidate – the review urges Labor to “begin the process of rebuilding voter trust in the seat of Fowler, and preselect a strong candidate for the next election”. And on the China front, it says: While always uncompromisingly promoting and defending Australia’s national interests and Australia’s security, both major parties should avoid unnecessarily divisive and aggressive rhetoric towards China. The report says the Labor election review team was “also obliged to address the matter of the relationship between the media and politicians”: A number of people interviewed commented on the behaviour of some of the journalists who travelled with the Albanese campaign team. It was generally suggested that, by comparison to previous election campaigns, fewer senior members of the press gallery travelled on this occasion, and that some journalists seemed determined to make their mark with “gotcha” moments. Media events were described by some as “feeding frenzies” and excessively aggressive towards Anthony Albanese … The review agrees with [WA] premier [Mark] McGowan. Politics should inspire people, not dishearten them. It is the responsibility of all political parties to uphold decency and respect. All people involved in politics – politicians, staffers, volunteers, the media and electoral officials – should talk politics up and not down, they should inspire, educate and inform people about Australia’s democracy and how they can participate in it. And now Bill Shorten is meme-ing about the MyGov app. A review of Labor’s performance in the federal election warns that the party’s loss of support in “heartland areas” is a cause for significant concern. The report, published this afternoon, also says the party won the May election “against the odds” as it faced headwinds include “partisan media advocacy favouring the Coalition”. The Labor-commissioned review was chaired by Greg Combet and Lenda Oshalem, with other panel members being Linda White and Craig Emerson. The report says the electorate decided it was time for a change when faced with “a choice between Labor’s plans for a better future and three more years of Scott Morrison”. It says while several factors contributed to the outcome, “the unpopularity of Scott Morrison and his government was the most significant”. The report says Morrison’s unpopularity was the result of a range of factors including his “failure to accept responsibility”, his “failure to understand and empathise with the experience of women”, his “failure to develop a credible climate and emissions reduction policy”, and “bellicose politicisation of the relationship with China”. However, the report includes a cautionary note: Despite the Morrison government’s unpopularity, Labor’s primary vote did not increase and in fact fell to its lowest level since 1934. The report says the factors contributing to Labor’s low primary vote were: A long-term trend downwards in the primary vote of both major parties, driven by declining trust in government, politics and politicians. Tactical voting by Labor supporters, particularly in seats contested by high-profile and well-resourced independents. The decision by the Labor campaign to focus voter attention on Scott Morrison’s shortcomings as a leader. The Labor strategy to offer a smaller and more tightly targeted set of policies, as distinct from offering a broader agenda that may have energised more soft Labor voters. The proliferation of minor party, Green and independent candidates. Dissatisfaction with Labor in some heartland seats in Melbourne and Sydney. A swing against Labor in Tasmania. The report says the election victory “conclusively affirmed the Labor campaign’s strategic judgement to maintain focus on the Morrison government’s negatives, and to present a more targeted set of policies, even if it may have moderated the primary vote”. It says the victory was notable because “difficult economic circumstances, the pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and partisan media advocacy favouring the Coalition all unquestionably advantaged the incumbent Morrison government”. The report says the unusually disparate results in individual seats, regions and states “reflect the political turbulence of recent years and the frustrations of many voters”. The results do not represent a permanent realignment of Australian politics, it says, but “the loss of support for Labor in heartland areas, as evidenced once again in the recent Victorian state election, is cause for significant concern”. 82,000 roads affected by flood-related closures in two months Official figures show more than 82,000 roads have been impacted by flood-related closures in just the past two months, AAP reports. The figures, from the Australian Climate Service and obtained by AAP, follow widespread flooding across parts of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. Since 14 October there have been 82,634 roads impacted by flood-related closures, with 6,841 roads blocked at different times during that period. The closures peaked on 16 October when 331 roads were closed, impacting supply chains. As of Friday, 44 roads remain closed nationally, including roads feeding into Victorian ports, and parts of major supply routes such as the Newell Highway near Forbes in NSW. The NSW Farmers Grenfell chair, Harvey Matthews, said the closure of a stretch of the Newell was causing a major headache for road users in his area. The pressure that it’s creating for our shire is that it’s putting all this extra traffic onto shire roads that aren’t federally funded, and roads that were never built to take B Doubles or B Triples. When we take our grain trucks out onto the road, we’re competing with the Newell highway traffic, for a space on the road to get our product to the grain site. Grenfell producer Wayne Dunford from NSW Farmers said the Newell Highway had already been closed for several weeks. It’s time and money, and it’s not only to the local farmer right now, it’s also to the whole grain industry. That’s the supply chain for livestock or grain going to feed lots south. All of it starts to multiply. The emergency services and agriculture minister, Murray Watt, has said his government is working closely with the states and local governments to get the roads moving again. He said last week: We’ll keep rolling up that support as much as we need, but I’m very conscious that the roads and infrastructure is a really big issue. The final cost of fixing the country’s roads won’t be known until all roads are repaired and reopened. China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has suggested that the bilateral relationship between the two countries “is becoming increasingly more mature and stable” as this month marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations. Speaking this afternoon, Xiao described last month’s meeting between China’s president, Xi Jinping, and the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, as “very successful”. Xiao repeated Beijing’s position that China and Australia should improve, uphold and further develop their relationship as this would serve the fundamental interests of the two countries. Xiao has been addressing the Australia China Business Council’s webinar event titled “Australia-China Low Carbon and Innovation Cooperation Forum”. Xiao adopted a noticeably warmer tone that the editorial published earlier today by the state tabloid Global Times (that was about a visit by six Australian politicians to Taiwan). Xiao said China was “ready to work together with Australia” to deepen the friendship and collaboration between the two countries. That could include joint efforts on green technology, green services and green infrastructure, Xiao said. China and Australia have the same objectives and complementary advantages in developing a low carbon economy which promises bright prospects for cooperation. The Australian ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher, told the same event climate change was one of the topics Albanese and Xi discussed at their meeting in Bali last month. Fletcher said the leaders agreed climate change was an area for further consultation and collaboration. He said Australia and China’s climate ministers also met at Cop26, and the countries intended to build on these discussions with further meetings between officials and experts in due course. Plibersek to deliver government’s response to environmental laws review The environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, will use a speech in Brisbane on Thursday to deliver the government’s response to the 2020 review of national environmental laws. Plibersek will deliver the keynote speech at a symposium hosted by the Queensland Conservation Council. The 2020 review, led by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, found successive governments had failed to properly protect Australia’s unique wildlife. It made 38 recommendations, including that a new set of national environmental standards guide decision-making about developments that affect threatened plants and animals. The Albanese government had promised it would respond to the review this year, with a package of reforms to follow in 2023. It has committed to establishing an independent environment protection agency and it is expected Plibersek’s response will propose a structure for the new agency. Dave Copeman, the director of the Queensland Conservation Council, said the Samuel review made it clear the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was outdated and Australia’s environment was in an overall state of decline: Reform of this law is long overdue, to ensure it is working in the best possible way to safeguard Australia’s natural environment for future generations. New Zealand announces Covid response inquiry A royal commission will investigate New Zealand’s Covid-19 response, with Jacinda Ardern tapping Australian-based epidemiologist Tony Blakely to lead the review. AAP reports the prime minister announced the commission on Monday, saying that “the highest form of public inquiry is the right thing to do”. Ardern said: The Covid-19 emergency was the most significant threat to the health of New Zealanders and our economy since world war two. New Zealand experienced fewer cases, hospitalisations and deaths than nearly any other country in the first two years of the pandemic but there has undoubtedly been a huge impact on New Zealanders both here and abroad. It’s critical we compile what worked and what we can learn from it should it ever happen again. Blakely is a New Zealand-born professor of epidemiology at the University of Melbourne who emerged as a familiar face during the pandemic, explaining the virus and sharing his views on various measures to audiences on both sides of the Tasman. He will be joined by former minister Hekia Parata and former Treasury secretary John Whitehead to form the royal commission. Blakely has been asked to begin work in February 2023 and finish by June 2024, meaning the commission will not report back before next year’s election. The opposition National Party welcomed the announcement, while the Greens labelled it disappointingly narrow in scope. Both parties want a specific inquiry into the economic response, given rollercoaster house prices and spiralling interest rates among Covid-19’s tumultuous effects. Australia joins pact capping price on Russian oil Australia has joined the UK, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Canada and the US, as well as EU member states, in an agreement to put a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian oil. The price cap, which comes into effect today, aims to reduce the Kremlin’s income from fossil fuels as well as curtailing Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The price cap would “immediately cut into Putin’s most important source of revenue”, the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said. But critics, including Ukraine, say the cap is toothless since it is above the price of existing Russian oil prices of about $52 a barrel. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: You wouldn’t call it a serious decision to set such a limit for Russian prices, which is quite comfortable for the budget of a terrorist state. It’s only a matter of time before stronger tools will have to be used anyway. It is a pity that this time will be lost. Russian authorities rejected the price cap and on Saturday threatened to stop supplying the nations that endorsed it. The Global Times – a Chinese state media tabloid known for its nationalistic takes on international developments – has published an article warning Australia against “playing with fire”. The article is in response to news that a group of six Australian MPs from both Labor and the Coalition is travelling to Taiwan, a self-governed democracy that China claims as a province. We are yet to see any formal response from China’s foreign ministry, and the Global Times article is relatively muted in the scheme of things. But the article includes this passage: Those who play with fire will perish by it. The politicians from certain countries who visit Taiwan to seek limelight are like [the] political god of plague and pestilence. They bring nothing but risks and tension to Taiwan and no benefit to their own countries, and they also hijack their own countries’ China policy. As the Australian MPs’ Taiwan visit is under way, it has already generated negative impacts on the China-Australia relationship. It is the first such trip by Australian MPs to Taiwan since 2019, prior to the Covid pandemic. Anthony Albanese has previously been on such a trip (when he was in opposition) but this trip includes no government ministers. When asked on Saturday about this trip, Albanese played down any suggestion it could inflame tensions with China, saying: No, there have been backbench visits to Taiwan for a long time. This is another one. This isn’t a government visit. There remains a bipartisan position when it comes to China and when it comes to support for the status quo on Taiwan. Over on Twitter, Antony Green has offered up some analysis on what teals need to do to chart a path to victory: Thanks to Cait Kelly for picking up the blog for me for the last hour while I filed a story. I’m Josh Taylor and I’ll be with you for the remainder of the news day. Alarm at gambling ads targeting children Concerns have been raised at how betting companies are targeting children with ads, with one activist going so far as to brand it “grooming”, AAP has reported. The Alliance for Gambling Reform estimates more than 430,000 people under the age of 16 are likely betting online. Rev Tim Costello said the lack of federal regulation on gambling advertising meant operators were able to “groom our kids with impunity”. And the implications will be horrific and lifelong. Costello told parliamentarians reviewing gambling reform that betting companies had built a myth around mateship, such as through the plethora of betting-with-mates ads. He said that when he first started researching the sector, he came in with the idea Australians just loved to punt and that was what led to such great gambling losses. But he’d now changed his mind, saying the losses don’t come from a culture “that loves it more than anyone else” but from a lack of regulation. Costello told the reform inquiry on Monday: The truth is, we’ve had the worst policies, the least regulation of gambling. That is why we have the greatest losses. Inquiry hears of long Covid’s toll A federal parliamentary inquiry into long Covid has heard from hundreds of Australians about lingering effects after their experience with the virus, and suggested that the government needs to collect better data to get an accurate picture of how widespread this problem is. People have complained to the committee about impacts on health, lost capacity to work, difficulty cooking or caring for children, and social isolation due to their long-term symptoms from the pandemic – with federal MPs warning that Australia “may not have seen the full scope of the after-effects of this condition.” The federal parliament’s health committee is conducting an inquiry into long Covid and repeated Covid infections. Generally, long Covid is being investigated by the MPs as “ongoing symptoms more than three months after a confirmed Covid infection”. Australia doesn’t have an accepted definition of the condition but the committee is adopting the World Health Organisation’s findings that common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction and others that have an impact on everyday functioning. In an issues paper, released Monday ahead of a final report expected in coming months, the committee said it had heard from many people suffering long-term symptoms after Covid infection, but noted that Australia’s long Covid rates may be lower currently than other comparable nations. However, the paper also flagged that Australia’s largest Covid waves happened later than those in Europe and the United States, which may be a factor. The paper also said there was only “limited reliable and consistent data available in Australia regarding long Covid”, noting differences in how different states collect data, and limitations on sharing data including privacy reasons. “The committee has heard that some of the datasets available may not provide an accurate representation of the general Australian population,” it said, such as an undercounting of people from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds. The committee said some submissions called for a centralised body in coordinating research around long Covid, and suggested that a national database and a national focus on data collection may be required. The paper said the committee would continue to investigate key questions including an Australian definition of long Covid, how to collect better data, how to boost research into these conditions, how to bring in CALD communities into this process, what healthcare professionals and government can do to manage problems, and the best management of long Covid. Hello everyone – this is Cait Kelly, I will be with you for the afternoon. A big thanks to Natasha – the blog queen. Let’s get into it! Thanks for your attention today, everyone. I hand you over to the wonderful Cait Kelly. The minister for the NDIS and government services, Bill Shorten, has launched the myGov app at the Opera House. Shorten has high hopes for the app – that it takes on the same iconic status as Sydney’s white sails. He said: Good morning everybody and welcome here to Australia’s iconic Opera House. It’s about 50 years ago that the Opera House was opened and now, 50 years on, it’s a national icon. I’m hoping that our myGov app that we’re launching here today won’t take 50 years, but I’m hoping it becomes iconic for quality government services to everyday Australians. I’m really pleased to be announcing this morning that at long last, long overdue, we now have a myGov app. Damaging wind warning for Tasmania NSW Labor may be defending the laws which have led to Violet Coco’s long sentence for a non-violent protest, but ACT independent senator David Pocock has taken a more nuanced view. In 2014, while still a Wallabies player, Pocock was arrested for chaining himself to mining equipment in a protest against a new coal mine in NSW. Now a senator, who won his seat by campaigning on increasing climate action and transparency, Pocock said the news of Coco’s sentence “gets at the challenge we have of regulating protest”. In considered and obviously thought-through comments, Pocock said he believed Coco’s 15-month jail sentence – with an eight month non-parole period – fell on the wrong side of the line balancing the right to protest and the inconvenience it caused everyday life. Asked for his thoughts on Coco’s sentence, Pocock told the Guardian: This news gets at the challenge we have of regulating protest. As a society we want to balance the importance and value of protest and civil disobedience against the inconvenience it can cause to everyday life. Anti-protest laws that result in a 15-month jail sentence, with an eight-month non-parole period and no bail during the appeal process, falls on the wrong side of that line. The right to protest is fundamental to our democracy. Many of the rights we now take for granted were off the back of people willing to risk their civil liberties to raise their concerns and push the conversation on issues that affect all of us. We look to China and Iran with disbelief at how protesters are treated abroad. But democracy is fragile and ours is not immune. We must protect our ability to disagree, to voice dissent publicly and, if needed, to protest. We don’t have to look far to see the disastrous consequences of failing to protect the right to protest. Nor to understand why so many young people are so deeply concerned about the changes global warming is causing right around them. Every time I meet a group of school kids touring Parliament House, climate change very quickly comes up as the issue they’re most concerned about. And rightly so. For so many of them they feel helpless in the face of the changes they’re already seeing. And many of them have tried the options available to them – writing to their MP, conducting local protests and huge, unprecedented strikes. And still they are not seeing the urgency or scale of action required to create a safe future. I think history will view people like Violet quite differently from the way many see her today. As Mignon McLaughlin put it: ‘Every society honours its live conformists, and its dead troublemakers.’ North Sydney apartment building evacuated due to gas leak Around 50 people have been evacuated due to a gas leak in a North Sydney apartment building. Fire and Rescue NSW is on the scene and continuing to monitor atmospheric gas levels in the area. A spokesperson said: It’s believed workers severed a gas main at the William Street site, just before 12.30pm today. NSW police helped firefighters from Crows Nest and Neutral Bay to clear the adjacent building. The fire crews have established two lines of hose as a protective measure and are monitoring atmospheric levels as gas company technicians attempt to repair the leak, which could take some time. An exclusion zone remains in place in William Street, preventing pedestrian and vehicle access to the affected area. Victorian parliament to sit for extra day in December Company profits fall as wages rise Also out today, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released its business indicators report for the September quarter, elements of which will feed into Wednesday’s national accounts. Company gross operating profits fell 12.4% in the quarter, with wages and salaries lifting by 2.9% over the three months. Business inventories – stock on shelves and warehouses – rose by 1.7%. Zooming in on the construction industry, the Australian Industry Group and Housing Industry Association’s construction activity index recorded a contraction in activity for the sixth month in a row. The 48.2 reading for November was less depressed than the month before but still indicated a contraction as it was less than 50. HIA economist Tom Devitt said the Reserve Bank’s aggressive monetary tightening was weighing on the sector. He warned: The lags that characterise this cycle mean the full impact of the RBA’s hikes to date won’t be seen until the second half of 2023. Further hikes in 2023 would jeopardise the housing industry’s ‘soft landing’ in 2024 and beyond. The Reserve Bank board is due to make its December cash rate decision on Tuesday. – From AAP Household costs crisis not over yet Sky-high living costs continue to crush household budgets, with a monthly inflation gauge picking up pace again. The 1% lift in the Melbourne Institute’s monthly inflation gauge follows smaller increases in October and September. In October, the index lifted by 0.4%, and in September increased by 0.5%. The gauge is sitting 5.9% higher than in November last year. Holiday, travel and accommodation costs lifted 14.6%, suggesting demand for post-pandemic travel remains strong, with private motoring costs also adding 3.3 % to the index. But consumers paid less for audio-visual and computing equipment, with this category sliding 3.4%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as fuel and vegetables, lifted 0.7% in November to sit 5.6% higher than 12 months prior. The institute’s cost of living measure, which unlike the inflation index includes mortgage repayments, unsurprisingly increased across most consumer types given the seven interest rate rises since May. Employees suffered the most, with the cost of living measure lifting by 1.1% for the consumer type most sensitive to interest rate movements. The stronger inflation reading for November follows a step down in annual inflation as captured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ monthly consumer price index from 7.3% in September to 6.9% in October. – From AAP South Australia on flood alert The River Murray is currently flooding as a result of high flows upstream, with the highest flood levels in the area since 1974. A watch-and-act message has been issued for parts of Crescent, near Renmark. Communities along the banks are preparing evacuation plans as the peak is expected within the week. The ABC is reporting that a group of aged care residents are being evacuated now as a precaution. Robodebt inquiry probes ‘quick copy and paste’ suggestion Government officials believed they were being given the opportunity to “effectively co-write” a federal watchdog’s report into the robodebt scheme when they suggested specific changes to its language, an inquiry has been told. The commonwealth ombudsman was investigating the robodebt scheme in early 2017, with its final report failing to identify the unlawfulness of the program. The royal commission was shown emails on Monday showing that a commonwealth ombudsman’s official had written to the Department of Human Services asking for “initial comments, points of clarification or feedback” on a draft of a report it was preparing. In response to that email from the ombudsman’s staff, a Department of Human Services (DHS) official wrote to colleagues in January 2017 saying the department has “been given a great opportunity to effectively co-write the report with the ombudsman’s office”. The email said: Given the time pressure the OO is under, any suggested wording you provide in response to their dot points will enable them to do a quick copy and paste in many instances where there is general agreement or at least not totally opposing views. Jason McNamara, the former general manager, integrity and information group at DHS (now Services Australia), was involved in the department’s response to the ombudsman. Under questioning, McNamara said the ombudsman was an “independent statutory office holder” that could “reject” any suggestions from DHS. He said: This is fairly normal practice with both ombudsman and ANAO [Australian National Audit Office] reports. In my experience it’s fairly normal practice for both the ombudsman and the ANAO to reject those suggestions, but APS agencies do that [propose changes] all the time. Counsel assisting Angus Scott replied: Cut and paste words into the independent report? McNamara replied: At the end of the day the ombudsman is signing off on the report. If he’s not happy ... he’s going to say ‘No’. The royal commission was then shown a marked-up version of the executive summary of the report. DHS proposed removing phrases such as “inaccurate debts” while it suggested changing “better” decision to “new” in reference to debts no longer relying on the flawed “income averaging” method. The inquiry has not heard yet how the ombudsman responded to these suggestions. The published version of the report incorporates some of the proposed changes. The ombudsman has previously told Guardian Australia it cannot be compelled to give evidence at the royal commission. It said it was “and has always been willing to consider what assistance he can provide to the royal commission voluntarily”. The royal commission continues. The NSW State Emergency Service is warning people in parts of west Condobolin to evacuate due to flooding. Changes for new Victorian cabinet A new minister, upper house MP Enver Erdogan, will take on corrections, youth justice and victims support, while St Albans MP Natalie Suleyman will also enter cabinet, becoming minister for youth, small business and veterans affairs. In some other minor changes, Gabrielle Williams will gain the ambulance services portfolio but continue as minister for mental health and for treaty and First Peoples. Ben Carroll will hand over responsibility for roads and road safety to Melissa Horne and take on the new portfolio of “manufacturing sovereignty” and employment. The deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, will become minister for transport and infrastructure (she was transport infrastructure minister previously), while Gayle Tierney’s training and skills portfolio will move into the Department of Jobs, Skills, Industry and Regions. Harriet Shing will remain minister for water, regional development and equality and add the “Commonwealth Games legacy” portfolio to her responsibilities. But with counting in the upper house ongoing, she will not be sworn in on Monday. The premier says he will be responsible for her portfolios until she can be sworn in. It appears the only casualty of the reshuffle is Shaun Leane, who will be nominated as Labor’s candidate for the upper house presidency, a position he has previously held. It comes after a group of seven MPs from the ALP’s right faction – including the treasurer, Tim Pallas, and minister Steve Dimopoulos – shifted to the premier’s socialist left. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has unveiled his new-look cabinet ahead of a swearing in ceremony at Government House this afternoon. In a statement, Andrews confirmed Carrum MP Sonya Kilkenny would become minister for planning, replacing Lizzie Blandthorn, who was expected to change portfolios due to perceived conflicts of interest related to her brother’s work at Labor-linked lobbying firm Hawker Britton. Blandthorn will take on the deputy leadership position in the legislative council, having moved from the lower house, as well as the portfolios of disability, ageing and carers and child protection and family services. She is the fifth minister to take on the portfolios in a period of 14 months and will also be tasked with leading the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing. Danny Pearson will remain assistant treasurer, as well as leading a new Department of Government Services. He will also become minister for WorkSafe and the TAC and take on the portfolio of consumer affairs. Pearson’s portfolio of housing will be passed onto Colin Brooks, who will also become minister for multicultural affairs. Lily D’Ambrosio will become the minister for the State Electricity Commission – Labor’s key election promise – as well as minister for climate action and energy and resources. Both resources and agriculture will move into the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action. She will hand the environment portfolio to Ingrid Stitt, who will also retain her role as minister for early childhood and pre-prep. Mary-Anne Thomas will continue as health minister but take on the key parliamentary role of leader of the lower house, as well as the portfolios of health infrastructure and medical research. Heatwaves building across northern and central Australia Queensland senator Murray Watt has warned those who live in the top of the country to take care as the heatwave is expected in coming days. The NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, says he does not regret supporting laws that saw climate protester Deanna “Violet” Coco jailed after she blocked a lane of traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in April. Coco was sentenced to 15 months in prison, with a non-parole period of eight months, on Friday in a judgement that human rights advocates and environment groups have labelled extraordinary and disproportionate. The laws passed the NSW parliament in April with the support of the Labor opposition despite the head of Unions NSW, Mark Morey, describing them as an “unacceptable” intrusion on the right to protest. It came after a series of climate protests at Port Botany, Martin Place and the Spit Bridge in Manly. Today, Minns defended his decision to support the laws – a move that angered some on his backbench when it was announced before it was debated in the Labor party room earlier this year. Minns said: I don’t regret supporting those laws ... At the end of the day, you’re talking about a situation where mass protests were shutting down half the city and in a repeated fashion. Earlier on Monday the premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the sentence was not excessive and that protesters should not “inconvenience” people. Asked if he agreed with the premier, Minns said the protests had been geared towards causing “as much chaos as possible for as long as possible”. I think most people would appreciate that even in free societies there’s a context and a set of circumstances [and] when you inconvenience literally hundreds of thousands of people as often as possible in consecutive days there will be legislative action in relation to that because it’s not just inconvenience, it could be a situation where people are put in life-threatening circumstances, not being able to access emergency services right when they need them. 120,000 fee-free training courses to be funded under government deal The NSW and federal governments have signed a 12-month, $319m agreement to fund 120,000 fee-free Tafe and vocational education and training places in 2023. The course list includes about 40,200 fee-free places in the care sector (including approximately 10,000 in early childhood education and care), 9,900 in technology and digital, 6,900 in agriculture, 5,200 in construction, 5,000 in hospitality and tourism, 1,200 in sovereign capability and 51,400 in other priority sectors including foundation skills. Brendan O’Connor, the federal minister for skills and training, said: The Australian government recognises the urgency of the skills crisis facing the nation, and the challenges particular to NSW, which is why this agreement is so important. If we want to provide greater opportunity in NSW for secure and rewarding employment, we must be able to skill and reskill our workforce. Alister Henskens, the NSW minister for skills and training, said: This additional investment in fee-free training places will target priority industries and help address skills and labour shortages that are hampering businesses across NSW. Fall in national operating profits could be a drag on GDP There’s quite a bit of other economic news this week, with the September quarter national accounts coming out on Wednesday. (Occasionally the quarterly GDP figures come out before the RBA decisions, but for that to happen, the first Wednesday in December, March, June and September has to land before the first Tuesday, when the RBA meets. Begs the question why the RBA and ABS agree to make sure GDP comes first and so remove some of the RBA speculation. Maybe they enjoy it?) The GDP figures have lots of moving parts and some of the last ones landed just a short time ago. Economists will be tweaking their final estimates tomorrow after September quarter trade numbers arrive. From today’s instalment, though, we learned inventories rose 1.7% for the quarter, which was more than some economists had pencilled in. That should nudge GDP estimates higher. Gross operating profits, however, fell 12.4% in seasonally adjusted terms. That’s more than the 2% slide the CBA had forecast, so will probably be a drag on GDP. And despite the high – if not record – prices for various commodity prices, mineral exploration in the September quarter was down 1.5% from the previous three months to just over $1bn. Petroleum exploration fell even more, dropping 5.5% to $230m. RBA governor Philip Lowe and others have noted that exploration investment hasn’t responded as you might expect from such high prices (and record profit). One reason might be that investors don’t want to be spending money on new coal mines or gas fields that might have short operating lives – assuming net zero targets mean something. Rate rise all but inked in during last big week of economic data With Christmas coming at a rush, economists are pretty certain the Reserve Bank will do its bit to dim the festive cheer (cue tedious cartoons of governor Philip Lowe as Grinch, etc.) All but one of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the RBA will hike its cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.1% when its board meets on Tuesday. (The outlier predicted a 15bp rise to 3%, possibly out of neatness.) Markets, as happens, are not quite so certain. As of Friday, they were estimating the odds of a quarter-point rise as just over a 50:50 chance. At least they’ve lowered their sights. Investors now expect the RBA’s peak rate to be 3.6% in the second half of 2023 – which is better than 4%-plus of a few weeks back if you’re a borrower. Scott Morrison and Marise Payne won’t be the only former Coalition ministers who will be called to front the robodebt royal commission. Justin Greggery KC, senior counsel assisting the commission, told the inquiry on Monday “successive ministers of [department of social services] DSS and DHS [department of human services] are likely to be called in subsequent public hearings”. Those ministers could include individuals including Alan Tudge, Stuart Robert, Christian Porter, Michael Keenan and Dan Tehan. Tudge was human services minister when the commonwealth ombudsman and a Senate inquiry were investigating the scheme in 2017. Robert was government services minister when it was the subject of two court challenges from 2019 onwards. Greggery said Payne, who was human services minister in 2015, would likely give evidence on Tuesday next week, while Morrison, who was social services minister, would give evidence on Wednesday next week. Greggery said: The evidence they are likely to give … is anticipated to be evidence which was not in the public [domain] prior to the commencement of the commission. The commission has previously heard the policies that became the robodebt scheme were progressed through the department after Morrison told officials he wanted them included in the 2015 budget. One official said Morrison’s desire for the measure to be announced in that budget had limited the ability for legal officers to provide sufficient legal advice. It remains unclear exactly what knowledge Morrison had of potential legal concerns about what became the robodebt scheme. Greggery said the inquiry had received about 442,000 documents so far. Among those it received were emails from frontline Centrelink worker Colleen Taylor, who raised the alarm about the scheme directly with the DHS secretary Kathryn Campbell. Taylor gave an exclusive interview to the Guardian which was published on Saturday. Greggery confirmed Campbell would be quizzed about those emails this week when she returns to the stand. Greggery said: … It provides evidence of actual knowledge of persons in positions of seniority within the department and an insight into the mindset of the department during the operation of the scheme … Employees … would have felt restricted in their ability to speak publicly about the effect of the scheme upon them publicly. The royal commission continues. Vehicle sales rise, but long waits persist Extended wait times for some vehicles remain a factor for Australian car buyers despite the ongoing recovery in the vehicle market, the industry’s peak body says. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries says the market rose by 17.9% in November with 95,080 new cars and trucks retailed. That took demand for the year to 993,509, a 2.3% improvement compared to the same time last year. FCAI Chief Executive Tony Weber said the automotive sector is continuing to recover from (Covid-19) pandemic-related shutdowns, a global shortage of microprocessors and the general supply chain uncertainty we experienced over the last two years. While this is positive news, many customers are still facing extended wait times for their vehicle, with expected delivery dates for some models beyond 12 months. Sales of battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles continued to rise with 13,415 zero and low-emission vehicles sold in November. Sales of battery electric vehicles more than doubled compared with October to 4,457 while demand for hybrid’s was also up by more than 70% compared to November last year. The improvement came as the federal government considers purchase incentives, increased fuel quality standards and an emissions target for the light vehicle sector to further boost the alternative-fuel segment. Toyota led the market last month, selling 20,107 vehicles ahead of Mazda (7,549), Ford (7,165), Kia (6,120) and Mitsubishi (5,559). The Toyota Hi-Lux was the top-selling model with 5,440 ahead of the Ford Ranger (5,073), the Toyota Corolla (3,732), the MG ZS (3,051) and the Toyota Landcruiser (2,296). The November market also showed a sharp 36.3% rise in demand from rental fleets with 6,599 vehicles sold as operators prepared for the first major holiday period since Covid-19 border restrictions eased. - from AAP If you couldn’t quite put your finger on why Dominic Perrottet looked different at his press conference today – it took me a few moments – the NSW premier was spec-less. My colleague Tamsin Rose was at the press conference today and has the full story: Underpayment rife among migrant workers Underpayment is rife among migrant workers in Australia with many not reporting the issue due to fears of deportation, a new report has found. The Unions NSW audit, released today, showed more than 60% of job advertisements reviewed in the nation’s top eight industries offered illegal rates of pay. More than one-third of migrant workers surveyed also reported being paid or offered a lower salary because of their visa type, while more than one-quarter received lesser salaries because of their nationality. Unions NSW is using the latest findings to call for greater protections for migrant workers. Secretary Mark Morey said in a statement: Our audit exposes this underbelly and demonstrates the need for the commonwealth to bolster its efforts to stamp out bad employer behaviour while empowering workers to enforce their rights. The visa system is broken and needs reform to strengthen the protection of migrant workers. Right now, too many workers remain shackled to their employers due to the uncertainty of their visa status. Unions NSW wants there to be a firewall between the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Department of Home Affairs so vulnerable workers can act against unscrupulous employers. It also wants a new substantive visa to allow workers with outstanding claims for workplace entitlements to remain in the country with working rights until their claim has been settled. Immigration, citizenship and multicultural affairs minister, Andrew Giles, will join the union on Monday to launch the new report. - from AAP Pocock warns against soil degradation on World Soil Day Happy world soil day to one and all. Independent senator for the ACT David Pocock has taken to social media to applaud the brown stuff beneath our feet, which does more work than we know – not only growing all our food but also storing carbon. Guardian Australia’s rural editor Gabrielle Chan spoke to Pocock recently about these issues of biodiversity and agricultural sustainability which are central to the climate crisis and the future of human life on this earth. The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has defended the sentencing of protester Deanna “Violet” Coco after she blocked a lane of traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in April. The climate protester was on Friday sentenced to 15 months in prison, with a non-parole period of eight months, with human rights advocates calling it “disproportionate”. Perrottet said it was “pleasing to see” and warned others against taking part in protests that “inconvenience people”. He said: It’s not excessive, and if protesters want to put our way of life at risk, then they should have the book thrown at them and that’s pleasing to see. We want people to be able to protest but do it in a way that doesn’t inconvenience people right across NSW. My view is that those protests literally started to grind our city to a halt. The clear message here, and it’s is a clear lesson – everyone has the right to protest, but do so in a way that doesn’t inconvenience people. Government launches $3.9m in grants to protect species from bycatch Dugongs and turtles might stand a better chance against commercial fishing nets, thanks to nearly $4m the government is committing in grants to reduce bycatch. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the grants launched today will help commercial fishers invest in new technologies and techniques to this end. A nature restoration market could inject $137bn into conservation measures by 2050, according to a report by consulting firm PwC. The report, which explores the potential and risks associated with establishing a national biodiversity market, estimates $78b of that figure would come from private capital, $8.5b from government, $11b from charities. It estimates $24b could come from forest carbon offsets and $9b from biodiversity offsets. The federal government is developing a national biodiversity market, which it has said would recognise private landholders who restored and managed habitat by granting them biodiversity certificates that could then be sold to other parties. When it was announced in August, researchers and conservation organisations called for more detail on how the scheme would be designed, including whether it would allow for the trade of certificates as offsets for other habitat destruction. The PwC report argues a biodiversity market should incentivise work that “anticipates and prevents” negative impacts to nature and “offsetting should only be considered where impacts to biodiversity are unavoidable, if at all”. It says a market is not a “silver bullet” and should not be a substitute for other important measures, including government funding of conservation work, reducing land-clearing, accelerating action on climate change and managing invasive species. It calls for stronger laws to protect nature and enforcement of those laws. The report makes several recommendations for the design of a national market. It recommends a national market exclude biodiversity offsets and instead prioritise stewardship certificates that are based solely on conservation outcomes. It calls for a transparent, public register of biodiversity certificates and trades and clearer delineation of biodiversity and carbon markets to avoid “double dipping” where providers of biodiversity credits are able to sell the same credit in both carbon and biodiversity markets. PwC Australia partner Neil Plumridge said: While considerable efforts are being made to conserve, protect and restore various native species and ecosystems, more needs to be done to not only stop the decline, but revive Australia’s biodiversity. A biodiversity market, if implemented successfully, could encourage companies to factor biodiversity into their environmental, social and governance (ESG) plans, ensuring biodiversity remains front and centre of decision making. SA premier says Aukus subs will dispel myths about nuclear safety SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, today said submarines his state would build via the Aukus deal would bust myths about how safe the energy alternative is. Australians’ feelings about nuclear energy are becoming front and centre of the nuclear debate. If you missed the story yesterday, my colleague Daniel Hurst revealed in an exclusive that a Coalition frontbencher’s survey on the subject was linked to a business that helps an American small modular reactor company. A Coalition frontbencher conducting a ‘grassroots’ survey about nuclear power is using a website registered by a business that helps an American small modular reactor company, records reveal. Ted O’Brien, the shadow minister for climate change and energy, issued a statement on Friday saying he was ‘launching a grassroots community engagement program’ under the banner ‘Time to Talk Nuclear’. You can read the full story here: Rezoning could create 70,000 NSW homes Up to 70,000 new homes could be built in NSW as new areas are rezoned. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, today said he’s “throwing everything at getting more houses built” as the cost of living continues to bite. Working with councils, rezoning is one important lever that we are pulling to get the ball rolling on more housing supply across our state. We are throwing everything at getting more houses built so more people get keys in doors and can realise their dream of owning a home. Through the $73.5m Rezoning Pathways Program, ten areas will be rezoned, including at Riverstone, Camellia-Rosehill, Macquarie Park, Explorer St in Eveleigh, two sites in Parramatta, and one site in Broadmeadow in Newcastle. The program is part of the state government’s $2.8bn housing package announced in the budget, which included stamp duty reform for first home buyers. It also comes on the back of the latest Rental Affordability Index, which showed renting has become less affordable in Sydney over the last year, and steadily risen since the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the government announced it would assume responsibility for three planning proposals across the Macarthur Region, saying their approval could lead to the construction of 19,000 new homes as well as providing koala corridors. While planning proposals are usually assessed by local councils, this program gives the government the ability to make assessments and lead rezoning work on planning proposals it deems significant. A pilot is under way for developers proposing projects offering more than 1,000 homes in metropolitan areas, and more than 300 homes in regional areas. - from AAP Australia looking to compensate Afghanistan war crime victims’ families The Albanese government is looking to compensate families of victims of alleged Afghanistan war crimes, more than two years after a landmark inquiry found payments should be offered quickly to restore “Australia’s standing”. Guardian Australia can reveal the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, has received a number of briefings from officials about compensation, one of the key outstanding recommendations of the Brereton report he is examining. Adelaide is expected to build at least eight submarines under the Aukus arrangement, which Malinauskas said would show safety concerns around nuclear energy were misplaced. Malinauskas told News Corp: In respect of my position on nuclear power for civil consumption, or use, I’ve always thought the ideological opposition that exists in some quarters to nuclear power is ill-founded. Nuclear power is a source of baseload energy with zero carbon emissions. For someone like myself, who is dedicated to a decarbonisation effort, we should be open-minded to those technologies and it would be foolhardy to have a different approach. The PM will meet with state premiers at national cabinet on Wednesday, with a cap on coal and gas prices expected to be a priority agenda item in an attempt to get power bills down. Albanese said: It is important that the price of gas is reasonable and can make a profit, but the idea that you have super profits being made at the same time as businesses going out of business … is not on. We will act before Christmas and I don’t think there is a premier or chief minister who will sit back and say ‘yep, this is all OK’ as prices continue to rise. - from AAP Nuclear off table as states seek power fix The SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, left the door open to nuclear on Monday, stating submarines his state would build via the Aukus deal would bust myths about how safe the energy alternative is. However, the prime minister Anthony Albanese and environment minister Tanya Plibersek were quick to shoot their Labor colleague down, each pointing out nuclear energy wouldn’t work out financially. The discussion comes as Australia desperately seeks a fix for soaring power bills, the PM labelling talk around nuclear energy as a distraction. Albanese told FiveAA radio: I have a great deal of respect for ‘Mali’, but everyone’s entitled to get things wrong. Every five years or so we have economic analysis of whether nuclear power stacks up and every time it’s rejected. Plibersek was similarly strong, saying nuclear power was “slow to build and really expensive”. She told Seven: All this nonsense about small-scale nuclear reactors in every suburb, I don’t know if there’s people up your street who want a nuclear reactor in the local park … I really don’t think that’s the case. - from AAP ‘Wherever you stand on Violet Coco, her jailing raises the stakes for climate protest’ My colleague Adam Morton’s column out today is on Violet Coco, who was Friday sentenced to 15 months in jail for her role in a climate protest blocking traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Wherever you stand on this, the penalty and bail refusal significantly elevates the bar for what protesters – and particularly climate protesters – can expect to face in NSW. Coco is the first person to be sentenced under laws introduced by the Perrottet government in April that carry fines of up to $22,000 and jail terms of up to two years for protests on roads, rail lines, tunnels, bridges and industrial estates. They were passed with the support of the Labor opposition. The incident continues to draw criticism from groups including the UN and Bob Brown Foundation: Read Morton’s full column here: Newspoll shows lift for Labor and Albanese The latest Newspoll has delivered good news for federal Labor and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Labor’s primary vote has lifted a point to 39% while the Coalition remains unchanged on 35%, according to the final Newspoll survey for the year. Albanese also enjoyed a surge in support as preferred prime minister, the poll conducted for The Australian newspaper shows. The result for Labor is more than six points stronger than its election result of 32.6%, while the Coalition’s result is almost a point down on its election tally of 35.7%. The Greens were unchanged with a primary vote of 11%, Pauline Hanson’s One Nation was on 6% while Clive Palmer’s deregistered United Australia party attracted just 1%. Other minor parties, including the teal independents, dropped one point to 8%, the Newspoll showed. Satisfaction with Albanese’s performance rose to a record high with a three-point gain to 62%, while those saying they were dissatisfied fell four points to 29%. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, suffered a three-point decline in his satisfaction ratings to 36% but those dissatisfied with his performance dropped from 46% to 45%. The December Newspoll was conducted between Wednesday and Saturday and interviewed 1,508 voters throughout Australia. – from AAP Chemical spill at industrial premises in South Australia South Australia’s metropolitan fire service is on the scene and advising people to take an alternative route to George St where the incident has occurred. National service brought to end 50 years ago today It is the 50th anniversary of the end of national service today and while some, like Tony Abbott, would like to see it brought back, today recognises the sacrifices “Nashos” made for their country. The minister for veterans’ affairs, Matt Keogh, said today marked the end of the national service schemes which ran from 1951 before the Whitlam government ended them in 1972. Keogh said: The Nashos were an integral part of Australia’s defence forces in the 1950s, 60s and 70s serving in Australia, Borneo, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam. The first national service scheme, from 1951-59 saw men from across the country called up for training in the royal Australian navy, the Australian army and the royal Australian air force. More than 220,000 served during this period, putting their careers and lives on hold to serve their country. The second national service scheme took place from 1965-1972 and for some, included service in the Vietnam war. During this period, 63,000 20-year-olds were selected for service in the Army through a birthday ballot. More than 15,300 national servicemen served in the Vietnam war, with 200 losing their lives. Keogh said: No matter the nature of their service, today we honour all national servicemen and thank them for what they have done for our nation. We thank all Nashos and their families for putting their lives on hold during their years of compulsory service. We know this service was difficult, as was your return to civilian life. The Australian government thanks you. If you were called up for national service and injured, even if never deployed, you are entitled to claim through the DVA, including for mental health support, as well as hold a White card. $1m reward for 1982 Sydney terror bombings A $1m reward has been announced to help solve a 40-year mystery – the bombing of Sydney’s Israeli consulate and Hakoah Club which shook the Jewish community. The increased reward was announced today – the first day of a coronial inquiry into Australia’s first terrorism cold case. A bomb exploded in front of the Israeli consulate in Sydney about 2pm on 23 December 1982, injuring a number of people. Later that day a car parked in the basement of the Hakoah Club at Bondi exploded, and although no one was injured, it’s believed the blast was intended to collapse the building. Investigations deemed the bombings to be acts of international terrorism motivated by Palestinian nationalism. A man was charged in 1983, however the matter was no-billed before the trial began. In 2011, investigators from the NSW joint counter-terrorism team established Strike Force Forbearance to reinvestigate the bombings and a $100,000 reward was announced the next year. Investigators want to track down three people who they believe were involved and detectives have prepared a coronial brief of evidence, which is being heard as an inquiry before the NSW State Coroner on Monday. The NSW police minister, Paul Toole, said it was hoped the $1m reward would “be the final push members of the public need to offer up information – no matter how big or small it may seem – to help police in their unwavering quest for answers and provide closure for all those involved”. NSW Jewish Board of Deputies CEO, Darren Bark, said the Jewish community remained hopeful that someone with information will come forward. Bark said: For four long decades, our community has searched for answers about this heinous terrorist attack targeting innocent Australians on our own soil. – from AAP No tsunami threat to Australia from Samoan earthquake Climate policy buoying investor confidence Good morning from Canberra where the end of the parliament sitting doesn’t mean we’re done for the year – just done with seeing most of the MPs! But the week starts with some good news, at least in terms of investment in emissions reduction technology, with the Investment Group on Climate Change finding actually having a climate policy means people are no longer afraid to invest. Who. Would. Have. Thought. The group reports a 14% drop in uncertainty from investors who view climate policy as a barrier to investment in Australia in the year since the survey was last taken, moving from 70% to 56%. While uncertainty is still high, the group report it is the largest year-on-year change they’ve seen in the survey. Investors also see sector-by-sector emissions targets (such as emission reduction pathways for coal, industrials, transport etc) as a priority, along with carbon pricing through mechanisms like the safeguards mechanism, while also waiting to see what decisions are made to meet the Labor government’s 2030 target. Director of policy, Erwin Jackson, said change was slowly emerging in the Australian investor market. Stronger 2030 emissions targets and bipartisan support for net zero emissions by 2050 are welcome. But they’re not enough on their own. Investors are seeking sector-by-sector emissions targets and detailed plans as a crucial next step. The government and parliament must strengthen the safeguard mechanism to ensure Australian industries remain competitive in a net zero world. Australia is in a global race to attract capital to ensure our continued economic prosperity as we steer towards a net zero world. Implementing stable long-term policy and forging political consensus on climate policy reforms will ensure Australia is an attractive destination for capital investment. Langton is asked about how concerned she is about the prospect of a No campaign with Aboriginal woman Jacinta Price already quite active in opposing it. I have mixed feelings about that. It’s unfortunate that the Nationals have injected misinformation and vitriol into the debates so early on. We’ve been through this many times over these kinds of campaigns. I mean, I am saying this now is a bit like you know, the Adam Goodes saga which is terribly unfortunate. The tragedy is of course – well take for instance, Jacinta [Price] says that she’s Celtic Warlpiri. The Warlpiri people see themselves as a people because they speak the Warlpiri language, and they have Warlpiri traditions. They don’t see themselves as a race. And the Warlpiri people that I’ve spoken to – many of the leaders – believe that the voice is a very necessary part of the Australian political system, and they would welcome it very much because they want their people to be represented. We are one species; there are no races. It would be terribly unfortunate for all Australians if the debate sinks into a nasty, eugenicist, 19th-century style of debate about the superior race versus the inferior race, and I have to say I’m terribly disappointed that a Warlpiri person – or a Celtic Warlpiri person – has kicked this off. Karvelas: Will there be a draft of legislation that that will be considered? Calma: I suspect not … what we’re working on is looking at what the question will be that goes into the referendum, and we’ve been guided by what the prime minister said at Garma. In that 51 people membership that we had in the co-design process, that comprised the majority of key Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander players around the nation who are working on local voices at the moment, they’re working on other processes at a state level, so it’s very well informed. And that information at a state and local government level has been shared a lot with those communities, so this is bewildering, really, that people say that they don’t have information when it’s been available. We’re already seeing fairly significant buy-in by all states and territories already, so it seems at the federal level they seem to be standing alone in now … the National’s position and some of the other minor party members. Langton: we ‘tried to speak to as many people as possible’ including Coalition and Pauline Hanson The former minister for Indigenous affairs under the Coalition Ken Wyatt said that he took the proposal to cabinet twice and implored his former colleagues to consider it and said it was laziness that was behind claims that there was no detail available. Patricia Karvelas: Are you speaking to the Liberals about whether they did read the report and whether they think this is the model that should go forward? Langton: We cruised the corridors of Parliament House over and over again and tried to speak to as many people as possible and we did speak to Nationals and to Liberal party members. We spoke to the members of the Greens party, and at that time, there were no Teals. But I have written to teal members of parliament and asked for an appointment to discuss it with them because if they were not present in the last parliament. I spoke to Pauline Hanson and members of her party and took the report to them personally. So we will speak to members in this parliament. And I am disappointed that people don’t believe we haven’t spoken to them when we in fact did. And that they believe that there’s no detail when we’ve personally handed the report to them and discussed it with them. Calma: The final report also went to cabinet and had been discussed for almost six months amongst the Coalition members before it was released again, unchanged, and released to the public in December last year, so the public have had it for over 12 months, including the government of the day. Voice model gets First Nations representation right, co-chair says The co-chairs of the Indigenous voice co-design groups, Marcia Langton and Tom Calma, are speaking on ABC Radio. They have some strong words following the Nationals coming out last week saying they would not be supporting the campaign. David Littleproud and his Nationals colleagues raised concerns that the voice would represent inner-city Aboriginal people rather than those from more remote communities. The report, of course, did make specific structural recommendations around the number of members, regional representation, gender split, and term limits. Langton said: I can’t imagine that there is a better model out there. I can foresee some tweaks. I’m very confident the voice will look much like our detailed proposal in our final report. Government ‘aware’ of urgent problems facing Medicare, assistant treasurer says Jones is also asked about the report on Medicare out from the Grattan Institute, which calls for an overhaul of the way that doctors’ visits are funded. Look, every MP in the country, in fact every household in the country – if I can put it that way more appropriately – has seen it harder and harder to get access to bulk billing. Difficulty in getting access to GPs in particular, and the big gap between what they’re being charged and what they’re getting back from Medicare. So yeah, there is an issue and there’s no doubt about it. And as health minister, Mark Butler … is reviewing the operation of Medicare. In the meantime, some initiatives already being rolled out as a part of the election commitments, including our urgent care clinics around the country. So yes, we are aware that there’s an issue. Of course, when the Grattan Institute publishes a report, we always take it seriously and look at what they’re recommending. Assistant treasurer warns scams ‘likely to ramp up’ this holiday season The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, has been speaking to ABC News this morning; he’s warning the spate of scams Australians have seen could get even worse this Christmas. The ACCC has told us that last year, there was about $2bn worth of scams. They expect that to double this year, and there’s always a spike over Christmas time. So you know, some things to look out for, fake websites selling or allegedly selling toys that don’t exist, delivery scams which we saw during the pandemic. You click a link on the SMS to get information on where your parcel is going to be delivered to and you never ordered the parcel and, of course, you click the link and they get access to information on your phone. We’re seeing regifting scams. We all heard about regifting but this is where allegedly, the scammers are pretending to sell unwanted gifts at cut-prices at ridiculously low prices. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. And puppy scams and the ‘hi, mum’ scams are also out there in the field as well. The government wants [people to] be aware that these things are likely to ramp up over the Christmas period and to take extra care. The Greens will make lowering the voting age to 16 a top legislative priority next year, with a private member’s bill to be introduced in the first week parliament resumes. Both the Greens and independent Kooyong MP, Dr Monique Ryan, had previously expressed their interest in lowering the voting age, with Ryan to consult with her community before moving ahead with either her own bill, or supporting the Greens push. But the Greens are powering forward, with the party’s youth spokesperson, Stephen Bates, saying young people deserved a seat at the table given the decisions being made in areas such as climate heavily affected their futures. He plans on introducing a private member’s bill to the house in the week of 6 February. 16 and 17-year-olds can drive cars, work, enlist in the Australian Defence Force, and serve their communities, yet they have no say in the composition of their own government, in the economy they will enter for the rest of their working lives, or the dying planet they’re about to inherit.’ The re-emergence of the voting age debate in Australia came after the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, greenlit a parliamentary debate in Aotearoa after a supreme court ruling that the existing age of 18 was discriminatory and breached the human rights of young people. A bill is being drafted by Ardern’s government to change the voting age to 16. Courts in Australia have not dealt with a voting age question, but last year, the federal court ruled the government had a duty to protect young people from the climate crisis, a ruling which was overturned on appeal. Lowering the voting age in Australia has not been dismissed out of hand by the Albanese government, with the special minister of state, Don Farrell, saying late last month Labor had “never ruled out” the move. The Greens senator Jordon Steele-John led a push in 2018 to lower the voting age to 16 on a voluntary basis. That bill was restored to the senate notice paper in July this year. While the committee which originally examined the Steele-John bill, led by a then-government senator, recommended the legislation not be passed, Labor MPs included additional comments that said the party supported 16 and 17 year voting “in principle”. Labor’s issue then was the non-compulsory voting aspect proposed for younger voters arguing “this would privilege the views of those young people who are most engaged, and generally most equipped with economic and social capital and so increase inequality in political participation”. The push for younger Australians to get a greater say in the country’s future is being renewed by the Greens who will make lowering the voting age to 16 a top legislative priority next year. The party is set to introduce a private member’s bill in the first week parliament resumes next year. The party’s youth spokesperson, Stephen Bates, says young people deserve a seat at the table given the decisions being made in areas such as climate heavily affected their futures. This Monday morning is also a big morning for reports being released. A new one from the Grattan Institute finds Australia’s universal healthcare system is in need of urgent overhaul, while the Australian National University’s 2022 Australian Election Study is also out. The ANU study revealed that most voters for teal independent candidates were not disaffected Liberals but identified with the political left. It also showed Scott Morrison was the most unpopular party leader since the study began in 1987, while the prime minister Anthony Albanese was the most popular since Kevin Rudd.

The government decided to keep the curbs on onshore wind, introduced by David Cameron, in the recent energy strategy. This means that it will be difficult to expand onshore wind in England. It came after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the turbines were an “eyesore”. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, emphasised his support for offshore wind but did not noticeably back onshore wind. Scientists have said that the contrast between policy in England and Scotland, which has devolved and less strict regulation of onshore windfarms, is made clear when travelling between the two countries. Dr David Toke, from the University of Aberdeen, said: “As you go from England to Scotland by road or rail you will notice a definite increase in the use of land close to transport corridors for windfarms. The rules effectively banning windfarms in England are unique to planning in the UK. They are a testament to the government’s political inability to mobilise this very cheap and clean source of renewable energy to reduce our energy bills.” Relaxed planning rules more akin to those in Scotland would not allow windfarms to be built in areas of outstanding natural beauty or other protected landscapes, researchers said. Dr Rebecca Windemer, a lecturer in environmental planning at the University of the West of England, said: “If the planning rules on windfarms in England are changed then designated landscapes that are traditionally regarded as beautiful, ie national parks, would remain protected by their designations. Also, as windfarms can only be developed in areas with adequate wind resources, we would not see windfarms being developed everywhere. “A revised planning policy should also give local communities the opportunity to say whether they feel that their local landscape is suitable for windfarms and to judge if the benefits outweigh the visual impact.” A recent study by scientists at the University of Sussex and Denmark’s Aarhus University has found that if windfarms were established on the available and appropriate land, they could meet 140% of the UK and Ireland’s energy demand. Although not all of this land would be used, in the interest of preserving biodiversity, the researchers said that the research showed how much potential onshore wind has to solve the energy crisis. Prof Peter Enevoldsen, who worked on the report, said: “Our study revealed that the UK and Ireland had the potential to generate 2,150 TWh of energy from onshore wind, assuming a realistic capacity factor of 28%, which was the mean capacity factor of onshore wind turbines in the UK in 2020.” He added that the UK and Ireland’s combined onshore and offshore wind generation in 2020 only met 4% of the onshore energy potential shown in the study. “Meeting the onshore potential would equal 140% of the UK and Ireland’s entire energy demand in 2020,” he said. However, onshore wind is being ignored by policymakers in favour of nuclear power. Co-author Benjamin Sovacool, a professor of energy policy at the University of Sussex Business School, said: “The study is not a blueprint for development but a guide for policymakers indicating the potential of how much more can be done and where the prime opportunities exist. Our study suggests that the horizon is bright for the onshore wind sector and that European aspirations for a 100% renewable energy grid are within our collective grasp technologically. “Obviously, we are not saying that we should install turbines in all the identified sites, but the study does show the huge wind power potential right across Europe which needs to be harnessed if we’re to avert a climate catastrophe.” Experts have also said that expanding onshore wind could empower communities by reducing their bills and giving them a stake in their local infrastructure. Jake Burnyeat, the managing director of Communities for Renewables CIC, said: “Onshore wind is low-cost generation – less than 5p per kilowatt-hour compared with 9p for nuclear and current wholesale electricity prices, which are more than 12p. Polls and citizens’ assemblies show broad public support for onshore wind. Given onshore wind is cheap and popular, why is the government preventing it in England? “If we are going to reintroduce onshore wind, how can the host communities benefit? Low-cost electricity is a good idea, but our energy market currently makes that very difficult. We think local communities should have a right to buy a meaningful share of any windfarm – maybe 20% or one in five turbines. The community could then use surplus income (after operating and finance costs) to fund net zero transition and fuel poverty projects in the surrounding locality. “The ‘right to buy’ should be at cost, so that the community can make surplus, and the local ownership should be by an asset-locked not-for-profit body with a local purpose. Rather than just offering cheap electricity, we’d like to see windfarms funding the low-energy retrofit of the houses surrounding them; providing long-term bill reductions and energy savings; and creating local jobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-voting-in-sham-referendums-due-to-end-japanese-consul-interrogated-in-russia","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-27T17:57:30Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Sweden launches sabotage investigation after explosions reported near Nord Stream pipelines – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-voting-in-sham-referendums-due-to-end-japanese-consul-interrogated-in-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-voting-in-sham-referendums-due-to-end-japanese-consul-interrogated-in-russia","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Sweden launches sabotage investigation after explosions reported near Nord Stream pipelines – as it happened","bodyText":"Denmark’s military has issued an image of gas bubbling at the surface of the Baltic Sea after “unprecedented” damage to the Nord Stream pipelines, which has seen three offshore lines of the system damaged in one day. Swedish police said it has launched a preliminary investigation into possible sabotage related to the Nord Stream 1 gas leak in the Baltic Sea. It comes after Seismologists in Sweden said they detected what they described as two explosions in the regions of the Baltic sea where the leaks have occurred. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has already called the leaks “an act of sabotage” which he said “related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine”. Russia’s “referendums” in Ukraine, which could lead to Moscow annexing 15% of the country’s territory, are ending today. Voting in the eastern provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia began on Friday. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday that Russia wants to “save people” in the four Moscow-controlled territories. Russian media have announced early results, claiming that with approaching a quarter of the “votes” counted in each of the four referendums, all the regions have voted by at least 97% to be annexed by Russia. Nato has denounced the ‘referendums’ as a ‘sham’ and ‘violation of international law’. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, vowed that the west will never recognise Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, which he called part of a “diabolical scheme” by Moscow. Putin is scheduled to address both houses of Russian parliament on Friday 30 September, and may use the address to formally announce the accession of the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine into Russia, the British Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. The United Nations human rights office has said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had caused a dire human rights situation and led to a wide range of rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture, that could amount to war crimes. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a report that it was particularly concerned about torture and ill treatment of detainees by Russian forces and affiliated armed groups, but said there had been rights violations by both sides. Georgia and Kazakhstan said that tens of thousands of Russians had flooded into their countries from neighbouring Russia as military-aged men avoid military call-up. Moscow said it will not request the extradition of Russians travelling abroad to avoid being called-up to fight in Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, has again threatened the west with the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and said “Imagine that Russia is forced to use the most formidable weapon against the Ukrainian regime, which has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state. I believe that Nato will not directly intervene in the conflict even in this situation. After all, the security of Washington, London, and Brussels is much more important for the North Atlantic Alliance than the fate of Ukraine, which no one needs, even if it is abundantly supplied with various weapons.” Two seismic shakings resembling blasts rather than those recorded from earthquakes were recorded on Monday at seismographic stations in Denmark, Sweden and Germany, Denmark’s Geological Survey said on Tuesday. The first shaking happened at 0003 GMT measuring 2.3 on the Richter scale, while the other at 0503 GMT measured 2.1 on the Richter scale, it said in a statement. The Moscow organised votes in four occupied regions in Ukraine on annexation by Russia are a “sham” and “a blatant violation of international law,” NATO’s chief Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday. Stoltenberg tweeted that he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “and made clear that NATO Allies are unwavering in our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and right to self-defence”. “The sham referenda held by Russia have no legitimacy and are a blatant violation of international law. These lands are Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said. He later waded into the row about the three separate leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, saying that while the facts were not yet clear, “Russia is now weaponising energy”. He added that Russia had exacerbated the situation by holding “sham” votes, mobilising more personnel into its army, and threatening nuclear strikes if attempts were made to break its grip on areas it holds. “All this is a serious escalation of the conflict. Our message is that any use of nuclear weapons is absolutely unacceptable,” Stoltenberg said. “It will totally change the nature of the conflict and Russia must know that the nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” The United States welcomes Russians seeking asylum from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “unpopular” war, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday. “We believe that regardless of their nationality, they may apply for asylum in the United States and have their claim educated on a case by case basis,” she said. Reuters is reporting from Russia’s borders as draft-eligible men flee. The agency spoke to Nikita, a 24-year-old from the Russian city of Voronezh, who drove up to a border crossing on the arid steppeland along Russia’s remote border with Kazakhstan. “The border is like death,” Nikita told Reuters in an interview over the Telegram messaging app. “In five hours they only let 50 people across”. Nikita described would-be emigres pitching tents along the highway leading up to the Vishnyovka border post, while others less well-equipped slept on the tarmac, building makeshift beds out of their own clothes. Giving up on the border crossing after four hours of waiting and getting a room for the night in the nearby city of Volgograd, Nikita and his girlfriend said they were still determined to find an alternative way out of Russia, and were looking at public transport links across the border. The mobilisation announcement touched off a frenzy inside Russia, with many young men seeking ways to avoid fighting in Ukraine. On social media, closed groups sprang up offering everything from tips for crossing at specific border crossings, to organising private charter flights. One Telegram group offered seats on a flight from Moscow’s Domodedovo airport to the Kazakh capital Astana for 140,000 roubles ($2,400), according to Reuters. Norway will strengthen security at its oil and gas installations in the wake of gas leaks in the Baltic Sea and reports of drone activities in the North Sea, the Nordic country’s energy minister said on Tuesday. “Based on the information we have seen so far, much indicates acts of sabotage,” Norwegian oil and energy minister, Terje Aasland, said in a statement reported by Reuters. The government had consulted with the armed forces and operators of oil and gas installations, both on land and offshore, it said. On Monday, Norway’s Petroleum Safety Authority had urged greater vigilance over unidentified drones seen flying near Norwegian offshore oil and gas platforms, warning they could pose a risk of accidents or deliberate attacks. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, vowed that the west will never recognise Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, which he called part of a “diabolical scheme” by Moscow, AFP reports. “We and many other countries have already been crystal clear. We will not - indeed, we will never - recognise the annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia,” Blinken told reporters as Kremlin proxies started to claim victory. Blinken repeated President Joe Biden’s threat that the US “will impose additional swift and severe costs on Russia” for going ahead with the referendums. “It’s important to remember what’s going on here. Russia invaded Ukraine, seized territory and is engaged in a diabolical scheme on some of the territory it seized where it has moved the local populace out,” he said. Some people are deported and others “simply disappear,” Blinken said. “Then they bus Russians in, they install puppet governments and they engage in the referendum and manipulate, in any event, the outcome to then claim that the territory belongs to Russia.” Our correspondents Philip Oltermann in Berlin and Peter Beaumont in Kyiv have reported on the three separate leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines Gas is pouring into the Baltic Sea from three separate leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, Denmark’s energy agency confirmed on Tuesday, amid claims by seismologists in Sweden and Denmark of two sharp spikes in undersea activity, possibly indicating explosions, and speculation about possible sabotage. A seismograph on the Danish island of Bornholm, near where the leaks occurred, twice recorded spikes on Monday, the day on which the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines underwent dramatic falls in pressure, the German geological research centre GFZ said. A Danish military flight over the leaks brought back striking images from the ruptures, including one showing an area of bubbling gas a kilometre wide on the sea’s surface. The seismograph recorded near-silence until just after midnight GMT (2am local time), when there was a spike representing a tremor in the earth followed by a continuous hissing wave form. The pattern was repeated at 5pm GMT. Amid the speculation over sabotage, suspicion immediately turned to potential culprits – with fingers pointed at Russia, whose pipelines were hit, suggesting a further weaponisation of energy supplies to Europe in the midst of the conflict in Ukraine. Not least it was seen as a possible message about the vulnerability of other marine gas infrastructure. Read more of Philip Oltermann and Peter Beaumont’s report: Fears of sabotage as gas pours into Baltic from Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had discussed further support of Ukraine’s armed forces by Nato member states, in a call with the bloc’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday. The phone call came in the wake of votes staged in four occupied regions of Ukraine on annexation by Russia. Zelenskiy thanked Stoltenberg for his condemnation of the votes, which Ukraine and its western allies call illegal shams, in a post on Twitter. Moscow said it will not request the extradition of Russians travelling abroad to avoid being called-up to fight in Ukraine, after thousands of military-aged men crossed into neighbouring countries, AFP reports. “The Russian ministry of defence has not sent any request to the authorities of Kazakhstan, Georgia, or any other country for the alleged forced return to Russian soil of Russian citizens, and it is not planning to do so,” the ministry said in a statement. Neighbouring countries have seen Russians arriving en masse since the draft was announced last Wednesday, with hours-long queues at border crossings. Pjotr Sauer, the Guardian’s Russia affairs correspondent, reports that Russia is to boycott the Oscars Russia will not submit a film to the Oscars this year, the first time the country has boycotted the prestigious film awards since the fall of the Soviet Union, as Moscow’s cultural isolation deepens. “The presidium of the Film Academy of Russia has decided not to nominate a national film for the Oscars award of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2022,” the Russian academy said in a statement on Monday. The chairman of Russia’s Oscar nomination commission announced in a letter on Tuesday that he was resigning following the move, which he said was an “illegal” decision taken “behind his back”. Read more of Pjotr Sauer’s report: Russia to boycott Oscars as cultural isolation deepens Swedish police said it has launched a preliminary investigation into possible sabotage related to the Nord Stream 1 gas leak in the Baltic Sea. “We have established a report and the crime classification is gross sabotage,” a national police spokesperson said, according to Reuters. It comes as the US said it is ready to provide support to European partners investigating the leak. Daniel Boffey reports for us from the Verkhny Lars border crossing in Georgia where families are queuing for hours to escape Russian President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation Alexandra, 37, a lawyer from Moscow, appeared to almost astonish herself as she said it. Perhaps it was the first time she had out loud. “We have left our house, our car, our lives – everything”. Looking down at the top of the blond head of her small child, kicking a stone at her feet, Alexandra explained that she, her husband and son had driven for more than 20 hours from Russia’s capital before dumping their car in the southern city of Vladikavkaz and going on by foot to the border crossing with Georgia. “We walked for 25km to get to the border with our four-year-old son, between the queueing cars, with no space and lots of fumes.” Asked what they will do next, she replied: “I don’t know, we don’t know”. Alexandra’s husband, Artiom, 41, who works in radio technology, was at least clear as to why they were there, blinking in the bright sun, with thousands of others among the mountains on the Georgian side of the Verkhny Lars border point. “We didn’t want to be part of the war,” he said. Alexandra added: “My husband was born in Ukraine. He could be mobilised and fighting Ukrainians.” The couple and their child, with only four small bags to their name, walked on, to be mobbed by the horde of taxi drivers who gather daily at the crossing, charging exorbitant fees for the three-hour drive to Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi. This family, exhausted and bewildered, are just three of the 10,000 Russians that Georgia’s interior minister, Vakhtang Gomelauri, said on Tuesday were entering the country daily through Verkhny Lars, a bundle of grey buildings and lanes sandwiched in a gorge in the mountains that acts as the only formal crossing between the two countries. Read more of Daniel Boffey’s report from Georgia: ‘We didn’t want to be part of the war’: Russians at the Georgia border flee Putin’s call-up Ukraine’s authorities have said citizens helping to organise Russia’s so-called “referendums”, which concluded on Tuesday in the occupied territories, will face up to five years in prison for their role in orchestrating them. “We have lists of names of people who have been involved in some way,” a presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, adding that Ukrainians who were forced to vote would not be punished. Russian state media – as predicted - is reporting on Tuesday that people in the occupied areas overwhelmingly voted to join Russia, with claimed exit polls ranging from 87% to 92%. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is expected to announce the territories’ annexation on Friday when he addresses both houses of Russia’s parliament, according to Russian state media. Read more of Isobel Koshiw’s report from Kyiv: Ukrainians involved in ‘referendums’ face prison terms, says Kyiv The number of Russians entering the EU has jumped following a partial mobilisation ordered by Moscow, and illegal crossings are likely to increase should Russia decide to close the border for potential conscripts, EU border agency Frontex said. “Over the past week, nearly 66,000 Russian citizens entered the EU, more than 30% compared to the preceding week. Most of them arrived to Finland and Estonia,” Frontex said in a statement. Over the last four days alone, 30,000 Russian citizens arrived in Finland, according to the statement published by Reuters. “Frontex estimates that illegal border crossings are likely to increase if the Russian Federation decides to close the border for potential conscripts,” the agency said. Eurovision song contest 2023 is to be hosted in Liverpool or Glasgow after the UK replaced Ukraine to host the event following Russia’s invasion Liverpool and Glasgow are the two cities that remain in the competition to host the Eurovision song contest in 2023, when it will be held in the UK for the first time in 25 years. The two cities were selected after Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield and Manchester were removed from contention to host the music event. The BBC said a final decision would be made “within weeks”. The Ukrainian group Kalush Orchestra triumphed at the 2022 competition in Turin, Italy, which would normally make Ukraine the 2023 host, but the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which produces the event, decided the next contest could not be held safely in Ukraine due to Russia’s invasion. Read more of Nadia Khomami’s report: Eurovision song contest 2023 to be hosted in Liverpool or Glasgow Denmark’s military has issued an image of gas bubbling at the surface of the Baltic Sea after “unprecedented” damage to the Nord Stream pipelines, which has seen three offshore lines of the system damaged in one day. Seismologists in Sweden say on Monday they detected what they described as two explosions in the regions of the Baltic sea where the leaks have occurred. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has already called the leaks “an act of sabotage” which he said “related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine.” Russia’s “referendums” in Ukraine, which could lead to Moscow annexing 15% of the country’s territory, are due to end on Tuesday. Voting in the eastern provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia began on Friday, Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday that Russia wants to “save people” in the four Moscow-controlled territories. Russian media have announced early results, claiming that with approaching a quarter of the “votes” counted in each of the four referendums, all the regions have voted by at least 97% to be annexed by Russia. The process has been dismissed as a sham by western nations, and described as a “propaganda show” by Ukrainian authorities, which have pledged not to recognise the results. Putin is scheduled to address both houses of Russian parliament on Friday 30 September, and may use the address to formally announce the accession of the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine into Russia, the British Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. The United Nations human rights office has said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had caused a dire human rights situation and led to a wide range of rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture, that could amount to war crimes. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a report that it was particularly concerned about torture and ill treatment of detainees by Russian forces and affiliated armed groups, but said there had been rights violations by both sides. Georgia and Kazakhstan said that tens of thousands of Russians had flooded into their countries from neighbouring Russia as military-aged men avoid military call-up. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, has again threatened the west with the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and said “Imagine that Russia is forced to use the most formidable weapon against the Ukrainian regime, which has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state. I believe that Nato will not directly intervene in the conflict even in this situation. After all, the security of Washington, London, and Brussels is much more important for the North Atlantic Alliance than the fate of Ukraine, which no one needs, even if it is abundantly supplied with various weapons.” Russian media has announced more details of the early results of whether four occupied areas of Ukraine – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – should be incorporated into Russia. Displaced people from those regions were able to cast votes in Russia. Russian state news agency RIA said the initial counts from inside Russia showed huge majorities in favour of the move. They ranged from 96.97% in the Kherson region, based on 14% of votes counted, to 98.19% in Zaporizhzhia, based on 18% of the count. The majorities in the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics were just under 98%, with 14% and 13% respectively of votes tallied. Valentina Matviyenko, head of the upper house of the Russian parliament, said that if the referendum results were favourable, it could consider the incorporation of the four regions on 4 October, Reuters reported. Facebook says it has identified and stopped a sprawling network of fake accounts that spread Russian propaganda about the invasion of Ukraine throughout western Europe, AP reports. Meta, its parent company, says the network created more than 60 websites that mimicked legitimate news organisations but parroted Russian talking points about Ukraine. More than 1,600 fake Facebook accounts were used to spread the propaganda to audiences in Germany, Italy, France, the UK and Ukraine. Meta says it was the largest and most complex network linked to Russia that the California-based company has identified since the Ukraine invasion began. The Russian Embassy in Washington DC hasn’t responded to a request for comment, the news wire said. Denmark’s armed forces released a video showing bubbles rushing to the surface of the Baltic Sea above the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, and said the largest gas leak had caused surface disturbance of well over 1km in diameter. They posted a video on Twitter: Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has described the major leaks in two Russian gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea as a “terrorist attack”. In a statement on Twitter, he called for more arms and said: Russian media have announced early results from the four widely-derided “referendums” staged by pro-Russian proxy authorities in four occupied areas of Ukraine – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson As widely predicted, authorities are claiming an overwhelming majority of the public there want to be annexed by the Russian Federation. RIA Novosti reports that with approaching a quarter of the “votes” counted in each of the four referendums, all the regions have voted by at least 97% to be absorbed into Russia. Ukrainian officials have described the process, which began on Friday, as a “propaganda show”, and western officials have said that the results will not be recognised. The apparent leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline are both near the island of Bornholm, which belongs to Denmark in the Baltic sea. Sweden’s SVT quotes seismologist Björn Lund saying that the area where they detected explosions is not an area usually used for military drills. He told SVT: “We usually get information about explosions that take place underwater, but sometimes we don’t get it. In this case, we have not received any information.” According to Lund, one of the explosions had a magnitude of 2.3 on the Richter scale, and was recorded at 30 measuring stations in southern Sweden. Prior to the reports from the seismologists, there had already been speculation about possible sabotage, as the pipeline operator had described three lines suffering significant damage within the space of a day as “unprecedented”. The Swedish national broadcaster SVT is reporting that seismologists registered explosions near the Nord Stream pipelines in the last 36 hours. In a report published in the last few minutes it said: SVT can reveal that measuring stations in both Sweden and Denmark registered strong underwater explosions in the same area as the gas leaks on Monday. ‘There is no doubt that these are explosions,’ says Björn Lund, lecturer in seismology at the Swedish National Seismic Network, SNSN. The first explosion was recorded at 2.03am on the night of Monday and the second at 7.04pm on Monday evening. The warnings about the gas leaks came from the maritime administration at 1.52pm and 8.41pm on Monday, respectively, after ships detected bubbles on the surface. SVT has obtained the coordinates of the measured explosions and they are in the same area where the gas leaks were registered. It further quoted Lund saying of the measurements: “You can clearly see how the waves bounce from the bottom to the surface. There is no doubt that it was a blast. We even had a station in Gnosjö that picked this up.” Germany’s economy minister expects to have to extend the lifespans of the country’s last two nuclear power plants to avoid possible outages and grid bottlenecks in Europe’s biggest economy this winter, Reuters reports. Germany had planned to complete a phase-out of nuclear power by the end of this year, but a collapse in energy supplies from Russia due to the war in Ukraine has prompted the government to keep two plants on standby until April. Der Spiegel weekly quoted Robert Habeck saying: “We are already in a place where the stress test says: it may be necessary to use nuclear power plants for grid security.” The Danish defence command has issued a picture of the leaking gas from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline reaching the surface of the Baltic Sea. It says that the disturbance on the surface of the water covers a diameter of at least 1km. Denmark’s energy agency confirmed earlier today that gas is seeping into the Baltic Sea from three separate leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, prompting speculation that the infrastructure at the heart of the energy standoff between Russia and Europe had been deliberately damaged. The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has condemned Russia’s “referendums” in Ukraine, saying the “phoney results” will not be recognised. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that Russia wants to “save people” in four Moscow-controlled territories in Ukraine, on the last day of annexation votes denounced as a sham by Western leaders, AFP reports. If the regions vote to join Russia, Moscow will claim sovereignty over about 20% of Ukraine, including Crimea – which was annexed in 2014. Putin said during a televised meeting with officials: “Saving people in all the territories where this referendum is taking place … is the focus of the attention of our entire society and of the whole country.” Ukraine urged the European Union to impose economic sanctions on Russia to punish it for staging annexation votes in four occupied regions, Reuters reports. The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said personal sanctions would not suffice as punishment for the referendums, billed by Russia as a prelude to it annexing four Ukrainian regions. “It won’t be enough to limit oneself to cosmetic measures … the softer the reaction to the so-called referendums, the greater the motivation for Russia to escalate and annex further territories,” he told reporters after talks in Kyiv with the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna. “In the content of the eighth [EU] sanctions package, we will see just how seriously the EU takes the problem of referendums.” He added that moves by Moscow would not change Ukraine’s actions on the battlefield. Colonna said that French support for Ukraine was “massive” and included humanitarian aid, financial aid and military or diplomatic assistance totalling more than $2bn. “Russia is more and more isolated. No one has supported its presentation at the UN security council. Its narrative is incoherent,” she said. “So much so that we can even wonder whether our Russian colleague believed what he was saying. Everybody can see Russia is sinking further into an impasse, whether militarily or vis-a-vis its own people.” A new pipeline that will carry Norwegian gas via Denmark was inaugurated in Poland on Tuesday in a move to strengthen Europe’s energy security after Russia cut off Warsaw’s supplies, AFP reports. At a ceremony in western Poland, the Norwegian energy minister, Terje Aasland, said it was “a milestone on the important path towards European independence from Russian energy”. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said the pipeline launch “marks a crucial geopolitical step for all of us. “We have to do all we can to remove energy as a Russian instrument of power,” she said at the launch in Budno, near the city of Szczecin. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, “uses Russian energy as a weapon to destabilise Europe, to divide us. He cannot be allowed to succeed,” she added. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, called the pipeline “a Polish dream”. Frederiksen also referred to unexplained leaks from the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines linking Russia and Germany, saying it was “hard to imagine” they were accidental. “It’s an unusual situation to have three leaks a distance from each other,” she said. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, went further and said the leaks were caused by “sabotage”. “Today we faced an act of sabotage, we don’t know all the details of what happened, but we see clearly that it’s an act of sabotage, related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine,” he said during the opening of the pipeline. The EU said it will slap sanctions on organisers of “illegal” votes in four occupied regions of Ukraine that Russia is conducting as “referendums” with the aim of annexation, AFP reports. “There would be consequences for all people who participate in the illegal, illegitimate referendums,” Peter Stano, a spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, told journalists as the voting took place for a fifth and final day. A high-ranking official in Borrell’s foreign policy service, Luc Devigne, separately told EU lawmakers that “we will put in individuals that are obviously linked to the recent steps with these referendums” in the sanctions package. The EU’s 27 member states are deliberating on fresh sanctions on Russia for holding the vote, widely dismissed by the West as a “sham”. Devigne did not detail what the next sanctions package would contain, but he explained it would include new bans on Russian exports and imports and extend sanctions on some Russian business activities, as well as adding “new listings of companies and individuals”. “We have been clear that those who are involved with these so-called referenda will be held accountable and this will (also) be the subject of... the additional restrictive measures,” he said. These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires which show Russians fleeing into neighbouring Georgia: Georgia and Kazakhstan said that tens of thousands of Russians had flooded into their countries from neighbouring Russia as military-aged men flee the Ukraine military call-up, AFP reports. The Black Sea nation of Georgia said the number of Russians arriving daily has nearly doubled since Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists on September 21. “Four to five days ago 5,000-6,000 (Russians) were arriving in Georgia daily. The number has grown to some 10,000 per day,” Interior Minister Vakhtang Gomelauri told journalists. Georgia and its neighbour Armenia, which do not require visas for Russians, have been a major destination for Russians fleeing since the war began on February 24. The local interior ministry in a Russian region that borders Georgia said today there was a tail-back of around 5,500 cars waiting to cross the Georgian border, calling the situation “extremely tense”. On Tuesday, Central Asia’s Kazakhstan said around 98,000 Russians entered the country since the draft was announced last Wednesday. Astana provided no comparison with previous weeks. “Recently we’ve had many people from Russia coming here,” Kazakh leader Kassym-Jomart Tokayev was quoted as saying by his press service. “Most of them are forced to leave because of the hopeless situation. We must take care of them and ensure their safety.” Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has told a meeting with officials that farmers are among the Russians being drafted into the military, Reuters reports. Russia is the world’s largest wheat exporter and autumn is a busy season for farmers as they sow winter wheat for the next year’s crop and harvest soybeans and sunflower seeds. Winter grain sowing has already been significantly delayed by rains. “I would also like to address regional heads and the heads of agricultural enterprises. As part of the partial mobilisation, agricultural workers are also being drafted. Their families must be supported. I ask you to pay special attention to this issue,” Putin told the televised meeting. Putin also said that Russia is on track to harvest a record grain crop of 150 million tonnes, including 100 million tonnes of wheat, in 2022. Ukrainian and Russian forces were locked in heavy fighting in different parts of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s presidential office says at least 11 civilians have been killed and 18 others wounded by the latest Russian shelling, AP adds. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Donetsk region in the east remained his country’s - and Russia’s - top strategic priority, with “particularly severe” fighting engulfing several towns as Russian troops try to advance to the south and west. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional governor, said three civilians had been killed and 13 wounded in the Donetsk region in the past 24 hours. There were also reported clashes in the Kharkiv region in the northeast - focus of a Ukrainian counter-offensive this month. A strike on the town of Pervomaiskyi killed eight people, including a 15-year-old boy, Ukrainian officials said. Oleh Synyehubov, Kharkiv governor, said in televised comments that “the senseless shelling looks like an attempt to scare civilians.” A Reuters reporter in the city of Zaporizhzhia saw a huge crater next to a restaurant on Khortytsia Island and workers disentangling power lines and trees. The restaurant owner said nobody had been hurt in the overnight strike. The Ukrainian Air Force said on Tuesday it had shot down three Iranian-made drones operated by Russia after an attack on the Mykolaiv region. The UN said it is “deeply disturbed” at reports of nearly 2,400 arrests in less than a week of protests in Russia against the draft ordered by President Vladimir Putin, AFP reports. “We are deeply disturbed by the large number of people who have reportedly been arrested,” UN human rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva. Russian authorities have cracked down on criticism of the war in Ukraine, arresting thousands of protesters since the beginning of the conflict in February. But the arrests have sky-rocketed since Putin announced a partial military mobilisation to bolster troops in Ukraine last Wednesday. Shamdasani pointed to “credible reports (that) some 2,377 demonstrators had been arrested … in various locations across the country. It is unclear how many people remain in detention.” On Saturday, police monitoring group OVD-Info counted at least 726 people in detention in 32 cities across Russia, nearly half of them in Moscow. Shamdasani highlighted in particular the two days of protests in Russia’s southern republic of Dagestan, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and the police. “Dozens of people were reported to have been arrested,” she said. She stressed that the majority of protests across Russia to date had reportedly been peaceful. She said: “We stress that arresting people solely for exercising their rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of liberty. “We call for the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained and for the authorities to abide by their international obligations to respect and ensure the rights to freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly.” Russians who also hold Israeli citizenship are being denied entry into Estonia, according to the Israeli daily, Haaretz. Dozens of men with dual nationality have reportedly attempted to cross the Estonian-Russian border and been turned back by Estonian border guards since Vladimir Putin’s conscription declaration on 21 September. In an interview on Tuesday, Estonia’s ambassador to Israel, Veikko Kala, said that Israeli citizens were only being prevented from entering if they “misled” border officials over the purpose of their trip. “As long as the Israeli citizens, who want to go home through Estonia or visit Estonia, have the required documents, nothing is stopping them from entering Estonia, given that they do not give misleading information about their visit,” he told the newspaper. Estonia has taken an extremely critical stance towards Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Baltic state, along with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, closed its borders to Russian citizens. The restriction, however, is not supposed to apply to those travelling with Israeli passports, which grants visa-free travel in the EU. About 100,000 Israeli citizens are believed to live in Russia. Another 24,000 people with Jewish ancestry have decided to move to Israel since the war began. Israel is home to around 1.5m native Russian speakers, most of whom emigrated after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin said it does not rule out sabotage as a reason behind the damage to the Russia-built network of Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports. It comes after Nord Stream AG, the operator of the network, said earlier that three offshore lines of the Nord Stream gas pipeline system sustained “unprecedented” damage in one day. When asked if sabotage was the reason for the damage, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: “No option can be ruled out right now.” He also said the Kremlin was very concerned with the situation, which requires a prompt investigation as it was an issue for the energy security for the “entire continent”. “This is a very concerning news. Indeed, we are talking about some damage of an unclear nature to the pipeline in Denmark’s economic zone,” he said. “This is an issue related to the energy security of the entire continent.” Russia’s “referendums” in Ukraine, which could lead to Moscow annexing 15% of the country’s territory, are due to end on Tuesday. Voting in the eastern provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia began on Friday and have been dismissed as a sham by western nations, which have pledged not to recognise the results. Russian media have announced that “referendums” in four occupied territories of Ukraine are “valid” a day before voting ended, claiming the turnout had already passed 50%. Analysts have called those turnout claims “flagrantly falsified”. Russian news agency Tass is reporting that two of the polling stations being used in the widely derided referendums in occupied Luhansk have been moved to reserve locations following “threats”. President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to address both houses of Russian parliament on Friday 30 September, and may use the address to formally announce the accession of Russian occupied territories of Ukraine into Russia, the British Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Volodymyr Zelensky has called Russia’s mobilisation “a frank attempt to give commanders on the ground a constant stream of “cannon fodder”, in his nightly address on Monday evening. The Russian Orthodox Church head says Russian soldiers who die on the battlefield will have their sins absolved. Patriarch Kirill, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion, said the “sacrifice washes away all sins”. The United Nations human rights office has said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had caused a dire human rights situation and led to a wide range of rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture, that could amount to war crimes. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a report that it was particularly concerned about torture and ill treatment of detainees by Russian forces and affiliated armed groups, but said there had been rights violations by both sides. Sweden’s Maritime Authority said it had issued a warning of two leaks on the Russian-owned Nord Stream 1 pipeline in Swedish and Danish waters, shortly after a leak on the nearby Nord Stream 2 project was discovered. Nord Stream AG, the operator of the network, says three offshore lines of the Nord Stream gas pipeline system have sustained “unprecedented” damage in one day. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, has again threatened the west with the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and said: “Imagine that Russia is forced to use the most formidable weapon against the Ukrainian regime, which has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state. I believe that Nato will not directly intervene in the conflict even in this situation. After all, the security of Washington, London, and Brussels is much more important for the North Atlantic Alliance than the fate of Ukraine, which no one needs, even if it is abundantly supplied with various weapons.” Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, has commented on the detention of the country’s consul, telling reporters that he was subjected to a “coercive interrogation” during his detention by Russia’s FSB security service and that Japan has demanded an apology. Hayashi told reporters on Tuesday that consul Motoki Tatsunori had not engaged in any illegal activity and described his detention, which lasted several hours, as “totally unacceptable”. Refugees arriving from Ukraine have helped drive Germany’s population to its highest level, the Federal Statistical Office said, with more than 84 million people now living in the EU’s most populous country. Germany’s female population grew by 1.2%, significantly more than its male population, which increased by 0.8%, reflecting the fact that mainly women and children fled the war in Ukraine. The Philippines is in talks with Russia to buy fuel and other commodities, according to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who said the country’s national interests had to take precedence over politics. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Emine Sinmaz will be with you shortly. Vakhtang Gomelauri, who is head of the ministry of internal affairs in Georgia has, according to Russian RIA Novosti news agency, been moved to say that “we have no reason to close the border with Russia and restrict entry to Russians”. He denied reports that some 250,000 Russians had recently arrived in Georgia, saying: “That many people haven’t come, I don’t know where these numbers come from.” He said: “Approximately four to five days ago there were 5,000-6,000 arrivals. Now this figure has grown to 10,000.” In another sign of cultural isolation, Russia appears to have decided to boycott the Oscars, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. It says the Russian film academy said in a statement late last night: “The presidium of the Film Academy of Russia has decided not to nominate a national film for the Oscars award of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2022.” Pavel Chukhray, head of the committee responsible for selecting a nomination, said on Tuesday that he had resigned in the wake of a decision taken “behind his back”. The United Nations human rights office has said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had caused a dire human rights situation and led to a wide range of rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture, that could amount to war crimes. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a report that it was particularly concerned about torture and ill treatment of detainees by Russian forces and affiliated armed groups, but said there had been rights violations by both sides. The OHCHR also said it was “highly concerned” about the “enormous risks” posed by hostilities near or in nuclear power plants, and called for immediate steps to demilitarise the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station occupied by Russian forces. The OHCHR said it was continuing to document and verify allegations of unlawful killings of hundreds of civilians by Russian armed forces in the Kyiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions. It said it had also documented at least six killings of civilians perceived as traitors for alleged collaboration with Russia in occupied areas. It said alleged violations included extrajudicial executions, torture and ill-treatment, sexual violence, ignoring fair trial guarantees, denial of medical assistance, lack of food and water, and poor sanitation. Neither Kyiv or Moscow have immediately commented on the report Oliver Carroll, who is a foreign correspondent for the Economist, has posted an image of cars queueing at the checkpoint with Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia. In a subsequent tweet, he says “Ever so kind, the Russians painted their Z signs on cars that they let through. People were scrubbing them off when they stopped in Ukrainian controlled territory.” The queue does not look as long as the one seen in this satellite image released yesterday by Maxar, which shows the queue of vehicles at the Russian border with Georgia earlier this week. Andrii Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine, has tweeted to suggest that Russian conscripts being sent to the front under the partial mobilisation announced last week would be best advised to surrender at the first opportunity. He said: Mobilized Russians who surrender themselves have a chance to save their lives. Everyone else won’t have it. Refugees arriving from Ukraine have helped drive Germany’s population to its highest level, the Federal Statistical Office said, with more than 84 million people now living in the European Union’s most populous country, Reuters reports. The Federal Statistics Office said that the population had grown by 1%, or 843,000 people, in the first half of 2022. The population grew just 0.1% over the whole of 2021. Germany recorded net immigration of 750,000 people from Ukraine over the same period. Germany’s female population grew by 1.2%, significantly more than its male population, which increased by 0.8%, reflecting the fact that mainly women and children fled the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine, showing that the “voting” continues in the occupied areas of the country while the aftermath of attacks is being dealt with in Kharkiv and Slovyansk. Reuters has a further update on the pipeline situation, carrying a statement from Nord Stream AG, the operator of the network, which says three offshore lines of the Nord Stream gas pipeline system have sustained “unprecedented” damage in one day. It also said that it was impossible to estimate when the gas network system’s working capability would be restored. Sweden’s Maritime Authority said it had issued a warning of two leaks on the Russian-owned Nord Stream 1 pipeline in Swedish and Danish waters, shortly after a leak on the nearby Nord Stream 2 project was discovered. “There are two leaks on Nord Stream 1 – one in Swedish economic zone and one in Danish economic zone. They are very near each other,” a Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) spokesperson told Reuters. The leaks were located north-east of the Danish island Bornholm, the spokesperson said. It was not immediately clear what had caused the leaks. “We are keeping extra watch to make sure no ship comes too close to the site,” a second SMA spokesperson said. On Monday, Danish authorities had asked ships to steer clear of a five nautical mile radius south-east off Bornholm after a gas leak from the defunct Nord Stream 2 pipeline drained into the Baltic Sea. Later the same day, the operator of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which ran at reduced capacity from mid-June before shutting down completely in August, also disclosed a pressure drop on both lines of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. The Danish energy ministry said in a statement that “there are no security risks related to the leak outside of the prohibitive zone. The incident is not expected to have consequences for the security of Danish gas supply”. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, Putin ally, and former prime minister and president of Russia, has issued another warning over the use of nuclear weapons to the west via a long screed on Telegram, in which he specifically criticises US president Joe Biden and new British prime minister Liz Truss. In the course of the message, Medvedev says: I have to remind you again – for those deaf who hear only themselves. Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons if necessary, in predetermined cases, in strict accordance with the fundamentals of state policy in the field of nuclear deterrence. If we or our allies are attacked using this type of weapon. Or if aggression with the use of conventional weapons threatens the very existence of our state. The president of Russia spoke about this directly recently. In addition, we will do everything to prevent the appearance of nuclear weapons in our hostile neighbours. For example, in Nazi Ukraine, which is directly controlled today by Nato countries. He complains that Biden and Truss “demand that Russia remove its hand from its ‘nuclear button’” while accusing Truss of being “completely ready to immediately begin an exchange of nuclear strikes with our country”. He then goes on to say that he does not believe the west would come to Ukraine’s aid or retaliate if Russia did use nuclear weapons, saying: If the threat to Russia exceeds the established danger limit, we will have to respond. Without asking anyone’s permission, without long consultations. And it’s definitely not a bluff. Imagine that Russia is forced to use the most formidable weapon against the Ukrainian regime, which has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state. I believe that Nato will not directly intervene in the conflict even in this situation. After all, the security of Washington, London, and Brussels is much more important for the North Atlantic Alliance than the fate of Ukraine, which no one needs, even if it is abundantly supplied with various weapons. The Russian ministry of defence this morning has published a seven-minute video on its official Telegram channel which it claims are interviews with Ukrainian citizens in Russia voting in Novy Oskol in the Belgorod region. The message accompanying the video quotes a Vladimir Buinak saying “With the collapse of the Soviet Union, everything became very bad, and over time, our region, one might say, was destroyed. We are only for the Russian Federation, we are only for Russia. We were Russian-speaking, we studied in Russian schools.” Another quote is given from Elena Korobova, who pre-empts the result of the vote, saying: “The reunion, of course, is long-awaited, how much we have been waiting for, more than eight years, and, finally, it has happened or it will happen soon.” The Russian ministry of defence goes on to say “All the votes cast by the residents of Donbas on the territory of Russia will be taken into account, and their choice will become part of the historic decision of people who freely vote for what they truly believe in.” Belgorod is to the north-east of Ukraine, bordering the Kharkiv region. The “referendum” process being carried out by proxy Russian authorities in occupied areas of Ukraine has been widely derided as a sham vote. A video has been circulating on social media that purports to show “election officials” at a polling station in Donetsk standing to attention while the Russian national anthem plays. Commenting on the clip, BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford says: “An ‘electoral commission’ in Donetsk stands for the Russian anthem before another day’s ‘voting’ on whether or not to join Russia … Don’t expect many ‘no’ votes here.” Richard Dannatt, former chief of the general staff of the British army, has been interviewed by Sky News in the UK this morning about his view on the latest situation in Russia. He described Vladimir Putin’s order for a partial mobilisation as “deeply unpopular” and said that it was now “hitting home” with ordinary Russians. He told viewers: [Putin] has got an increasing problem at home of his own making. Did he have any alternative? Actually probably not, because of the casualties they have taken, killed or wounded. He was running out of manpower, just as he was probably running out of everything else to do with the military. He’s not going to give up. He’s going to double down. Russia has given an official casualty figure during what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine of around 6,000 personnel. Ukrainian armed forces, by contrast, claim to have killed over 55,000 enemy combatants. Neither figure has been independently verified. The Russian news agency Tass is reporting that two of the polling stations being used in the widely derided “referendums” in the occupied Luhansk region of Ukraine have been moved to reserve locations following “threats”. It quotes Elena Kravchenko, giving her job title as “head of the central election commission of the Luhansk People’s Republic”, saying: Here were threats against members of the commission in the Starobilsk district … that the sites would be burned, they were personally threatened. In this regard, we had to transfer the work of these sites to reserve sites, change the addresses of these polling stations. All voters have been notified, work continues. Ukrainian authorities have described the so-called referendums as a “propaganda show”. Oleh Synyehubov, Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, has issued a status update on Telegram, listing damage and casualties in the last 24 hours that he says has been caused by Russian shelling. He claims that in Kupyansk a church school, an outbuilding, and a shop burned down as a result of shelling and five people were hospitalised. He reports that a 15-year-old was killed in Pervomaiskyi, and seven dead people were found under the rubble in the aftermath of the attack. In Dvorichna, he says that a first responder was killed. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Marcos Jr told Bloomberg TV that the Philippines was in “conversations with as many possible suppliers” and was close to reaching agreements. President Putin has previously claimed that US and European efforts to isolate Russia with economic sanctions will fail because he will instead look to Asia for new trading partners. Over recent months, Russia has courted several countries in the region, offering cheap fuel deals at a time when many are struggling with painful price rises. Indonesia is also reportedly considering buying Russian fuel. Asked about the sanctions imposed on Russia, Marcos said the political side of striking a deal “has been of course a little tricky”, but added “nonetheless, the national interest comes first”. Details are still emerging about Russia detaining a Japanese consul and demanding he leave the country for alleged espionage. You can read about that in full from our Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, here: President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to address both houses of Russian parliament on Friday 30 September, and may use the address to formally announce the accession of Russian occupied territories of Ukraine into Russia, the British Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update: There is a realistic possibility that Putin will use his address to formally announce the accession of the occupied regions of Ukraine to the Russian Federation. The referendums currently underway within these territories are scheduled to conclude on 27 September” Russia’s leaders almost certainly hope that any accession announcement will be seen as a vindication of the ‘special military operation’ and will consolidate patriotic support for the conflict. The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine says that the occupied part of Kherson region is completely closed for entry and exit. The Ukrainian military did not specify a reason for the movement restrictions. Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, has commented on the detention of the country’s consul, telling reporters that he was subjected to a “coercive interrogation” during his detention by Russia’s FSB security service and that Japan has demanded an apology. Hayashi told reporters on Tuesday that consul Motoki Tatsunori had not engaged in any illegal activity and described his detention, which lasted several hours, as “totally unacceptable”. Japan’s foreign ministry summoned the Russian ambassador, Mikhail Galuzin, over the incident, according to the Kyodo news agency. The ministry demanded that Moscow make a formal apology, Hayashi said, adding the government would consider appropriate retaliatory measures. Images are emerging of Russia’s mobilisation in Siberia, where families are farewelling those drafted to fight in the invasion of Ukraine. Reuters correspondents on the ground report that the music of Soviet war songs mixed with the sobbing of relatives in the small Russian town of Bataysk, Omsk, as freshly mobilised reservists farewelled their families on Monday. Protests against the call-up and Russia’s military operation have taken place in dozens of cities, and long queues have formed at Russian land borders with a number of countries. Russian media have announced that “referendums” in four occupied territories of Ukraine are “valid” a day before voting ended, claiming the turnout had already passed 50%. Analysts have called those turnout claims “flagrantly falsified”. Russian state media agency Tass said that on Monday 26 September, voter turnout was 86.89% in Donetsk, 83.61% in Luhansk, in the 63.58% in Kherson, and 66.43% in Zaporizhzhia. Voting is due to end today. The referendums have been repeatedly condemned by Ukraine and the west as a “sham”. Thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said: Turnout even in a free and fair referendum, rather than the Kremlin’s sham plebiscite, would almost certainly be much lower … Even in peacetime, Ukrainians do not turn out to vote at rates as high as what Russian occupation officials are reporting; the first round of Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election saw only a 62.8% turnout.” The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says the Kremlin “faces a daunting task in trying to calm the Russian people while still mobilising enough men to keep fighting,” in its latest Russian offensive campaign assessment. The thinktank documented protests in at least 35 Russian settlements on September 25 and at least 10 settlements on September 26, and said police continued to suppress protests, notably detaining several hundred women in Yakutsk, Republic of Sakha. The ISW also said that the “planned annexation of occupied Ukraine may take place before or shortly after October 1, the start of Russia’s normal fall conscription cycle, to enable the forced conscription of Ukrainian civilians to fight against Ukraine.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called Russia’s mobilisation “a frank attempt to give commanders on the ground a constant stream of “cannon fodder”,” in his nightly address on Monday evening. Russian society is not yet aware of all the brutality of the Russian government towards its own people. But we must do everything so that every citizen of Russia recognises that his own state is depriving him of the most important thing - the right to life.” The president’s comments were published to Telegram. Russia’s FSB security agency said on Monday it had detained a Japanese consul for suspected espionage and ordered him to leave the country. The consul, Motoki Tatsunori, was released after a few hours of detention, Reuters reports. Japan’s top government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said he was blindfolded, restrained, and treated in an “intimidating manner” which was “a clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations”. Tokyo has lodged a “strong protest” about the detention and signalled it may retaliate, Matsuno told a media briefing on Tuesday. The FSB said the consul was declared persona non grata after he was caught “red-handed” receiving secret information on the effects of Western sanctions on the economic situation in Russia’s far east. It said the classified information, which also concerned Russia’s cooperation with an unnamed Asia-Pacific country, had been obtained in return for a “monetary reward”. Japan has said he was not participating in any illegal activity, and will leave the country by Wednesday. Good morning. I’m Tess McClure, and will be beginning our live coverage with you. It’s just after 7am in Kyiv. Here’s the latest news and what’s happened overnight: Russia’s “referendums” in Ukraine, which could lead to Moscow annexing 15% of the country’s territory, are due to end on Tuesday. Voting in the eastern provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia began on Friday and have been dismissed as a sham by western nations, which have pledged not to recognise the results. The Kremlin said it had made no decision on closing Russia’s borders as the first mobilisation since the second world war prompted some to flee. Russia detained a Japanese consul for suspected espionage on Monday, and has ordered him to leave the country. Japan alleges he was blindfolded and restrained. Tokyo has lodged a “strong protest” about the detention and signalled it may retaliate. A Russian man shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town on Monday, after telling him he would refuse to fight in Ukraine. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point-blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline’s pressure collapsed mysteriously on Monday. Authorities in Germany are trying to establish what caused the sudden drop in pressure in the defunct pipeline, with a spokesperson for its operator saying it could have been a leak. Long queues of vehicles formed at the border crossing between Russia and Mongolia as people continue to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag said more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Nato air forces are conducting drills over the Baltic Sea. Member states including the UK, Germany and Italy have taken part in the military training, both over water and on land, in an effort to boost eastern defences. The Netherlands has increased its military support for Ukraine. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, also announced new sanctions in response to Russia’s mobilisation and referendums. The US pledged to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support was aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, said the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. The Russian Orthodox Church head says Russian soldiers who die on the battlefield will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion, said the “sacrifice washes away all sins”. The UK announced 92 new sanctions in response to Russia’s “sham referendums” in Ukraine. The package of penalties target those behind the sham votes as well as oligarchs and board members. Germany is debating whether it should grant asylum to Russian war refuseniks. The interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the country was potentially prepared to give protection to deserters who face repercussions if they refused to fight, but each case would be decided on an individual basis amid security concerns. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog says it is ready for talks about setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency head met the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility. The US has warned of horrific consequences if Russia follows through with its thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons. Antony Blinken said any use of the weapons would have a “catastrophic” impact across the world. Negotiators of a spending bill in the US Congress have agreed to include nearly $12bn in new military and economic aid to Ukraine, Reuters reported sources as saying on Monday. The funding – requested by the Biden administration – would include $4.5bn for defence capabilities and equipment for Ukraine and $4.5bn in direct support to the Kyiv government, the sources said. Ukraine claims some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia presses on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/25/rishi-sunak-to-announce-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T08:09:43Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak to announce windfall tax on energy firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/rishi-sunak-to-announce-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/25/rishi-sunak-to-announce-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak to announce windfall tax on energy firms","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak is expected to unveil controversial plans for a windfall tax on energy companies later on Thursday as ministers seek to move on from the Partygate scandal and deal with the “huge challenge” of spiralling energy and food costs. The chancellor will make a statement to the Commons at 11.30am, laying out measures to ease the pain of rising household bills, which Treasury sources have not denied will include scrapping the requirement to repay a previously announced £200 discount on energy bills for all households, or increasing the level of the grant. Steve Barclay, No 10’s chief of staff and a Conservative MP, said households were braced for a “significant challenge” this autumn when the energy price cap rises, further compounding the already “huge hike” in costs over the past few months. He stressed there would be more “targeted action” to help the least well-off, following a warning from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that injecting too much more money risked making inflation “much more permanent” in the economy. Among the measures expected to be unveiled by Sunak are an increase in the warm home discount scheme, which is worth £150 to 3 million low-income households. This grant could rise to as much as £500. The government could also bring forward a planned increase in benefits that had been expected next year or offer a council tax rebate. The Times reported that the previously announced £200 loan on energy bills would be replaced with a grant that will not have to be paid back, with the discount possibly increasing to as much as £400. After the head of Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it was on course to raise the cap on energy bills by a further £800 in October, the government faced significant pressure to swiftly announce further financial support for struggling households. The measures will be funded in part by a windfall tax on energy firms, after a fierce battle within the government over the policy, which has been bitterly opposed by some cabinet ministers including the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. The measure could be extended to all electricity generators and may include exemptions for investments. A senior party official admitted the decision had caused splits in the government. “The arguments have been tested rigorously both within the Treasury and within government and there is high pressure to make sure that the gain is worth the pain and that it does not jeopardise investment,” they said. “We do not want to introduce random taxes that make the environment unpredictable for global companies that can go anywhere. We have to set the bar high and do something genuinely impactful and put in massive safeguards to ensure we do not jeopardise investment.” In an interview with BBC Breakfast, Barclay avoided questions about why the government would support a windfall tax after ministers and Tory MPs spent weeks rubbishing Labour’s proposal, but said they had been wary of risking “inward investment” by offshore energy companies. He said the government was considering how to fund extra financial support by “looking at the balance, how much is done through debt, how much is done through revenue raising” while also recognising “we do need a long-term energy strategy, and one that attracts inward investment”. Oil and gas producers have benefited from rocketing global energy prices during Russia’s war in Ukraine. Higher gas prices have pushed up wholesale prices across the electricity market, including for some producers of renewable and nuclear power. The Treasury has reportedly analysed whether the tax should be expanded beyond North Sea operators such as BP and Shell to generators including renewable energy operators such as windfarms. It is estimated the plan could tax more than £10bn of excess profits, although City analysts said that figure was far beyond their estimates. Labour’s plan for a one-off levy applied only to North Sea oil and gas producers would raise an estimated £2bn. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We understand that people are struggling with rising prices, which is why we’ve provided £22bn of support to date. The chancellor was clear that as the situation evolves, so will our response, with the most vulnerable being his number one priority.” Economists say living costs for Britain’s poorest households are expected to increase by almost twice the rate of those for the richest when energy bills rise this autumn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the fresh surge in gas and electricity bills expected in October could lead to average annual inflation rates of as high as 14% for the poorest 10th of households. Economist Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, said the support should be as targeted as possible. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I do think we need to be careful … Putting tens of billions into the economy at a time of high inflation could stoke additional demand and make the inflation much more permanent in the economy.” The energy crisis was thrown into sharp focus this week when Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of the energy regulator Ofgem, indicated the energy price cap would increase by a further £830 to nearly £2,800 in October. The increase is likely to hit poorer families disproportionately because a larger share of their total spending goes on energy. The IFS said the poorest 10th of households typically spend almost three times as much of their budgets on gas and electricity as the richest 10th. This means low-income homes are experiencing a much higher rate of inflation than the wealthy. The IFS predicts that while inflation for those on the breadline will reach 14% this autumn, the richest 10th could see rates of about 8%. Across all households, inflation is likely to reach 10%, the highest rate since 1982. In a sign of the growing pressure on households, figures on Wednesday showed average petrol prices hit a new record high of 170.4p a litre, up from 129p a litre a year ago. Diesel rose to 181.4p, up from 131.3p a year earlier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/31/testing-times-why-north-koreas-missile-launches-should-worry-the-west","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-31T05:26:02Z","webTitle":"Testing times: why North Korea’s missile launches should worry the west","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/testing-times-why-north-koreas-missile-launches-should-worry-the-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/31/testing-times-why-north-koreas-missile-launches-should-worry-the-west","fields":{"headline":"Testing times: why North Korea’s missile launches should worry the west","bodyText":"When it comes to North Korean missile launches – and much else about the secretive country – all may not be as it seems. Days after the regime claimed it had successfully tested its biggest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), South Korea said it believed the launch had been faked. The “monster missile”, the South’s military said, was in fact a Hwasong-15 – a smaller projectile previously tested in 2017, the last time Pyongyang fired missiles potentially capable of striking anywhere on the US mainland. Even if last week’s launch, accompanied by a slick PR video showing the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in a black leather jacket and aviator shades, was not of the more powerful Hwasong-17, there is agreement that the weapon flew further and higher than any other in the history of Pyongyang’s missile tests. The timing is significant, coming as US president Joe Biden’s attention is on the war in Ukraine – a reminder that North Korea’s sanctions-busting development of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons is continuing with alarming speed. “Pyongyang might have thought it was safe to test more provocative weapons without drawing penalties while Washington and the world are preoccupied with Ukraine,” said Duyeon Kim, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. “North Korea usually has multiple objectives for every action. It may be gearing up for a tougher US-South Korea alliance after Yoon Suk-yeol’s presidential election victory while pushing ahead with preexisting plans to make hi-tech nuclear weapons as ordered by Kim Jong-un. It might also be aiming to mask any internal weakness through shows of strength before the North Korean people even if it has to be deceptive about them.” Despite reports that a Hwasong-17 had exploded in midair over Pyongyang in mid-March, reportedly in view of shocked residents of the capital, every significant missile launch is partly intended for Kim’s domestic audience. While the country battles food shortages and attempts to revive cross-border trade with China wrecked by two years of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, Kim habitually uses weapons tests as an opportunity to demonise the US and reinforce the belief among the country’s 25 million people that their greatest existential threat comes not from economic mismanagement but from the “imperialists” other side of the Pacific. Above all, the first launch of an ICBM since November 2017 was a reminder to the US that despite years of UN security council sanctions, North Korea is quickly becoming a legitimate nuclear-armed state that Washington will have to treat as an equal if there is to be a return to Trump-era summitry. Although Biden has shown little interest in meeting Kim, North Korea can point to an increasingly impressive inventory of weapons, from a purported hypersonic missiles and smaller short-range solid-fuel missiles targeting South Korea, as an inducement to talk. In addition, analysts say the North could be planning another nuclear test – its seventh – to claim it has acquired the ability to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on those missiles. “The offensive arithmetic will be in their favour soon; they may be able to keep up with advances in American defences,” Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said after the recent ICBM test. The North’s diplomatic calculation is the same now as it was when Kim signed up to a nebulously worded agreement to “denuclearise” the Korean peninsula at his first summit with Trump in June 2018, even though few analysts believed he had any intention of relinquishing his most effective deterrent and most powerful bargaining chip. Pyongyang’s goal seems to be to strengthen its leverage so it can turn denuclearisation talks into nuclear-reduction talks in exchange for economic aid. “The message of the North Korean readout of [the recent] ICBM launch is clear: North Korea will continue to develop its nuclear arsenal,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee at the Washington-based 38 North programme, which monitors North Korea. After a four-year hiatus, analysts say the ICBM test could be the opening gambit in a new phase of provocations reminiscent of the “fire and fury” days of 2017. “A nuclear test is possible,” Hyun-Wook Kim, professor and director-general at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul, said, amid signs that work is under way to dig a shortcut to a tunnel at Punggye-ri, a nuclear test site the North “detonated” in 2018, weeks before Kim’s first summit with Trump. “I think North Korea will use this opportunity to continue its military provocations as a way of getting something from both the US and China,” he added. Duyeon Kim said it was “only a matter of time” before North Korea conducts a nuclear test, provided it stands to gain technologically or politically. “North Korea has every reason to raise tensions on the peninsula to gain leverage ahead of any future negotiations with Washington and to be accepted by the world as a permanent nuclear power,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/08/ranked-how-green-are-the-tory-leadership-candidates","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-08T11:04:40Z","webTitle":"Ranked: how green are the Tory leadership candidates?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/08/ranked-how-green-are-the-tory-leadership-candidates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/08/ranked-how-green-are-the-tory-leadership-candidates","fields":{"headline":"Ranked: how green are the Tory leadership candidates?","bodyText":"Whoever succeeds Boris Johnson as UK prime minister, whether from the extreme right wing of the Tory party or tacking to the centre, is likely to be a disappointment to environmental campaigners. Although Johnson’s record in government on environmental policies was patchy at best, he was widely viewed as the prime champion of climate action and green issues within government. He oversaw the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow; three vital pieces of environmental legislation in the environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill; and the net zero strategy. His actions may at times have fallen short, but even diehard green campaigners acknowledge that his rhetoric at least was usually green. In that, he was largely alone in his cabinet. Zac Goldsmith, the climate minister who was elevated to the Lords by Johnson, tweeted on Wednesday night: “Most of the likely contenders [for leadership] are people who, on the whole, couldn’t give a shit about climate and nature.” Tom Burke, a veteran government adviser and co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, added: “The environment was seen as a Johnson priority, not a Tory priority.” Some of the top candidates have a recent track record of opposing or downplaying climate action while in cabinet. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has been at war with No 10 over net zero, kiboshing nearly every policy – from insulation to renewable energy – that could boost the UK’s climate fight. Liz Truss, despite being foreign secretary, played almost no role at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, and failed to mention the climate in speeches and meetings with her foreign counterparts. Yet this is a crucial time for the climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the world has reached a point of “now or never”: drastic action now could limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but without that we face irreversible and catastrophic changes. The next prime minister will shape the UK’s role in ways that will play out over years. This winter, the UK faces soaring gas bills. Insulation would help, but there are no plans for insulating the UK’s draughty households, and though more renewable energy is being built, wind farms still face hurdles in the planning system. In addition, two vital jobs will soon fall vacant: the chair of the Environment Agency, and the chair of the Committee on Climate Change, a position held by former Conservative environment minister John Gummer. The prime minister can effectively determine both appointments. A slew of government bills are on hold, but beyond legislation there are also important decisions looming that will have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions for years to come. A decision has been delayed, but must be made soon, on a new coal mine proposed in Cumbria, which Gummer, who is Lord Deben, has said has no justification. The moratorium on fracking could also be lifted, while the windfall tax offers billions of tax giveaways to fossil fuel companies, potentially including frackers. At this crucial moment, when the stakes have never been higher and with public support clearly in favour of climate action, the rightwing of the Tory party has come out in full flood against net zero. David Frost, hero of Brexit to many on the right, has taken to the media to blame the push for net zero for the energy prices rise, despite the fact that it is fossil fuel prices that have risen, and the clear evidence that renewable energy reduces bills. Green campaigners point out that the next leader of the Tory party will have to court not just the small group of party members, but also the electorate at large. They warned prospective candidates not to ignore public opinion, which is consistently well over 60% in favour of climate action across a wide range of polls. Some of the potential leadership candidates and their green credentials Rishi Sunak While chancellor, Sunak frequently vetoed moves that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions but incur a cost to the public purse. The green homes grant was a rare example of him allowing funding for such a project, but its administration was botched and it ended in disaster. Since then, no significant new green policies requiring public funding have been allowed. At Cop26, he trumpeted the UK’s funding for climate finance overseas for developing countries, and moves to force banks and other companies to account for their emissions. Green score: 2/5 Liz Truss Truss always looked impatient in her two-year stint as environment secretary under David Cameron, giving the firm impression she was eager to move on to something she regarded as meatier. As foreign secretary, she barely played a role in Cop26 last November, the biggest diplomatic gathering on British soil since the second world war, and failed to mention the environment or climate in speeches and meetings with foreign counterparts. She has not yet spoken out against net zero. Green score: 1/5 Michael Gove A self-confessed “shy green Tory”, Gove gained the respect of many green campaigners during his stint as environment secretary, when he brought forward a 25-year environment plan and started off several pieces of green legislation, including a new environment act and reforms to agricultural subsidies. During his recent role on levelling-up, he counselled against fracking, and prepared to take on housing developers over energy-efficiency standards. Green score: 4/5 Jeremy Hunt Within his constituency, Hunt has supported attempts to stop fossil fuel development, and he has said that bidding for the chance to host Cop26 was a proud moment for him as foreign secretary. Beyond that, he has said little in public on green issues but joined the Conservative Environment Network earlier this year and is not on the anti-net zero wing. Green score: 3/5 Suella Braverman On her website, the attorney general proclaims: “I firmly believe in protecting both the UK’s vibrant ecosystem and the natural environment worldwide. Environmental and economic progress are not just compatible: they depend on each other. The government is committed to being the UK’s greenest ever.” Closer examination, however, reveals this as a boilerplate statement repeated by many Tory MPs. She has tried to crack down on climate activists in her legal post, putting injunctions on Insulate Britain protesters. Green score: 1/5 Sajid Javid The MP for Bromsgrove says he has “gone on a journey” when it comes to climate and biodiversity, but that these are now among his passions. He has called for biodiversity to be included in GDP and, although he is popular with some of the more rightwing Conservatives, has said that being a free marketeer does not need to be at odds with strong environmental policies. He also wants a new international body to encourage companies to fund and implement green measures. He has also not been afraid to call out those who do not care about nature, including Donald Trump, and is understood to be considering an intervention on climate policy in the near future. Green score: 3.5/5 Steve Baker Brexiter Baker revealed to the Guardian that he was considering standing on a platform including scrapping green policies from farming subsidies that prioritise nature to the push for solar and wind power, and wants gas and nuclear power to be classed as green. He has said telling children about the climate crisis is “child abuse”. He supports fracking, is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate-sceptic thinktank, and is co-founder of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Tory MPs, accused of trying to make the climate a “culture war” issue.

The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, argued the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. The move risks further provoking an already irritated Kremlin. Before the British announcement, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would retaliate further if the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week. “We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” said the Russian leader, who has been closely involved with operational military decisions throughout the three months-plus of the war. He did not specify what those targets were. In the small hours of Sunday morning, Russian cruise missiles struck a railway depot in the eastern Dniprovsky suburb of Kyiv. Ukraine said the strike hit a rail car repair works; Moscow said it had destroyed tanks sent by eastern European countries to Ukraine. It was the first time anywhere in the capital has been hit for over five weeks. One person was hospitalised, and a plume of smoke rose and was visible from high points in the capital. Five cruise missiles were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. Kyiv was last hit on 28 April. Russia’s ministry of defence claimed it was targeting an arsenal of T-72 tanks that had been delivered from eastern European countries, suggesting it now wants to target the supply of western arms. But Ukrainian officials said the statement was false. Oleksandr Kamyshin, the chairman of the board of Ukrainian Railways, said: “There are no such tanks at the plant, as well as no military equipment. There are only cars that we repair. These carriages we need for export – these are, in particular, grain carriages.” The UK, in conjunction with the US and other western nations, began the war by promising only to supply “defensive weaponry” to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion. But as Russia has made gains in the east and the south of the country, western countries have gradually sent more lethal arms. London said it had been cooperating closely with Washington. The British announcement comes a few days after the US said it would send four similar truck-mounted Himars systems. The US and UK systems are intended to be complementary. The ranges of both are far greater than any land weapons Ukraine currently has. Like the US, the UK has sought assurances from Kyiv that the M270s would not be used to strike targets within Russia. A British defence source said the weapons will be used “to defend Ukraine, in Ukraine”. They added: “We have confidence that the weapons will be used appropriately.” Britain did not say how many M270s it was sending, although the number is small and will be comparable to the US decision to send four Himars. Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the launchers in the UK, the MoD added, and Kyiv’s forces will be supplied with the appropriate rockets “at scale”. However, Putin said he believed the west’s goal was to prolong the war in Ukraine, which has now gone on for over three months, after the Russian president launched an unprovoked invasion on 24 February. “All this fuss around additional deliveries of weapons, in my opinion, has only one goal: to drag out the armed conflict as much as possible,” Putin added. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company, Energoatom, also warned on Sunday that a Russian cruise missile had come dangerously close to the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. It said the missile “flew critically low” over the site and that Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak”. Elsewhere, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that Ukrainian forces had counterattacked in Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained” but offered no assessment of whether the effort was pushing the invaders back. On Saturday, Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, said his country’s forces had regained about 20% of the city in Donbas, which had been under days of attack from concentrated Russian shelling and airstrikes. Haidai repeated that claim on Sunday, adding that eight Russians had been taken prisoner and that the occupiers had “lost a huge number of personnel”. A humanitarian headquarters in neighbouring Lysychansk had been struck with 30 shells overnight, the governor said. Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”, said the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, overnight. The research group, which closely monitors the fighting, said that Russia “may still be able to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk” and that it appeared that “Ukrainian defences remain strong in this pivotal theatre”. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was relying on “poorly equipped and trained” separatist forces from Luhansk to conduct the clearance of the city, a tactic it said had been previously employed by Moscow’s forces in Syria. “This approach likely indicates a desire to limit casualties suffered by regular Russian forces,” it added. One Ukrainian presidential adviser urged European nations to respond with “more sanctions, more weapons” to the strike on Kyiv – and appeared to criticise the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had said in an interview on Friday that Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine so that a diplomatic solution could eventually be found. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the president’s office, tweeted: “While someone asks not to humiliate Russia, the Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today’s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal – kill as many Ukrainians as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jun/22/russia-ukraine-war-significant-blow-against-snake-island-occupiers-says-ukrainian-army-russia-marks-anniversary-of-hitlers-invasion-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-23T00:26:20Z","webTitle":"Finland’s armed forces chief says his country is prepared for a Russian attack and ready to fight – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/22/russia-ukraine-war-significant-blow-against-snake-island-occupiers-says-ukrainian-army-russia-marks-anniversary-of-hitlers-invasion-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jun/22/russia-ukraine-war-significant-blow-against-snake-island-occupiers-says-ukrainian-army-russia-marks-anniversary-of-hitlers-invasion-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Finland’s armed forces chief says his country is prepared for a Russian attack and ready to fight – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for joining us for today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. We will be pausing our live reporting overnight and returning in the morning. In the meantime, you can read our comprehensive summary of the day’s events in our summary below. Russian forces are edging closer to seizing the last pocket of resistance in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region. Sievierodonetsk and its neighbouring city, Lysychansk, continue to be battered by intense Russian shelling. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Wednesday that Russian forces were moving towards Lysychansk, targeting the buildings of police, state security and prosecutors. Dramatic footage has emerged from Russia of what appears to be a drone flying into an oil refinery and causing an explosion in what could be an attack inside Russia’s borders. Video shared on social media showed the unmanned aerial vehicle crashing into the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov region, in what would be an embarrassing breach of Russia’s air defence systems. A television tower in the Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk has been badly damaged by shelling and broadcasting has been interrupted, the local Donetsk news agency reported. The Petrovskiy television centre is still standing, but part of its equipment has been damaged, while some equipment has been moved out, the agency said. A Russian missile strike has left at least one person dead in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv, according to its mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. The attack caused several fires and damaged a number of buildings including a school, Senkevych said. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said seven missiles had hit Mykolaiv. Residents and workers at a nuclear power plant in Enerhodar, a city in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, are being abducted by Russian occupiers, according to the region’s mayor. “Whereabouts of some unknown. The rest are in very difficult conditions: they are being tortured with electric shock, bullied physically and morally,” said mayor Dmytro Orlov. British intelligence predicts that Russia’s momentum will slow over the next few months.“Our defence intelligence service believes, however, that in the next few months, Russia could come to a point at which there is no longer any forward momentum because it has exhausted its resources,” British prime minister, Boris Johnson, told reporters. The Kremlin said the EU sanctions that led Lithuania to block the transit of some goods to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad were “absolutely unacceptable”. Moscow was working on retaliatory measures in response to the “illegal sanctions” by the EU, it said. Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s response to Lithuania’s ban would not be exclusively diplomatic but practical in nature. Ukraine has played down the chances of reaching an agreement with Russia that could allow blocked grain shipments to start sailing across the Black Sea. Consultations are ongoing, Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said. Russia’s defence ministry said Moscow and Ankara had agreed to continue discussions on safe vessel departures and grain exports from Ukrainian ports. Leaders at the upcoming G7 summit in Germany will announce new measures aimed at pressuring Russia as well as new commitments to shore up European security, a senior US official has said. “We will roll out a concrete set of proposals to increase pressure on Russia,” the official said. The G7 is also likely to discuss the fate of a Russian turbine blocked in Canada and blamed for reducing gas supplies to Germany, Canada’s natural resources minister added. Finland’s armed forces chief said his country was prepared for a Russian attack and would put up stiff resistance in the event that one should occur. Finns are motivated to fight and the country has built up a substantial arsenal, Gen Timo Kivinen said, adding: “The most important line of defence is between one’s ears.” Vladimir Putin has called for a strengthening of ties with countries from the Brics group of emerging economies – Brazil, Russia, India, China South Africa– following western sanctions over Ukraine. The Russian leader said discussions were continuing on the “opening of Indian chain stores in Russia, increasing the share of Chinese automobiles” on the Russian market. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov visited in Iran on Wednesday to expand cooperation between the two nations in light of western sanctions. The Iranian foreign ministry said Lavrov’s visit was aimed at “expanding cooperation with the Eurasian region and the Caucasus”. Europe needs to prepare immediately for Russia to turn off all gas exports to the region this winter, according to the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol. He called on governments to work on reducing demand and keeping nuclear power plants open. A Ukrainian photojournalist and a soldier who was accompanying him were “coldly executed” when they were killed in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion, according to Reporters Without Borders. Maks Levin and Oleksiy Chernyshov were reportedly searching Russian-occupied woodlands for the photographer’s missing image-taking drone, the agency said, citing its findings from an investigation into their deaths. Countries should ask the United States for help if they have any problems importing Russian food and fertiliser, a senior US official has said. “Nothing is stopping Russia from exporting its grain or fertiliser except to own policies and actions,” US State Department Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs Assistant Secretary, Ramin Toloui, said according to a transcript published on Wednesday. However he added that concerns had been raised about “so-called over compliance with sanctions.” Facilitating Russian food and grain exports is a key part of attempts by UN and Turkish officials to broker a package deal with Moscow that would also allow for shipments of Ukraine grain from the Black Sea port of Odesa. A meeting between Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and UN officials would likely be held in Istanbul in coming weeks, sources in the Turkish presidency said. “We are fully supportive of this and want to see that play out,” Toloui said of the UN efforts. “We’ll continue close coordination with the UN delegation and the government of Ukraine on ways to mitigate the impacts to global food security of Putin’s war in Ukraine.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Iran on Wednesday to expand cooperation between the two nations in light of western sanctions. Russia’s foreign ministry posted a clip of Lavrov’s opening remarks during a meeting with Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi in which he said Moscow was adapting to what he called the west’s aggressive policies. In all the countries experiencing the negative influence of the selfish line taken by the United States and its satellites, there arises the objective need to reconfigure their economic relations so they can avoid relying on the whims and vagaries of our western partners,” Lavrov said. Last month Moscow said Russia and Iran, which are both under western sanctions and sit on some of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves, had discussed swapping supplies for oil and gas as well as establishing a logistics hub. While Moscow is challenging western sanctions over Ukraine, Tehran’s clerical rulers have been struggling to keep Iran’s economy afloat because of US sanctions that were reimposed after Washington exited Tehran’s nuclear deal in 2018. “During Lavrov’s visit, Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal, boosting bilateral and energy cooperation, as well as international and regional issues will be discussed,” Iranian state media reported. The Iranian foreign ministry said on Monday that Lavrov’s visit was aimed at “expanding cooperation with the Eurasian region and the Caucasus”. Iran’s state news agency IRNA said Lavrov would meet his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amirabdollahian, on Thursday. The G7 is also likely to discuss the fate of a Russian turbine blocked in Canada and blamed for reducing gas supplies to Germany, Canada’s natural resources minister said on Wednesday. “If you talk to the Germans, they are very, very concerned about” a decline in gas supplies allegedly caused by the missing turbine, Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters. “I’m sure it’ll come up at least in the corridors of the G7 … I wouldn’t hold my breath that we’re going to find a resolution before the end.” Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom has cut the capacity along the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just 40% of usual levels in recent days, citing the delayed return of equipment being serviced by Germany’s Siemens Energy in Canada. Moscow said on Thursday more delays in repairs could lead to suspending all flows, putting a brake on Europe’s race to refill its gas inventories. Canada, alongside its western allies, has issued sweeping sanctions on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February. Russia calls the war a “special military operation”. “We are trying to be sensitive to the concerns that Germany and others are expressing and trying to find a resolution that will allow us to ensure that we’re respecting the intent of the sanctions, but also ensuring we’re not penalising our allies,” Wilkinson said. Wilkinson said he did not know for sure if the turbines were the reason for the current reduction in gas supplies, but said the issue should be resolved anyway. Leaders at the upcoming G7 summit in Germany will announce new measures aimed at pressuring Russia over its invasion of Ukraine as well as new commitments to shore up European security, a senior US official has said. “We will roll out a concrete set of proposals to increase pressure on Russia,” the official said. US President Joe Biden will join the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan at the summit in Bavaria. After attending the G7 summit from Sunday to Tuesday, Biden will fly to Madrid for a summit of the Nato military alliance next week. Ukraine and Russia will feature heavily in both diplomatic gatherings as allies ponder how to weather the secondary impact from sanctions against Russia on their own economies - particularly in stoking high fuel prices. Speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, the US official said: How do we maximise pain on Putin’s regime? How do we minimise spill-backs back to the rest of the world? And I think that’s exactly how the discussion around energy markets and energy market challenges will get framed.” The official also confirmed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would address both summits by video link. It’s 1am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: British intelligence predicts that Russia’s momentum in its war in Ukraine will slow over the next few months, according to British prime minister Boris Johnson. “Our defence intelligence service believes, however, that in the next few months, Russia could come to a point at which there is no longer any forward momentum because it has exhausted its resources,” Johnson told a group of European newspapers. Columbia Law School will advise Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on war reparations. Ukraine has added to its growing arsenal of U.S. lawyers, tapping Washington, D.C.-based Allen &amp; Overy partner Patrick Pearsall through Columbia Law School as a legal advisor to Zelenskiy on reparations issues. In a recent interview with Ukrainian outlet Hromadske, wounded Ukrainian soldiers said that Russian forces and weaponry significantly outnumber theirs. “There is one artillery shell of ours against about 20 of theirs … and I’m talking about only the bombardment artillery, I’m not even mentioning the cluster projectiles, which they deluge us with,” one soldier told the outlet. Five women have been killed in the village of Pryshib in the Kharkiv oblast as a result of Russian shelling on Wednesday, Euromaidan Press reports. According to the outlet, at least 860 civilians have been killed by Russian forces in Kharkiv since the Russian invasion in February. Ukraine’s parliament has approved and ratified the Istanbul Convention, a human rights treaty aimed to prevent and combat violence against women. The convention “will establish legally blinding standards for governments to prevent violence against all women and girls...and applies during armed conflict.” Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has launched a series of criminal cases under the article of “discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.” The cases include a list of “objectionable media.” the Belarusian outlet NEXTA, which is also on the list, reports. The mayor of Enerhodar, a city in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, has said that locals, including workers at the nuclear power plant operator Energoatom, are being abducted by Russian occupiers. “Whereabouts of some unknown. The rest are in very difficult conditions: they are being tortured with electric shock, bullied physically and morally,” said mayor Dmytro Orlov. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand over the blog to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock, who will bring you the latest updates on Ukraine. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. British intelligence predicts that Russia’s momentum in its war in Ukraine will slow over the next few months, according to British prime minister Boris Johnson. “Our defence intelligence service believes, however, that in the next few months, Russia could come to a point at which there is no longer any forward momentum because it has exhausted its resources,” Johnson told a group of European newspapers. “Then we must help the Ukrainians to reverse the dynamic. I will argue for this at the Group of Seven summit (in Germany at the weekend),” he added. When asked what a victory for Ukraine or failure for Putin would look like, Johnson replied, “That we at least regain the status quo that was there before Feb. 24 and that its (Russia’s) troops are repulsed from the areas they invaded.” Columbia Law School will advise Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on war reparations. Reuters reports: Ukraine has added to its growing arsenal of U.S. lawyers, tapping Washington, D.C.-based Allen &amp; Overy partner Patrick Pearsall through Columbia Law School as a legal advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on reparations issues. According to a filing with the U.S. Department of Justice dated June 13, Pearsall is studying international law remedies Ukraine may pursue in response to Russia’s four-month-old invasion. The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires law firms, lobbying shops and public relations consultants to disclose certain engagements with foreign clients. Pearsall did not report any income from the Ukraine engagement in the filing. He is representing Zelenskiy as the director of Columbia Law’s new International Claims and Reparations Project. The group is examining how Ukraine can utilize international law to bring claims against Russia and seek reparations for its hostilities, according to a May statement from Columbia Law. In a recent interview with Ukrainian outlet Hromadske, wounded Ukrainian soldiers said that Russian forces and weaponry significantly outnumber theirs. “There is one artillery shell of ours against about 20 of theirs … and I’m talking about only the bombardment artillery, I’m not even mentioning the cluster projectiles, which they deluge us with,” one soldier told the outlet. Another soldier said, “We were going to the positions to replace a brigade. Our brigade, our company was coming. And our company was fired [on] by tanks, planes, helicopters and missiles.” Ukrainian forces have been pleading for increased western military assistance as the war enters its fourth month. Five women have been killed in the village of Pryshib in the Kharkiv oblast as a result of Russian shelling on Wednesday, Euromaidan Press reports. According to the outlet, at least 860 civilians have been killed by Russian forces in Kharkiv since the Russian invasion in February. Ukraine’s parliament has approved and ratified the Istanbul Convention, a human rights treaty aimed to prevent and combat violence against women. On Tuesday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a law that ratified the Istanbul Convention, a move that has been described as “historic moment for Ukraine...which supports the policy of gender equality.” The Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić praised the move, saying, “This is a huge step forward in protecting women and girls from all forms of violence, whether in Ukraine or abroad.” According to the UN website Relief Web, the convention “will establish legally blinding standards for governments to prevent violence against all women and girls...and applies during armed conflict.” Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has launched a series of criminal cases under the article of “discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,” and has included a list of “objectionable media.” the Belarusian outlet NEXTA reports.

The rest are in very difficult conditions: they are being tortured with electric shock, bullied physically and morally,” said mayor Dmytro Orlov. Orlov added that the “exchange of civilian prisoners abducted by the occupiers was urgently needed at the highest level”. It is 9pm in Kyiv.

Finns are motivated to fight and the country has built up a substantial arsenal, Kivinen says, adding: “The most important line of defence is between one’s ears.” Vladimir Putin has called for a strengthening of ties with countries from the Brics group of emerging economies – Brazil, Russia, India, China South Africa– following western sanctions over Ukraine. The Russian leader said discussions were continuing on the “opening of Indian chain stores in Russia, increasing the share of Chinese automobiles” on the Russian market. Europe needs to prepare immediately for Russia to turn off all gas exports to the region this winter, according to the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol. He called on governments to work on reducing demand and keeping nuclear power plants open. A Ukrainian photojournalist and a soldier who was accompanying him were “coldly executed” when they were killed in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion, according to Reporters Without Borders. Maks Levin and Oleksiy Chernyshov were reportedly searching Russian-occupied woodlands for the photographer’s missing image-taking drone, the agency said, citing its findings from an investigation into their deaths. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today on the blog. My colleagues in the US will be here shortly with the latest from Ukraine. Thank you. A television tower in the Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk has been badly damaged by shelling and broadcasting has been interrupted, Russian state media cited the local Donetsk news agency as saying. The Petrovskiy television centre is still standing, but part of its equipment has been damaged, while some equipment has been moved out, according to the Donetsk news agency. Footage shows a plume of smoke rising above Mykolaiv after a vegetable oil terminal caught fire in the Ukrainian port city. Mykolaiv was struck seven times early on Wednesday, according to local officials. Strikes in other parts of the city killed at least one person and damaged homes, businesses and a school, the city’s mayor said. Ukraine has played down the chances of reaching an agreement with Russia that could allow blocked grain shipments to start sailing across the Black Sea. Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said Kyiv welcomed efforts by the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, to unblock grain exports from Ukrainian seaports. Consultations are ongoing, Nikolenko tweeted. He added: Yet no concrete agreements on holding talks with Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and UN have been reached so far. Security remains a key element of Ukraine’s position. Turkey’s defence ministry earlier said its “constructive” meeting with a Russian military delegation resulted in “an understanding for future negotiations between Turkey, Russia, Ukraine and the UN”. The Turkish defence ministry said: In this context, it was decided that a four-way meeting should be held in Turkey in the coming weeks, after a meeting with the Ukrainian side and the UN. A Russian defence ministry statement about the Turkish meeting also noted no discernible progress. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he believed all 27 EU member countries will support granting Ukraine EU candidate status at a summit later this week. Speaking to Canadian students via video link, Zelenskiy said: This is like going into the light from the darkness. Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the UK “fully supports” Lithuania’s decision to ban the transit of Russian goods sanctioned by the EU through its territory. Truss tweeted that Britain “must stay strong in the face of Russian aggression and challenge these unjustified threats”. Nearly two-thirds of Europeans believe EU membership is a “good thing”, according to a study, marking the highest result in 15 years. Most countries – notably Lithuania and Estonia – showed significantly more positive attitudes towards EU membership compared with a survey conducted at the end of last year, the European parliament said in a statement. The president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, said: With war returning to our continent, Europeans feel reassured to be part of the European Union. Only one in 10 respondents saw Russia positively compared to one in three in 2018, the study showed. Attitudes to China have also deteriorated. Nearly 60% considered a defence of “common European values” a priority, even if it were to affect prices and costs of living. Another EU-backed survey published last week showed 80% of respondents supported economic sanctions against Russia and a common security and defence policy. Vladimir Putin has called for a strengthening of ties with countries from the Brics group of emerging economies – Brazil, Russia, India, China South Africa– following western sanctions over Ukraine. On the eve of a Brics summit, the Russian president said Moscow was in the process of rerouting its trade towards “reliable international partners, above all the Brics countries”. Business people from Brics countries were being “forced to develop their business under difficult conditions” where western countries “neglect the basic principles of market economy, free trade, as well as the inviolability of private property”, Putin said. He said discussions were continuing on the “opening of Indian chain stores in Russia, increasing the share of Chinese automobiles” on the Russian market. Russian oil deliveries to China and India are increasing, he said. Russia is also developing “alternative international transfer mechanisms” with Brics partners and an “international reserve currency” to reduce dependence on the dollar and euro, Putin added. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces are edging closer to seizing the last pocket of resistance in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region. Sievierodonetsk and its neighbouring city Lysychansk continue to be battered by intense Russian shelling. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Wednesday that Russian forces were moving towards Lysychansk, targeting the buildings of police, state security and prosecutors. Dramatic footage has emerged from Russia of what appears to be a drone crashing into an oil refinery and setting off a fiery explosion in what could be an attack inside Russia’s borders. Video shared on social media showed the unmanned aerial vehicle crashing into the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov in what would be an embarrassing breach of Russia’s air defence systems in its war in Ukraine. A Russian missile strike has left at least one person dead in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv, according to its mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. The attack caused several fires and damaged a number of buildings including a school, Senkevych said. Regional governor Vitaliy Kim said seven missiles had hit Mykolaiv. Ukraine’s army said it launched airstrikes on Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, causing “significant losses” to Russian forces. The military’s southern operational command said it had undertaken “aimed strikes with the use of various forces” and the military operation was continuing. The Kremlin said the EU sanctions that led Lithuania to block the transit of some goods to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad were “absolutely unacceptable”. Moscow was working on retaliatory measures in response to the “illegal sanctions” by the EU, it said. Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s response to Lithuania’s ban would not be exclusively diplomatic but practical in nature. Russia and Turkey have agreed to continue discussions on safe vessel departures and grain exports from Ukrainian ports, the Russian defence ministry said. Turkish presidency sources said yesterday its military delegation would travel to Russia this week to discuss details of a possible safe sea corridor in the Black Sea to export grain. Finland’s armed forces chief, Gen Timo Kivinen, said his country was prepared for a Russian attack and would put up stiff resistance in the event that one should occur. Finns are motivated to fight and the country has built up a substantial arsenal, Kivinen said, adding: “The most important line of defence is between one’s ears.” Europe needs to prepare immediately for Russia to turn off all gas exports to the region this winter, according to the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol. He called on governments to work on reducing demand and keeping nuclear power plants open. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said its staff had seen evidence of a “shocking level” of “indiscriminate violence” being inflicted on civilians in Ukraine. The medical charity, which set up a hospital train in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, said more than 40% of its wounded train patients were elderly people and children. More than 10% of the war-trauma patients had lost at least one limb. A Ukrainian photojournalist and a soldier who was accompanying him were “coldly executed” when they were killed in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion, according to Reporters Without Borders. Maks Levin and Oleksiy Chernyshov were reportedly searching Russian-occupied woodlands for the photographer’s missing image-taking drone, the agency said, citing its findings from an investigation into their deaths. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you today with all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Russia and the US were exchanging official signals on the issue of American fighters in Ukraine, according to the Moscow state-owned news agency Ria. Ryabkov was also quoted by Interfax news agency as saying Moscow did not see Washington’s readiness to deal with the issue seriously. Dramatic footage has emerged from Russia of what appears to be a drone crashing into an oil refinery and setting off a fiery explosion in what could be an attack inside Russia’s borders. Video shared on social media showed the unmanned aerial vehicle crashing into the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery, in Rostov, in what would be an embarrassing penetration of Russia’s air defence systems in its ongoing war in Ukraine. Ukraine has used drones during the war but did not claim responsibility for the alleged attack. Vasily Golubev, the governor of Russia’s Rostov region, appeared to confirm the incident, writing that fragments of two drones had been found on the territory of the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery, where a large fire broke out on Wednesday morning. Video published on Russian social network channels showed a drone approaching the oil refinery as workers looked on. “Do you think it’s Ukrainian?” asked one. “Of course not,” another answered. “Where’d it go?” he added, as the drone vanished from sight. Moments later, a large explosion rocked the refinery. “Fuck!” yelled the onlookers. As a fire began raging at the refinery, the unidentified cameraman said with a resigned tone: “That’s what’s happening, guys.” Footage broadcast by Russian state television showed firefighters battling flames at the oil refinery, which halted production on Wednesday. Authorities claimed that the fire had been contained. Read Andrew Roth’s full story here: Drone crashes into Russian oil refinery in possible attack Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted on his official Telegram channel a note to mark 22 June, the date noted as the Day of Remembrance and Sorrow in Russia, as it marks the moment that Nazi Germany turned and invaded former ally the Soviet Union in 1941. Zelenskiy posted: Every year on 22 June, we honour the memory of everyone who died in World War II. Millions of lost lives and crippled destinies. This should not have happened again, but evil has returned. On 24 February, the occupiers came to our land. And we are fighting for a new victory. No enemy will break our will. We remember the victims of World War II! We believe in good, peace and justice! The military authority in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has posted to Telegram to warn people in the occupied territory to not go to evacuation points. It writes: Ukrainian channels and people on social networks continue to spread disinformation about urgent evacuation. The population is called for mass gatherings at several points in the city. The administration of the Kievsky district of Donetsk refutes [sic] this information. The so-called “gathering places” are the quarters of the city that are under constant fire from enemy artillery! Avoid mass gatherings, do not put your life in danger! The DPR posted an image of a poster which appeared to list locations for meetings, overlaid with the text “disinformation”. There was no indication when the image was taken or where the poster had been displayed. Footage circulating on social media purports to show a Ukrainian drone flying into a large oil depot in Russia, causing a huge explosion. The unmanned aerial vehicle can be seen flying low towards the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in the Rostov region, which borders Ukraine. Finland’s armed forces chief, Gen Timo Kivinen, said his country was prepared for a Russian attack and would put up stiff resistance in the event that one should occur. Finns are motivated to fight and the country has built up a substantial arsenal, Kivinen said in an interview. He said: The most important line of defence is between one’s ears, as the war in Ukraine proves at the moment. Finland has maintained a high level of military preparedness since the second world war, having fought two wars in the 1940s against its eastern neighbour, with which it shares a 810-mile border. Kivinen said: We have systematically developed our military defence precisely for this type of warfare that is being waged there [in Ukraine], with a massive use of firepower, armoured forces and also airforces. He added: Ukraine has been a tough bite to chew [for Russia] and so would be Finland. A Russian missile strike has left at least one person dead in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv, according to its mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. The attack caused several fires and damaged a number of buildings including a school, Senkevych said on national television. Senkevych said: I keep saying it’s still dangerous in the city. Before, people were going out in droves but they go out less now. Earlier today, the regional governor Vitaliy Kim said seven missiles had hit Mykolaiv. It has not been possible to independently verify the situation in the city. Europe needs to prepare immediately for Russia to turn off all gas exports to the region this winter, according to the head of the International Energy Agency, who has called on governments to work on reducing demand and keeping nuclear power plants open. Fatih Birol said reductions in supplies in recent weeks which the Kremlin has attributed to maintenance work could, in fact, be the beginning of wider cuts designed to prevent the filling of storage facilities in preparation for winter, as Russia seeks to gain leverage over the region. “Europe should be ready in case Russian gas is completely cut off,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “The nearer we are coming to winter, the more we understand Russia’s intentions. “I believe the cuts are geared towards avoiding Europe filling storage, and increasing Russia’s leverage in the winter months.” EU countries are racing to refill storage sites, with Germany hoping to reach 90% of capacity by November. Its stores are only half full. Member states have also been working to reduce their reliance on Russian fossil fuels, by sourcing gas from other countries, including the US, and speeding up the switch to renewable energy, although officials have conceded that the race to phase out Russian oil and gas would mean burning more coal and keeping nuclear plants going. Birol said emergency measures taken by European governments to reduce energy demand had probably not gone far enough, and urged countries to work on preserving energy supplies. “I believe there will be more and deeper demand measures as winter approaches,” Birol said. He added that gas supplies may need to be rationed, if Russia were to further reduce gas exports. Read the full article here. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has warned the west to stop talking about triggering Nato’s “article 5” mutual defence clause in a standoff between Lithuania and Russia. Ryabkov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying: I would like to warn Europeans against dangerous rhetorical games on the topic of conflict. His comments come after the US government said yesterday that its commitment to article 5 of Nato’s founding treaty, which states that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all, was “ironclad”. Earlier today we reported comments by Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, who said Moscow’s response to Lithuania’s ban on the transit of goods sanctioned by the EU to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad would not be exclusively diplomatic but practical in nature. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has now also spoken about Lithuania’s goods transit ban. During his briefing with reporters today, Peskov said the EU sanctions that led Lithuania to block the transit were “absolutely unacceptable”. Moscow was working on retaliatory measures in response to the “illegal sanctions” by the EU, he said. But Peskov and Russian officials have remained tight-lipped about the exact nature of Moscow’s response. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said its staff has seen evidence of a “shocking level” of “indiscriminate violence” being inflicted on civilians in Ukraine. The medical charity, which set up a hospital train in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, said it had seen an “outrageous” lack of effort to spare and protect civilians caught up in hostilities. Between 31 March and 6 June, more than 650 patients were medically evacuated by train from war-affected areas in eastern Ukraine to hospitals in safer parts of the country, it said in a statement. More than 40% of the wounded on the train were elderly people and children. The wounded came onto the train with blast wounds, traumatic amputations, shrapnel and gunshot wounds, it said, adding: Most patients we talked to when designating who is responsible for their injuries pointed at Russian and Russian-backed military forces. The patients talked about civilians being shot while evacuating, indiscriminate bombing and shelling of residential areas and elderly people being brutalised. MSF’s emergency coordinator Christopher Stokes said: Our patients’ wounds and the stories they tell show unquestionably the shocking level of suffering the indiscriminate violence of this war is inflicting on civilians. Many of the patients were wounded during military strikes that hit civilian residential areas, he said. Blast injuries accounted for 73% of the war-related trauma cases the charity handled, with 20% caused by shrapnel or gunshots. More than 10% of the war-trauma patients had lost at least one limb, with the youngest such patient just six years old. Hours after Russia’s invasion started, Serhiy Kit was receiving phone calls from members of the Ukrainian Association for the Blind at his factory’s office in Dnipro. Like everyone else in the country, people with visual impairments in Ukraine were terrified when the invasion began. In their case, they had an 88-year-old association to fall back on. Kit is the director of a Dnipro factory that welds parts for railway tracks and was established in 1945 by the association, one of the country’s oldest-running organisations. The factory is a non-profit, predominantly managed and staffed by visually impaired people. Kit’s factory is one of 48 owned by the organisation in Ukrainian-controlled areas; a further 32 enterprises are in Russian-occupied Ukraine. “We were the first shelter to open in Ukraine, on 25 February,” said Kit. “Twenty-six of our [association] members in Kharkiv rang me and asked me to help them leave. We said they could stay in the factory.” Kharkiv, which is located 18 miles (30km) from the border with Russia, was bombarded by Russian forces from the first day of the invasion, whereas Dnipro, in south-central Ukraine, was relatively calm. The Kharkiv members drove with their families to Dnipro. “We rang around and found mattresses for them and cleared out one of our offices,” said Kit. “But then the calls kept coming. We’d never done anything like this before, but we couldn’t just stop.” Read the full article here. Russia and Turkey have agreed to continue discussions on safe vessel departures and grain exports from Ukrainian ports, the Russian defence ministry said. Turkish presidency sources said yesterday that its military delegation would travel to Russia this week to discuss details of a possible safe sea corridor in the Black Sea to export grain, Reuters reported. Russian state-owned news agency Tass confirmed plans for the talks, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The UK government has responded to accusations from Moscow that members of the Russian delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) had been denied visas. Russian lawmaker and delegation member Vladimir Dzhabarov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that Russia had “ahead of time” requested “to resolve the issue of providing guarantees from the British side that visas will be issued” because of UK sanctions. Dzhabarov said: We received an outrageous response that the British government - literally - cannot issue visas to members of the Russian delegation to the OSCE parliamentary assembly whatever their reason for visiting the country. Asked about Dzhabarov’s comments, a spokesperson for the Home Office said: There are currently no restrictions or limitations for Russian nationals to work in the UK on long-term work visas. The spokesperson said the UK was prioritising applications from Ukrainians, and that applications for study, work and family visas were taking longer to process. Dzhabarov said Russia sent a letter to all other delegations stating the “exclusion of the Russian delegation seriously damages the credibility of the event”. All decisions adopted in its absence “will not be recognised by us as legitimate”, the letter said, according to Dzhabarov. The 29th annual session of the OSCE parliamentary assembly is due to take place in Birmingham between 2-6 July. Ukraine’s army said it launched airstrikes on Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, causing “significant losses” to Russian forces. The military’s southern operational command said it had undertaken “aimed strikes with the use of various forces” and the military operation was continuing. The military situation for Ukraine’s defenders in the eastern Donbas is “extremely difficult”, officials have said. There are 568 civilians thought to be holed up in Sievierodonetsk’s Azot chemical plant, as Russian attacks intensify in an effort to capture the city and neighbouring Lysychansk. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Lysychansk was getting shelled “en masse”. Russian forces have captured several settlements near Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. The head of the Sievierodonetsk district military administration, Roman Vlasenko, said the frontline village of Toshkivka had not been under Ukrainian control since Monday. Russian forces also reportedly captured Pidlisne and Mala Dolyna, located south-west of Sievierodonetsk, and also had success near the Hirske settlement in Luhansk. Moscow’s response to Lithuania’s ban on the transit of goods sanctioned by the EU to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad will not be exclusively diplomatic but practical in nature, the foreign ministry press secretary Maria Zakharova has said. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has said the city was struck by seven missiles this morning. Casualties to the forces of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), one of Russias proxies in eastern Ukraine, may have amounted to about 55% of the original strength, British intelligence has claimed. One of the leaders of the authorities imposed in occupied Ukraine has described the border between Russia and Ukraine as “worse than the Berlin Wall for the Germans”. “Our reunification with Russia is inevitable, there should be no borders between us,” Vladimir Rogov is quoted as saying. Vladimir Putin is set to mark the day when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June, 1941. The date is significant in Russia and remembered as the Day of Remembrance and Sorrow. Putin will reportedly lay flowers to honour the dead. A Ukrainian photojournalist and a soldier who was accompanying him were “coldly executed” when they were killed in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion, according to a recently published investigation from Reporters Without Borders. The pair were reportedly searching Russian-occupied woodlands for the photographer’s missing image-taking drone, the agency said, citing its findings from an investigation into their deaths. Granting Ukraine candidate status to join the EU would be a historic decision signalling to Russia it can no longer claim a sphere of influence over its eastern neighbour, Kyiv’s ambassador to Brussels has said. Vsevolod Chentsov, the head of Ukraine’s mission to the EU, said Russia’s war had united Kyiv with the bloc, while ending what he called a “mistake” about whether his country could belong to the union. Members of the Russian delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) have been denied British visas to attend the next session, according to Vladimir Dzhabarov, the first deputy head of Russian upper house’s international affairs committee. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, visited Ukraine on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s war crimes, a justice department official said. Garland met with Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, and announced a war crimes accountability team to identify and prosecute perpetrators. “There is no hiding place for war criminals,” Garland said. The military authorities in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has issued its daily operational briefing. It says it controls 239 settlements in occupied Donetsk, and it claimed that 13 settlements in the region have been shelled by Ukrainian forces. It says one person was killed and 14 people were injured in the last 24 hours. The claims have not been independently verified. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has just posted to Telegram to say that the city has been struck with seven missiles. Moscow’s response to Lithuania’s ban on the transit of goods sanctioned by the EU to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad will not be exclusively diplomatic but practical in nature, Maria Zakharova has said. “One of the main questions has been about whether the response would be exclusively diplomatic. The answer: no,” the foreign ministry press secretary said at her weekly briefing. “The response will not be diplomatic but practical.” Reuters reports that Zakharova would not elaborate on the nature of the practical measures Russia planned to take against Lithuania. Yesterday while hosting a meeting in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council, said: “Russia will certainly respond to such hostile actions. Their consequences will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania.” From 17 June an EU prohibition on Russian steel and iron ore came into force, and the Lithuanian state railway said it would consequently no longer allow these goods to be carried on its tracks and imported into Kaliningrad. Granting Ukraine candidate status to join the EU would be a historic decision signalling to Russia it can no longer claim a sphere of influence over its eastern neighbour, Kyiv’s ambassador to Brussels has said. Vsevolod Chentsov, the head of Ukraine’s mission to the EU, said Russia’s war had united Kyiv with the bloc, while ending what he called a “mistake” about whether his country could belong to the union. Speaking to the Guardian ahead of an EU summit on Thursday, he said for many years Ukraine had been seen as a bridge or a buffer state rather than a potential member. A decision on candidate status would “kill finally, this ambiguity, what is Ukraine for the EU: whether we are building a common house or not … I think now finally there is clarity.” EU leaders will decide on Thursday whether to grant Ukraine candidate status after positive recommendation from the European Commission last Friday. Expectations for a yes have grown since four EU leaders, including France and Germany, which had been perceived as among the most lukewarm, visited Kyiv last week in a show of support. Read more of Jennifer Rankin’s report from Brussels: Kyiv’s EU envoy says Ukraine candidate status would send clear signal to Russia There is a quick snap from Reuters reporting that members of the Russian delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) have been denied British visas to attend the next session, according to Vladimir Dzhabarov, the first deputy head of Russian upper house’s international affairs committee. One of the leaders of the authorities imposed in occupied Ukraine has described the border between Russia and Ukraine as “worse than the Berlin Wall for the Germans”, according to a report from RIA Novosti. It quotes Vladimir Rogov saying: For us, the border with Russia is worse than the Berlin Wall for the Germans. According to various estimates, 60-68 per cent of the inhabitants of East Berlin and the German Democratic Republic [East Germany] had relatives in West Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany [West Germany]. In Ukraine, depending on the region, 73-85 percent residents have relatives in Russia. Accordingly, this border should not exist. Rogov went on to say, the agency reports, that the Germans did not hold a referendum on the wall, they took it into their own hands to destroy it and live in a single state. “Our reunification with Russia is inevitable, there should be no borders between us,” Rogov is quoted as saying. Rogov is a member of the main council of the self-proclaimed military-civilian administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. Pjotr Sauer reports for us from Zahaltsy: Since the start of the war, the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been discovered in the Bucha district, many hastily buried in dozens of shallow mass graves. Ukrainian police believe that about 650 people were shot in what they have described as executions. On Tuesday, local police exhumed the remains of one – believed to be those of a local man – as the aftermath of the Russian occupation continues to haunt the towns and villages around Ukraine’s capital, nearly three months after the invading troops withdrew. The body was found next to a police checkpoint used by Russian soldiers during their occupation, leading officials to believe that he was killed by the soldiers manning the post. All signs indicate that this man was murdered by Russian soldiers. We have found more bodies around checkpoints in this area,” said Vyacheslav Tsyliuryk, the head of the local police unit. “We believe this person was heading towards his home when he was shot.” As two men started digging up the earth, the outlines of the corpse began to emerge, and then Tsyliuryk pointed to a gunshot wound in the man’s chest as the likely cause of death. The dead man was wearing a thick winter jacket, which Tsyliuryk said suggested that the killing had taken place in late March or early April, shortly before the Russians left Kyiv. Zahaltsy, like other towns and villages nearby, was occupied for about a month before the Russian forces’ retreat. Read more of Pjotr Sauer’s report from Zahaltsy: Ukrainians still finding bodies in former occupied villages outside Kyiv The military authorities of the self-proclaimed breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic have posted to Telegram to claim that in the last two hours the Kievsky district of Donetsk has been shelled sixty times by Ukrainian forces. It specifically states that the munitions used are 155mm shells “supplied by Nato countries”. The claims have not been independently verified. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has posted to Telegram to say that there were no air raid warnings over his region of western Ukraine overnight. He stated that 225 displaced people arrived in Lviv on evacuation trains yesterday. Casualties to the forces of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic (DPR), one of Russias proxies in eastern Ukraine, may have amounted to about 55% of the original strength, British intelligence has claimed. According to the latest UK ministry of defence report: Heavy shelling continues as Russia pushes to envelop the Sievierodonetsk area via Izium in the north and Popasna in the south. Russia is highly likely preparing to attempt to deploy a large number of reserve units to the Donbas. It goes on to discuss the casualty situation, stating: The Russian authorities have not released the overall number of military casualties in Ukraine since 25 March. However, the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) publishes casualty figures for DPR forces. As of 16 June, the DPR acknowledged 2128 military personnel killed in action, and 8,897 wounded, since the start of 2022. The DPR casualty rate is equivalent to around 55% of its original force, which highlights the extraordinary attrition Russian and pro-Russian forces are suffering in the Donbas. It is highly likely that DPR forces are equipped with outdated weapons and equipment. On both sides, the ability to generate and deploy reserve units to the front is likely becoming increasingly critical to the outcome of the war. For further context, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claims to have killed about 34,100 Russian soldiers in total between 24 February and 21 June. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London, and I will be with you for the next few hours. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com A Ukrainian photojournalist and a soldier who was accompanying him were “coldly executed” when they were killed in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion, according to a recently published investigation from Reporters Without Borders. The pair were reportedly searching Russian-occupied woodlands for the photographer’s missing image-taking drone, the agency said citing its findings from an investigation into their deaths. The press freedom group said it went back to the spot where the bodies of Maks Levin and serviceman Oleksiy Chernyshov were found 1 April in woods north of the capital, Kyiv. The group said it counted 14 bullet holes in the burned hulk of their car still at the scene. The report, published on Wednesday, reads: The evidence gathered by RSF indicates that the Ukrainian photo-journalist Maks Levin and the friend who was with him were executed in cold blood by Russian forces, probably after being interrogated and tortured, on the day they went missing, 13 March 2022. The photos of the crime scene, the evidence RSF found there and RSF’s observations attest to the fact that the journalist Maks Levin and his friend Oleksiy Chernyshov were executed. Levin was very probably shot by one of the bullets that RSF found at the crime scene. Material evidence was found of a Russian presence very close to the crime scene including food package, plastic cutlery which could still contain DNA traces.” Some of Levin and Chernyshov’s belongings, including the soldier’s ID papers and parts of his bulletproof vest and the photographer’s helmet, were also recovered, it said. A Ukrainian team with metal detectors also uncovered a bullet buried in the soil where Levin’s body had lain, it said. The group said that finding suggests “he was probably killed with one, perhaps two bullets fired at close range when he was already on the ground.” A jerrycan for gasoline was also found close to where Chernyshov’s burned body had been recovered, it added. Reporters Without Borders said its findings “show that the two men were doubtless coldly executed.” Levin and Chernyshov were last heard from on 13 March. A GPS tracker in their vehicle gave their last position, in woods north of Kyiv, the group said. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is set to mark the day when Hitler’s Nazi Germany forces invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June, 1941. The date is significant in Russia and remembered as the ‘Day of Remembrance and Sorrow’. Putin will reportedly lay flowers to honour the dead on Wednesday. To mark the anniversary, the Russian defence ministry released documents dating back to the start of the second world war purporting to show Germany intended to claim the Soviet army was bombing churches and cemeteries to justify its invasion. “Just as nowadays, in 1941, the Nazis prepared provocations in advance to discredit our state,” Russia’s defence ministry said. June 22 is one of the most tragic dates in Russian history - Memorial and Mourning Day. On this day 81 years ago, the Great Patriotic War began. A divine liturgy and a memorial service will be held in the Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces.” Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies, dated 21 June, appear to show damage inflicted on Snake Island after Ukraine claimed it launched an attack on the small southern territory on Tuesday. A destroyed tower in the southern end of the island and burnt areas on the northern end can be observed. Russia said it repelled a Ukrainian attempt to retake the island in the Black Sea captured by Russian forces on the first day of the invasion. Ukraine’s army has said it had launched airstrikes on Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, causing “significant losses” to Russian forces. In a video address posted to Facebook, the military’s southern operational command said it had used “aimed strikes with the use of various forces” on the island. The command added: The island of Zmiinyi was dealt a concentrated blow with the use of various forces and methods of destruction.” Russian troops stationed on the island took “significant losses” The military operation continues and requires information silence until it is over. Moscow claimed it repelled the “mad” attack which saw Ukraine “plan to carry out massive air and artillery fire... before landing and capturing” the island. In an update posted to its Telegram channel, Russia’s ministry of defence said: On June 20 at 5am, the Kyiv regime undertook another mad attempt to take possession of Snake Island. This is another fake ‘victory’ of the Ukrainian military. The ministry said 15 Ukrainian attack and reconnaissance drones took part in the airstrike while missile launchers and howitzers fired at the island, with 13 drones reportedly shot down. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you as we continue to report all the latest news from Ukraine. Here are all the other major developments as of 8am in Kyiv. Ukraine’s army said it launched airstrikes on Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, causing “significant losses” to Russian forces. The military’s southern operational command said it had undertaken “aimed strikes with the use of various forces” and the military operation was continuing. The military situation for Ukraine’s defenders in the eastern Donbas is “extremely difficult”, officials have said. There are 568 civilians thought to be holed up in Sievierodonetsk’s Azot chemical plant, as Russian attacks intensify in an effort to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said Lysychansk was getting shelled “en masse”. Russian forces have captured several settlements near Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. The head of the Sievierodonetsk district military administration, Roman Vlasenko, said the frontline village of Toshkivka had not been under Ukrainian control since Monday. Russian forces also reportedly captured Pidlisne and Mala Dolyna, located south-west of Sievierodonetsk, and saw success near the Hirske settlement in Luhansk. At least 15 civilians were killed in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region by Russian shelling on Tuesday, according to the regional governor, Oleh Synegubov. Mass mobilisation is “about to happen” in Russia with the Kremlin recruiting people in poorer regions to fight in Ukraine, according to western officials. Officials also said there was “more chatter” about Vladimir Putin’s health and “more speculation” about who would replace him in Russia. However, there did not appear to be an “immediate threat” to the Russian president’s position from the elite or the general population, they said. A fire that broke out after Ukrainian forces allegedly attacked oil rigs in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea was approaching an oilwell, according to a pro-Russian official. Three people were wounded and seven people were still reportedly missing. The Russian-backed leader of annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, blamed Kyiv for the attack. Russia has demanded that Lithuania immediately lift a ban on the transit of goods on an EU sanctions list across its territory to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Patrushev, said the consequences of the ban “will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania”. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, visited Ukraine on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s war crimes, a justice department official said. Garland met with Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, and announced a war crimes accountability team to identify and prosecute perpetrators. “There is no hiding place for war criminals,” Garland said. The Kremlin has said that two captured US volunteers are not covered by the Geneva conventions and could face the death penalty. Russian media claimed that two of three US volunteers missing in Ukraine had been captured and were being held by pro-Russian separatist forces. The Kremlin has denied it knows their locations. German self-propelled howitzers have arrived in Ukraine in the first delivery of heavy weapons promised by Berlin. “We have replenishment!” Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, announced. “The German Panzerhaubitze 2000 with trained Ukrainian crews joined the Ukrainian artillery family.” Turkey should be cautious about delivering more weapons to Ukraine, the head of Turkey’s weapons production agency said. The remarks by Ismail Demir to the Wall Street Journal show how Ankara is increasingly playing both sides of the war. Turkish-made drones have played a critical role in Kyiv’s defence. Turkey’s military delegation will travel to Russia this week to discuss a possible safe sea corridor in the Black Sea to export Ukrainian grain, according to Turkish presidency sources. A meeting between Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and the United Nations would be held in Istanbul in the coming weeks, possibly with the participation of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, the sources said. European countries are united in their support for granting Ukraine the status of EU member candidate, Luxembourg’s foreign affairs minister has said. Jean Asselborn told reporters: “We are working towards the point where we tell Putin that Ukraine belongs to Europe, that we will also defend the values that Ukraine defends.” The UK government is “determined” to impose further sanctions on Russia and will continue to do so until Moscow fully withdraws from Ukraine, Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. She told parliament that she would be travelling to Turkey on Wednesday to discuss options to help get grain out of Odesa. Boris Johnson also warned of the need to resist “growing fatigue” around the war and said any concessions to Vladimir Putin would be a “disaster”. Estonia summoned the Russian ambassador on Tuesday to protest about an “extremely serious” violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter. The Estonian foreign ministry said the helicopter flew over a point in the south-east without permission on 18 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/dec/23/balfour-beatty-to-pay-49m-fine-for-against-us-military","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-23T17:59:25Z","webTitle":"Balfour Beatty to pay £49m fine for fraud against US military","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/balfour-beatty-to-pay-49m-fine-for-against-us-military","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/balfour-beatty-to-pay-49m-fine-for-against-us-military","fields":{"headline":"Balfour Beatty to pay £49m fine for fraud against US military","bodyText":"British construction company Balfour Beatty will pay $65m (£49m) in fines after pleading guilty to fraud committed against the US military. The company’s US arm was one of the biggest providers of privatised military housing to the US army, navy and air forces at 55 bases across the states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas, but it lied about repairs in order to increase bonus payments, the US Department of Justice said on Thursday. The company, a member of the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, had to meet various maintenance and resident satisfaction targets to qualify for the bonuses. But employees deliberately altered data in its property management software and falsified resident comment cards to reach the required levels. The payout includes a $34m penalty plus nearly $32m in restitution, and the company will also be supervised for three years by an independent compliance monitor. It is not the first time that Balfour Beatty has been censured for defence-related work. In the UK in 2019 MI6 sacked the company as a contractor during refurbishment work after it lost sensitive plans of the layout of its headquarters in London’s Vauxhall, which are famously featured in several James Bond spy films. The deputy head of the FBI, which was also involved in the recent fraud inquiry, said it was a “disgraceful” crime. Two former Balfour Beatty managers, Stacy Cabrera and Rick Cunefare, have already pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the case this year. The fines are more than Balfour Beatty’s entire profit before tax for 2020 of £48m, although they are only a small proportion of revenues of £8.6bn during that year. The company, valued at £1.6bn, is struggling with other problems in its main UK building business, which counts Hinkley Point nuclear power station and the HS2 and Crossrail rail developments among its major projects. The chief executive, Leo Quinn, who was paid £2.1m in salary and bonuses in 2020, warned in August that the company would not take on any new property construction projects in central London after it was forced to prop up failing subcontractors. The US deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, said: “Instead of promptly repairing housing for US service members as required, Balfour Beatty lied about the repairs to pocket millions of dollars in performance bonuses. “This pervasive fraud was a consequence of Balfour Beatty’s broken corporate culture, which valued profit over the welfare of service members.” The fraud meant that crucial maintenance was delayed, harming military personnel and their families, the Department of Justice said. Balfour Beatty said it had appointed a chief compliance officer for the US after carrying out a review when the fraud was first discovered, as well as adding further ethics and compliance training for all employees. “The wrongdoing that took place is completely contrary to the way the company expects its people to behave,” Balfour Beatty said in a statement to the stock market on Thursday. “The company apologises for the actions of communities to all its stakeholders. It has been made clear to all employees that breaches of policies, procedures, or law will not be tolerated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/feb/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-one-year-anniversary-russian-invasion","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-24T22:00:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Kyiv and Moscow welcome China’s intervention  – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-one-year-anniversary-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/feb/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-one-year-anniversary-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Kyiv and Moscow welcome China’s intervention  – as it happened","bodyText":"It is midnight in Kyiv. It has been a busy day for Ukraine as the country marked its one-year anniversary since the Russian invasion. Here is a wrap-up of today’s developments: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine. On Friday, Trudeau said that Canada will provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. The US has announced that it will offer over $10 billion in assistance to Ukraine. Blinken said that the funds are crucial to Ukraine and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education, and emergency services.” A ‘people’s court’ has endorsed an indictment against Russian president Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression and called for his arrest. After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against president Vladimir Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible,” the AP reports. The European Union has promised additional support for millions of Ukrainian refugees that have fled their country since Russia’s invasion one year ago. Speaking to the Associated Press on Friday, EU Commission vice president Margaritis Schinas said, “As far as (refugees from) Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable. “If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being,” he said, referring to a potential increase in refugees. US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has released a statement marking the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in which he pledged American solidarity. “One year ago, Vladimir Putin committed his greatest mistake by underestimating the resolve of Ukraine. Since then, we have seen bravery, patriotism, and valor personified by President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people,” Schumer wrote. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity.” The Group of Seven (G7) has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. The group announced it would take unprecedented measures in order to weaken Russia, promising measures against Russian diamond exports. It warned that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs” and is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. The UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of the staff of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and their children. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said today. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. President Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west was fuelling the conflict and which analysts dismissed as anodyne. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - as well as of Crimea. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we close the blog for today. Thank you for following along. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine. On Friday, Trudeau said that Canada will provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks, CTV News reports. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. Canada will also provide an armoured recovery vehicle, as well as over 5,000 rounds of ammunition. The US has announced that it will offer over $10 billion in assistance to Ukraine. In a statement on Friday, secretary of state Antony Blinken said, “…in coordination with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of the Treasury, we are announcing over $10 billion in assistance, including budgetary support to the Government of Ukraine and additional energy assistance to support Ukrainians suffering from Russia’s attacks.” Blinken said that the funds are crucial to Ukraine and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education, and emergency services.” He added that the Biden administration is also working alongside Congress to provide additional energy assistance to the war-torn country – a $250 contribution that will in turn address “immediate needs, including critical power grid equipment.” The assistance is in addition to the $270 million that the US has already committed to help safeguard and bolster the country’s energy security in the past year. A ‘people’s court’ has endorsed an indictment against Russian president Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression and called for his arrest. The Associated Press reports: The symbolic decision Friday came on the anniversary of Russia’s illegal invasion of its neighbor that triggered Europe’s biggest and deadliest conflict since World War II. After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against president Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible.” The judges, including Stephen Rapp, a U.S. prosecutor who once headed the successful effort to bring former Liberian President Charles Taylor to justice for crimes in Sierra Leone, heard testimony from survivors of Russian attacks in Ukraine and from military experts before issuing their order. The ruling comes amid international efforts to establish a tribunal that could prosecute Putin and other Russian leaders for the crime of aggression. The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation in Ukraine, but doesn’t have jurisdiction to prosecute the crime of aggression. The presiding judge at the court, South African Zak Jacoob, said that he hoped the hearings would add to the pressure for a special court. “Hopefully this is a step to prosecution. As I said, we have no legal authority or force, but hopefully we have the authority of moral force and moral persuasion, which would take us somewhere,” he told reporters. The people’s court found that evidence presented was strong enough to indict Putin, saying that as head of state he “planned, prepared, initiated and executed — and continues to plan and execute — the Russian Federation’s acts of aggression in Ukraine.” Jacoob, called Putin’s justifications for the war “pathetic.” An invitation for Putin or his legal representatives to take part in the hearings went unanswered, prosecutors said. “It is an insult to the international community and to the integrity of the world to make the sort of claims that he has made. And I reject them in no uncertain terms,” Jacoob said. The Eiffel Tower has lit up in blue and yellow – colors of the Ukrainian flag – in a show of solidarity for the country on the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion. “Paris once again shows its solidarity with the Ukrainian people, who are fighting tirelessly for freedom and democracy,” tweeted Paris deputy mayor Jean-Luc Romero-Michel. The European Union has promised additional support for millions of Ukrainian refugees that have fled their country since Russia’s invasion one year ago. Speaking to the Associated Press on Friday, EU Commission vice president Margaritis Schinas said, “As far as (refugees from) Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable. Schinas added that he did not think it was “automatic” that the number of refugees would increase in the coming months. “If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being,” he said. US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has released a statement marking the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in which he pledged American solidarity. “One year ago, Vladimir Putin committed his greatest mistake by underestimating the resolve of Ukraine. Since then, we have seen bravery, patriotism, and valor personified by President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people,” Schumer wrote. “To honor that heroism and show the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s fight for freedom and democracy, I was proud to lead the Senate in delivering over $113 billion in military, economic, and humanitarian aid their country needed and deserved. Now, and for as long as it takes, the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine,” he added. During a security council meeting at the United Nations, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzya, interrupted a minute of silence which Ukraine’s foreign minister requested for those who died as a result of “Russian aggression.” ‘All lives are priceless ... we are rising to remember the memory [of all the victims],” Nebenzya said, interrupting the minute’s silence, before it resumed. Today marks the first anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. It’s been a busy one, so here’s a look at the key developments: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. He paid homage to cities that have become bywords for Russian war crimes, such as Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol, describing them as “capitals of invincibility”. The Group of Seven (G7) has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. The group announced it would take unprecedented measures in order to weaken Russia, promising measures against Russian diamond exports. It warned that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs” and is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. The US led the way with an announcement of further military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available, as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The US will also send more ammunition for the high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) and 155mm howitzer guns Washington has provided over the course of the year. The UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of the staff of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and their children. But Britain is not planning to send RAF Typhoons to Ukraine, the defence secretary Ben Wallace has said. Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine – but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv. The EU is expected to announce a ban on €11bn (£9.7bn) worth of exports of critical technologies to Russia, as part of a 10th round of sanctions. Despite plans to have the measures in place by the first anniversary of the invasion, the latest measures were being held up by a last-minute dispute over how quickly to ban synthetic rubber imports from Russia. Italy objected to a rapid phase-out, while Poland blindsided other member states with its insistence the trade be stopped as soon as possible. The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirmed that four Leopard tanks had been delivered to Ukraine. “Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside President Zelenskiy during his visit to Kyiv. He said Poland will provide more Leopard tanks soon, as well as a number of upgraded, Soviet-era T-72 tanks. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said today. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. President Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west was fuelling the conflict and which analysts dismissed as anodyne. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means., foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - as well as of Crimea. But western leaders have largely dismissed China’s peace plan for Ukraine, arguing that Beijing does not have the international credibility to act as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine, for which Kyiv was not consulted, was criticised by US officials and some analysts who noted the growing ties between China and Russia. On Wednesday, China’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership. The World Bank has announced $2.5bn (£2.1bn) in additional grant financing for Ukraine to support the country’s budget and to maintain essential services. The funds will go towards supporting Ukraine’s key sectors, including health care, schools, payment of pensions, payments for internally displaced people, social assistance programs, and wages for employees providing core government services, it said. The White House says it believes Russia may provide Iran with fighter jets and other military equipment in exchange for support for its war in Ukraine. The White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US had information that Iran had shipped artillery and tank rounds to Russia in November. In return, Russia was offering “unprecedented defence cooperation”, including on missiles, electronics and fighter jets, he said. Commemorations have been held in Ukraine and around the world on the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, with moments of silence observed, candlelit vigils and protests. Our picture editors have selected some of the strongest images from the events for this gallery. Britain is not planning to send RAF Typhoons to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said, rejecting a high profile campaign led by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with the support of the former prime minister Boris Johnson. Ben Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine – but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv. The defence secretary said: “We’re not going to send our own Typhoon jets in the short term to Ukraine,” in an interview with Sky News to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Friday. But the comments deal a blow to Zelenskiy, who travelled to the UK this month to make a dramatic request for “wings for freedom” in a rare address by a foreign leader to both Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Instead, Wallace said that if other countries with Soviet-origin aircraft wanted to supply Ukraine instead, the UK would be willing to help provide air cover for that country to make up for the loss of jets. Read the full story here: The World Bank has announced $2.5bn (£2.1bn) in additional grant financing for Ukraine to support the country’s budget and to maintain essential services. The funds will go towards supporting Ukraine’s key sectors, including health care, schools, payment of pensions, payments for internally displaced people, social assistance programs, and wages for employees providing core government services, a statement from the World Bank said. The president of the World Bank group, David Malpass, said: One year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world continues to witness the horrific destruction inflicted on the country and its people. We will continue supporting the people of Ukraine through urgent repair projects and coordination with the Government for recovery and reconstruction efforts Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has thanked Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, following the announcement that Stockholm will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has wrapped up his press conference after more than two hours of taking questions from journalists. The Ukrainian leader concluded the conference by talking about his family. “I love them, I love my family. I love my wife,” he said. He said his children are “the most important people” for him, but that he did not get to see them often and that he didn’t have “any opportunities” to see his own parents. On the subject of Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, he said he was “very proud” of her and that she was “doing everything she can for the sake of our children and the country”. He added: The most important thing is not to let them down. The most important thing is to make sure that my children are proud of me. The EU’s top diplomats have for a third day running failed to agree on the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, according to sources. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia, with Poland reportedly rejecting Italy’s demand for laxer new curbs on rubber imports. Reuters reports that Poland said proposed restrictions on EU imports of Russia rubber included such a big quota of imports exempted and such long transition periods that they would have no effect in practice. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had told Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU aimed to have the measures in place by today, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Zelenskiy asks the BBC’s James Waterhouse if he can send a question to Rishi Sunak for fighter jets and Typhoons. Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) that he supported Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s calls for China to engage with Ukraine during a virtual meeting to mark the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, Downing Street has said. During the meeting, Sunak said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “not just a Euro-Atlantic problem, but an attack on universal principles”, a spokesperson for the prime minister said. The G7 leaders “reiterated their unfaltering support for Ukraine and agreed on the need to continue to intensify military aid”, and “praised the steadfast international unity throughout the past year”, they said. The leaders also discussed the strong show of support for Ukraine at the United Nations (UN) last night, and the prime minister emphasised that by supporting Ukraine, the international community was upholding the UN’s Charter. They added: Reflecting on China’s ceasefire proposals, the prime minister said he supported President Zelenskiy’s calls for China to engage with Ukraine, adding that peace could only be achieved on Ukraine’s terms. The prime minister added that the international community needed to support Ukraine with long-term military and security assurances to send a strong message to President Putin that the global support was enduring. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he plans to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and said it would be “useful” to both countries and global security. “As far as I know, China respects historical integrity”, he says at a news conference in Kyiv. China needs to do its best to make sure that the Russian Federation withdraws from our territory because that’s what respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty means. My colleague Luke Harding is covering Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s news conference in Kyiv. Asked if Putin will try to invade another country, given his military setbacks in Ukraine, Zelenskiy replies: Unfortunately yes. I believe it is possible and it might happen. He warns that Russia “will come for Nato states if the US abandons Ukraine” in the war. The White House says it believes Russia may provide Iran with fighter jets and other military equipment in exchange for support for its war in Ukraine Speaking to reporters, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US had information that Iran had shipped artillery and tank rounds to Russia in November. In return, Russia was offering “unprecedented defence cooperation”, including on missiles, electronics and fighter jets, he said. He said Iran was also seeking to purchase attack helicopters, radars and combat trainer aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is still taking questions from journalists at a news conference in Kyiv. We will have a full write-up of what he said, but here are some more key points: Ukraine’s president said one of his biggest disappointments of the war had been to see people who could have fought leave the country when Russia invaded, referring to officials who fled. Asked if he would join negotiations mediated by Turkey if Vladimir Putin came to the table, Zelenskiy said he would “accept” it. The Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, “knows my view”, Zelenskiy said. We discussed this before the war. I told him to put Putin at the table for negotiations. ‘Can we please do that? We must avert a full-scale war.’ But [Erdogan] was not able to do that. Not only him — he is powerful — but he is not able to do it. And now he thinks that he is? Now we can’t. Zelenskiy also dismissed Russia’s allegations that Kyiv has aims on Moldova’s breakaway Russian-speaking Transdniestria region. The region was the sovereign territory of Moldova, he said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has shared a photo of him shaking hands with his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, in front of the first Leopard 2 tanks in Kyiv. Writing on Twitter, Shmyhal said Kyiv was grateful to Poland for the “decisive steps that bring Ukraine closer to victory” and that he was waiting for the expansion of the western “tank coalition”. The Group of Seven nations (G7) is taking actions against third-country actors “materially supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine,” the bloc said in a statement as it reaffirmed its support for Ukraine. The statement reads: We call on third-countries or other international actors who seek to evade or undermine our measures to cease providing material support to Russia’s war, or face severe costs. To deter this activity around the world, we are taking actions against third-country actors materially supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Asked if Australia should reopen its embassy in Kyiv, Zelenskiy says he would like to shake hands with the returning Australian ambassador. He says: Please come back. But on a Bushmeister. We need one more. Here are some more remarks from Volodymyr Zelenskiy on China’s ceasefire proposal. Zelenskiy said he welcomed some elements of the plan, but said only the country where a war is being fought should be the initiator of a peace plan. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said: I think it’s correct to think that if there are thoughts that, in one way or another, correspond with respect for international law, to territorial integrity... let’s work with China on this point. Why not? He urged Beijing not to provide Moscow with arms, but added that it was promising that China, an ally of Russia, was considering brokering peace, adding: Our task is to gather everyone to isolate one. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has appeared to make a dig at China’s newly published 12-point ceasefire proposal to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking at the UN security council in New York, Blinken said he expects “many countries will call for peace today,” but “history teaches us that it’s the nature of peace that matters”. Members of the council should not be fooled by calls for a temporary or unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine and should not fall into the “false equivalency” of calling both sides to stop fighting, he said. Russia will use any pause in fighting to consolidate control of territory and replenish its forces, he said. Any peace that legitimises Russia’s seizure of land by force will weaken the Charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it. Asked to share a moment of the war he found most difficult, Zelenskiy replied: Bucha. The moment we de-occupied Bucha. What I saw. It was horrible. What we’ve seen… the devil is not somewhere below us - he’s among us. Asked what the chances are of him negotiating with Vladimir Putin, Zelenskiy said he had a message for Moscow: Respect our right to live on our land, get out of our territory, stop bombing us, stop killing civilians... stop the bombardments. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, says Moscow appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and said it was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means. She said: We appreciate the sincere desire of our Chinese friends to contribute to resolving the conflict in Ukraine by peaceful means... We share the views of Beijing. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - as well as of Crimea. Her remarks came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said there were points in the Chinese proposals that were understandable” and “there are those that we don’t”. “But it’s something,” he added at a news conference on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy said: China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad. But the question is what follows the words. The question is in the steps and where they will lead to. An Azerbaijani journalist asked if he could take a selfie with President Zelenskiy in the middle of a news conference, before asking a question about Ukraine’s relationship with Azerbaijan. Zelenskiy says there are some points in China’s ceasefire statement that are “understandable” to him “and there are those that we don’t”. Zelenskiy says Beijing’s statement “respects our territorial integrity”, adding that it is a good thing that China is talking about Ukraine and that Beijing’s interest is “not bad”. He says: China has started talking about Ukraine, and that is not bad. The Chinese statement respects our territorial integrity. He adds: But the question is what follows the words. The question is in the steps and where they will lead to. Zelenskiy, speaking at a press conference, has called for a summit with Latin American leaders and said Ukraine should take steps to build relations with African countries. He said he would like countries from across Latin America and Africa, as well as China and India, to join a peace formula proposed by Kyiv to end the war with Russia. He says he would attend the summit in person “even though it’s very difficult for me to leave Ukraine”. He says he also wants to have India and China participate in a “peace summit” to end the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile in New York, the Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, has interrupted a minute’s silence during a meeting of the UN security council. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, had called for a minute’s silence to honour “the victims of the aggression”. As members of the assembly stood up, Nebenzya began tapping his microphone and asked for the floor. He said: We are getting up on our feet to honour the memory of all victims of what has happened in Ukraine, starting in 2014. “All of those who perished. All lives are priceless,” he said, appearing to refer to Russian lives lost in the conflict. From my colleague Patrick Wintour: My colleague Luke Harding is at Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s press conference in Kyiv: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is delivering a statement at a televised press conference to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of his country. You can watch it live here: The Ukrainian leader starts by thanking the journalists who have worked in Ukraine over the last year and calls for a minute of silence to remember those who died in the conflict. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the people of Britain for their “unwavering support” and “invaluable” help “in hard times”. The Ukrainian leader’s tweet came after Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, announced an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine. The UK foreign office said the internationally coordinated package of sanctions includes aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military-industrial complex. The UK is also sanctioning senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia’s two largest defence companies and four banks. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, is currently addressing a meeting of the UN security council to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. Guterres says he sat in the council a year ago and urged “in the name of humanity” not to allow “what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century” in Europe. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a “blatant” violation of the UN charter and international law, he says. It has unleashed widespread destruction and displacement attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and of course, many casualties and terrible suffering. He says the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights has documented dozens of cases of conflict-related sexual violence against men and women. Serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law against prisoners of war, and hundreds of cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions of civilians, were also documented. The past year has been a “living hell” for the people of Ukraine, he says, adding that more than half of all of Ukraine’s children have been forced from their homes. The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine, as western allies announced a raft of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia, in a renewed effort to weaken Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Speaking on the anniversary of the Russian invasion on Friday, Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, said the first Leopard tanks had arrived in Ukraine. He did not specify how many, but Poland had previously requested an export licence from Berlin for 14 Leopard 2 tanks, with the goal of spurring others to do the same. As ceremonies to remember the dead took place in Kyiv, western allies sought to demonstrate their support. Ukraine’s blue and yellow colours were projected on the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, the Empire State Building and EU headquarters, and were painted on the street by activists outside the Russian embassy in London. Ahead of a G7 meeting, the US led the way with an announcement of further military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available, as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The new drones include the Switchblade 600, a bigger version of this loitering munition (or kamikaze drone) than has already been supplied, as well as the CyberLux K8, Altius-600, and the Jump 20, which can be used for surveillance or adapted to carry bombs. The US will also send more ammunition for the high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) and 155mm howitzer guns Washington has provided over the course of the year. Read the full story by Jennifer Rankin and Julian Borger: Country star Brad Paisley has released a new song featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Titled Same Here, the song – a single from Paisley’s forthcoming album Son of the Mountains – features audio of Paisley and Zelenskiy discussing the commonalities between Americans and Ukranians, as well as the Ukrainian peoples’ desire for freedom. “I think we appreciate the same things – children, freedom, our flag, our soldiers, our people,” says Zelenskiy on the song. “We are proud of our army, who defend our freedom and defend our lives.” We are fighting for our children, our parents, to defend our houses, our families … there is no distance between our countries in such values. That is very important – to see that they are really, in many things, the same. Per an AP report, Zelenskiy suggested changes to the song prior to its release. “I think he understands that art is how you reach the most people, especially in the heart,” said Paisley. He can give as many speeches as he can give, but it’s a lot easier to hear something with a melody maybe. Commemorations have been held in Ukraine and around the world on the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, with moments of silence observed, candlelit vigils and protests. Our picture editors have selected some of the strongest images from the events for this gallery. Helena Smith reports for the Guardian from Athens: Over in Greece, the foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, has taken to Twitter to express his country’s support for Ukraine as the world marks the first anniversary of an invasion Russia still insists on calling a “special military operation.” “One year since the Russian invasion of Ukraine: Greece has been and remains by the side of the Ukrainian people, committed to its principles of respect for international legality and the territorial sovereignty of all states and against any revisionism,” Dendias wrote. The Greek government’s stance has resulted in a scuppering of ties with fellow Orthodox Russia, once a close ally. Moscow’s displeasure with Nato-member Greece was conveyed in a message tweeted by the Russian embassy in Athens earlier this week in which Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, was quoted as saying: We were friends with the Greeks. We noted the transformations in the country’s leadership. She was forced, or agreed, to submit to American demands. We have drawn conclusions in regard to those who so happily supported aggression against Russia. Meanwhile, officials attending the second European conference in border management in Vouliagmeni outside Athens observed a minute of silence in tribute to the victims of the war. The EU’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, who is in attendance vowed the 27-member bloc would be standing by Ukraine for as long as it takes. “Ukraine can win this war, but we will be with Ukraine as long as it takes,” she told the AP on the sidelines of the conference. Poland’s deputy interior minister, also attending the conference, said Warsaw was braced – and would welcome – the ever more Ukrainians who could be forced to seek refuge in the neighbouring country if Moscow went ahead with a widely anticipated spring offensive. “We have this contingency planning,” the minister, Bartosz Grodecki, said. “I hope that it will not be necessary (but) … we’ve been trained, planned properly, and we know how to be prepared,” he also told the AP. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to the Telegram app about the visit of Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, to Kyiv today. Zelenskiy writes: Poland was with us even before the start of the full-scale war, was with us every minute of this year and, I am sure, will be with us until our victory. Our joint victory! Today, during the talks with prime minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, we discussed the entire range of defence issues. Talks concerned weapons for Ukraine, thanks to which Russia’s defeat on the battlefield will be speeded up, and new sanctions against Russia. Separately, I would like to note our cooperation regarding the treatment and rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. I am sure that it will remain a good memory in the history of nations. I am thankful to Mateusz Morawiecki and all our Polish brothers for understanding the situation and needs of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to attend an online summit with leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies, expected to pledge more support for Ukraine and tighten sanctions against Russia. Joe Biden announced new US sanctions on Russia earlier today, and other western allies are expected to do so around the summit to mark the anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Current G7 president Japan said it was considering new measures, without giving any details. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the US. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said today. The Swedish government said in a statement: The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks. Canada will provide more than $32m (£19.7m) in support to further strengthen Ukraine’s security and stabilisation, its government has announced. In a statement, Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, said: For an entire year, Canada and the international community have rallied like never before to support Ukraine’s resilience in the face of President Putin’s aggressions. Canada’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty is unwavering. We will not stand down until Russia is held accountable for its crimes. The $32m includes $7.5m for demining efforts, more than $13m for accountability efforts that include addressing conflict-related sexual violence, and more than $12m to “counter chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats”, the government said. Ukraine’s war reaches the one-year mark with no immediate end in sight. Both sides want to carry on fighting, and any negotiated peace looks a long way off. So how might the war end? The Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, says there are five scenarios to consider. Joe Biden has tweeted his support for Ukraine today on the first anniversary of Russia’s full-fledged invasion, alongside a photograph of him and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv. “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never,” the US president wrote. Earlier we reported that Poland has delivered its first Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine. Its prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has now confirmed that his country has delivered four Leopards to Kyiv already. Morawiecki, who has been meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, said at a joint news conference with the Ukrainian leader: Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia. He said Poland will provide more Leopard tanks soon, as well as a number of upgraded, Soviet-era T-72 tanks. Poland has pledged 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Alexander Kamyshin, the head of Ukraine’s railway company Ukrzaliznytsia, doesn’t get much sleep at the best of times. On Sunday night, as Joe Biden was being ferried into Ukraine in a 10-hour night journey from Poland – in a carriage now known as “Rail Force One”, he got almost none. Along with others involved in the secret operation to bring the US president to his meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Kamyshin watched the progress of the train in a command centre. A handsome bearded man sporting a hipster-ish braid of hair that falls over the shaved sides of his head, Kamyshin is deliberately vague about many of the details. But in the past year, his dedicated team has brought in world leaders, VIPs and diplomatic missions on an almost daily basis as part of a programme called “Iron Diplomacy”. Security is everything, he told the Guardian in an interview at Kyiv’s main railway station. We have not had one leak. There have been no photographs from train attendants. We respect the confidence of the delegations. The challenge is treat the delegations properly because, like Biden, they spend more time on the train than they do in Kyiv. He spent 20 hours on the train and four hours in Kyiv. Everyone knows Ukrainians are brave. We also want them to know that we are welcoming.” Read the full interview here: China’s government has called for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west is fuelling the conflict. The 12-point position paper was released on Friday, on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion and before an expected speech by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The paper stated that the international community should “create conditions and platforms” for negotiations to resume, and claimed that China would continue to “play a constructive role in this regard”. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that any actions threatening its troops in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria would be seen as a direct attack on Russia itself and trigger an “adequate response”. The ministry said: Any action that threatens their security will be considered under international law as an attack on the Russian Federation. Today’s warning came a day after Russia’s defence ministry alleged that Ukraine was planning to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria after staging a false-flag operation. The region of Transnistria broke away from then-Soviet Moldova in 1990 and is controlled by Russia separatists. The Russian ministry claimed on Thursday that Ukraine – which borders Moldova – posed “a direct threat” to Russian troops in the Russian-speaking region. Moldova’s government dismissed the accusation, calling for “calm and for information to be received [by the public] from official and credible sources of the Republic of Moldova”. Separately, Russian state-run Tass news agency quoted Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin as saying the west had instructed Moldova’s government in Chisinau to stop all interaction with Transnistria’s Moscow-backed authorities. Liudmyla Bikus recalled how she had tried to dissuade her son Andrii from joining the army. That was in March, weeks after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, one year ago today. “Andrii told me: ‘Mum if I don’t go then who will?’” Bikus said. She added: He was a golden boy. The best son, husband, father and brother. He wanted to defend his country and his family. Andrii was quickly dispatched to the eastern front. Less than three months later he was dead, fatally wounded on 6 June near the city of Lysychansk. A Russian shell landed on top of his artillery position. He was taken to hospital and died from blood loss on the operating table. Eight men from his company perished in the same lethal strike. In September Andrii’s widow Natalia planted a blue and yellow flag with her late husband’s name on it in a memorial garden in central Kyiv. It said: “Eternal memory”. The non-official plot is on a grassy slope in the Maidan, the city’s independence square. On Thursday Bikus went to visit. She brought her daughter Alyona, Andrii’s sister. They couldn’t find the flag. It had somehow got lost among hundreds of new ones, left by grieving relatives. Each marked a victim of Russia’s war: soldiers, civilians, volunteers. There were names, places, dates of birth and death. One said simply: “Anya from Mariupol”. Another: “Roman Stetsiura, 54th brigade, Bakhmut”. Nearby, under a tree, pigeons pecked in the February snow. “A whole young generation is being wiped out. Guys are dying aged 19 and 20. They will never have children or grandchildren,” Bikus reflected. Andrii was 34. He was buried in Kyiv’s Berkovetske cemetery. His seven-year-old son Misha watched as his father’s coffin was lowered gently into the ground. “There are three or four funerals like ours every day,” Bikus said. Read the full report by our foreign correspondent Luke Harding: A number of Russian state-controlled media outlets have been instructed not to quote statements made by the founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, according to a report. Prigozhin, who is one of Vladimir Putin’s most notorious associates, has spent much of the last week publicly criticising Russia’s top military leaders, accusing them of “high treason” and saying they have refused to provide him with munitions in an attempt to wipe out his fighting force. The Wagner boss’s press service published a photo on Wednesday showing what he claimed were dozens of Wagner servicemen who had died because of “shell hunger”. It could not immediately be confirmed if the men had died or if the shot was staged. A day later, Prigozhin said ammunition for his troops had been dispatched. The Russian defence ministry rejected his initial accusations about blocking ammunition as “absolutely untrue”. Independent outlet Verstka, citing sources from the Kremlin-backed media and the Russian defence ministry, reports that Russian state journalists have been ordered not to quote Prigozhin unless absolutely necessary, Meduza writes. Russian authorities have also prepared a “media smear campaign” against Prigozhin, the outlet says, but have decided not to launch it for the time being. One source said: In a meeting this week, the higher-ups repeated to us that the block on Prigozhin that we put in place in January remains in effect. We’re banned from mentioning him unless it’s absolutely necessary, we’re banned from quoting him, except in cases where he’s the first person to report news about successes on the front line. For example, if they captured Soledar or reached the outskirts of Bakhmut. Prigozhin has previously feuded with Russia’s top brass over military tactics and the right to recruit convicts from Russian prisons for the war in Ukraine. But his latest attack on military leaders such as the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, marks an unusual level of infighting in Russia, where the Kremlin has sought to tamp down infighting among elites despite its lack of military success. Prigozhin was conspicuously absent from a major speech Putin gave on Tuesday, and it appears that the ambitious catering magnate may have fallen out of favour. Earlier this year, he announced that he would suspend recruiting in Russian prisons, apparently due to pressure from the Russian defence ministry. The invasion of Ukraine has sparked interest in learning the country’s language among the British public, with the University of Sheffield launching new courses for students and the public, assisted by academics from Lviv. The university says that its beginners classes in Ukrainian language and culture for the public are the first of its kind in the UK. The university will also offer an accelerated course in Ukrainian for students studying Slavonic languages at Sheffield’s modern languages school. Neil Bermel, professor of Slavonic languages at Sheffield, said: We have thousands of Ukrainians living in the UK, including a large number in Sheffield, because of the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme, and many of the hosts are motivated to learn more about the language. The courses are mainly funded by Sheffield, with teaching done by Ukrainian academics seconded from universities in Lviv. If the initial six-week course is a success, Prof Bermel said the university could continue to offer more. Nataliia Faryna, one of course teachers, said: For me, teaching Ukrainian language is a way to tell people about Ukraine, about our culture and worldview, to help those people who have already taken the first steps in the chosen direction get to know it. I am infinitely grateful to the people of Britain for standing with Ukraine in the war and for their unwavering support. Native English speakers will find Ukrainian “a steeper hill to climb compared to learning Spanish or French”, according to Bermel, with the intricacies of Slavonic grammar posing problems initially. But the Cyrillic alphabet used in Ukrainian is much easier to learn than people expect, he said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has tweeted about his visit to the Wall of Remembrance in Kyiv with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, where the pair laid flowers for those who died for Ukraine. The Polish premier’s visit comes as its president, Andrzej Duda, said his country has delivered the first Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Japan is considering new sanctions against Russia in line with moves by other Group of Seven (G7) countries, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said. Speaking before a call with other G7 leaders and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy scheduled later today, Kishida said he would present new ideas for sanctions but did not give any details. At a news conference to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, Kishida said Moscow was refusing to change its “hardline stance”, adding: The international community must come together and show solidarity and impose strong sanctions against Russia. Kishida, who will host the G7 summit in Hiroshima in May, said he was considering travelling to Ukraine in a show of solidarity. Japan tightened sanctions against Russia last month, including banning some exports and freezing the assets of Russian officials and entities. Japanese firms have however maintained stakes in Russian oil and gas projects seen as critical to Japan’s energy supplies. The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has said any “peace plan” to end the conflict must involve the withdrawal of Russian troops to the borders of 1991. Posting to Twitter, he said a ceasefire that would result in the continued occupation of Russian territory “isn’t about peace, but about freezing the war, Ukraine’s defeat, next stages of genocide”. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has said his country has delivered its first Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Duda, speaking in his opening remarks at a meeting of the national security council in Warsaw, said he was happy that Poland was the first nation to offer the advanced tanks to Ukraine. Defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, also said at the council: The prime minister couldn’t be here, he went to Kyiv to bring Leopard tanks which are the first batch delivered to Ukraine. The government spokesperson, Piotr Müller, confirmed that the first Leopard tanks from Poland had gone to “our neighbours” in Ukraine. Poland has pledged 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. It was unclear how many tanks have been delivered. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, is in Kyiv today in a show of support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pledged to push for victory this year as Ukraine marks the sombre first anniversary of the Russian invasion, an event the president called “the longest day of our lives”. Funerals for the recently killed were taking place across the country on Friday morning alongside church services to commemorate the fallen, in a grim reminder of the relentless attrition of the continuing war. As morning broke on a day of commemorations and reflection, Zelenskiy struck a tone of grim defiance as he congratulated Ukrainians on their resilience in the face of Europe’s biggest and deadliest war since second world war. He said they had proven themselves to be invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. Sitting at a desk, dressed in a blue sweatshirt with Ukraine’s trident emblem, Zelenskiy paid homage to cities that have become bywords for alleged Russian war crimes, such as Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol, describing them as “capitals of invincibility”. “We survived the first day of the full-scale war. We didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but we clearly understood that for each tomorrow, you need to fight. And we fought,” he said in an early morning video address. The longest day of our lives. The hardest day of our modern history. We woke up early and haven’t fallen asleep since. Read the full story by my colleague Peter Beaumont: The UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has led the country in a minute of silence to mark the anniversary of the war in Ukraine. Sunak was joined outside No 10 by his wife, Akshata Murthy, Kyiv’s ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, and dozens of Ukrainian troops being trained by the UK for the national pause. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the military situation in Ukraine’s south is “quite dangerous” in some places while conditions in the east are “very difficult”. Speaking in a video address early on Friday on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian president said pro-Moscow forces had again shelled the southern city of Kherson, this time cutting off heat for 40,000 people. Zelenskiy delivered a sombre message of defiance to his people, saying “we will defeat everyone”. In a video titled “the year of invincibility”, he recalled how he addressed Ukrainians a year ago in a hurried statement, as Kyiv and the world reeled from Russia’s act of war. In a further address in Lithuania given via video link, Zelenskiy said Russia has to lose its war in Ukraine so it stops seeking to conquer territories it once controlled. “Russian revanchism must forever forget about Kyiv and Vilnius, about Chișinău and Warsaw, about our brothers in Latvia and Estonia, in Georgia and every other country that is now threatened,” he said. Russia’s Wagner group of mercenaries has taken full control of the Ukrainian village of Berkhivka, just north-west of Bakhmut, Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed on Telegram. The US has announced new military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies, to demonstrate resolve on the anniversary. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The US commerce department will list over 80 companies from Russia, China and other countries accused of sanctions busting, including “backfill activities in support of Russia’s defence sector”, replenishing material that Moscow has used up in the invasion. China’s government has called for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west is fuelling the conflict and was dismissed as anodyne by analysts. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine was released on Friday morning. The paper, for which Ukraine was not consulted, was cautiously welcomed by Kyiv, but criticised by US officials and some analysts who noted the growing ties between China and Russia. On Wednesday, China’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership. China’s call for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia “doesn’t have much credibility” the secretary-general of Nato Jens Stoltenberg has said, as he warned China against supplying arms to the Kremlin war machine. Stoltenberg told reporters “China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine and they also signed just days before the invasion an agreement between President Xi and President Putin on a limitless partnership with Russia.” Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said on Friday more talks between parliamentary groups were needed before Hungary’s ratification of Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership, which lawmakers will start debating next Wednesday. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, went to Kyiv on Friday in a show of support to Ukraine, government spokesperson Piotr Muller wrote on Twitter. Denmark is “open” to the idea of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to help its war effort against the Russian invasion, the Danish defence minister said on Friday. Britain is prepared to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies to enable them to release their Soviet fighters to Ukraine, defence secretary Ben Wallace has said. Wallace also said Britain is taking steps to rebuild its stockpiles of munitions which have been depleted by the war in Ukraine. Britain has imposed an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced. King Charles III has issued a message praising the “remarkable courage and resilience” of Ukraine’s people. Charles said in his message: “It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy.” The archbishop of Canterbury has said an end to the war in Ukraine cannot lead to Russia being treated like Germany after the first world war. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the only way for Moscow to eventually ensure a lasting peace with Ukraine was to push back its own borders as far as possible, “even if these are the borders of Poland.” That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I shall be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly to continue our live coverage. World affairs editor Julian Borger reports for the Guardian: The US has announced new military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia and its supporters, including Chinese companies, to demonstrate resolve on the first anniversary of the full-scale Russian invasion. The military assistance package will include several new drone and anti-drone systems the US has not previously made available as well as equipment to help Ukraine counter Russian electronic warfare. The new drone include the Switchblade -600, a bigger version of this loitering munition (or “kamikaze drone”) than has already been supplied, as well as the CyberLux K8, Altius-600, and the Jump-20, which can be used for surveillance or adapted to carry bombs. The US will also send more ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) and 155mm howitzer guns Washington has provided over the course of the year. The US commerce department will list over 80 companies from Russia, China and other countries accused of sanctions busting, including “backfill activities in support of Russia’s defence sector”, replenishing material that Moscow has used up in the invasion. The Biden administration has become increasingly vocal about Chinese aid to the Russian war machine, and has raised concerns recently that Beijing is contemplating supplying weapons directly. The companies named would be blocked from purchasing hi-tech items like semiconductors made in the US, or using US technology abroad. Tariffs will be raised on imports from Russia of more than 100 metals, minerals, and chemical products, including aluminum smelt or cast in Russia, worth an estimated $2.8bn in revenue to Moscow. Other measures will be taken in concert with the G7 group of nations, including sanctions on over 200 individuals and entities in Russia, as well as Europe, Asia and the Middle East deemed to be supporting the Russian war effort. In that list are a dozen Russian financial institutions as well as Russian officials. The G7 will also set up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of G7 sanctions already imposed. The US has this week begun disbursing $9.9bn in financial assistance to help fund healthcare, education, and emergency services, while the G7 as a whole has increased its commitment of budget and economic support to $39bn for this year. Part of the US assistance will be a third delivery by the energy department of equipment to help patch the Ukrainian power grid equipment which has been weakened by repeated Russian missile attacks over the course of the year. Britain’s King Charles III has issued a message marking the first anniversary of the conflict in Ukraine praising the “remarkable courage and resilience” of the nation’s people. PA Media reports Charles said in his message: “It has now been a year that the people of Ukraine have suffered unimaginably from an unprovoked full-scale attack on their nation. They have shown truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy. “The world has watched in horror at all the unnecessary suffering inflicted upon Ukrainians, many of whom I have had the great pleasure of meeting here in the UK and, indeed, across the world, from Romania to Canada. “Earlier this month I met President Zelenskiy at Buckingham Palace to express my personal support for the people of Ukraine. It is heartening that the United Kingdom, along with its allies, is doing everything possible to help at this most difficult time. “Therefore, I can only hope the outpouring of solidarity from across the globe may bring not only practical aid, but also strength from the knowledge that, together, we stand united.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, marked the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Friday with a sombre message of defiance to his people, saying “we will defeat everyone”. In a video released to the media titled “the year of invincibility”, he recalled how he addressed Ukrainians a year ago in a hurried statement, as Kyiv and the world reeled from Russia’s act of war. Here is a clip … Here is a striking image from Serbia, where a pro-Ukrainian activist Čedomir Stojković has tried to deliver a bloody cake decorated with a skull to the Russian embassy in Belgrade. The US has announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine. In a statement the Biden administration said that it would include “ several new Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) equipment to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences … and electronic warfare detection equipment to bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s aggression.” The statement says “The package also includes a large amount of ammunition for 155mm artillery systems and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) that have proved so effective on the battlefield, as well as mine clearing equipment and secure communications support equipment.” Reuters reports that it has seen a draft document that suggests the US is also poised to announce for financial support for Moldova. Nick Ames and Larisa Kalik look today for us at the impact the war has had on the world of football in Ukraine. Among others, they spoke to Obolon Kyiv’s goalkeeper Nazariy Fedorivskyi. He had this to say: Football unites. That has never been clearer than over the past year. It was so important that we could restart our league to give people an outlet outside of Russia’s invasion: something to watch and enjoy, even if not inside the stadiums, that brought people together. We hope that fans of our club, Obolon Kyiv, have been given some pleasure: we are top of the second tier, about to finish the mid-season break, and hope we can finish the job with promotion back to the top flight. That is only part of what football can give. As players we have all adapted, trying to help, volunteer and donate in any way we can. I run a store in Kyiv that sells trainers and we have diverted a lot of our activities towards helping the military effort. Only last week we ran a charity event to raise funds for army dogs, while a percentage of every sale we make goes directly to the army. My family have remained here ever since Russia invaded. They try to help too: my mum has a big company that makes fabric for military uniforms. My father was on Maidan Nezalezhnosti in 2013 during the Euromaidan protests and we all know what we are working so hard for.

During a visit to Estonia, Jens Stoltenberg was asked about China’s 12-point position paper on Ukraine, which calls for the international community to “create conditions and platforms” for negotiations to resume. Stoltenberg told reporters “China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine and they also signed just days before the invasion an agreement between President Xi and President Putin on a limitless partnership with Russia.” He added that “military support today is the way to achieve a peaceful agreement tomorrow” in a rebuke to China’s implied criticism of western weapons for Ukraine. And he warned China against supplying Russia with weapons, saying it would be tantamount to supporting Russia’s illegal war of aggression, thereby violating the UN Charter. “We are monitoring closely what China is doing and we have seen signs that they may be considering sending lethal aid to Russia … this would be a very big mistake.” The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, also gave a cool response to the Chinese paper. “You have to see [the Chinese statement of principles] against a specific backdrop and that is the backdrop that China has taken a side, by signing, for example, an unlimited friendship right before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine started,” she said. The EU would look at the paper against that backdrop, she added. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that about 2,000 people held a demonstration near the Russian consulate in the Romanian city of Constanta. It posted to its official Telegram channel to say: About 2,000 Ukrainians are present at the event, including many from Kherson. The event began with the national anthem of Ukraine. Then the participants honoured the memory of the dead with a moment of silence. They also called out “Kherson is Ukraine”, “Donbas is Ukraine”, hung up posters, and laid out toys with photos of children killed in the conflict. Services will be held across the world today to remember those who have lost their lives in the war. Here are some images from Copenhagen and London. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, went to Kyiv on Friday in a show of support to Ukraine, government spokesperson Piotr Muller wrote on Twitter. Morawiecki and the Ukrainian prime minister laid flowers at the wall of remembrance of those who died for Ukraine, Reuters reports the chancellery of the prime minister said in a statement. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been taking part in a ceremony in Kyiv to commemorate the one year anniversary of Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. Denmark is “open” to the idea of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to help its war effort against the Russian invasion, the Danish defence minister said on Friday, according to state broadcaster DR. “I won’t rule out that at some point it may be necessary to look at the contribution of fighter jets,” Reuters reports acting defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said. Russia has to lose its war in Ukraine so it stops seeking to conquer territories it once controlled, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in an address in Lithuania given via video link. “Russian revanchism must forever forget about Kyiv and Vilnius, about Chișinău and Warsaw, about our brothers in Latvia and Estonia, in Georgia and every other country that is now threatened,” Reuters reports the Ukrainian president said. Britain is prepared to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies to enable them to release their Soviet fighters to Ukraine, defence secretary Ben Wallace has said. Nato allies have been reluctant to release modern western warplanes to Kyiv, arguing that it will take too long to train aircrew. PA Media reports Wallace told Times Radio: “The other quick way that Ukraine can benefit from fighter jets is for those countries in Europe that have Russian Soviet fighter jets – MiG 29s or Su-24s – if they wish to donate we can use our fighter jets to backfill and provide security for them as a result. “They are already configured to fight in a Nato way, where of course Ukraine isn’t.” Wallace also said Britain is taking steps to rebuild its stockpiles of munitions which have been depleted by the war in Ukraine. “This Ukraine war and the way Russia is fighting has shown across the west that our stockpiles over the last three decades have often borne the brunt of defence cuts and we have to restock those,” he told Sky News. “We have now started to place orders to replenish them and where we haven’t placed orders we have started the work to make sure we have the supply chain or find alternative sources.” The defence secretary added that Russia has been forced to adopt a “meat-grinder approach” after its forces failed to make a breakthrough in Ukraine. He told listeners the Russian army was suffering “huge losses” on the battlefield for very little gain in territory. “It will move effectively to a meat-grinder approach where it just keeps sacrificing its own soldiers for the vanity of the Kremlin “That’s why we see huge losses amongst the Russian army and only gains, where we see gains, in metres not miles.” Some images have been released this morning that show Ukrainian troops and their UK military instructors commemorating lives lost during the invasion at Lydd army camp in Kent, England. Britain has imposed an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has announced. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said the internationally coordinated package of sanctions includes aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components that can be used by the Russian military industrial complex. PA Media reports the UK is also sanctioning senior executives at the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, as well as bosses at Russia’s two largest defence companies and four banks. Cleverly said: “Ukrainians are turning the tide on Russia but they cannot do it alone. That is why we must do more to help Ukraine win.” “Today we are sanctioning the elites who run Putin’s key industries and committing to prohibit the export to Russia of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield.” The archbishop of Canterbury has said an end to the war in Ukraine cannot lead to Russia being treated like Germany after the first world war. Justin Welby, writing in the Daily Telegraph as Ukraine marks the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion, also said Kyiv must not be forced into a “Munich Agreement-like compromise”, a reference to the doomed settlement that failed to prevent the second world war. “Provided a just peace between Russia and Ukraine can be achieved, there must be a security structure that makes another war unlikely,” he said. “Russia cannot end up like Germany after 1919; it must be able to recover and be secure without being allowed to repeat its aggression. “The great powers must find ways, ideally through a conference, to design the conditions for long-term security, as was done in 1945. Today, it must be done for a new century, including UN reform, while the cost of conflict is fading from most European memories.” The treaty of Versailles, signed in Paris in 1919, was seen as humiliating by many Germans, and some historians argue that it created an enduring bitterness that helped the Nazis rise to power. But Welby also urged world leaders not to force Ukraine into an “unjust peace”, as he spoke about the impact of visiting Kyiv. Read more here: Welby calls for just peace between Russia and Ukraine on war anniversary Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the only way for Moscow to eventually ensure a lasting peace with Ukraine was to push back its own borders as far as possible. Medvedev, a longtime ally of Putin and deputy chair of Russia’s security council, posted to the Telegram app to say: It’s been a year since the special operation has been going on. A year since our servicemen restore order, peace and justice in our land, protect our people and destroy the roots of neo-nazism. Victory will be achieved. We all want this to happen as soon as possible. And that day will come. We will return our territories and reliably protect our people, who have suffered during the years of genocide and shelling. Then there will be negotiations, which, I am sure, will become difficult and nervous. First of all, because the formal participants in the negotiations on the part of our enemy are one, and the actual leaders are completely different. And decisions for the Kyiv regime will, of course, not be made by some kind of Zelenskiy, if he is still alive, or his clique. The decision will be made across the ocean. By those in whose hands the supply of weapons to Kyiv and the allocation of money to maintain the remains of the Ukrainian economy. It is so important to achieve all the goals of the special military operation. Push the borders of threats to our country as far as possible, even if these are the borders of Poland. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the notion that China could supply arms to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would not help resolve the conflict, an outcome he was confident China wanted. “It can’t help the peace if China effectively supplies the one nation that has broken the international law on the sovereignty of Ukraine and been inflicting war crimes,” Wallace told Sky News on Friday when asked about reports China could supply weapons to Russia. “But I’m also confident that China is pretty clear that it wants this [war] to stop,” Reuters reports he added. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said on Friday more talks between parliamentary groups were needed before Hungary’s ratification of Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership, which lawmakers will start debating next Wednesday. Reuters reports that, speaking on public radio, Orbán said he had asked lawmakers of his nationalist Fidesz party to support their bid, adding however that some deputies were “not very enthusiastic” about the expansion and sought further discussions on the matter. Orbán added that in the end, it should be made clear that Hungary supports Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership, but said Turkey’s concerns regarding Sweden’s entry should also be heard, otherwise the expansion effort could fail. “Regarding Turkey, they are also our allies, and therefore we need to hear their voice,” Orbán said. Ankara claims Stockholm has harboured what Turkey calls members of terrorist groups and recently indicated it would approve only Finland for Nato membership at present. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has posted to the Telegram messaging app to mark a year since the beginning of the war. He writes: Friends! We have been living in a new reality for a year. Tragic and psychologically exhausting. But we are fighting, we believe in ourselves and our country. Therefore, we will overcome everything and win. A year ago, Russia’s resolution of this barbaric war seemed unreal to most Ukrainians. But the capital was preparing for a possible offensive. Volunteers had joined the ranks of territorial defence [and] our military helped protect and hold the capital. The city’s critical infrastructure worked despite shelling and the real threat of street fighting. Hospitals received the wounded from the suburbs, where fierce battles were fought. Grocery stores and community pharmacies stayed open. Businesses and caring citizens of Kyiv provided support to those who needed it. Photojournalists Alessio Mamo, Anastasia Taylor-Lind, Ed Ram and Anastasia Vlasova have covered the situation in Ukraine since the Russian invasion last February. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo spoke to them about their experiences for this photo essay. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that overnight the city of Slovyansk in Donetsk was shelled by Russian forces. It says “private houses were damaged by shelling” but there were no reports of any injuries as a result. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown writes for the Guardian today, saying that ‘we owe it to the people of Ukraine to bring Vladimir Putin to trial for war crimes’: Special tribunals have been promoted by the US before. Exactly 30 years ago, with the US’s endorsement, the UN security council created the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. One year later, it supported the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda. An agreement between the government of Sierra Leone and the UN led to an independent special court and, with the assistance of the UN, special tribunals were created for Cambodia and Lebanon with US support. But the most obvious parallel is the decision made by nine European allies that met in London in 1942 and drafted a resolution on German aggression, which led, at the war’s end, and with American support, to the creation of the international military tribunal and the trials of Nazi war criminals. The trial of Japanese war criminals followed. Those who say prosecutions like this do not work should remember not only the verdicts of Nuremberg and Tokyo, but also that the notorious former president of Liberia, Charles Taylor, languishes in a British prison after a 50-year sentence was imposed upon him in 2012 for atrocities committed on his instruction in Sierra Leone. A similar verdict was likely to be imposed on the butcherous Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević, who was being tried in The Hague for war crimes when he died of a heart attack in his prison cell. And war tribunals can sentence criminals in their absence, making it difficult for them ever to travel abroad again. Read more here: Gordon Brown – We owe it to the people of Ukraine to bring Vladimir Putin to trial for war crimes First Edition, the Guardian’s daily briefing email, today features Archie Bland speaking to Patrick Wintour, our diplomatic editor, about the anniversary of the war and the way the world has responded to it. Here is an excerpt: “Global south” is a “rather overused phrase”, Patrick said. It refers to such a varied group of countries – from India’s 1.4 billion people to African states with populations in the low millions – that any attempt to view them as uniform is bound to fall short. Still, it is clear that most of these countries are sceptical of joining western support of Ukraine, and see the war as a proxy conflict between world powers with an eye on the US’s history of military interventions and European imperialism as context rather than a necessary moral crusade. The recent debate between allies over whether or not to provide Ukraine with tanks – which ended with a deal to send US and German-made armour and train Ukrainian soldiers to use it – is a decent miniature of the larger pattern in the west since the war began: serious disputes over the right approach, but agreement in the end. This week, Patrick said, Joe Biden’s trip to Ukraine and the Munich security conference have reinforced that narrative. “The thing I drew from Munich, and then the Biden visit, is the degree to which the west has remained united in the face of the likelihood of a long war. The signs of fissure that we might have expected, with France and Germany as reluctant warriors in opposition to the Baltic nations, haven’t really materialised. I don’t think there’s an influential ‘peace party’ operating in Europe.” Read more here: Friday briefing – Ukraine’s allies are settling in for the long haul as the war enters its second year Paris lit up the Eiffel Tower in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukraine flag on Thursday night in a show of support to Ukraine and to mark the first anniversary of the war. Ukrainian ambassador to France, Vadym Omelchenko, spoke at the event. A couple of pictures of how it unfolded can be seen below. Over the course of the last year, Putin has “met the bravery of Ukraine and the iron will of nations everywhere,” Joe Biden has said as the world marks the anniversary of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Biden also said that Nato, which Putin thought “would fracture and divide” is “stronger and more unified than ever before”. In another one of the conflict’s defining images, the bridge that linked Crimea to Russia burns after a truck bomb exploded on 8 October. The Kerch Bridge was a personal Putin prestige project and the hit came the day after his 70th birthday. The blast destroyed the road into Crimea and left the railway link in flames. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for the attack at the time, but s senior Ukrainian official posted a “happy birthday” message with images of destruction, and the country’s post office revealed – within hours – designs for a commemorative stamp, showing the bridge ablaze, raising questions about whether the explosion had been anticipated. Russia’s Wagner group of mercenaries has taken full control of the Ukrainian village of Berkhivka, just north-west of Bakhmut, Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said a few minutes ago on Telegram. The Guardian has not verified this independently. How will the war in Ukraine develop during 2023? The Guardian has asked a panel of experts to weigh in. Russian investigative journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan say we are in for a long fight. This war is going to last for a very long time – that feeling dawned on Russians at the end of 2022. Most of those who wanted to leave the country have already left. The rest, the thinking part of the population, will try to adjust to the circumstances in a state where even children are subject to compulsory propaganda in schools. In 2023, the added feeling will be fear of those who enthusiastically went to war and now are getting back. Many will be angry and frustrated, and capable of further violence. People will switch to a quiet survival strategy – something familiar to Russians who remember the Soviet Union. There will be an exodus into domestic life, to quiet conversations in kitchens, to a habit of being cautious about what you say publicly and on the phone or on social media. In short, keeping one’s head down. The body bags arriving in Russian cities and towns will not add to sympathy for the plight of Ukrainians. The rest of the panel’s responses are here: Buildings and monuments across Ukraine have been illuminated in blue and yellow lights to commemorate the victims of Russia’s invasion. In Kyiv, the main post office was lit up overnight during a light projection by Swiss artist Gerry Hofstetter. Hofstetter is performing an art tour of the cities of Ukraine with illumination of buildings and monuments commemorating the full-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence has posted its daily update. Today, it tracks Russia’s changing tactics since 2014, as it changed from subversion to invasion. “In recent weeks, Russia has likely changed its approach again. Its campaign now likely primarily seeks to degrade the Ukrainian military, rather than being focused on seizing substantial new territory,” the ministry says. “The Russian leadership is likely pursuing a long-term operation”. Here is the full update: Since 2014 Russia’s strategic goal in Ukraine has highly likely been consistent: to control its neighbour. Over 2014-2021, it pursued this objective through subversion, by fomenting an undeclared war in the Donbas, and by annexing Crimea. On 24 February 2022, Russia pivoted to a new approach and launched a full-scale invasion which attempted to seize the whole country and depose its government. By April 2022, Russia realised this had failed, and focused on expanding and formalising its rule over the Donbas and the south. It has made slow and extremely costly progress. In recent weeks, Russia has likely changed its approach again. Its campaign now likely primarily seeks to degrade the Ukrainian military, rather than being focused on seizing substantial new territory. The Russian leadership is likely pursuing a long-term operation where they bank that Russia’s advantages in population and resources will eventually exhaust Ukraine. Zelenskiy has released a video as part of his message on the morning of the one year anniversary of the war: China’s government has presented itself as a neutral party, one capable of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. However it has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, instead blaming the west for inflaming tensions, and some senior officials have repeatedly voiced explicit support for Russia’s aims. This week the US government said it has intelligence suggesting Beijing is considering supplying weapons to Russia, and on Friday a report by Der Spiegel claimed Moscow was in negotiations with a Chinese company about supplying large quantities of strike drones. On Friday Beijing also abstained – for the fourth time – from a UN vote demanding Russia withdraw from Ukraine. Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the US-based German Marshall Fund, said the paper was largely a summary of its previously stated positions and statements, which were “replete with contradictions”. “Beijing claims to support Ukraine’s sovereignty, but it has not criticised Russia’s annexations of Ukrainian territory,” Glaser said. Glaser also noted the last of the 12 points, which states China stood ready to help in post-conflict reconstruction, “sounds like China is keen to get its [state-owned enterprises] into Ukraine, both to make a profit and promote Chinese influence via commercial and economic means”: More now on China’s position paper on Ukraine, released a few hours ago. China’s government has called for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians, in a statement which appeared to maintain Beijing’s stance that the west is fuelling the conflict and was dismissed as anodyne by analysts. The 12-point position paper on Ukraine was released on Friday morning, on the one year anniversary of Russia’s invasion, and ahead of an expected speech by Xi Jinping. The paper, for which Ukraine was not consulted, was cautiously welcomed by Kyiv, but criticised by US officials and some analysts who noted the growing ties between China and Russia. On Thursday China’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership. The paper stated that the international community should “create conditions and platforms” for negotiations to resume, and claimed that China would continue to “play a constructive role in this regard”.  The paper did not address its suggestions to a particular side in the conflict, instead calling for all parties to “stay rational and exercise restraint”, and to “strictly abide by international humanitarian law, avoid attacking civilians or civilian facilities, protect women, children and other victims of the conflict”. Some of the language appeared to be directed at the west. The paper warned against “expanding military blocs”, an apparent reference to Nato, and urged all parties to “avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions”, mirroring language that Beijing officials have repeatedly used to criticise the US’s support of Ukraine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just posted on Telegram saying, “On 24 February, millions of us made a choice. Not a white flag, but a blue and yellow flag. Not fleeing, but facing. Facing the enemy. Resistance and struggle. “It was a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity. And this is a year of our invincibility. We know that this will be the year of our victory!” After a 30% contraction in its economy in 2022, Ukraine will need $38bn by the end of year to cover its budget deficit alone, Reuters reports. “We need these funds for critical costs: funding of salaries and pensions, education and medicine,” prime minister Denys Shmyhal told a recent government meeting. “For economic stability and a successful fight against the enemy, Ukraine needs more help.” On top of that, Kyiv has said it will need $17bn this year for urgent energy repairs and de-mining, and rebuilding some of its critical infrastructure. The European Union is expected to provide the lion’s share of funds, at $18bn, to cover the budget deficit. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stepped up calls on Thursday for increased financial support to Ukraine as the United States readies an additional $10bn in economic assistance. Kyiv has yet to identify sources of funding to meet those additional costs. It is now pressing for a multibillion-dollar borrowing programme from the International Monetary Fund, with prime minister Denys Shmyhal saying he hopes to agree a $15bn multi-year program. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Tuesday lending to Ukraine could be “sizeable”. Ukraine’s military has just released its latest operational report as of 6am this morning, claiming Russian forces launched strikes on dozens of settlements across Ukraine’s south and north-east in the past day. Russian troops fired at more than 22 settlements in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region as well as more than 20 settlements in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to the latest intelligence report from Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces. Russia conducted “several unsuccessful offensive actions” including on the sought-after eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, the military said. About 25 settlements in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region also reportedly fell under artillery shelling. The military also said mobile operators had disconnected access to the internet across some temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region. In some areas of the temporarily occupied territories of the Luhansk region, mobile operators have disconnected access to the Internet network in order to prevent the transmission of data on the actions of Russian occupation troops and the fight against the patriotic Ukrainian population. Disruption of the Internet network must take place in all temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region.” “Russian warship, go fuck yourself”: these may be the most famous five words said in the war. Ukrainian soldiers defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment reportedly told an officer on board a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender on 25 February 2022. There were 13 border guards stationed on Snake Island, a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island owned by Ukraine that sits about 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, when Russian troops bombed the island on Thursday. The exchange went like this, my colleague Luke Harding reported later: Russian warship: “Snake Island. I, Russian warship, repeat the offer: lay down your arms and surrender, or you will be bombed. Have you understood me? Do you copy?” First border guard to second border guard: “Well, that’s it then. Or do we need to tell them back to fuck off?” Second border guard to first border guard: “Might as well.” First border guard: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” Soon after the conversation, the Ukrainian military command lost contact with the island. It assumed all of its defenders had been killed. But days later it emerged that they had surrendered and were prisoners of war. They were freed in March that year. In the meantime, Harding writes, the phrase “became a national slogan, a global meme and a symbol of Ukraine’s heroic defiance in the face of Russian aggression.” You can read the full story of what happened to the men in Snake Island here: G20 financial leaders must condemn Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters in an interview on Friday. Speaking on the first day of the G20 financial leaders meeting in Bengaluru, Le Maire also said that Europe was “thinking and working on new sanctions on Russia”. Here is a video of the UN’s vote earlier on Russia withdrawing from Ukraine. The United Nations overwhelmingly isolated Russia by calling for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace”, demanding Russia withdraw its troops from Ukraine and stop fighting. Marking one year since Moscow’s invasion, the resolution was adopted with 141 votes in favour and 32 abstentions. Six countries joined Russia to vote no: Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria. China abstained from the vote – accusing the west of “adding fuel to the fire” – a day after Beijing’s top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership with Russia: On 9 March, two weeks after the invasion began, Russian forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol. The image of Mariana Vishegirskaya, heavily pregnant in cheerful pyjamas, her face smeered with blood, became a beacon of Russia’s ruthlessness. Vishegirskaya was later targeted by a Russia disinformation campaign accusing her of faking the injuries. The Russian embassy in London claimed in a series of tweets that Vishegirskaya had been employed as an actor to stage the photos, including a photo of a completely different woman being stretchered out of the hospital. On 11 March, she gave birth to a baby girl. Let’s take a look at some of the images that have captured the events of the last year. The first is Zelenskiy addressing Ukrainians on 24 February 2022. Appearing shortly after midnight, Ukraine’s president urged Putin to, “Listen to the voice of reason”. “The Ukrainian people want peace,” he said. Later that day, as Russia launched strikes accross the country, hitting 16 cities, Zelenskiy spoke again. Putin “wants to destroy our country, and everything we have been building. But we know the strength of the Ukrainian people,” he said. A few days later, Zelenskiy walked streets of Kyiv’s government district defiantly, proving that, contrary to rumours he had fled, he was still in the country – where he would remain for almost the entire first year of the war. Today on the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast: searching for the first casualty of the war in Ukraine. Denys Tkach was killed in the early hours of 24 February 2022, an hour and twenty minutes before Putin announced a “special military operation” in Ukraine. He was serving on a military checkpoint near the village of Zorynivka in the eastern Luhansk region. Was this the moment that the war really began? The Guardian’s chief reporter Daniel Boffey has been looking into what happened in the final hours of his life. He tells Michael Safi about meeting people who knew Tkach and learning about the complicated consequences of his death. Ukraine has responded to China’s publication of a position paper on ending the war, saying it is a “good sign and a sign that China wants to be involved in the global efforts to stop the war in Ukraine,” Reuters reports, citing Leshchynska Zhanna, the charge d’affaires at the Ukrainian embassy in China. Zhanna also called for China offering more support to Ukraine, saying, “Ukraine would like to see China on its side, at the moment hina is not supporting Ukraine efforts.” Ukraine has a peace plan which it hopes China supports, she said. Earlier this week, Zelenskiy said that he had not been shown what was then being referred to as China’s ‘peace plan’, but that he would be open to a meeting with Chinese leaders. In cities around the world, people are protesting and commemorating the war. In New York, a silent candlelight vigil took place front of the Russian embassy on Thursday night. Ukrainian refugees and locals gathered for a ceremony in the village of Grabie, Wieliczka, Poland. Closer to home, a commemoration event took place at the Lychakiv military cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine, where family members visited the graves of fallen soldiers. Here are some of the pictures: Here is the full story on Shakhtar Donetsk’s thrilling – and very well-timed – Europa League win: Hi, Helen Sullivan back with you. Some US lawmakers have expressed displeasure with South Africa’s decision to host joint military exercises with Russia and China on the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but said it would not scupper health partnerships between the two countries. South Africa’s 10-day joint naval exercises with Russia and China, which are being held off South Africa’s country’s east coast and which South Africa has called routine, have fuelled domestic criticism and fears that the drills will endanger important relations with western partners. Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham said any country that does such exercises are “gonna have problems,” but added that ending his country’s 20-year-old US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) programme aimed at HIV treatment and prevention could also hurt the United States. Graham was speaking at a press briefing in Johannesburg. Graham said he would work with the Republican caucus to have Pepfar reauthorised this year “despite the problems going on here in South Africa with the Russians.” Democratic Senator Chris Coons hinted that senators discussed the military exercises with South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, in a meeting on Wednesday, but added that “every other minute here has been about Pepfar.” Pandor’s spokesperson Lunga Ngqengelele confirmed that the meeting took place but could not immediately confirm the discussions. I’ll hand you back to my colleague Helen Sullivan who will continue to deliver all the latest developments as the day unfolds. Before I go, here is a little more detail from US national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s interview with CNN this evening. Sullivan told the broadcaster that the US has vowed to do “everything in our power to get you the equipment and the ammunition” that Ukraine needs. That includes 155-millimetre artillery shells, 120-millimetre tank shells among other tools like Himars missiles. He said the US and Nato countries aim to increase ammunition for Ukraine “so that the total supply of each of these different forms of ammunition grows month by month and we can continue to move to the front lines.” He said countries are putting in “immense effort and resources” into ramping up ammunition, but noted that “this is not something we can do with the snap of a finger.” The US will provide Ukraine an additional $2bn in security assistance, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan has said. Sullivan made the announcement while speaking with the news broadcaster during a special live town hall to mark one year of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. Sullivan said US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have had “deep conversations” about providing Ukraine with the weaponry and tools needed to fight the war against Russia. We’re going to continue to look at what is necessary, and make sure that we provide what is necessary that Ukraine has what it needs to succeed on the battlefield.” He said during Biden’s recent surprise visit to Ukraine, the US president “brought with him an announcement of more artillery, more ammunition, more Himars on the back of major announcements about American tanks and armoured vehicles.” Sullivan also mentioned recently announced security assistance for Ukraine, as well as more technology. We will keep working with them month by month to figure out if there are additional tools that they need,” Sullivan said. The European Council has released this statement on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine in political, economic, humanitarian, financial and military terms, including through swift coordinated procurement from European industry. We will also support Ukraine’s reconstruction, for which we will strive to use frozen and immobilised Russian assets in accordance with EU and international law. We will further increase collective pressure on Russia to end its war of aggression. To this end we will adopt a tenth sanctions package and we will take steps against those who attempt to circumvent EU measures. We support President Zelenskiy’s peace formula. Together with our international partners, we will make sure that Ukraine prevails, that international law is respected, that peace and Ukraine’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders are restored, that Ukraine is rebuilt, and that justice is done. Until that day, we will not rest.” Earlier, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen raised the Ukrainian flag in front of the EU Commission. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Helen Sullivan takes a short break. As I reflect on one year of covering the Russia-Ukraine war, here is a short snippet of what I recall on 24 February, 2022: Putin’s forces invaded in an unprecedented pre-dawn attack that hit as most major European newsrooms were sleeping. It was about 2pm in Sydney when the first series of missiles were launched towards Kyiv. I was live-streaming the event when Putin announced his invasion. About an hour into the meeting when speakers took the floor to denounce Russia’s escalating tensions towards Ukraine, rumours began to circulate that an offensive against Ukraine had begun. Back in Russia, President Vladimir Putin went on television to announce a “special military operation” in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region had commenced. The first few hours of war were frantic as missiles began to rain down near Kyiv and Putin’s plan became clear. Handing over to my colleagues in London as Europe woke up to a new reality, I never imagined the war would dominate the news agenda one year on. US President Joe Biden will meet virtually on Friday with G7 leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and announce new sanctions against those aiding Russia’s war effort, the White House said. The same group came together last year hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, imposing the first round of a series of sanctions, Reuters reports. “The G7 has become an anchor of our strong and united response to Russia,” White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday. The leaders on Friday will discuss “how we continue supporting Ukraine” and ways to increase pressure on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine a year ago, she said. The sanctions will include Russian banks, technology and defense sectors, and will impact both people and companies involved in the conflict, according to Jean-Pierre. The US will also announce a fresh Ukrainian aid package that will include economic, security and energy support, she added. Japanese chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Friday that Japan, as chair of the G7, wants to strengthen G7 ties and show firm cooperation with Ukraine. Japan is set to host an online G7 summit later on Friday to discuss the conflict. We’re just getting the first look at what is inside China’s so-called “Peace plan” for Ukraine, which was notably not shared with Ukraine’s leaders. So far, it looks fairly unsurprising, noting the dangers of nuclear weapons, which should be avoided, stressing the need for negotiations, and saying that ‘“one country’s security cannot be at the expense of another country’s security”. But one thing stands out, which is that China says it is opposed to “any unilateral sanctions not authorised by UN security council”. Many countries have imposed their own sanctions against Russian products, including gas, selling products within Russia, and on wealthy Russians with links to the Kremlin. So it seems like the cat’s out of the bag on that one. The paper also warns that, “nuclear weapons cannot be used and nuclear war cannot be fought” Here are the dot points from the peace plan: Respect sovereignty of all countries Country’s security cannot be at expense of other countries’ security Regional security cannot be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs Cease fire and stop fighting, prevent Ukraine crisis from further aggravating or even getting out of control Gradually promote de-escalation and easing of situation and finally reach comprehensive ceasefire Dialogue, negotiation are only viable way to resolve Ukraine crisis Maintain safety of nuclear power plants, oppose armed attacks on nuclear facilities Nuclear weapons cannot be used and nuclear war cannot be fought Prevent nuclear proliferation, avoid any nuclear crisis We oppose development, use of biological and chemical weapons by any country under any circumstances Oppose any unilateral sanctions not authorised by UN security council On Thursday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary the invasion. Here is Zelenskiy on 25 February 2022, the day after Russia had invaded: More now on the significance of the UN general assembly’s resolution calling for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine, via AP. The General Assembly has become the most important UN body dealing with Ukraine because the Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, is paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, unlike Security Council resolutions, but serve as a barometer of world opinion. In joyful news: the Ukrainian football team that has not played in their home city since 2014, qualified for the knockout stages of the Europa League on Thursday with coach Igor Jovicevic hailing the win at French side Rennes as a “victory for Ukraine.” AFP reports that Shakhtar defeated Rennes 5-4 in a penalty shootout after their playoff had ended 3-3 on aggregate and then went to extra-time. The win comes on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “It was very important. This match was for you, Ukraine, it was for our country, for Ukraine,” said Croatian national Jovicevic who has worked in Ukraine for more than 20 years. “I can’t find the words at the moment, we were in the game until the end,” he added. “You could almost say that we died on the pitch, that we left our arms and legs there. This victory is a reward for our work.” The BBC’s correspondent for eastern Europe, Sarah Rainsford, has posted this picture taken the day before Russia invaded. “The night before war. Everyone was nervous, but didn’t really believe what was coming. I barely slept that night,” she writes. “We were woken by the explosions.” Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine has reported that Russia is in talks with a Chinese manufacturer about buying 100 drones for use in the war, with a delivery date of April, but has not cited any specific sources. Over the past week the US has suggested China may be considering supplying weapons to Russia, while warning that any such move would have severe consequences. Beijing has denied this, saying they would continue to take “an objective and impartial stance” on the conflict. Der Spiegel said a Chinese drone manufacturer was prepared to make 100 prototypes of a model that they claim could carry a 35-50kg warhead. It claims the drone is similar to Iran’s Shaheed-136, which Russia has used to launch countless attacks on Ukraine, claiming hundreds of lives and damaging civilian infrastructure. Moldova’s government has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine is planning to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria after staging a false-flag operation. “We call for calm and for information to be received [by the public] from official and credible sources of the Republic of Moldova,” the government said in a statement. “Our institutions cooperate with foreign partners and in the case of threats to the country, the public will be promptly informed,” adding that the government “do not confirm” the Russian defence ministry’s allegations. On Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed Ukraine – which borders Moldova – posed “a direct threat” to Russian troops in the Russian-speaking region. At least 137,780 Russian military personnel have died in the war so far, according to the Ukrainian military, with around 824Russian soldiers dying a day this month, a marked increase from recent months and a figure not seen since the start of the war. A recent estimate by the US military said that each side had probably suffered about 100,000 deaths and injuries, putting the total number of deaths and casualties for Russia and Ukraine at 200,000. Russia’s own figure for casualties is far lower than the Ukrainian estimate, with The Conversation pointing out this month that Russia has provided only two official reports since the start of the war. “The most recent was on 21 September 2022, when defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that 5,937 Russian troops had been killed. Mediazona, an independent Russian publication which is working with the BBC News Russian service to monitor the death toll, puts the figure at 12,538 deaths. So the numbers vary wildly from source to source.” Ukraine has also refrained from providing casualty figures, but in August last year, the armed forces’ commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that 9,000 have died. As security studies expert Lily Hamourtziadou explains in the conversation: Casualty reporting is a powerful tool of war propaganda, seen most starkly in the tit-for-tat accounts of two incidents around the new year. Ukraine claimed that its rocket attack on a Russian army barracks in Makiivka near Donetsk in the east of Ukraine on New Year’s Eve killed 400 Russian soldiers. Russia countered that the attack, while deadly, had killed only about 60 troops (although prominent pro-Moscow blogger and former military leader Igor Girkin reportedly claimed the death toll was in the hundreds). Here is more on the clash between Germany and China the UN on Thursday. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, clashed with Chinese diplomats on Thursday, passionately rejecting their claim that the west was adding fuel to the fire by arming Ukraine. Baerbock said it was time for China to tell Russia to stop its aggression. The deputy Chinese envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, insisted the west was worsening the situation by arming Ukraine, saying: “Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions”. His remarks provoked Baerbock into a powerful rebuttal rejecting his claim that the west was indulging in military spending at the expense of other priorities more important to ordinary people. She asked: “Why on earth would we do that?”, adding: “We did not want this war. We did not choose this war.” She said her government “would much rather focus every bit of our energy and money in fixing our schools, in fighting the climate crisis and strengthening social justice”, adding: “The truth is that if Russia stops fighting, the war will end, If Ukraine stops this fighting, Ukraine ends.” She said the suffering, including “abduction, rape and torture”, would continue every day, and that the world’s gaping wounds, caused by hunger, inflation and energy shortages, would not end. In Australia, where Friday 24 February is well under way, the government has announced it would send more drones to Ukraine and impose new targeted financial sanctions against 90 Russian individuals and 40 entities. The latest targets include Russian ministers overseeing energy, resources and industry sectors, and key players in defence including arms manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern, aviation firm Tupolev and submarine developer Admiralty Shipyards. “We continue to stand with Ukraine,” prime minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement. “(The uncrewed aerial systems) provide a battlefield intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.” He did not specify how many drones would be shipped, the models involved, and whether they would be armed. The UN has overwhelmingly voted to call for Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Ukraine, marking one year since Moscow’s invasion by calling for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace”. The resolution on Thursday night saw 141 countries in favour with seven against and 32 abstentions, including China. The Chinese deputy envoy to the UN, Dai Bing, said the west was throwing fuel on to the fire by arming Ukraine. That would only exacerbate tensions, he said. Leading the abstention camp, he claimed: “One year into the Ukraine crisis, the conflict is still grinding on and growing in scale, wreaking havoc to countless lives. A spillover effect is intensifying. We are deeply worried about this. China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed. The legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously.” His remarks provoked a powerful rebuttal from Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, rejecting his claim that the west was indulging in military spending at the expense of other priorities more important to ordinary people. She said it was specious to claim the military aid was worsening the crisis since if the west did not supply aid, the aggressor would be free to capture Ukraine and destroy the UN Charter. The military situation in Ukraine’s south is quite dangerous in some places while conditions in the east are very difficult, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address early on Friday. Zelenskiy, speaking on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, said pro-Moscow forces had again shelled the southern city of Kherson, this time cutting off heat for 40,000 people. “As for the south – in some places the situation is quite dangerous but our troops have the means to respond to the occupiers,” he said, summarising events on the various fronts. “In the east – it’s very difficult, painful. But we are doing everything to withstand it,” he continued, in reference to repeated attacks by Russian forces seeking to capture the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Zelenskiy said repair work in Kherson, which is being shelled on a daily basis, would continue until heat was restored. “And we will rebuild. No matter what these Russian terrorists and bastards may do, we will rebuild and restore everything,” he said. On Friday morning, Ukrainians will wake up to an anniversary like no other: a year since Russia invaded their country and began a campaign of terror, striking civilian areas, targeting critical infrastructure and weaponising the freezing cold. Russia has been accused of war crimes including torture, raping women and children and carrying out mass executions. At least 8,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed, though the true number is likely much higher. This figure includes 487 children. The war has turned more than eight million Ukrainians into refugees. Today, we will be looking back at the first year of the war in Ukraine, as well as reporting the day’s news and analysis on what might come next. My name is Helen Sullivan, and I’ll be bringing you news, photos and analysis throughout the day. If you would like to get in touch, the best place to find me is on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Here are the key recent developments in the war: Ukraine is bracing for possible fresh Russian attacks on key cities amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with a series of strikes. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces had stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline and its forces had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance has seen signs that China is considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against taking any such step. Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing direct “support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course [as] a member of the UN security council China should not in any way support violation of the UN charter or international law.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”, as well as roll out hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the “Defender of the Fatherland” holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air. Spain will send Ukraine six Leopard tanks and is willing to increase that number to 10 if necessary, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, confirmed during a visit to Kyiv on Thursday. “We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe,” he said, adding that Spain had offered to train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the tanks. Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, the country’s defence ministry has said. The announcement comes after Sweden’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. The Czech government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine. A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months. But plans were still being drawn up on how and when they would be delivered, the US army secretary, Christine Wormuth, said. The EU’s top diplomats have failed to finalise the bloc’s tenth round of sanctions against Russia, which would ban the sale of more military-critical technologies. Talks are understood to be stuck on the question of rubber trade with Russia. The US president, Joe Biden, will meet virtually on Friday with G7 leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskiy to announce new sanctions against those aiding Russia’s war effort, the White House says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/sep/16/hitachis-disappointing-exit-from-wylfa-nuclear-deal-is-no-great-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-16T18:21:54Z","webTitle":"Hitachi’s 'disappointing' exit from Wylfa nuclear deal is no great loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/sep/16/hitachis-disappointing-exit-from-wylfa-nuclear-deal-is-no-great-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/sep/16/hitachis-disappointing-exit-from-wylfa-nuclear-deal-is-no-great-loss","fields":{"headline":"Hitachi’s 'disappointing' exit from Wylfa nuclear deal is no great loss","bodyText":"The government officially regards it as “disappointing” that Hitachi has pulled out of building a nuclear plant at Wylfa. Why? Well, the loss of potential jobs in north Wales must be acknowledged. But, from the point of view of meeting the nation’s energy needs, there is no reason to be disappointed. Hitachi had been wobbly on Wylfa for the past two years anyway, despite being offered generous-looking terms. More to the point, the government’s experts – the National Infrastructure Commission – are not banging the drum for new fleets of giant nuclear power stations. The NIC reiterated its two-year-old advice only last month: “The government should take a one-by-one approach to nuclear and not agree to more than one new nuclear plant, in addition to Hinkley Point C, before 2025.” It’s not the NIC’s job to pick which plant to build, but almost everybody believes the next cab on the rank, as it were, is the intended Hinkley replica at Sizewell C in Suffolk. Wylfa wasn’t a priority. What is? Again, read the NIC’s latest report, which put the case for a more rapid rollout of renewables, meaning on-shore and off-shore wind and solar, on grounds of cost and meeting emissions targets. Instead of an increase in renewables from 40% to 50% by 2030, which was the view in 2018, the electricity system could reach 65% with “no material cost impact”, it said. In short, renewables “are now the cheapest form of electricity generation due to dramatic cost reductions in recent years”. As for the overall security of the system, the NIC repeated its point that interconnectors will have a key role to play in balancing supply and demand. Seen in this context, Hitachi’s formal exit is no great loss. In fact, one could cheer the clarity. It should make it marginally easier for ministers to concentrate on their own adviser’s energy analysis. Housebuilders lay on their pitches to Sunak with a trowel There must be a rule that requires chairmen of large housebuilders to plead for more subsidies when announcing financial results. John Allan at Barratt Developments was at it earlier this month, urging the government to “consider what further options are available to help potential first-time buyers” now that lenders are culling high loan-to-value mortgages. Now here comes Redrow’s John Tutte. There should be “long-term reform” of stamp duty “to free up more cash for deposits”, he says, fretting about “a hiatus in the market” next March when the current sub-£500,000 stamp duty holiday comes to an end, just as restrictions on help to buy are due to kick in. These corporate pitches would be more persuasive if the subsidies weren’t so obviously sticking to the builders. George Osborne’s help-to-buy bonanza made the big firms fabulously rich and Rishi Sunak’s stamp duty holiday has rescued returns for them in the year of the virus. Redrow’s pre-tax profits fell by two-thirds to £140m in the year to June, but operating profit margins still arrived at 11%, which ain’t so terrible. If Tutte’s comments about a “record order book” are a guide, normal service may soon be restored in the form of 20%-ish margins – a splendid ratio but not untypical in a comfortable sector. The most obvious ways to help first-time buyers, then, would be to allow house prices to drift lower and to force builders to cut the prices of new-build properties, which is what would happen in a competitive market. There may be indeed be a hiatus next spring, but the danger in the other direction is that government finds it impossible ever to kick the subsidy habit. Sunak should resist the pressure to keep playing. In practice, one suspects he’ll cave in: the housebuilding lobby is a phenomenon and is currently laying on its message with a trowel. Hut Group valuation is hard to square with its meagre profits The Hut Group’s governance is shocking. Its founder, Matt Moulding, is both chairman and chief executive, has a veto on takeovers for three years, could earn in £700m in freebie shares for reasons nobody has explained satisfactorily, and is also landlord to a few of the company’s properties. None of these features deterred new investors. Shares in the online health, beauty and nutrition retailer popped by 25% on the first day of trading on Wednesday. At its new valuation, Hut is worth £6.75bn, a valuation that is hard to square with the modest profits. The ride will be entertaining. But buyers be warned: governance doesn’t matter until it absolutely does."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/28/lethal-injection-surviving-execution-attempt-alabama","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-28T07:00:44Z","webTitle":"What is it like to survive an execution by lethal injection?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/28/lethal-injection-surviving-execution-attempt-alabama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/28/lethal-injection-surviving-execution-attempt-alabama","fields":{"headline":"What is it like to survive an execution by lethal injection?","bodyText":"On three occasions in the past four months, Alabama’s department of corrections has bungled its lethal injections procedure. At 7.57pm on 17 November, prison guards entered the “death cell” at Holman correctional facility in Atmore, south Alabama, where Kenneth Smith was awaiting execution by lethal injection for the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher’s wife. The guards put Smith in handcuffs and leg irons, then led him to the execution chamber and strapped him tightly to the gurney. As he lay there, he prepared himself for imminent death. He looked up at the fluorescent lights and was struck by how they formed the shape of a cross. Over 33 years on death row he had found faith, and he sang quietly to himself, “I’m not alone.” Two minutes before Smith was taken into the death chamber, the 11th circuit court of appeals had put a stay on his execution. The judges found reasonable grounds to suspect that the team in charge of setting up the intravenous lines for the lethal injections would have “extreme difficulty” in accessing the prisoner’s veins and that as a result he would be inflicted with “superadded pain”. Despite a clear order to stop from one of the country’s highest courts, the execution team pressed on. According to Smith’s lawyers, who have relayed his account of events in court documents, “he believed that he would die soon and that there was nothing more that could be done”. At 10pm, with the appeal court stay still in place, a three-person IV team, their identities obscured behind green, blue and red scrubs, respectively, entered the chamber, ready to inject the drugs that would kill Smith – midazolam hydrochloride, rocuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Blue Scrubs tied a tourniquet around Smith’s upper arm and then stuck a needle into him. When Smith protested that he was stabbing into his muscle, Blue Scrubs replied: “No I’m not.” After that attempt failed, Green Scrubs began slapping Smith’s right hand, then piercing it in several places. “With each jab, Mr Smith could feel the needle going in and out and moving around under his skin, causing him great pain,” the lawyers recorded. When no workable veins could be found, Blue Scrubs instructed the prison guards to flip the gurney backward so that the prisoner’s feet pointed towards the ceiling while his head bowed to the ground. Smith now found himself, curiously for a man of religion, in an inverse crucifixion. Then the IV team left the chamber, leaving him in that position for several minutes. On their return, they righted the gurney. Red Scrubs, swathed now in face mask and shield to protect himself from splattering blood, produced a large-gauge needle. He began piercing it under Smith’s collarbone “in an attempt to begin a central line IV in his subclavian artery”. After five or six jabs, still with no success, a deputy warden moved Smith’s head to the side to provide a clearer run for the needle. By now the condemned prisoner was in excruciating pain, according to his lawyers. When Smith protested, the deputy warden clasping his head reportedly told him: “Kenny, this is for your own good.” *** What is it like to survive an execution attempt in the US? Normally, there’s no one to tell the tale. But these are not normal times, especially in Alabama. On three occasions in the past four months, Alabama’s department of corrections has bungled its lethal injections procedure. In each case, IV teams struggled for hours to find a vein through which to pour the lethal cocktail set out in the state’s execution protocols. Two of those times, after hours of prodding and jabbing, piercing and stabbing, they were forced to admit defeat. The prisoners did – almost unthinkably – live to tell the tale. A recent series of disturbing death chamber encounters, in Alabama and other states, following a troubling history, has put the spotlight back on lethal injections as the main method of capital punishment in the US. The confluence of stories has been so alarming that some observers have begun to wonder whether the narrative that has stood for more than half a century that lethal injections are a medically informed, dignified way for states to kill people is finally unraveling. The procedure was first proposed by a medical examiner in Oklahoma in 1977 as a more civilized, painless alternative to the electric chair and firing squad. But from the start, it has been dogged by problems ranging from controversies surrounding the pharmaceutical drugs used in the cocktail to prolonged and potentially agonising deaths. Not only have death penalty states struggled to acquire execution drugs under a global boycott by drug companies, but they have also found it hard to contract skilled medical practitioners to administer the IV lines. Both the American Medical Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology prohibit their members participating in executions. As a way around these hurdles, many states have wrapped themselves in a veil of secrecy to avoid public scrutiny. In Alabama, the members of the execution team are kept strictly anonymous. The establishing of IV lines is a process that occurs, literally, behind a closed curtain in the absence of media and other public witnesses. Under Alabama’s execution protocols the curtain over the window of the official viewing room is to be opened only after the IV team has completed its task. As a result, the only people who know precisely what happened to Smith inside the death chamber are the prisoner himself and his unnamed executioners. “The recent spate of disastrous lethal injection executions have shown that whatever the drug, whatever the protocol, condemned prisoners often spend their final hours in agonising pain and distress,” said Maya Foa, director of the human rights group Reprieve US. “With each gruesome scene in the death chamber, we are witnessing the consequences of persisting with a broken method of execution, in real time.” In Smith’s case, the IV team’s labours failed. He was still in the chamber when the US supreme court gave its go-ahead for the execution, but shortly before midnight when the death warrant would expire the procedure was called off. The prisoner, still alive but riddled with holes and profoundly traumatized, was returned to his cell. He had been strapped to the gurney for four hours. Smith is one of only two people alive today who have survived an execution procedure in the US. His fellow member of this exceptionally small and undesirable club, Alan Miller, was subjected to an attempted execution by Alabama in September. Miller has been on death row for 22 years for shootings that killed three co-workers in 1999. At 10pm on 22 September, he was taken into the death chamber at Holman and put through what his lawyers claim was physical and mental torture. Miller’s attorneys described what happened in a court filing. He was repeatedly punctured over 90 minutes as he lay on the gurney. Miller’s legal team had flagged up in litigation that doctors had struggled to gain access to his veins throughout his adult life. In fact, the prisoner was so worried that lethal injection would go horribly wrong that he opted – as was his right under Alabama law – to die by lethal gas, via nitrogen hypoxia. Alabama ignored the request. Miller’s IV team – Green Scrubs and Aqua Scrubs this time – proceeded to make what his lawyers described as a “tour” of the prisoner’s body. Left arm, right hand, left hand, inner left arm, right foot, left foot – each body part was pierced multiple times in an increasingly desperate, and ultimately futile, search for an accessible vein, sometimes with them both probing different parts with needles simultaneously. Like Smith, Miller was also swung vertically, suspended in the crucifix position, albeit with his head up, for an estimated 20 minutes. By the time they lowered him, blood was leaking from his wounds. Shortly before midnight, he was told: “Your execution has been postponed.” He spent the next several days curled up in the fetal position in his cell. *** In a rare personal account, Romell Broom self-published a book, Survivor on Death Row, in which he described being poked for two hours by Ohio executioners in September 2009 before the procedure was aborted. According to Broom, who was convicted of raping and murdering a child in 1984, he was probed more than 100 times all over his body by officials unsuccessfully seeking a vein. After the failed execution attempt, the authorities kept at him, setting a new death warrant for June 2020. When Broom objected that it would be unconstitutional to try and execute him twice, the state argued that an execution only begins once the lethal drugs are in your bloodstream. Broom said of this catch-22: “Once the chemicals enter your system, you’re as good as dead, so you would have no right of appeal.” The pandemic forced a delay in Broom’s execution, but then he died in prison of complications from coronavirus in December 2020. In recent months problems with IV lines have struck several death penalty states. It took Texas almost two hours to kill the convicted murderer Stephen Barbee on 16 November – the day before Smith’s ordeal in Alabama. Barbee was disabled and could not straighten his arms. On the same day, Arizona struggled to insert IVs into the double murderer Murray Hooper and officials had to cut into his femoral artery. Hooper lifted his head off the gurney, looked through the glass at public witnesses and said: “Can you believe this?” Back in Alabama Joe Nathan James was executed in July for the 1994 murder of his ex-girlfriend. The authorities took almost four hours to kill James – the longest botched lethal injection in US history. Yet state officials insisted it was “nothing out of the ordinary”. After that execution Joel Zivot, an expert on lethal injections, at Atlanta’s Emory University hospital, and Elizabeth Bruenig, a reporter from the Atlantic, were invited to attend a private autopsy of James. Zivot told the Guardian he saw multiple punctures on both James’s arms. There was bruising around the wounds indicating James had been alive at the time. There was also a deep incision in a forearm, implying the IV team had attempted a “cutdown procedure” – a maneuver seeking a vein that Zivot said would rarely be used in a medical setting and would almost certainly have caused extreme pain. Zivot linked Alabama’s repeated recent blunders to secrecy. “When things go wrong in industries that require safety – nuclear power, say, or the airlines – detailed reviews are conducted in full public view. But what Alabama did to Joe Nathan James, they then did to Alan Miller and Kenny Smith – and guess what, it failed both times.” Another important factor, Zivot believes, is the composition and skill level of the IV team, noting that even Alabama’s heavily redacted execution protocols are confused about the role of trained medical professionals. The first page of the protocols says that administering lethal injections “shall not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing, or pharmacy”. Yet the next page says that the condemned person “will see a physician [REDACTED] for an assessment of his vein structure”. “So what is it then?” Zivot said. “Is lethal injection a medical act by physicians or is it not a medical act? The whole document is fraught with contradictions.” Zivot is convinced from having inspected the cutdown incision that a physician was involved in James’s execution, as such a surgical step would probably be beyond the comfort zone of an EMT or nurse practitioner. But “just because you’re a physician, doesn’t mean you can start an IV”, Zivot said. “Besides, what doctors learn in medical training does not necessarily translate to the death chamber – they are working in a totally different environment without the critical trust that exists between doctor and patient.” Bernard Harcourt has also seen the results of a botched procedure in Alabama up close. A Columbia University professor and death penalty lawyer, Harcourt represented Doyle Hamm, who on 22 February 2018 became the first Alabama prisoner to survive attempted execution. Hamm was terminally ill with lymphoma at the time, and died of his illness in prison three years later. The fact that he had terminal cancer did not deter the state from trying to kill him. Nor did several clear warnings made by Hamm’s lawyers in litigation that his medical condition, combined with years of drug use, would make it extremely difficult to locate a vein. Harcourt went to see Doyle in prison the day after he had been subjected to a two-hour aborted execution during which he was punctured at least 11 times and his bladder pierced. As Doyle approached, Harcourt could hear his chains rattling and said it “was the slowest jangling noise I had heard in 30 years of prison visits”. When he appeared, Harcourt said Doyle “looked like a ghost, a shadow of himself. He shuffled over, barely able to walk. He had been in such pain, he told me, that he had been praying they would get it over with and that he would die.” Amid rising public concern about the string of events in Alabama, the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, last month ordered a temporary halt to executions to allow for an official review.. But in announcing it, she said: “I don’t buy for a second the narrative being pushed by activists that these issues are the fault of the folks at corrections or anyone in law enforcement. Legal tactics and criminals hijacking the system are at play here.” That makes Zivot see red. “It’s like a joke, you know, except it’s not funny. I’ll be clear, terrible things happened here to the original victims, people were murdered. How we treat and punish prisoners is the measure of our civil society, it’s the test. Shame on us, and shame on them, for causing this to happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jan/02/observer-view-britains-climate-crisis-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-02T06:30:10Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Britain’s climate crisis targets | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/observer-view-britains-climate-crisis-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/observer-view-britains-climate-crisis-targets","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Britain’s climate crisis targets","bodyText":"Britain’s electricity generation went through an unfortunate phase last year. According to the UK-based website Carbon Brief, it got dirtier for the first time in years as renewable sources failed to provide sufficient power to help the nation’s economy recover from lockdown restrictions. More coal and gas had to be burned to generate electricity. This jump occurred – in part – because 2021 was notable for its low winds. Wind farm output dropped by almost 15% from 2020, despite the fact that more turbines had been installed across the nation. At the same time, nuclear power generation fell by almost 10% because of problems with ageing reactors. It is a sobering reminder that the road to limit climate change is going to be a long one, though, in this case, the news is particularly unfortunate, given that Britain is still in charge of the negotiations that followed the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year. Indeed, the nation will remain in this position of leadership until Egypt takes charge at the end of 2022, when its Cop27 summit opens in Sharm el-Sheikh. Until then, the world will be looking to Britain to set a lead and to play a major role in ensuring that the promises made in Glasgow are fulfilled. What other nations will have witnessed so far will not have made a good impression, however. The fact that the UK last year failed to clean up its power generation, one of the easiest ways to start on the business of cutting carbon emission, is bad enough. Sadly, there have been many other setbacks in the UK’s attempts to fight climate change. Another example was provided by the public accounts committee, which last month savaged the government over the failure of its green homes grant scheme in England. The programme underperformed so badly it risks damaging future efforts to deliver net zero, the committee warned. Hailed by Boris Johnson as a key plank in his green industrial revolution, the scheme was intended to help the public make their homes more energy efficient and less reliant on fossil fuel heating. This was to be done by providing grants for installing heat pumps and other equipment. A total of 600,000 homes were targeted but in the end just 47,500 were upgraded, while only a small fraction of the expected jobs were created in the process. As Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the committee, put it: “This scheme was a slam dunk fail.” Power generation and carbon-friendly housing are clearly issues that need to be tackled urgently. But they are not the only problems that lie ahead. As another government body, the Climate Change Committee, made clear last month, the UK desperately needs a strategy to reduce carbon emissions from agriculture and to review how tax policy can help deliver net zero. This last issue is particularly important because the Treasury is now under pressure to reduce VAT on gas in response to the energy crisis – at a time when it should be making it more expensive in order to discourage its use. However, the committee’s key message was even more direct: the UK must now focus on implementation rather than targets. In other words, we need action, not words, when it comes to tackling climate change in 2022 and that action should come not just from Alok Sharma, currently president of Cop26, but from all senior ministers, including Boris Johnson. Certainly, if they do not act firmly over the coming year, and provide international leadership, then the goal to limit global warming to 1.5C will be dead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/04/lviv-ukrainians-world-russian-forces-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T11:00:31Z","webTitle":"A question from Lviv to the world: are you going to leave us to face the Kremlin’s madman alone? | Sasha Dovzhyk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/04/lviv-ukrainians-world-russian-forces-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/04/lviv-ukrainians-world-russian-forces-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"A question from Lviv to the world: are you going to leave us to face the Kremlin’s madman alone?","bodyText":"I started writing this piece in an underground garage turned bomb shelter in the western Ukraine city of Lviv. Situated about 80km from the Polish border, it has not yet been shelled by the Russian military. While the air-aid sirens were going off every day during the first week of the full-scale invasion of my country, Tuesday night was the first time I bothered to take cover. I was trying to score responsibility points with my parents: they were about to go over the border to Poland and needed to see that their daughter, bent on remaining in Ukraine, was not putting herself in harm’s way. Yet the harm is all over my country. Vladimir Putin, better known in Ukraine as khuilo (“dickhead” – my people have never been known for their deference), planned to conquer this land in two days. His delusion has been exposed by a pre-written article, Offensive of Russia and the New World, which was mistakenly published by one of the main Russian news outlets on 26 February. Having failed to crush the armed forces of Ukraine with his murderous blitzkrieg, Putin is terrorising its civilian population. Thousands of civilians arrive here in Lviv every day from the east as well as the capital. They sleep on the floors in theatres and research institutions. Local businesses are transforming their operations to support the war effort. Instead of beer, a trendy brewery is filling bottles with molotov cocktails. A metallurgical plant specialising in copper cable is producing anti-tank obstacles. Teenagers are fortifying checkpoints with sandbags instead of going to school. Hundreds and hundreds of volunteers are queueing at military registration offices to sign up and join the army. And while the most vulnerable are fleeing westwards, more than 80,000 Ukrainian economic migrants, mostly men, have come back home to fight. I can relate to their sentiment, having come here from London at the beginning of February in anticipation of the big war to come, looking for a way to be of help. Whereas Lviv has been spared the artillery fire so far, my home region of Zaporizhzhia, in the east of the country, is the scene of active fighting. The Russians have been shelling the nuclear power plant there – the largest in Europe, and the source of a fifth of Ukraine’s power. Before the shelling began, peaceful residents gathered at the entrance to Enerhodar, the small town where the plant is based, to meet the invaders – a few handfuls of civilians trying to shield the world from a nuclear catastrophe with their bodies. An initial fire caused by the shelling has now been extinguished, but the Russians have seized the plant and the danger is far from over. Ukraine’s military and civil society should not be facing the Kremlin’s madman and his troops alone. It is bad enough that the international community has been looking in the other direction for eight years, since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine. It is bad enough that the world has failed to protect Ukraine as it promised when, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country gave up the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal in exchange for security assurances. At this point, the world is facing the choice of either standing in front of the Russian tanks or behind them. This is the choice that Ukrainians have been deprived of by the western appeasement strategies and inaction. Further and ever more painful sanctions, enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect civilians, halting all business with Russian companies, stopping trading in oil and gas and ramping up the military support of Ukraine will force the aggressor to negotiate a ceasefire instead of turning up to negotiations with grotesque ultimatums. I said goodbye to my parents on the seventh day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They have now crossed the border into Poland, and are about to join my husband in Germany. I am staying in Lviv to help coordinate displaced people coming from the east and reporters coming from the west. I promised to meet my family under the peaceful sky and raise a glass to Ukraine’s victory. They know that I am obsessive about keeping my promises. However, I will require an unprecedented global effort to help me with this one. Sasha Dovzhyk is special projects curator at the Ukrainian Institute London.

Media reports said work to release the water, which is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks, would begin in 2022 at the earliest and would take decades to complete. An official decision could come by the end of the month, the Kyodo news agency said, ending years of debate over what to do with the water, with other options including evaporation or the construction of more storage tanks at other sites. The government, however, has long indicated it prefers the option of releasing it into the nearby Pacific, despite opposition from local fishermen who say it will undo years of work rebuilding their industry’s reputation since the plant was wrecked by a huge tsunami in March 2011. In response, the government has said it will promote Fukushima produce and address concerns among fishermen that consumers will shun their seafood once the water is released. Environmental groups also oppose the move, while neighbouring South Korea, which still bans seafood imports from the region, has repeatedly voiced concern, claiming that discharging the water represented a ”grave threat” to the marine environment. Pressure to decide the water’s fate has been building as storage space on the nuclear plant site runs out, with the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), estimating all of the available tanks will be full by the summer of 2022. As of last month, 1.23m tonnes of water, which becomes contaminated when it mixes with water used to prevent the three damaged reactor cores from melting, were being stored in 1,044 tanks, with the amount of waste water increasing by 170 tonnes a day. Tepco’s Advanced Liquid Processing System removes highly radioactive substances from the water but the system is unable to filter out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that nuclear power plants routinely dilute and dump along with water into the ocean. A panel of experts advising the government said earlier this year that releasing the water was among the most “realistic options”. Experts say tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is only harmful to humans in very large doses, while the International Atomic Energy Agency says it is possible to dilute filtered waste water with seawater before it is released into the ocean. The water at Fukushima Daiichi will be diluted inside the plant before it is released so that it is 40 times less concentrated, with the whole process taking 30 years, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. Hiroshi Kishi, president of a nationwide federation of fisheries cooperatives, voiced opposition to the move in a meeting with the chief cabinet secretary, Katsunobu Kato, this week. Kato told reporters that a decision on the water “should be made quickly” to avoid further delays in decommissioning the plant – a costly, complex operation that is expected to take around 40 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/aug/13/australia-news-live-nationals-conference-jobs-summit-nuclear-power-monkeypox-vaccinations-meningococcal-city2surf-rail-strike-teachers-climate-rally-gas-energy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T06:43:35Z","webTitle":"At least 89 Covid deaths; Littleproud tells Nationals he’ll bring pragmatic policies to jobs summit – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/13/australia-news-live-nationals-conference-jobs-summit-nuclear-power-monkeypox-vaccinations-meningococcal-city2surf-rail-strike-teachers-climate-rally-gas-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/13/australia-news-live-nationals-conference-jobs-summit-nuclear-power-monkeypox-vaccinations-meningococcal-city2surf-rail-strike-teachers-climate-rally-gas-energy","fields":{"headline":"At least 89 Covid deaths; Littleproud tells Nationals he’ll bring pragmatic policies to jobs summit – as it happened","bodyText":"We will close this blog now.

Internationally, the British-Indian author Sir Salman Rushdie was stabbed on stage at a literary event in New York. The Booker prize winner lived for years in hiding after a fatwa was issued against him by the then leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, over his 1988 book The Satanic Verses, which some Muslims regard as blasphemous. Rushdie remains in hospital, with reports he may lose one eye; the nerves in his arm were severed; and his liver was stabbed and damaged. The UN has warned of a “grave crisis” resulting from shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, rebuked Amnesty International for a report that accused the Ukrainian military of endangering civilians.

Socialite Lillian Frank remembered as a flamboyant personality who used her social standing for good The Melbourne socialite Lillian Frank has been remembered as a flamboyant personality who used her social standing for good, after her death aged 92. The icon of Melbourne’s social scene, hairdresser and tireless charity worker died on Friday night. Frank’s daughter Jackie Frank paid tribute to the social doyenne, saying “last night we lost the heart and soul of our family”. “She lived life to the max, without any regrets and was forever grateful,” she wrote on Instagram. “She saw things through rose-coloured glasses. No matter what adversity she had to face, and there were many, she saw the good in everyone and everything. “Forever trying to make a difference in the world. She used her flamboyant personality and social standing for good, raising millions and millions for charity.” She said of the longtime Toorak hair salon owner: “To us she was mum, to my kids nani and the most spectacular selfless human being in the world with the biggest heart. “We (heart) you but a piece of our hearts will be broken forever. #RIP Lillian.” The Victoria Racing Club paid tribute to Frank, who was a longtime judge of Myer Fashions on the Field and attended her first Melbourne Cup in the 1960s. “Lillian left an indelible mark on the Melbourne Cup Carnival where she attended nearly every year for 50 years,” chairman Neil Wilson said. “Her impeccable sense of style and vibrant personality helped elevate the VRC’s Fashions on the Field competition to one of the most popular and prestigious outdoor fashion events in Australia, if not the world.” The club was celebrating 60 years of Fashions on the Field in 2022, and would not be the enduring competition it had become without Frank’s influence, Wilson said. Australian former Taliban prisoner returns to Afghanistan The Australian teacher formerly known as Timothy Weeks, who was a prisoner of the Taliban for more than three years before a prisoner swap was engineered for his release in 2019, has returned to Afghanistan, praising Taliban rule of the country, a year after the terror group violently seized power. “I’m … coming to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, who I have stood behind,” he said. “I spent three and a half years with Taliban soldiers, and I saw these people in a light that nobody else has been able to do.” Three convicted terrorists, senior members of the Haqqani network, were released in exchange for his freedom. The educator has converted to Islam and is now known as Jibrael Umar. He landed at Kabul airport on Friday Afghanistan time. Umar was welcomed by the Taliban. But his return was condemned by members of the Afghan-Australian community. What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

The Northern Territory has reported 171 new Covid cases in the 24 hours to 4pm yesterday, bringing the number of active cases to 1,228. There are currently 32 people in hospital. The territory has seen a total of 59 Covid-related deaths throughout the pandemic. Millenial and Gen Z voters a significant bloc in Victorian state election – analysis Much has been made about voters shifting away from the major parties and towards independents and Greens candidates. But a lot of the analysis from this year’s federal election didn’t consider one important aspect: it was the first in which baby boomers were outnumbered by Millennial and Gen Z voters. According to the 2021 census, Millennials, aged 25-39, are neck and neck with the baby boomers as the largest generational group in Australia, each representing about 21% of the Australian population. A further 18% of the population are members of generation Z (10-24 years old). This is a significant voting bloc who have come of age at a time of economic uncertainty – either the global financial crisis or the Covid pandemic – growing inequality and an increase in extreme weather events, including bushfires and floods. This is a demographic that is being closely watched in Victoria as the state heads to the polls in November.

It seats a few thousand people and it’s a covered amphitheatre and I was just settling into my seat around 10.45am, a few minutes beforehand. We knew this was going to be a very popular event, he is a very well-known speaker, author, novelist and proponent of human rights. One of the hosts for the event, one of the staff members of the Chautauqua Institution was describing the program and shortly after he started talking, a man rushed onto the stage and repeatedly and viciously stabbed Salman Rushdie. And there were just gasps of shock from the audience, we were all sitting down, many of us stood up. A few courageous and compassionate people went up the stage and it was just a really horrible act of intolerance and violence to witness. You can follow live updates about Rushdie here: Western Australian health authorities have reported 2,094 new Covid-19 cases to 6pm last night. There are currently 14,677 active cases in the state and 304 people in hospital.

Littleproud outlined his vision for the Nationals to the party faithful gathered in Canberra for a federal council meeting. It’s disappointing that regional Australia wasn’t even thought of. We were an afterthought and it’s important regional Australia has a voice there. We want to prosecute our case with some pragmatic solutions. The fact that regional Australia wasn’t even invited just goes to show that this stunt was all aimed at just sending the symbolic messages to the electorate.” Littleproud said rebuilding trust with women was also a top priority, but rejected quotas for his party. I don’t believe in quotas. I believe in creating the environment for women to come forward. We’ll be looking to identify female candidates in new seats and those seats that we will have retiring members in and we’ll start that process as part of this journey in being open and honest, but we want to be genuine about this. Littleproud said pensioners and veterans should be able to work more without their payments being impacted as a reward for their service to the nation. “This is a payback to them,” he said. The party will also fight for a visa to fast-track permanent residency for workers in rural and regional communities. We believe that it needs now to go forward and to incentivise those migrants that come to regional Australia. We need to give them the incentive of becoming residents and citizens of this great country. This is an opportunity to grow regional Australia to make sure the next generation are out there and taking us to our full potential. Littleproud said the program of paying the university debt of healthcare workers in the regions should be extended to other graduates in areas experiencing skills shortages. The federal government will hold its jobs and skills summit in Canberra over the first two days in September. Labor invited the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, to attend, or a Coalition member in his place, but the Liberal party turned down the offer. It brings the total number of active cases in the state up to 11,211. There are 275 people in hospital. Lillian Frank, a Melbourne socialite and philanthropist, has died aged 92. Frank will be remembered as an icon of Melbourne’s social scene, hairdresser and tireless charity worker. Frank’s daughter Jackie announced the news on social media, saying “we lost the heart and soul of our family” on Friday night. Frank was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for service to the community in 1991, and a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1977 for her philanthropic work. There are currently 507 people hospitalised in the state. Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, has vowed to keep advocating for a Chinese-born Australian journalist detained in China for two years on espionage charges. AAP has the story: Cheng Lei, a one-time high-profile presenter on China Global Television Network, was detained in Beijing in August 2020 and later formally arrested. In March, the 46-year-old faced a closed trial in Beijing on charges of illegally supplying state secrets overseas. Australia’s ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher, was barred from attending the court hearing and China has not provided details of its outcome. Senator Wong said in a statement: Our thoughts today are with Ms Cheng’s family, including her two young children, with whom she has had no contact since she was detained. Since Ms Cheng was detained in August 2020, the Australian government has consistently called for basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment to be met, in accordance with international norms. We will continue to support Ms Cheng and her family, and to advocate for Ms Cheng’s interests and wellbeing. The comments come after the foreign minister raised Cheng’s case with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Bali last month. In June, the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said that when cases of Australians detained in China involved national security they usually were not conducted openly, and urged Australia to respect China’s legal process. Victoria has recorded 22 deaths from Covid in the last reporting period, and 4,300 new cases. There are 543 people in hospital with 31 in ICU. Former Liberal staffer criticises response to Broderick report AAP reports: A former New South Wales Liberal staffer who raised issues of sexual misconduct is sceptical any structural change in breaking a misogynistic and toxic workplace culture in NSW parliament will occur, after an independent report by former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick was handed down this week. Dhanya Mani, an advocate for sexual assault survivors, has alleged she was sexually assaulted by a male Liberal staffer between 2014 and 2015 when she was working in the parliament. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said he would “absolutely” try to weed out people in the parliament behaving poorly. “If you are involved in this behaviour, you should leave immediately,” he said. The opposition leader, Chris Minns, said the review painted a “dark picture” and the response needed to be bipartisan. “It’s my view that neither side or any side in politics comes to this issue with clean hands,” he said. Mani accused the major parties of not reaching out to survivors in responding to the report: Given that there wasn’t any consultation with survivors, it feels like it’s quite a tokenistic reply to that report from both sides [Liberals and Labor] … It’s really staggering and disappointing that neither [party] leader bothered to reach out to survivors. In June, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the opposition leader, Chris Minns, acknowledged Mani by name as a sexual assault survivor in their response to the NSW ministerial offices respectful workplace policy. The Broderick report found sexual harassment and bullying were rife in the parliament. It said five people had reported an attempted or realised sexual assault, while more than one in four experienced bullying in the past five years, with several unnamed offices identified as “hotspots” for the behaviour. More than two-thirds of respondents, the report said, noted sexual harassment was perpetrated by someone at a more senior level. Mani is the only survivor on the NSW parliament advisory group on bullying, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct established in March 2021 and comprised of politicians and parliamentary staff. Her membership came about after lobbying efforts by Greens MP Jenny Leong and after meeting with former premier Gladys Berejiklian. Leong on Friday criticised the oldest parliament in Australia as an exclusionary space: Parliament is a toxic, sexist and at many times unsafe workplace – nobody inside the institution needed this report to know this. The state recorded 35 deaths in the last 24 hours. There are currently 2,107 people in hospital with Covid-19. The Australian Capital Territory has recorded 322 new Covid cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the current number of active cases to 2,749. One person lost their life. There are currently 141 people in hospital with the virus in the territory. Restarting life for the third time after fall of Kabul This is an extraordinary and moving story written by Noor M Ramazan, who fled Kabul with his wife, Masuma, and two children a year ago and is now settled in Melbourne. He “had to restart from zero for the third time in my life”. He writes: I had to go through many other dead-end jobs in my childhood when Taliban took over my hometown Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998. I had to shine shoes and sell water, cigarettes, chewing gum and cherry juice on the streets to help my family have food on the table. OK. Let’s do it for the third time. At least this is Australia and I hope no one will harass or bully me as they did on the streets when I was a child … We were taught from childhood to love our country. Country is mother. We love our country as much as our mother. You are safe as long as you are in your mother’s arms. You are free and nothing bad can threaten you. Because mother takes care of you with all her might. But if something happen to this mother, you will become an orphan and no one cares about you. Just like us, the Afghan people, who are like helpless children whose mother has fallen to her knees due to countless wounds … If you are very lucky like me, another kind of mother comes and holds your hand and saves you from being trampled and crushed. She keeps you in her arms and her vast heart and adopts you as a child. Like what Australia did to us. Australia saved us. We owe our lives to Australia. Australia accommodated us in its sky-sized arms and gave us freedom and security. It’s well worth your time as a Saturday morning long read. Fair warning: tackle with tissues. Doctors resisting calls for Covid-19 antiviral treatments to be sold over the counter have accused pharmacists of creating a false narrative for commercial reasons, AAP reports. The Australian Pharmacy Guild this week publicly petitioned the federal government for the right to dispense the medications without a prescription, citing a national shortage of general practitioners. While two oral antivirals are available in Australia and early treatment is considered critical to lessen the effects of the virus, access to them is restricted. People aged over 70 and those over 50 at risk of severe disease are eligible following consultation with a doctor or nurse. Yet the guild believes community pharmacists should be able to supply the treatments over the counter to speed up access upon infection. The immediate reaction to the idea from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners was around concern over patient safety. The RACGP president, Dr Karen Price, said bypassing the prescription process would be “a recipe for disaster”. She said the guild’s claims of wait-time blowouts when visiting doctors, and their impact on the narrow window to use antiviral medications, were unfounded and misleading. Price said in a statement: The Pharmacy Guild, which is the body representing pharmacy business owners, needs to stop muddying the message on access for patients. Patients need to understand the urgency of contacting their GP when they test positive for Covid-19 and not be distracted by the Pharmacy Guild’s efforts to push their own agenda. We have telehealth infrastructure in place to make sure patients can access these medicines while isolating, including patient rebates for longer telephone consultations. We are also calling for these antivirals to be added to the doctor’s bag in the event access to a pharmacy is problematic in emergency situations or for rural and remote locations. Doctors were best placed to safely prescribe treatments because they knew their patients, their health histories and what medications they were on, Price added. The Pharmacy Guild president, Trent Twomey, said on Thursday that GP wait times were growing unacceptably. In NSW, that meant an average of 4.17 days to see a family doctor and in Victoria, 3.33 days. At the same time, antivirals needed to commence within five days of the onset of virus symptoms, Twomey said. The Nationals are holding a federal council meeting in Canberra today, the first since David Littleproud took over party leadership and since the coalition’s federal election loss. AAP has the story: Nationals federal president Kay Hull says the party needs to reset and embrace women to remain the nation’s most diverse political organisation. In the first address of the meeting, Hull spoke of the importance of women in politics and the contribution they made to key regional industries, including agriculture: We need to be resetting, ensuring we are embracing particularly the women of our nation. They are part of our heartland ... we stand as one of the few parties that have such a proud track record. I think there are many areas that we need to embrace and further reset. Analysis of the coalition’s election defeat showed women deserted the Liberal Party in droves, with a number of women - the teal independents - winning city seats from the party. They strongly campaigned on climate change action and integrity. Littleproud is expected to talk about his priorities for the upcoming jobs summit and the review into nuclear power. He told AAP: We are going to have to face up to some of the challenges we’ve got. We retained all of our seats at the election, but you only have to look at the numbers to see that women left us so we have to go out and talk to them.” Littleproud, deputy leader Perin Davey and leader of the Nationals in the Senate Bridget McKenzie will give speeches at Saturday’s conference. Littleproud was elected leader in May, emerging as the winner of a three-way contest with ousted leader Barnaby Joyce and former minister Darren Chester. The party’s federal director Jonathan Hawkes is stepping down after three years in the top administrative job. White whale calf seen off NSW coast There’s one newborn hogging all the attention off the NSW coast – a southern right whale calf born whiter than usual, AAP reports: The calf and its mother are resting up before they head south to Antarctica. Government conservationists are urging people to keep their distance from the mum and new bub spotted off the state’s south coast. National Parks and Wildlife Service’s Andrew Marshall said it was rare to see a virtually white calf, though the parks office says it is more of a brindle colour: Southern right whales are mostly very dark, although some have splashes of white called a blaze. Its white areas will darken to grey as it ages. It’s one of around one-in-30 southern right whale calves born with brindle colouring. The calf’s colouring is related to genetics. The mother shows pale grey areas indicating she has a recessive brindle gene. A southern right whale calf needs 300 litres of milk a day to get to the weight needed to make the 5,000km trip south. It’s illegal for a vessel to go within 300 metres of a nursing whale mother and calf, that includes people on surfboards, paddleboards and kayaks. Drones have to stay 100 metres above the whales. Asked about concerns that the voice to parliament would result in a “talk-fest without tangible issues”, Dreyfus responds: I think this can only add to the range of issues we need to make to improve Indigenous health, housing, to deal with the social problems that [Country Liberal party] senator [Jacinta] Price is talking about. The voice is to elevate to constitutional level the possibility of receiving representations, receiving suggestions from our Indigenous people on measures we need to take that are about them. We have not had that in the past. I’m very much looking forward to this referendum succeeding so there will be at the constitutional level, a voice to parliament. I don’t think in any sense the two things are inconsistent. I accept Senator Price’s concerns about what needs to be done for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders across Australia, but I think the measures we need to take can only be improved if we listen to a voice of Indigenous people. Mark Dreyfus says he’s pleased with progress on Indigenous voice Dreyfus is asked about the referendum about constitutional change to recognise Indigenous Australians with a voice to parliament. He says: I think in coming months you will see careful building of the community consensus we will need to make this referendum successful. I’ve been pleased to hear from the leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, from the shadow attorney general, that they are keeping the door open. That is appropriate. I’m pleased to hear so many people making constructive contributions, to hear a number of constitutional lawyers putting to rest today this incorrect notion that it might be veto or a that it might be a third chamber. We need to … build the community consensus that we need to accept that this is the way in which we can recognise our Indigenous people in our constitution. Mark Dreyfus says attorneys general want to address responses to sexual violence Dreyfus said the meeting that took place between the attorneys general was the first face-to-face meeting in two and a half years. We will be meeting more regularly … we plan to get together four times a year and this is a very important item on our agenda. We’ve also agreed to do more work on criminal justice system responses to sexual violence. This is responding to something that Grace Tame raised with attorneys general last year and I’m very pleased to see that tremendous co-operation in the room yesterday, from Liberal and Labor attorneys general agreeing to work together nationally to keep women and children safe, to work on family violence, to work on measures against sexual violence. Attorneys general agree on some draft principles to address coercive control Mark Dreyfus, the attorney general of Australia, is speaking to the ABC about coercive control. He says he and the attorneys general of jurisdictions around Australia have agreed on some draft national principles to address coercive control as an issue: We’re going to be consulting … in coming months, trying to get to some nationally agreed standard on how to deal with this. Coercive control is, of course, a pattern of behaviour – it might be not necessarily involving violence – where the perpetrators seeks to establish control over the victim. Nick Kyrgios’s winning streak comes to an end In sport, Nick Kyrgios’s North American winning streak has come to an end with a defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in the quarter-finals of the National Bank Open in Montreal. The Australian had won 15 of his last 16 matches. The full story is here: Victorian First Nations dispute over Phillip Island property donation A property donated by the family of renowned satirist and comedian John Clarke has become embroiled in a long-running dispute between two First Nations groups in Victoria. The land on Phillip Island, about 120km south-east of Melbourne, was donated by Clarke’s widow, Helen McDonald, to conservation group Trust for Nature after his death in 2017. Trust for Nature intends to transfer the eight-hectare property to the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation. However, a local traditional owner has demanded that be halted. While the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation is the registered local Aboriginal party, the area involves land on which members of the Boonwurrung people is seeking native title via the federal court.

A child from the NSW north coast may be the third person linked to the recent Splendour In The Grass festival to contract meningococcal disease, AAP reports. It follows the death on August 4 of a Sydney man in his 40s, who also developed meningococcal disease after attending the festival. NSW Health has urged anyone who attended Splendour In The Grass - which took place from July 21-24 at the North Byron Parklands - to be alert. Anyone showing symptoms - which can include a red or purple rash, fever, headache, stiffness, light sensitivity, nausea, diarrhoea, drowsiness and confusion - is urged to contact a doctor immediately. The disease, which is caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, is uncommon but can be fatal. Authorities warn it can develop very quickly and kill within hours. Three people have died of meningococcal disease this year: a Northern Territory man in his 30s died on Friday, while a two-year-old died in rural South Australia in July. Health authorities in the NT said the man had undertaken no recent interstate or international travel. Welcome to another Saturday edition of the live news blog.

Here’s what making news: The Nationals will hold their first major meeting today since the coalition’s federal election loss. The federal council meeting, in Canberra, will also be the first since David Littleproud took over party leadership. The energy ministers of New South Wales and Victoria have criticised gas companies for exporting Australian resources overseas, claiming their pursuit of profits led to the recent energy crisis. The monkeypox vaccine has arrived in Australia and the rollout has commenced in Victoria, with jabs being given to certain eligible groups while supplies are limited. In New South Wales, transport officers will today refuse to issue fines, part of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union’s rolling strike action in an attempt to secure crucial safety commitments. The Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas has dismissed the remaining members of its international advisory council, months after four independent directors walked out en masse.

Like notable 19th-century women travellers such as Isabella Bird Bishop, when at last released from a cage of domestic duty Murphy travelled, riding through the cold, snowy winter of 1962-63. She went armed with a .25 pistol and basic instruction from the County Waterford gardai on how to use it, which she did to confront wolves and thieves, and also with the maps and compass through which she had explored the planet in her imagination since childhood. Most of all she had a tolerance for hardship (her total budget was £64) and a curiosity about everyday elsewheres, which she kept through half a century of advancing by bike, foot, mule and cart (she never drove a car) on and off road across four continents. Murphy, who has died aged 90, wrote 26 books, many in the diary style of Full Tilt, approaching each day, person and place, fresh on the page as she had experienced it. That directness appealed to readers, along with Murphy’s viewpoint, which was novel because of her background: she was a voracious reader but with little formal education and, being from the Irish countryside, outside those higher levels of the class structure that dominated travel writing. Rural poverty around the globe was no surprise to Murphy, who had attended a village primary school with barefoot, hungry classmates, and knew families dying of tuberculosis. She arrived alone at each destination without social introductions, was shy at home but en route talked with anyone who responded, and, in life as well as writing, downplayed risks and tribulations – from injury, sickness and assault to dirt and nothing for supper. Aged 10, she had realised on riding her first bike that simple pedal power might one day take her to India, and on the way there she discovered how each day’s whizz of the wheels of her Armstrong Cadet cycle, Roz (short for Rozinante, Don Quixote’s horse), carried her forward to kind strangers’ hospitality. Coming fast down a mountain road always thrilled her; touring the Balkans in her 70s, she was clocked descending at 65mph by a military patrol and reproved for not applying her brakes. Murphy’s attitude to gender and social norms was also uncommon at the time. Tall, deep-voiced, muscled, practical and with a decisiveness accrued from constant solo choices, she was often taken for a man by other societies, and occasionally romanticised the restricted roles of those societies’ womenfolk, which she would never have put up with herself. She was sure of her own life’s direction, if uncertain of its meanderings. She never intended to marry, but once able to support herself through writing, did want a child. Her daughter, Rachel, deliberately conceived with Terence de Vere White, the literary editor of the Irish Times, was born in 1968, and her mother raised her alone, never naming the father publicly until after his death in 1994. Rachel had her fifth birthday in Kodagu (then called Coorg), south-west India, on the first of her journeys with her mother; they later went to Baltistan, Peru, Madagascar and Cameroon. Until Rachel reached puberty, when the people they met travelling began to regard her as an adult who shared a sealed bubble of foreignness with her mother, she was an asset, a connection to families, though also, sometimes, a distraction, interrupting Murphy’s communion with the deep, pre-modern silence of the Himalayas or Andes. Their relationship could be difficult, but it lasted, and in time Murphy, Rachel, and Rachel’s daughters, Rose, Clodagh and Zea, all dossed down together on a Cuban beach for a three-generation trip on the usual shoestring, in 2005. Murphy’s own hard family situation had formed her, she wrote in Wheels Within Wheels (1979). Her parents went from Dublin to Lismore in Waterford when her father, Fergus Murphy, was appointed county librarian. Soon after Dervla’s birth, her mother, Kathleen, contracted a rare rheumatoid arthritis that crippled her: perhaps in compensation she nurtured Dervla’s daring, giving her that first bike despite money always being short. But, aged 14, Dervla was withdrawn from the Ursuline convent boarding school in Waterford to serve as Kathleen’s carer for 16 years. Kathleen encouraged her brief bike jaunts to England and Europe, though Dervla had to return from each few weeks’ freedom to burdensome duty. Fergus died in 1961 and Kathleen the following year, leaving Murphy with a house, books (her lifetime collection grew to 9,000), strong convictions about political and social injustice, and her freedom. After Full Tilt, based on diaries published only because of a chance meeting in Delhi with Penelope Chetwode, John Betjeman’s wife, came Tibetan Foothold (1966) and The Waiting Land (1967), which grew out of work with Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal. From the late 1970s, the purpose of her travels shifted to inquiring into the effects of recent history on people and places, beginning with A Place Apart (1978), a bike ride round Northern Ireland, then at an implacable stage of its Troubles. On a Greyhound bus crossing the US, she passed close to Three Mile Island, the site in 1979 of the US’s worst nuclear power accident, which inspired Nuclear Stakes, Race to the Finish (1982), the first of the books in which her politics mattered more than the travelling, through Kenya and Zimbabwe during the Aids epidemic, Romania after its revolution, Rwanda after genocide, the Balkans after a decade of wars. These culminated with an unfinished trilogy on Palestinian territorial fragments – Gaza Strip, West Bank, Jordanian camps – researched as ever over coffee in crowded tenements or tea on tent floors. She was strongly for socialism, and against almost everything else, especially mass tourism. A hip replacement after a fall in Jerusalem, aged almost 80, plus arthritis and emphysema, finally confined Murphy to her austere base in Lismore, the remnant of a 17th-century cattle market plus eccentric outbuildings, where she organised a travel-writing festival and received pilgrims, including Michael Palin, visiting for a television documentary, Who Is Dervla Murphy?, in 2016. She asked him to join her daily skinny dip in the River Blackwater. Her daughter and granddaughters survive her. • Dervla Murphy, traveller and writer, born 28 November 1931; died 22 May 2022"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-shoots-down-own-drone-over-capital-zelenskiy-speaks-at-the-hague","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T17:41:27Z","webTitle":"Wagner head says forces to leave Bakhmut next week – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-shoots-down-own-drone-over-capital-zelenskiy-speaks-at-the-hague","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-shoots-down-own-drone-over-capital-zelenskiy-speaks-at-the-hague","fields":{"headline":"Wagner head says forces to leave Bakhmut next week – as it happened","bodyText":"The time is now approaching 9pm in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital on a day where the leader of Russia’s Wagner group has threatened to withdraw from Bakhmut in an ongoing row with the Kremlin. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the mercenary force, said in a sudden and dramatic announcement on Friday that his forces would leave Bakhmut, which they have been trying to capture since last summer. Prigozhin said they would pull back on 10 May – ending their involvement in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies. He asked defence chiefs to insert regular army troops in their place. Earlier Prigozhin released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses, personally blaming top defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine. Prigozhin’s expletives were bleeped out in the video published by his press service, in which he yelled “We have a 70% shortage of ammunition. Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the ******* ammunition?”. The reference to defence minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of general staff Valery Gerasimov appeared to reignite the simmering feud between Prigozhin and the Russian establishment forces. In a coded response, defence minister Sergei Shoigu has carried out an inspection of troop readiness for forces that are engaged in the war against Ukraine. Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. The Russian imposed governor Yevgeny Balitsky announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area. It is believed that about 70,000 civilians could be taken away from the area. “In the past few days, the enemy has stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline,” Balitsky said. “I have therefore made a decision to evacuate first of all children and parents, elderly people, disabled people and hospital patients.” It is believed that Russia is bringing Wagner forces from along the frontline to Bakhmut, according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar. She said that Russia wanted to capture the city before the victory day holiday on 9 May. Residents in Kherson are readying themselves ahead of a 56-hour curfew due to begin on Friday evening. The violence in the oblast has intensified this week, with 23 people killed by Russian strikes on Wednesday. Ukraine’s air force said it downed one of its own drones after it lost control over Kyiv on Thursday. Andriy Yermak, Ukraine presidential chief of staff, initially said an enemy drone that had been shot down. But the air force later clarified it was Ukrainian and had been destroyed to avoid “undesirable circumstances”. No casualties were reported. The White House has dismissed as “ludicrous” claims by Russia that Washington orchestrated drone strikes on Moscow, saying the US was not involved in the incident and accusing Russia of lying. National security council spokesman John Kirby said: “One thing I can tell you for certain is that the US did not have any involvement with this incident, contrary to [Vladimir Putin spokesman] Mr Peskov’s lies, and that’s just what they are: lies.” Earlier, Dmitry Peskov said: “Decisions about such terrorist attacks are taken in Washington” and that Kyiv “just implements these decisions”. Finnish power utility Fortum has formally notified the Kremlin that it strongly objects to what it said was Russia’s “unlawful” seizure of its subsidiary in the country. In his regular morning press conference, Kremlin spokesperson Peskov responded by saying the seizure was in accordance with Russian legislation. Bill Clinton has said that he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 – three years before he took Crimea – that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said … ‘I don’t agree with it. And I do not support it. And I am not bound by it.’ And I knew from that day forward it was just a matter of time.” Video footage has emerged overnight of a scuffle between a Ukrainian delegate and a Russian delegate during a gathering of Black Sea nations in the Turkish capital Ankara. The footage shows the Russian delegations secretary, Valery Stavitsky, snatching a Ukrainian flag out of the hands of his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksandr Marikovski, who unfurled the flag behind another Russian delegate who was mid-interview at the parliamentary assembly of the Black Sea economic cooperation group in Turkey. Russian forces in Ukraine are so degraded they cannot mount any significant offensive moves and are focused for now on consolidating control of occupied territory, the US intelligence chief said. Avril Haines said Putin’s strategy is likely to be to prolong the conflict until western support for Kyiv wanes. Putin must be brought to justice for his war in Ukraine, Zelenskiy said on Thursday during a visit to The Hague, where the international criminal court (ICC) is based. “We all want to see a different Vladimir here in the Hague, the one who deserves to be sanctioned for his criminal actions here, in the capital of international law,” Zelenskiy said in a speech. “I’m sure we will see that happen when we win,” he said, adding: “Whoever brings war must receive judgment.” That’s all for today. Thank you for following along. Another set of talks about the Black Sea grain deal has ended in deadlock, after Turkey, Russia, Ukraine and the UN did not find an agreement over new ships able to export grain. The UN deputy spokesperson, Farhan Haq, said the daily inspections of previously authorised ships would continue. The current agreement is due to end on 18 May. Russia has issued a list of demands it wants to be met for the agreement to continue, which was struck last year to alleviate the global food crisis caused by buildups of grain in Ukraine. Here’s a selection of photographs from Ukraine today. The all-clear from air raid alerts has now been given in central Ukraine, the Ukrainian Euromaidan Press news website has reported. Warnings are still in place for eastern Ukraine, including Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv. Loud explosions were reported in the Donetsk oblast in the last hour after sirens were sounded. Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and most Ukrainian regions announced air alerts on Friday, officials said. The number of air alerts has risen sharply in recent days, and Kyiv alone has issued six alerts in the last three days warning of Russian attacks. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has discussed preparations for the Victory Day parade on 9 May in a meeting with his Security Council, the RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. Moscow has said the parade will go ahead as planned despite its assertion that Ukraine tried to kill Putin in a drone attack against the Kremlin in the early hours of Wednesday. Kyiv has denied any involvement in the incident. More on the evacuation from Zaporizhzhia. We have quotes from the Russian head of the occupied-region confirming the evacuation. Yevgeny Balitsky cited an increased shelling of villages and towns near the frontline. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports him writing on social media: “In the past few days, the enemy has stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline. “I have therefore made a decision to evacuate first of all children and parents, elderly people, disabled people and hospital patients. “There will be a temporary evacuation” This includes the town of Enerhodar, which is where the region’s nuclear power station, the biggest in Europe, is. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that the plan to evacuate civilians from near the frontline in occupied Zaporizhzhia involves moving 70,000 people. It quotes Andriy Kozenko, a Russian-imposed minister for the economy in the occupied Ukrainian territory which Russia has claimed to annex, saying: In general, a total of about 70,000 people are expected to be relocated. We are still saying that there are priority categories – these are children, families with children. To date, relocation has already begun in the Polohivskyi district, they are moving to the city of Berdiansk. This figure is already about 500. There are collection points. Tass reports that “the movement of residents from the settlements shelled by the Ukrainian military in the Zaporizhzhia region is voluntary, the authorities of the region said.” Ukrane has repeatedly accused Russia of forcibly deporting children, a claim which Russia has denied. The international criminal court in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin and children’s ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova over the forced deportation of children. In what seemed like a coded response to the criticism from the Wagner group founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, earlier today [see 9.59am], the Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has carried out an inspection of troop readiness. Tass reports a statement from the ministry: The minister of defence of the Russian Federation, general of the army Sergei Shoigu, in the southern military district, inspected the readiness of military equipment and weapons sent to the units of the armed forces of the Russian Federation in the areas of the special military operation to carry out tasks for their intended purpose. “Special military operation” has been Russia’s preferred official term for its invasion of Ukraine and claim to annex four of Ukraine’s regions that Russian forces partially occupy. Ukraine’s defence ministry has found the time to cut a social media video thanking the UK for its assistance during the war, on the eve of the coronation of King Charles III. Soundtracked by The Clash’s London Calling, the clip shows Ukrainian service personnel using UK-supplied weapons, and also features clips of Volodymyr Zelenskiy meeting King Charles, the former prime minister Boris Johnson, the current British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, as well as British forces training Ukrainian soldiers. The Russian-imposed governor of Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, has said on Friday he had ordered the evacuation of villages close to the frontline with Ukrainian forces there, saying that Ukrainian shelling had intensified in recent days. Reuters notes that a widely expected Ukrainian spring counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion is viewed as likely to take in the Zaporizhzhia region, about 80% of which is held by Russian forces. Late last year the Russian Federation claimed to have annexed the whole Zaporizhzhia region, along with three other partly occupied regions. Russia’s ambassador has been summoned to the Polish foreign ministry and handed a protest note regarding a statement of the former ombudsman for children of Russia, Pavel Astakhov, calling for the murder of the Polish ambassador, a Polish foreign ministry spokesperson has said. The row has been rumbling for days since Astakhov said on Russian TV that he was surprised the Polish ambassador to Russia was yet to be found in the river Moskva in retaliation for a protest last year in which Russia’s ambassador to Poland was covered in red paint. The French senate’s website was offline on Friday after pro-Russian hackers claimed to have taken it down, in the latest cyberattack since Russia invaded Ukraine last year. “Access to the site has been disrupted since this morning,” the upper house of parliament said on Twitter shortly before midday according to Agence France-Presse, saying a team was busy fixing the problem. A group calling itself NoName on Telegram claimed responsibility, saying it had acted because “France is working with Ukraine on a new ‘aid’ package which may include weapons”. The same group said it had taken the website of France’s lower-house National Assembly offline for several hours in March. It also claimed it was behind the disruption of Canadian government websites last month as the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, visited the country. Russia is bringing Wagner mercenary fighters from along the frontline to Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian deputy defence minister. Hanna Maliar told Ukrainian television that Moscow wanted to capture the city in time for the victory day holiday on 9 May. It comes on the same day that the head of Wagner has threatened to pull its forces out of the battle-scarred Ukrainian city. “The Russians are inclined towards symbolism and their key historic myth is May 9 and they really have set the objective of taking control of Bakhmut by this date,” Maliar said. “We are now seeing them pulling [fighters] from the entire offensive line where the Wagner fighters were, they are pulling [them] to the Bakhmut direction,” she said, according to Reuters. Bahrain’s foreign minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani has visited Ukraine, the first visit by a foreign minister from the gulf state to Ukraine since its formal independence from Russia in 1992. Zelenskiy said: “I am grateful to Bahrain for its unwavering support of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty amid resisting full-scale Russian aggression.” Residents of the key southern Ukrainian city of Kherson are stocking up on food and water after another night of heavy Russian shelling and before an announced 56-hour curfew due to begin on Friday evening. A number said they planned to stay indoors before the curfew and planned closure of the city, adding that they had slept in their clothes or gone to shelters because of the intensity of the Russian attack. Others said they had sent some family outside the city or moved to safer locations further from the river, as they said they were anticipating “something big” over the coming days as Ukrainian forces also stepped up their shelling of Russian positions. The violence in Kherson has increased markedly this week, with 23 people killed by Russian strikes in the region on Wednesday, including a deadly bombardment of a supermarket that killed eight people.

The city’s council confirmed her as Nevara Yelyzaveta Jonivna, and said she died a few months short of her 17th birthday. “Lisa was a fragile girl, quiet and very modest. She was not only an excellent student, but also a friendly and kind soul who could always cheer up her friends and teachers,” a statement posted on Telegram said. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russia’s Wagner group mercenary force, said in a sudden and dramatic announcement on Friday that his forces would leave the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that they have been trying to capture since last summer.

The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that the Ilsky oil refinery in the Krasnodar region of Russia has been attacked by a drone or drones for the second consecutive day. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said “any self-respecting country” would refrain from speaking to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy following the apparent drone attack on the Kremlin. The White House has dismissed as “ludicrous” claims by Russia that Washington orchestrated drone strikes on Moscow, saying the US was not involved in the incident and accusing Russia of lying. National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, said: “One thing I can tell you for certain is that the US did not have any involvement with this incident, contrary to [Vladimir Putin spokesman] Mr Peskov’s lies, and that’s just what they are: lies.” Earlier, Dmitry Peskov said: “Decisions about such terrorist attacks are taken in Washington” and that Kyiv “just implements these decisions”. Finnish power utility Fortum has formally notified the Kremlin that it strongly objects to what it said was Russia’s “unlawful” seizure of its subsidiary in the country. In his regular morning press conference, the Kremlin spokesperson, Peskov, responded by saying the seizure was in accordance with Russian legislation. Bill Clinton has said that he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 – three years before he took Crimea – that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said … ‘I don’t agree with it. And I do not support it. And I am not bound by it.’ And I knew from that day forward it was just a matter of time.” Video footage has emerged overnight of a scuffle between a Ukrainian delegate and a Russian delegate during a gathering of Black Sea countries in the Turkish capital Ankara. The footage shows the Russian delegations secretary, Valery Stavitsky, snatching a Ukrainian flag out of the hands of his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksandr Marikovski, who unfurled the flag behind another Russian delegate who was mid-interview at the parliamentary assembly of the Black Sea economic cooperation group in Turkey. The Finnish power utility Fortum has formally notified the Kremlin that it strongly objects to what it said was Russia’s “unlawful” seizure of its subsidiary in the country. Vladimir Putin signed a decree on 25 April to establish temporary control of Fortum’s Russian assets, which the utility has openly tried to sell since the invasion of Ukraine last year. “With its actions, the Russian Federation has caused the dismissal of PAO Fortum’s CEO and deprived Fortum of its shareholder rights,” Reuters reports the company said on Friday, adding that it was preparing to take legal action. In his regular morning press conference, Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, responded by saying the seizure was in accordance with Russian legislation. “These actions, first of all, are dictated by the need to protect our own interests against the backdrop of the steps taken by countries unfriendly to us,” Peskov said. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russia’s Wagner group mercenary force, said in a sudden and dramatic announcement on Friday that his forces would leave the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that they have been trying to capture since last summer. Reuters reports Prigozhin said they would pull back on 10 May – ending their involvement in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies. He asked defence chiefs to insert regular army troops in their place. “I declare on behalf of the Wagner fighters, on behalf of the Wagner command, that on 10 May 2023, we are obliged to transfer positions in the settlement of Bakhmut to units of the defence ministry and withdraw the remains of Wagner to logistics camps to lick our wounds,” Prigozhin said in a statement. “I’m pulling Wagner units out of Bakhmut because in the absence of ammunition they’re doomed to perish senselessly.” Wagner has been spearheading Russia’s long and costly attempt to capture Bakhmut and Prigozhin said three weeks ago that his men controlled more than 80% of the city. But Ukrainian defenders have held out, and Prigozhin has vented increasing anger at what he describes as lack of support from the Russian defence establishment. Earlier today he issued a video in which he accused the leaders of Russia’s official forces of getting fat in their offices while Wagner troops lacked equipment. The video that the Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin released earlier today showed him standing in a field of Russian corpses, personally blaming top defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine. Prigozhin’s expletives were bleeped out in the video published by his press service, in which he yelled “We have a 70% shortage of ammunition. Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the ******* ammunition?” The reference to defence minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of general staff Valery Gerasimov appeared to reignite the simmering feud between Prigozhin and the Russian establishment forces. Those responsible would go to hell, Reuters reports Prigozhin shouted, before saying that Wagner’s losses would be five times smaller if it was adequately supplied. “These are Wagner lads who died today. The blood is still fresh,” Prigozhin said, pointing to the corpses around him. “They came here as volunteers and they’re dying so you can get fat in your offices.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that Russia’s Security Council will most likely discuss the Kremlin drone incident when it meets later today. Here is the video clip of that scuffle in Ankara yesterday. The footage shows the Russian delegations secretary, Valery Stavitsky, snatching a Ukrainian flag out of the hands of his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksandr Marikovski, who unfurled the flag behind another Russian delegate who was mid-interview at the parliamentary assembly of the Black Sea economic cooperation group in Turkey. Reuters has a quick snap that Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of Russia’s Wagner group mercenary force, said in a statement on Friday that his forces would leave Bakhmut on 10 May. Earlier Prigozhin released a video in which he appeared to angrily criticise Russian authorities for their lack of support of his Wagner forces. It should be noted that on previous occasions Prigozhin has made dramatic statements, then rowed back on them. Last week he offered to suspend artillery fire on Ukrainian forces in besieged Bakhmut and then said later it was a joke. More details soon … Russia’s foreign minister has said “any self-respecting country” would refrain from speaking to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy following the apparent drone attack on the Kremlin. Speaking in India, Sergei Lavrov said: As for the terrorist attack over the Kremlin and over the residence of the state leader, we have made our attitude clear. I think we shouldn’t wait for any more incidents and provocations. Zelenskiy and his team are doing everything in the media space, and in their practical steps, to ensure that any self-respecting country would refrain from talking to them or communicating with them. This is a fact. We have always been willing to deal with the consequences of the US attempts to pump Ukraine with weapons. We see there is a growing understanding that such problems cannot be settled on the on the contact line in Donbas. I think everybody understands that what is going on is geopolitical. Without resolving the key geopolitical problem, which is the west’s desire to retain its hegemony and to dictate its will upon everyone, without resolving that, no crisis will be settled anywhere. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov is giving a press conference at the moment in Panaji in India. We will bring you any key lines that emerge. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has said that in the last 24 hours two residents of the region were killed and five were wounded by Russian shelling. He also posted to Telegram to say that overnight a commercial enterprise Kramatorsk was struck, with nobody injured as a result. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that the Ilsky oil refinery in the Krasnodar region of Russia has been attacked by a drone or drones for the second consecutive day. It cites the emergency services telling it: The drone attacked the territory of the Ilsky refinery, as a result of which a fire broke out on an area of 60 sq metres. At present, open burning has been eliminated. The FT this morning is carrying quotes from Bill Clinton in which he says that he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine. Citing an appearance by the former US president alongside his wife Hillary, Joshua Chaffin writes: Bill Clinton said he realised in 2011 it was “just a matter of time” before Vladimir Putin would move on Ukraine after a chilling discussion with Russia’s president in Davos, Switzerland. During that encounter, Clinton said, Putin rejected a US-brokered deal agreed by his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, to respect Ukraine’s territory in exchange for Kyiv relinquishing its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 — three years before he took Crimea — that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said . . . ‘I don’t agree with it. And I do not support it. And I am not bound by it.’ And I knew from that day forward it was just a matter of time.” In the same piece, Hillary Clinton spoke of how the war might come to an end: To end hostilities, Hillary Clinton argued, Ukraine must either defeat Russia or at least regain the territory lost in the east since Russia’s invasion last year. “They need leverage,” she said. “I wouldn’t trust him [Putin] at a negotiating table under any circumstances, unless Ukrainians – backed by us – have enough leverage.” Video footage has emerged overnight of a scuffle between a Ukrainian delegate and a Russian delegate during a gathering of Black Sea nations in the Turkish capital Ankara. The incident happened on Thursday, after Olesandr Marikovski’s Ukrainian flag was snatched away from him to stop him photobombing a video interview with Russia’s lead delegate, Reuters reports. Marikovski posted the video of himself scrapping with the Russian and retrieving his blue and yellow flag on his Facebook page. The incident took place in a hallway of the parliament building, where the Organisation of the Black Sea economic cooperation (BSEC) assembly was being held. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update that “a recent uptick in Russian rail accidents in areas bordering Ukraine, attributed to sabotage committed by unknown actors, has almost certainly caused short-term localised disruption to Russian military rail movements”. It adds: “Although its Railway Troop Brigades are capable of restoring lines quickly, these incidents will increase pressure on Russia’s internal security forces, who will highly likely remain unable to fully protect Russia’s vast and vulnerable rail networks from attack.” Video shared on social media captured the moment a Ukrainian drone was brought down over Kyiv as onlookers cheered. The device, initially believed to be Russian, was taken down by air defence over the city. The air force later said the device was Ukrainian and had been destroyed to avoid “undesirable circumstances”. No casualties were reported from the incident. You can read the story on it here. Our defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, has produced some analysis on the recent Kremlin drone attack, writing that despite Zelenskiy’s denials it mirrors Kyiv’s tactics. He writes: Who exactly flew two drones over the Kremlin at around 3am on Wednesday is likely to be one of many questions that will remain unanswered until the Ukraine war ends, if not some while after that. But it is curious how many want to speculate about a Kremlin false-flag operation given how embarrassing it is to see video footage of drones flying over the Senate dome, housing Vladimir Putin’s presidential offices, before they were blown up. The response in Russia - where civilian drone flights have been banned in dozens of regions and GPS is being jammed in Moscow - suggests panic and a tightening of electronic security, rather than a planned escalation, he writes. Consider the more plausible alternative. Ukraine, and partisan groups aligned to it, have been building up their capabilities throughout the war. Drone attacks inside Russia – sometimes at great distances – are nothing new. You can read the analysis here. The Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang, has assured his Russian and Indian counterparts of deepening bilateral ties, promising that “coordination and cooperation” will only grow stronger, in a show of solidarity with two of China’s biggest neighbours, reports Reuters. Here is some more detail from Reuters’ report: Qin met in India on Thursday with other foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a bloc of nations spanning most of Eurasia, with Beijing seeking to preserve stable relations with countries in the region as ties with the West, particularly Washington, remain tense. The United States has long urged China to help resolve the war in Ukraine even though Beijing has refused to denounce Russia’s military moves as an invasion. In a landmark move last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke directly with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time since Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine. During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the SCO meeting, Qin said China is “willing to maintain communication and coordination with Russia to make tangible contributions to the political settlement of the crisis” in Ukraine. The two sides also agreed to strengthen communication and coordination with other SCO member-states and maintain the bloc’s “unity”, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry on Friday. They additionally agreed to strengthen coordination in the Asia-Pacific, the ministry said, without giving details. The SCO bloc includes Russia, India, China, Pakistan and four Central Asian countries - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Iran and Belarus were expected to be inducted into the SCO at a summit in New Delhi in July, an Indian foreign ministry official said. Australian Associated Press reports that further assistance for Ukraine is expected, and that there is speculation that a possible support package, organised jointly by Australia and the US, could be announced as soon as the end of the month. The US and Australia are reportedly working together on an assistance package that could mirror Canberra’s agreement with Paris to jointly supply ammunition to repel the Russian invasion, AAP says. This comes ahead of a visit by President Joe Biden to Australia. Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Canberra on Friday: “We are a big supporter of the Ukrainian efforts to repel the Russian invaders and that will be represented in the budget,” he told reporters in Canberra on Friday. Chalmers will hand down the budget on 9 May. Kyiv has submitted a wish list of aid ahead of the federal budget on Tuesday, which includes Hawkei armoured vehicles, artillery and ammunition. Hundreds of Ukrainian-Australians rallied around Australia on Saturday, calling for the government to provide Hawkeis to help defend their homeland. In February, Australia announced it would send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. A Russian official has warned that record high water levels could overwhelm a major dam in southern Ukraine and damage parts of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Reuters reports. Reuters quotes comments given by Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of nuclear energy firm Rosenergoatom, to Tass agency. Karchaa says that if the Nova Kakhovka dam did rupture, the power cable line for the Zaporizhzhia plant’s pumping stations would be flooded. “This (would create) functional problems for the operation of the plant and risks for nuclear safety,” he told Tass. Here is some more background from Reuters’ report: Last November, after Russian forces withdrew from the nearby southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, satellite imagery showed significant new damage to the dam. Both sides have accused each other of planning to breach the dam using explosives, which would flood much of the area downstream and would likely cause major destruction around Kherson. Karchaa’s comments represent a significant contrast from those made in late March by Ukrainian officials, who said they feared the Zaporizhzhia facility could face a shortage of water to cool reactors by late summer because Russian forces had let water out of a reservoir that supplied the plant. Russian troops took over the plant as they invaded parts of Ukraine last year. It is at the centre of a nuclear security crisis due to near-constant shelling in its vicinity which Kyiv and Moscow blame on each other. Here are some images of the drone that Ukraine shot down over Kyiv, after it suffered a suspected technical malfunction. The air force said it had been destroyed to avoid “undesirable circumstances”. No casualties have been reported as yet. You can read the story on it here. Our correspondent Peter Beaumont has reported on the heavy shelling in Kherson, where a 56-hour curfew is due to start on Friday evening amid a marked increase in the intensity of Russian attacks on the southern city this week. Some residents said they had sent some family away from the city or moved to safer locations further from the river, adding they were anticipating “something big” over the coming days as Ukrainian forces also stepped up shelling of Russian positions. There is mounting speculation about the timing of the long-anticipated Ukrainian spring counteroffensive, which officials have suggested may be imminent. You can read the full report here. China will persist in promoting peace talks on the Ukraine crisis, and is “willing to maintain communication and coordination with Russia to make tangible contributions to the political settlement of the crisis”, China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, said in a statement on Friday. The statement referred to Qin’s meeting with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers’ meeting in Goa, India, on Thursday, Reuters reported. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Below is a selection of the most recent events. Ukraine’s air force said it downed one of its own drones after it lost control over Kyiv on Thursday. Andriy Yermak, Ukraine presidential chief of staff, initially said an enemy drone that had been shot down. But the air force later clarified it was Ukrainian and had been destroyed to avoid “undesirable circumstances”. No casualties were reported. The White House has dismissed as “ludicrous” claims by Russia that Washington orchestrated drone strikes on Moscow, saying the US was not involved in the incident and accusing Russia of lying. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: “One thing I can tell you for certain is that the US did not have any involvement with this incident, contrary to [Vladimir Putin spokesman] Mr Peskov’s lies, and that’s just what they are: lies.” Earlier, Dmitry Peskov said: “Decisions about such terrorist attacks are taken in Washington” and that Kyiv “just implements these decisions”. Russian forces in Ukraine are so degraded they cannot mount any significant offensive moves and are focused for now on consolidating control of occupied territory, the US intelligence chief said. Avril Haines said Putin’s strategy is likely to be to prolong the conflict until western support for Kyiv wanes. Vladimir Putin must be brought to justice for his war in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday during a visit to The Hague, where the international criminal court (ICC) is based. “We all want to see a different Vladimir here in the Hague, the one who deserves to be sanctioned for his criminal actions here, in the capital of international law,” Zelenskiy said in a speech. “I’m sure we will see that happen when we win,” he said, adding: “Whoever brings war must receive judgment.” The US ambassador to Russia visited former US marine Paul Whelan, who has been detained in a remote Russian prison for more than four years. Ambassador Lynne Tracy said: “The US government will continue to engage Russian authorities on his case so Paul can come home as soon as possible.” She did not reveal his condition or what they discussed. Whelan was detained in 2018 and is serving a 16-year sentence for espionage. Analysts have pointed out that Moscow may be using jailed Americans as bargaining chips over the war in Ukraine. Residents of the key southern Ukrainian city of Kherson were stocking up on food and water after another night of heavy Russian shelling and before an announced 56-hour curfew due to begin on Friday evening. A number said they planned to stay indoors before the curfew and planned closure of the city, adding that they had slept in their clothes or gone to shelters because of the intensity of the Russian attack. Ukrainian air defences said they downed 18 out of 24 kamikaze drones that Russia launched in a pre-dawn attack on Thursday. In a statement, Kyiv city administration said that all missiles and drones targeting the Ukrainian capital for the third time in four days, have been destroyed. No casualties were reported. Russian emergency services extinguished a fire at a large oil refinery in Russia two hours after it was hit in a drone attack, Tass news agency reported early on Thursday. TASS said the incident occurred at the Ilsky refinery near the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk in the Krasnodar region, and that four drones were used. A day earlier, a fuel depot further to the west caught on fire near a bridge linking Russia’s mainland with the occupied Crimea peninsula. Finland has received a diplomatic note from Russia complaining over vandalism at a Russian consulate on the demilitarised Aland island located in the Baltic Sea between Finland and Sweden, the Finnish foreign ministry said on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/23/barclays-ceo-needs-profits-and-fewer-run-ins-with-regulators","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-23T19:01:37Z","webTitle":"Barclays CEO needs profits and fewer run-ins with regulators | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/23/barclays-ceo-needs-profits-and-fewer-run-ins-with-regulators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/23/barclays-ceo-needs-profits-and-fewer-run-ins-with-regulators","fields":{"headline":"Barclays CEO needs profits and fewer run-ins with regulators","bodyText":"The new chief executive of Barclays, CS Venkatakrishnan, will know what shareholders want from him: decent profits and fewer run-ins with regulators. Predecessor, Jes Staley, made progress on the former front but failed on the latter: he somehow survived a hefty fine for trying to unmask a whistleblower but was felled by the continuing regulatory probe into his characterisation of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Wednesday’s full-year report represented a promising inheritance for Venkatakrishnan. Pre-tax profits for 2021 hit a record £8.4bn and demonstrated that, for big banks at least, the pandemic is over. A total of £653m of credit impairments were written back. Meanwhile, return on tangible equity – a better measure of a bank’s financial performance – was 13.4%, the best in years, and every division achieved the desired double digits. Capital ratios were comfortably above target. At 6p, the dividend is almost back to pre-Covid levels and there was a spare £1bn to spray at buying back shares. On the requirement to avoid excitement, Venkatakrishnan sounds the part. He ducked for cover when invited to comment on Staley’s £22m-worth of frozen share awards and he signalled zero change of strategic direction – hardly surprising since he helped design the original plan. So plain sailing? Well, no. The stock market clearly still worries that Barclays will find new ways to disappoint, which is not an unreasonable view on past evidence. The deficit in the credibility ledger is a share price that, even after Wednesday’s 3% gain, stands well below book value; 196p plays 292p. Even NatWest, half-owned by the state, has a narrower discount these days. Put another way, Barclays’ “transatlantic” model of combining plain-vanilla UK retail and business lending with high-thrills Wall Street investment banking is still not universally trusted. Purely domestic banks just look more predictable. Staley, to be fair, made a better case for diversity in earnings and geography than his own predecessor-but-one, Bob Diamond, ever did. But Venkatakrishnan is the chief executive who will have to seal the deal. Interest rates are rising, which is a helpful backdrop for lenders, and Barclays’ investment bank has been redesigned to make it less of a naked bet on bond-trading volumes. The definition of a par score for Venkatakrishnan would be several years in a row of double-digit returns on equity. Easier said than done, but he has the chance to be the boring boss Barclays has been seeking for two decades. Aston Martin looks to jump start recovery Lawrence Stroll’s fan club should have listened harder when he said his intended “transformation” of Aston Martin Lagonda would take four to five years to perform. High hopes drove the shares as high as £21 soon after the rescue of the luxury carmaker in late-2020, but the price is now back roughly where it started at £10. There were few unexpected horrors within the £76.5m of operating losses for 2021, or £214m at the pre-tax level, but the gap between the two figures points to the major worry. Aston Martin, even in refinanced form, is still leaking substantial sums in interest payments on its borrowings. Net debt was £892m at the end of December and, worst of all, the company is still suffering the pauper’s interest rates agreed by old management in the dark days when corporate survival was in doubt. The aim is to achieve positive cashflow in 2023, which is probably the earliest that borrowing terms could be negotiated. The £2.5m-a-pop Valkyrie “hypercar” is built for speed; the corporate self-help programme wasn’t. Near miss: when Gazprom nearly bought Centrica As we inspect those long lists of Russian companies on the UK stock market and wonder how they all got here, here’s a tale from the archives that helps to explain. Back in 2006, there was a serious debate in Westminster as to whether Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled energy giant, should be allowed to buy Centrica, owner of British Gas and a company that, as now, owns a significant stake in the UK’s fleet of nuclear power stations. Gazprom kicked things off in February of that year when one of its senior executives said a bid was being “analysed and investigated”. Centrica’s shares shot up 25% in a day. Even come April, the story had legs. The FT reported that “Tony Blair [prime minister at the time] has ruled out any possibility that UK ministers might actively seek to block a future bid by Russia’s Gazprom for Centrica.” The priority, apparently, was to liberalise European energy markets and face down “economic nationalism”. In the event, of course, a bid never materialised – for which we can give thanks. The political naivety was extraordinary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-g7-condemns-russian-kidnapping-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-leaders","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T20:31:48Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: UK defence secretary dismisses Russia’s claims Ukraine plans to escalate conflict – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-g7-condemns-russian-kidnapping-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-g7-condemns-russian-kidnapping-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: UK defence secretary dismisses Russia’s claims Ukraine plans to escalate conflict – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s nearly 11:30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Iran announced Sunday that it will supply Russia with 40 turbines to help its gas industry amid western sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, local media reported. Iran’s “industrial successes are not limited to the fields of missiles and drones”, Iranian Gas Engineering and Development Company’s CEO, Reza Noushadi, was quoted as saying by Shana, the oil ministry’s news agency. Ukraine and the US on Sunday denounced suggestions from Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a “dirty bomb” as dangerous lies. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” president Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address. A statement from the US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Sunday echoed Ukraine’s words, saying: “We reject reports of Minister Shoigu’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory.” Ukraine’s special operations forces said that Iranian drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus, the Kyiv Independent reports. According to special operations forces, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are training Russian forces in Belarus and coordinating the launches of Iranian-made drones. One person was killed by a homemade bomb in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Sunday, according to the Russia-installed authorities in the region of the same name, Agence France-Presse reports. “An improvised explosive device, attached to a street pole and detonated remotely, killed a civilian from Kherson,” local pro-Russian official Kirill Stremousov wrote on social media, adding that a passerby had been wounded. Russia told people in the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson to flee for their lives on Sunday as more residents joined an exodus to escape an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive. In a video message, the Russian education minister, Sergei Kravtsov, said: “The situation today is difficult. It’s vital to save your lives … It won’t be for long. You will definitely return.” Following talks between the UK and Russia, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, rebutted claims made by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, that Ukraine, facilitated by western counties including UK, was planning to escalate the conflict. “The defence secretary refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service said on Sunday it had detained two officials of the Ukrainian aircraft engine maker Motor Sich on suspicion of working with Russia. SBU “detained the president of industrial giant Motor Sich. He is suspected of working with the Russian Federation,” it said in a statement. It added that it had also detained the company’s department head for foreign economic activities but did not name them. Iran announced Sunday that it will supply Russia with 40 turbines to help its gas industry amid western sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, local media reported. Iran’s “industrial successes are not limited to the fields of missiles and drones”, Iranian Gas Engineering and Development Company’s CEO, Reza Noushadi, was quoted as saying by Shana, the oil ministry’s news agency. “Currently, 85 percent of the facilities and equipment needed by the gas industry are built inside the country, and based on this capability, a contract has recently been signed to export 40 Iranian-made turbines to Russia,” he added. Noushadi did not specify when the contract was signed, and when the turbines are due to be delivered. After the imposition of economic sanctions over the Kremlin’s offensive in Ukraine, Russia reduced or halted supplies to different European nations, causing energy prices to soar. The Kremlin insists sanctions have prevented the proper maintenance of Russian gas infrastructure and, in particular, blocked the return of a Siemens turbine that had been undergoing repairs in Canada. “Give us a turbine, we will turn Nord Stream on tomorrow,” Russian president Vladimir Putin said at the Vladivostok forum in September, referring to a vital gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. Western countries have accused Russia of using gas supplies as a weapon. Noushadi said the US sanctions on Russia are aimed at excluding Moscow from the gas market. “In recent years, the United States of America has widely set up LNG production plants, and recently, with the all-out embargo on Russia and then the explosion in the Nord Stream gas pipeline, it effectively eliminated one of its biggest competitors in gas exports,” he noted. Russia and Iran hold some of the world’s largest gas reserves, and are both under strict US sanctions. Ukraine and the US on Sunday denounced suggestions from Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a “dirty bomb” as dangerous lies. In conversations with his British, French and Turkish counterparts on Sunday, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu conveyed “concerns about possible provocations by Ukraine with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’,” Moscow said. Russia did not mention the alleged “dirty bomb” allegation in its statement after Shoigu’s call with Pentagon head Lloyd Austin. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” president Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address, Agence France-Presse reports. “I believe that now the world should react as harshly as possible.” Earlier Sunday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, denounced Moscow’s claims as “absurd” and “dangerous”. “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves,” he added. A statement from US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Sunday echoed Ukraine’s words, saying: “We reject reports of Minister Shoigu’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.” Ukraine’s special operations forces said that Iranian drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus, the Kyiv Independent reports. According to special operations forces, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are training Russian forces in Belarus and coordinating the launches of Iranian-made drones. One person was killed by a homemade bomb in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Sunday, according to the Russia-installed authorities in the region of the same name, Agence France-Presse reports. “An improvised explosive device, attached to a street pole and detonated remotely, killed a civilian from Kherson,” local pro-Russian official Kirill Stremousov wrote on social media, adding that a passerby had been wounded. Faced with an advancing counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops, the pro-Kremlin authorities in Kherson region, which Moscow claims to have annexed, are moving residents of the city to Russian-controlled areas on the left bank of the Dnieper River. On Saturday they told residents to “immediately” leave the city - the only regional capital to have been captured by Russian forces - citing a “tense situation on the front ... an increased danger of mass shelling ... and attacks.” Stremousov described Sunday’s explosion as a “terrorist act” and blamed in on Ukraine. “We strongly recommend that all residents of Kherson leave the right bank part of the region,” he said. Russia told people in the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson to flee for their lives on Sunday as more residents joined an exodus to escape an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive. In a video message, the Russian education minister, Sergei Kravtsov, said: “The situation today is difficult. It’s vital to save your lives … It won’t be for long. You will definitely return.” Russia’s proxies in the southern region are trying to evacuate up to 60,000 people who live on the western bank of the Dnieper River. Moscow-backed authorities reported a shortage of vessels to ferry people across the river at one point on Sunday, due to a “sharp increase in the number of people wishing to leave the city”. The Kherson region sits to the north of the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. It is a key gateway for Russian military supplies. About 25,000 people have been evacuated since Tuesday, the Interfax news agency cited the Russian-installed deputy head of the region, Kirill Stremousov, as saying. Despite the warnings, officials insisted any relocation would be temporary if it was from territory Russia had officially proclaimed its own after its “referendums” – which were decried as sham, coercive votes by Kyiv and the west. “We are not going to give up Kherson,” Stremousov said. Following talks between the UK and Russia, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, refuted claims made by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, that Ukraine, facilitated by western counties including UK, was planning to escalate the conflict. “The defence secretary refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement, Reuters reports. During the earlier call, Shoigu told Wallace that Russia was concerned Kyiv could be preparing to use a “dirty bomb” in Ukraine – a claim he also made in calls with the French and Turkish defence ministers earlier on Sunday. Russia has published no evidence to support the claim. Russian missiles smashed into a suburb of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine early on Sunday, devastating two apartment blocks, but nobody was killed because most residents had already moved away after a similar attack in the vicinity six months ago. Reuters reports: “All of the people who had small children decided to leave immediately” after the April attack, said Svitlana, 46, as she salvaged belongings from her glass-and-plaster strewn apartment. “The pensioners had also decided to leave.” Her neighbour, Oleksii Begun, 35, said only about 15 to 20 flats in their 119-unit, 10-storey building were currently occupied after a Russian cluster munition hit a private home nearby in April, killing one person. “It’s a horror,” he said, surveying the devastation wrought by Sunday’s attacks. The explosions in the Karabelnyi district of Mykolaiv, a ship-building centre at the confluence of the Southern Buh and Dnipro rivers, continued a weeks-long Russian aerial offensive that has targeted civilian infrastructure, especially energy facilities, just weeks before the onset of winter. The first projectile struck at 1.35 am on Sunday, Begun said, ploughing into the roof of the five-floor apartment house opposite his block. It blasted a hole in the top two stories, smashed windows in both buildings and showered rubble across the courtyard separating the two. The second missile followed about eight minutes later, obliterating a playground and a small store inside the courtyard, he said, spewing a tornado of bricks and twisted metal and hurling several cars 30 metres into his building. Mykolaiv regional officials identified the missiles as S-300s, anti-aircraft weapons that Russian forces have been firing at ground targets. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, spoke with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Sunday in their second telephone call in three days, the defence ministry said in a statement. Moscow provided no further information on the outcome of the call or any specific areas of discussion. The pair previously spoke on Friday for the first time since May. Earlier on Sunday, Shoigu held calls with the British, French and Turkish defence ministers. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service said on Sunday it had detained two officials of the Ukrainian aircraft engine maker Motor Sich on suspicion of working with Russia, Agence France-Presse reports. SBU “detained the president of industrial giant Motor Sich. He is suspected of working with the Russian Federation,” it said in a statement. It added that it had also detained the company’s department head for foreign economic activities but did not name them. According to the SBU, their detention is part of a criminal investigation into “the illegal supply by Motor Sich of military goods for Russian attack aircraft”. The pair are being held on suspicion of “collaborative activity” and “assistance to the aggressor state”. The SBU said the management of the company’s plant in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region – part of which is controlled by Russian forces – “acted in collusion” with the Russian state-owned defence conglomerate Rostec. “The suspects established transnational channel for the illegal supply of wholesale batches of Ukrainian aircraft engines to the aggressor country,” the SBU said, specifying that Russia used them to produce and repair attack helicopters. These models of helicopter were used “en masse” during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the SBU. Motor Sich makes engines for helicopters and aircraft, as well as industrial turbines. Up until 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea, Russia was the company’s largest client. If you’re just joining us, here’s a round-up of all the day’s news from Ukraine so far. President Zelenskiy has said that power has been partially restored in parts of Ukraine after heaving shelling targeted key energy infrastructure on Saturday. Scheduled power cuts have been introduced in the capital, Kyiv, as part of efforts to ration energy usage. Two people have been killed in Russian strikes in Donetsk, and the bodies of a further four people have been discovered in areas of the region previously occupied by Russian forces. UK intelligence suggests that Russia is constructing new lines of defence in the Luhansk region that are likely to deter any rapid Ukrainian counteroffensives. Russia appears to be preparing to destroy a dam on the Dnipro River as part of “delaying actions” intended to slow Ukrainian advances, according to the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War. One Russian milblogger has described the situation for Russian troops in the southern region of Kherson as “dire”. The number of Russian troops killed since the start of the war stands at 67,470, according to the Ukrainian armed forces. A Russian fighter plane has crashed into a residential building in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, killing its two pilots The G7 has condemned Russia’s kidnapping of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant leadership and called for the return of control of the facility to Ukraine. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has held calls with his British, French and Turkish counterparts, the Russian defence ministry has said. Ukrainian ports are operating at only 25-30% capacity despite a deal reached in July because of “deliberate delays” by Russia, according to Ukrainian authorities. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has sent a congratulatory message to Xi Jinping after he secured a third term as Chinese leader. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu held a phone call on Sunday with his British counterpart, Ben Wallace, the Russian defence ministry has said. It added that Shoigu also spoke with his French and Turkish counterparts, Sebastien Lecornu and Hulusi Akar. The ministry said that, in all three calls, Shoigu claimed to be concerned about the possibility that Ukraine planned to use a so-called dirty bomb in the conflict. A dirty bomb is a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material that is disseminated when the bomb explodes. Russia has provided no evidence of any intention by Ukraine to deploy such a weapon. An earlier readout of the call with the French defence minister, again provided by the Russian defence ministry, said Shoigu had warned that the war in Ukraine has a “steady tendency towards further, uncontrolled escalation”. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has renewed a call for countries around the world to ban the Russian state broadcaster RT. The appeal was prompted by a clip, shared widely on social media, in which the channel’s director of broadcasting, Anton Krasovsky, is seen inciting a number of violent crimes against Ukrainians. “Governments which still have not banned RT must watch this excerpt,” Kuleba wrote on Twitter. “This is what you side with if you allow RT to operate in your countries. Aggressive genocide incitement (we will put this person on trial for it), which has nothing to do with freedom of speech. Ban RT worldwide!” Numerous commentators have argued that misinformation and propaganda of the sort routinely shared on RT forms a central part of Russia’s war effort, and so should not be covered by freedom of the press. The occupied city of Energodar is on the brink of a “humanitarian disaster” because of a lack of energy and water supply, its mayor has said. Dmytro Orlov said “constant enemy shelling [has destroyed] civilian infrastructure and power grids”, the Ukrainian outlet Ukrainska Pravda reports. “The city remains without electricity and without water supply. Gas has not been available in most parts of the city for almost six months,” he said. Energodar lies in the Zaporizhia region on the southern bank of the Dnipro River, which marks the border between Ukrainian and Russian-controlled territory. Orlov added that Energodar had a centralised heating system that had not been working since the spring. “There are currently no prospects for starting heating. The city is in danger of not starting the heating season at all,” he said. Much of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been targeted in recent weeks by Russian strikes and concerns raised that parts of the country could be left without heating over the winter. Ukraine’s ports are operating at only 25-30% capacity because of “deliberate delays” by Russia, according to the Ukrainian ministry of infrastructure. Grain and other agricultural products have been allowed to leave Ukrainian ports since a deal brokered between the UN, Ukraine, Russian, and Turkey in July. Negotiations to extend the deal beyond a November deadline are ongoing. In a post on Facebook announcing the departure of seven ships on Sunday, the ministry said: “Russia is deliberately delaying the full implementation of the grain initiative. “The ports have been operating at only 25-30% of their capacity in recent days.” More now from the latest assessment of the conflict by US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War. The assessment includes a quote from one Russian milblogger – a blogger serving in the military – describing the situation for Russian troops in the Kherson region as “dire”. Russia has withdrawn its troops from the west of the region and told residents in Kherson city to leave ahead of an expected counteroffensive by Ukraine. The milblogger says it has proved “virtually impossible” to evacuate troops from the first line of defence, adding that the only questions left are how to complete that final withdrawal and how to explain it to people in Russia. Pictures appear to show the aftermath of that fighter plane crash in the Russian city of Irkutsk. The images, posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda, show thick smoke rising from a cluster of houses in a residential neighbourhood. Another shows flames engulfing a building. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the pictures. A Russian fighter plane has crashed into a residential building in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, the regional governor has said. Posting to Telegram on Sunday, Igor Kobzev said the plane hit a two-storey house and that its two pilots had both been killed. He added that there had been no other casualties. Footage included in the post showed emergency workers moving among the wreckage and working to put out fires at the site. It is the second such incident in six days, Reuters reports. Last Monday, at least 15 people were killed after a fighter plane hit an apartment block in the southern city of Yeysk, near the Ukrainian border. The operator of Kyiv’s energy grid has announced a series of “stabilisation” power cuts following Russian strikes on key infrastructure on Saturday. More than a million households were left without electricity after strikes on energy facilities across Ukraine. In a statement on its website, energy company DTEK said the national energy operator, Ukrenegro, had introduced the cuts in the capital to “avoid accidents”. The blackouts began at 11.13am local time (09.30am BST), with households in Kyiv divided into three groups that will be “disconnected for a certain period of time”, DTEK said. It added that the blackouts should last “no more than four hours” but may be longer “due to the scale of damage to the power supply system”. President Zelenskiy has called on people across the country to be mindful of their energy use and to limit their use of appliances that require a lot of power. Russia is attempting to cut off telecommunications in Kherson in order to stop opposition figures within the city sending information to the Ukrainian armed forces, Ukraine’s government has said. It comes amid the withdrawal of Russian troops from the west of the Kherson region ahead of an expected counteroffensive by Ukraine to recapture the city. According to a report by the government-run Centre for National Resistance, Russia has begun dismantling communication equipment at the local television centre. “In the future, the Russians plan to leave the city completely without communication, television, and radio broadcasting,” it said. “In this way, the Russians are trying to informationally isolate Kherson in order not to allow the [underground resistance] to transmit information to the armed forces of Ukraine during counteroffensive actions.” As the realisation dawns that Russia’s president will stop at nothing, EU leaders are wondering what he may do next to undermine support for Ukraine – and weaken their governments. Putin is losing on the battlefield and despite his nuclear threats, they plainly fears a head-on conflict with Nato he knows he could lose. Thinking ahead, it’s logical – and prudent – to assume a desperate, heedless Putin will increasingly turn to hybrid attacks in Europe. Very little is off-limits. Norway, now Europe’s biggest gas supplier, knows its oil and gas installations have become prime targets. Finland plans to fence parts of its border with Russia, fearing an influx of spies and saboteurs. France worries transatlantic internet cables, essential for western security and communications, are in Putin’s sights. Britain, playing catch-up, has announced its first “multi-role ocean surveillance ship” will be operational in 2023. These threats are adding to the already considerable political and social strains imposed on Europe by the Ukraine conflict. Read Simon Tisdall’s piece here: Russia appears to be preparing to destroy a dam on the Dnipro River as part of “delaying actions” intended to slow Ukrainian advances, according to a US thinktank. It comes amid the withdrawal of Russian troops from the west of the Kherson region ahead of an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive intended to recapture Kherson city. In its latest assessment of the conflict, the Institute for the Study of War said Russia was “likely preparing” to destroy the dam at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant in order to flood the Dnipro River and delay Ukrainian forces. The dam is located near the southern port city of Nova Kakhovka, where authorities announced on Saturday they were lowering the level of the reservoir behind the dam in order to minimise damage should it be destroyed, but claimed it was the Ukrainians who were planning an attack. The institute said Ukraine had nothing to gain from destroying the dam and every interest in maintaining the energy supply in areas it expects to liberate, adding that the move appeared to be an attempt by Russia to “moderate” the flooding. Footage shows a violinist performing for people gathered in a shelter amid yesterday’s blackouts. The video, posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian defence ministry, shows dozens of people sat around and holding up torches as the man plays. The ministry said the footage was shot in the western region of Rivne. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has congratulated the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on securing a third term in office. Xi was reconfirmed as general secretary of the ruling Chinese Communist party on Sunday, ending a precedent that presidents should serve for only two terms. According to a statement posted on the Kremlin’s website, Putin told Xi in a message: “The results of the 20th congress of the Chinese Communist party fully confirmed your high political authority and the unity of the party you head. “I am certain that the resolutions of the congress will help successfully implement the grand social and economic tasks facing China, and will assist in strengthening the country’s position on the international arena. “It would be a pleasure for me to carry on our constructive dialogue and close joint work to develop the relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic alliance between our two states.” The two leaders signed a “no limits” partnership agreement in February, three weeks before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, China has taken a careful line, criticising Western sanctions against Russia but stopping short of endorsing or assisting in the military campaign. Two civilians have been killed in Russian strikes on the eastern region of Donetsk, according to the local governor. Posting on Telegram on Sunday, Pavlo Kyrylenko said the deaths had occurred in the villages of Klishchiivka and Torskyi. He added that authorities had also discovered the bodies of four people killed while the area was under Russian occupation. “Every war criminal will be punished!” he wrote. Power has been restored to some areas where it was cut off by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure on Saturday, President Zelenskiy has said. More than a dozen missiles hit facilities across Ukraine over the course of the day, causing widespread blackouts. Speaking in his nightly address, Zelenskiy said electricity supplies had been partly restored in the southern region of Odesa and the western regions of Khmelnytsky and Rivne. “There are positive reports from other regions as well,” he said. “But in many cities, in many districts, recovery work is still ongoing. We are trying to return power to people as soon as possible.” He urged residents to be careful in their use of electricity and to limit their use of any appliances that use a lot of power. “The stability of the power industry of our entire state depends on each city and district of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. “Even if the enemy can leave us temporarily without power, it will still never succeed in leaving us without the desire to make things right, to mend and return them to normal.” In case you missed it, Russia yesterday launched what President Zelenskiy described as a “massive attack” on Ukraine, hitting key energy infrastructure and causing widespread power outages. Authorities said more than a dozen missiles struck sites across the country and left more than a million households without electricity. “These are vile strikes on critical objects,” Zelenskiy said on Saturday. “The world can and must stop this terror.” Read the full story here: The total number of Russian troops killed since the start of the invasion stands at 67,470, according to Ukraine. The latest update from the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the death toll had risen by approximately 400 in the last 24 hours. It also said a further five tanks and two helicopters had been destroyed, bringing the totals to 2,584 and 245 respectively. The International Ski Federation has agreed to maintain a ban on athletes from Russia and Belarus from all competition in light of the invasion of Ukraine. The FSI said on Saturday after meeting for the opening event of the alpine ski calendar: The FIS council decided, with due regard to the integrity of FIS competitions and for the safety of all participants, and in line with IOC recommendations, to continue its policy to not allow Russian and Belarusian teams and athletes to participate in all FIS competition. Agence France-Presse also reported that the FIS ban means Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be able to compete in alpine skiing, nordic skiing, freestyle and snowboard. They are already suspended by the International Biathlon Union. Their absence will be of little significance for alpine skiing, but Russia is a powerhouse in cross-country skiing, having won a third of all medals available at the last Winter Olympic Games in Beijing in February. A new project suggests Russia is making a big effort to fortify its defences in the occupied Luhansk region and would be “likely to deter any rapid Ukrainian counteroffensives”, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence update said Wagner Group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed online this week that his engineering team was constructing an extensive fortified line of defences in Luhansk. Imagery showed a section of newly constructed anti-tank defences and trench systems south-east of Kreminna in the oblast in Ukraine’s east, the ministry tweeted. If the plans are as extensive as Prigozhin claims, the works likely aim to integrate the Siversky Donetsk river into the defensive zone, partially following the 2015 line of control. The project suggests Russia is making a significant effort to prepare defences in depth behind the current frontline, likely to deter any rapid Ukrainian counteroffensives. Prigozhin is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. As she was driven by her son out of Dudchany – a small village in the north-east of the Kherson region – a few days ago, Rosaliya Kovalchuk, 72, glimpsed something from the back seat that will haunt her forever. “Hanging from the branches of a tree were guts from a man’s belly,” Kovalchuk said, pausing as she sought to collect her emotions. A military car had been blown up. I think he was Russian, from the boots and the uniform. Dudchany, one of the stepping stones down the Dnieper river to Kherson city, the regional capital 123km (77 miles) to the south-west, is at the centre of fierce fighting that the west says could be pivotal in the outcome of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Daniel Boffey in Kherson oblast has the full story: Spain says it will send 14 fighter jets to Bulgaria and Romania to bolster Nato’s eastern flank as the defence alliance strengthens its deterrence capacity following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Madrid would send six Eurofighter jets and 130 soldiers to Bulgaria between mid-November and early December to train local forces, Agence France-Presse reported the Spanish defence ministry as saying in a statement on Saturday. A further deployment would see eight F18M fighter jets and 130 air force personnel sent to Romania between December and March 2023 as part of Nato’s “reaction and deterrence” strategy, the ministry added. A long-range aerial surveillance radar has also been deployed in Romania since 17 October and could remain until late June 2023, the statement said. Spain would also increase its air force’s missions forming part of an “aerial shield”. The country has already sent 12 fighter jets to eastern Nato members Bulgaria, Lithuania and Estonia since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The Group of Seven industrialised nations condemned Russia’s kidnapping of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant leadership and called for the immediate return of full control of the facility to Ukraine. “We condemn Russia’s repeated kidnapping of Ukrainian ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant] leadership and staff,” Reuters reported the G7 nonproliferation directors general as saying in a statement on Saturday. We urge Russia to immediately return full control of the ZNPP to its rightful sovereign owner, Ukraine. Russian forces captured the nuclear plant – Europe’s largest – in early March. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy agency accused Russia of detaining two senior employees at the plant. Energoatom said Russian forces on Monday “kidnapped” the head of information technology, Oleg Kostyukov, and the plant’s assistant general director, Oleg Osheka, and “took them to an unknown destination”, Agence France-Presse reported. Energoatom had called on International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, “to make every effort” to secure their release. The agency announced that another plant official, Valeriy Martyniuk, had been released. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton and here’s a quick run through the latest news to bring you up to speed as it approaches 9.15am in Kyiv. Russian-installed authorities have ordered all residents of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson to leave “immediately” ahead of an expected advance by Ukrainian troops waging a counteroffensive to recapture it. The regional pro-Kremlin administration called on civilians to use boat crossings over a major river to move deeper into Russian-held territory, citing a tense situation on the front and the threat of shelling and alleged “terror attacks” by Kyiv, Associated Press reported. On Friday, Ukrainian forces bombarded Russian positions across the region, targeting resupply routes. More than a dozen Russian missiles pounded energy facilities and other infrastructure across Ukraine on Saturday, the Ukrainian air force said, with strikes causing blackouts in parts of different regions. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Russian attacks had struck on a “very wide” scale, Reuters reported. He pledged that his military would improve on an already good record of downing missiles with help from its partners. Russian military forces targeted energy facilities in western Ukraine, the country’s power grid operator said on Saturday. Ukrenergo said on Telegram that the “scale of damage is comparable or may exceed the consequences of the attack on October 10-12”. It said repair crews were starting to repair the facilities after the rocket attack, but that restrictions were in place as they tried to restore the electricity supply. Hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine have woken up to power outages and periodic bursts of gunfire, as Ukrainian air defence tried to shoot down drones and incoming missiles. Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, said 1.5 million people were without electricity after Russian strikes against power stations on Saturday. Ukraine’s prime minister said that Russia has plunged Ukraine into a humanitarian catastrophe by attacking its energy infrastructure. Denys Shmyhal told German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine that Russia wanted to condemn Ukraine to “a cold winter when many people could literally freeze to death”. Ukrainian forces have pushed Russians out of the Charivne and Chkalove settlements in the Kherson region, the Ukrainian forces’ general staff said on Saturday. Iran’s foreign ministry has strongly condemned a call by France, Germany and Britain for the UN to investigate accusations that Russia has used “kamikaze” drones from Iran to attack Ukraine. Kyiv says Russia has used Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones. If true, the allegations would mark a breach of UN security council resolution 2231."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/mar/02/ofgem-faces-national-grid-challenge-over-energy-earnings-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-02T12:11:31Z","webTitle":"Ofgem faces National Grid challenge over energy earnings plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/02/ofgem-faces-national-grid-challenge-over-energy-earnings-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/mar/02/ofgem-faces-national-grid-challenge-over-energy-earnings-plan","fields":{"headline":"Ofgem faces National Grid challenge over energy earnings plan","bodyText":"National Grid has ignited an industry rebellion against the energy regulator by taking Ofgem’s plan to cut energy network company earnings to the competition watchdog. The company said it would refer parts of Ofgem’s new regulatory plan to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) because it does not allow large enough returns for its investment in the UK’s gas pipes and electrical cables. Other transmission cable operators, including Scottish Power and SSE, followed suit hours after National Grid announced that it would appeal against the five-year regulation plan that will cut returns for the companies by almost 40% from this April. The Guardian understands that gas network operators including SGN, Wales and West Utilities, Cadent and Northern Gas Networks may also challenge Ofgem’s regulation before the deadline for appeals on Wednesday. The industry revolt began brewing last summer when Ofgem initially set out plans to halve the returns allowed on investment in the UK’s transmission cables and gas pipes to protect household energy bills. The multibillion-pound investments are ultimately paid for by energy consumers, and typically make up one-fifth of the average household energy bill. Ofgem softened its stance at the end of last year by raising the energy company’s allowed returns on investment from its original proposal of 3.95% to 4.3% for the next five years. The rate is still the lowest ever proposed for a regulated network company, and well below the 5.6% suggested by National Grid. In the past, the regulator has been criticised for allowing energy network firms to rake in bigger than expected profits, by approving company spending plans that are higher than necessary and plans to recover generous returns from energy bills. Senior executives have speculated that Ofgem may feel under pressure to prove that it can be tough on company profits. John Pettigrew, the chief executive of National Grid, said Ofgem had “ultimately ignored certain evidence” presented by the industry in its consultation, and had underestimated the financial risk of its major infrastructure investments by setting returns that are too low. Ofgem said the rate was based on an assumed cost of equity of 4.55%, which it believes could fall lower if companies perform better than their efficiency targets. Pettigrew described the so-called “outperformance wedge” as “a curious mechanism” that is “conceptually and practically flawed”. Energy network bosses at SSE and Scottish Power have raised the same concerns in their appeals. Rob McDonald, the managing director of SSEN Transmission, said the appeal raised “technical but very important issues”. These include the “unacceptable risk” of a new mechanism to approve extra spending during the fixed five-year period without a right to appeal against the spending amount, and a change that could put SSE on the hook if National Grid’s electricity system operator undercharges energy consumers on their behalf. National Grid said its credit rating faced a downgrade based on the parts of the regulation that it would accept, but it would continue to pay a rising dividend to its shareholders. Instead of tracking the retail prices index, the dividend would track the consumer prices index, it said. Akshay Kaul, Ofgem’s networks boss, said the regulation “drives a fair price for consumers, improves services and boosts green energy investment”. “We respect the Competition and Markets Authority appeal process, where we will defend robustly our decisions which are in the best interests of consumers and tackling climate change,” he said. “While the appeals could take around six months to resolve, they will not delay any investment and we look forward to working closely with industry to accelerate investment for a green recovery.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/31/ukraine-in-fresh-effort-to-evacuate-mariupol-after-red-cross-warnings","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-31T17:00:31Z","webTitle":"Ukraine in fresh effort to evacuate Mariupol after Red Cross warnings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/ukraine-in-fresh-effort-to-evacuate-mariupol-after-red-cross-warnings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/31/ukraine-in-fresh-effort-to-evacuate-mariupol-after-red-cross-warnings","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine in fresh effort to evacuate Mariupol after Red Cross warnings","bodyText":"Ukraine has launched a fresh attempt to rescue civilians from Mariupol after warnings from the Red Cross that thousands of lives depend on the successful evacuation of people trapped in the besieged city by Russian forces. A total of 45 buses were en route to the nearby southern coastal town of Berdyansk, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said, along with a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delivering humanitarian aid and assisting evacuations. The convoy was expected to enter the city on Friday morning after Russian promises of a limited ceasefire along the route from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Repeated efforts to set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of up to 170,000 people who remain in Mariupol, which has suffered four weeks of bombardment and dwindling supplies, have failed. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of shelling supposedly safe routes outside of several fighting hotspots; claims that Moscow denies. “Time is running out to help these people. This evacuation is hugely important,” said Alyona Synenko, a spokesperson for the ICRC. “It is essential we get concrete and precise agreements from both sides on times and routes tomorrow. These instructions need to be conveyed to military units on the ground and they must be respected. “We distributed the last of the supplies we had there two weeks ago. People have nothing now. We are ready to help and we are hoping tomorrow safe passage materialises.” Control of Mariupol, a strategic port once home to 400,000 people and still in the Ukrainian government’s hands, would ensure Russian dominance in the inland Sea of Azov. Together with self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk and other eastern territories seized recently by Russia, it would create a land corridor from the Russian mainland to Crimea. As such, it has been a major focus of Moscow’s five-week offensive and civilians there have suffered gravely. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday that at least 5,000 people had died in the assault on Mariupol. Water, food and medicine are running low, and many families have been unable to bury loved ones killed by airstrikes and shelling because of the ferocity of the Russian attack. A maternity hospital, an arts centre housing displaced people and a Red Cross warehouse have all been struck, while residents who have managed to find fuel and undamaged cars have taken their lives into their own hands to flee. A successful evacuation on Friday morning would greatly improve the chance of progress in peace talks, which are also planned to resume online tomorrow. By the same token, if the humanitarian corridor was again attacked, the prospect of any major breakthrough would diminish. Ukraine and its western allies remain sceptical of Moscow’s overtures, which appear to include troop withdrawals from some areas of the country to focus on “liberating” the eastern region. On Thursday, Ukraine’s state nuclear company said most of the Russian forces that had occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power station since soon after the 24 February invasion had set off towards the Belarus border, with only a small number remaining. Russian forces have also withdrawn from the nearby town of Slavutych, where power station workers live. Despite the claims of a wider drawdown earlier this week, Russian forces have continued to bombard the northern city of Chernihiv, while the area’s governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russian troops were on the move but may not be withdrawing. “The enemy is taking losses. It is moving in the territory of Chernihiv region. Can we call that a withdrawal of troops? I am not sure. At the minimum, it is regrouping, but it is possible that it is withdrawing. We must not let down our guard,” he wrote on the messaging app Telegram. Ukrainian officials said there had been artillery barrages in and around the north-eastern city of Kharkiv over the past day, and heavy fighting had continued in several suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, where Ukrainian forces have counterattacked. Unverified pictures and video which emerged on Thursday on a Kharkiv news channel on Telegram showed massive damage caused by Russian strikes on a large farm about 18 miles (30km) north-east of the city. Russia’s defence ministry also reported new strikes on Ukrainian fuel stores overnight. An interior ministry adviser, Vadym Denysenko, said a corridor between two eastern towns – Izyum and Volnovakha – was becoming a key battlefront. In another sign of Russian intent, the top rebel leader in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, issued an order to set up a rival city government for Mariupol, according to Russian state news agencies. Zelenskiy said on Thursday that the continued fighting confirmed Ukraine’s suspicions that Russia was using talk of de-escalation as cover to prepare its forces for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine. Thousands of Ukranians and Russian soldiers have died and about 4 million Ukranians have fled the country since the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, announced a “special military operation” to disarm and “de-nazify” its neighbour. In the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, as well as substandard equipment and poor morale among Russian troops, however, Moscow has struggled to take control of any significant territory. Western intelligence agencies have claimed that Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth about the stalled offensive and the extent of the damage to Russia’s economy caused by crippling international sanctions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2023/feb/16/centrica-profits-british-gas-ftse-100-8000-points-inflation-growth-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-16T15:23:12Z","webTitle":"FTSE 100 surges over 8,000 points before rising US producer prices dampen mood; British Gas owner Centrica’s profits triple – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/feb/16/centrica-profits-british-gas-ftse-100-8000-points-inflation-growth-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/feb/16/centrica-profits-british-gas-ftse-100-8000-points-inflation-growth-business-live","fields":{"headline":"FTSE 100 surges over 8,000 points before rising US producer prices dampen mood; British Gas owner Centrica’s profits triple – as it happened","bodyText":"And finally…. the UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has ended the day at a new alltime closing high. That’s despite disappointment over the higher-than-expected US producer price inflation data. The FTSE 100 has closed at 8012 points tonight, up 14 points or 0.18%, having hit an intraday high of 8047 points this morning. Centrica was the top riser, surging 5.7% after beating profit forecasts and announcing a new £300m share buyback programme today. Thousands of workers at Britain’s Royal Mail voted in favour of further strikes on Thursday, warning of more walkouts until a long-running dispute over pay is resolved. More than 95% of those who participated in the ballot voted for strikes, said the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents more than 110,000 postal workers at the centuries-old postal company. Time to wrap up… here are today’s main stories: The head of the Rockefeller Foundation, Rajiv Shah, has emerged as the favourite to succeed David Malpass as head of the World Bank amid calls for the White House to lose its stranglehold on choosing who should run the global development body. Shah, a doctor, health expert and former head of the US Agency for International Development, is one of the names hotly tipped to be the Joe Biden’s administration choice as a replacement for Malpass following his announcement that he would be leaving his post by June. But the likelihood that Washington will use a “gentleman’s agreement” under which the US picks the World Bank president while Europe chooses the managing director of its sister organisation – the International Monetary Fund – brought immediate calls for the process to be opened up. “With the dismal Malpass gone, the US are already manoeuvring to appoint the new head of the Bank”, said Oxfam’s head of inequality policy, Max Lawson. Lawson added: “This neo-colonial 80-year-old stitch up has to end if the World Bank is to retain any credibility with the rest of the world. “Joe Biden should back a fully transparent open recruitment process to show the world that his administration is different.” More than 500 warehouse jobs are being cut at fashion chain New Look under plans to axe the night shift at its site in Staffordshire, PA Media reports. The move to switch to a day shift only will impact 503 of its 1,200 workers at the group’s warehouse in Lymedale Business Park site, Newcastle-under-Lyme. But New Look is hoping to be able to re-employ some of those employees affected as it hires an extra 300 staff on the expanded day shift. A New Look spokesman said: “With this shift, it has become increasingly clear that the processes at the distribution centre no longer suit our operational needs. “Therefore, we are proposing a necessary change to working hours in the distribution centre, including the removal of the night shift. Regrettably, we expect this will result in a number of redundancies at the site. “We are focusing on supporting our affected colleagues at this time and we expect to be able to offer a considerable number of these individuals new roles on the day shift.” The nasty surprise from today’s US producer price inflation report means the FTSE 100 may not hit a new closing high tonight. It’s currently down 6 points today at 7991, having soared to 8047 points for the first time this morning. Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley, points out that the FTSE 100 has been a laggard in recent years: “Over the past two decades, the UK’s FTSE 100 index has been a poor performer compared with most other markets. The index, representing the 100 largest stock market-listed UK companies, is a mere 25% higher than at the turn of the millennium. “Admittedly, this represents an unflattering starting point. The index was puffed up by unsustainable valuations of ‘TMT’ stocks during the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s. Yet it has been a clear laggard against the US or emerging markets where investors have comfortably trebled their money – in capital growth terms alone. “Where the FTSE has stood out, and consequently generated respectable returns, is dividends – the profits declared by companies and paid to shareholders. Reinvesting these for growth has boosted returns substantially, and the old fashioned values of seeking out sustainable and growing pay outs from shares are a large part of why the index has hit the landmark of 8000 points.” Centrica’s record profits have made the front of the Evening Standard, who report that the surge in earnings has ‘sparked fury’. They quote Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey saying: “This is a betrayal for British Gas customers across the country who are struggling to keep their heating on. Once again the government’s failure to implement a proper windfall tax is allowing oil and gas businesses to make billions off the back of hardworking families. Worryingly, a gauge of factory activity in the Philadelphia region has moved further into negative territory. The Philadelphia Fedreal Reserve’s index of manufacturing activity has fallen to -24.3 this month, down from -8.9 in January,. This is the sixth consecutive negative reading, and the lowest reading since May 2020. Turkey’s central bank could cut interest rates next week, to support the economy after the devastating earthquake that struck last week. JP Morgan has prediced that the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey will lower its headline rate by a full percentage point, to 8%. The Wall Street bank has also estimated that direct costs from the destruction of physical structures in Turkey from the devastating earthquake on Feb. 6 could amount to 2.5% of growth domestic product or $25 billion. European Union countries are said to be “on good track” to adopt new sanctions against Moscow in time for the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24th February. Diplomats in Brussels have told Reuters that talks are underway between EU members over proposed new sanctions estimated to be worth some 11 billion euros ($11.8 bln) in trade flows. One EU diplomat familiar with the discussions said: “The package should be concluded well in time for February 24th, it’s on good track, there are no major sticking points.” Switzerland, meanwhile, has ruled out confiscating private Russian assets to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine, saying it would undermine the Swiss constitution. The Swiss Justice Ministry said on Wednesday that: “The confiscation of frozen private assets is inconsistent with the Federal Constitution and the prevailing legal order and violates Switzerland’s international commitments.” Switzerland has frozen financial assets worth around 7.5 billion Swiss francs (£6.7bn) under sanctions against Russians. Bond prices are also weakening, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on US Treasury bills. UK government bond yields are also higher, another sign that the markets are disappointed that inflation pressures are higher than hoped. Stock markets are taking a knock from the strong US PPI inflation report just released. The FTSE 100 has sunk back from its earlier record highs, and is now back below the 8,000-point mark which it cleared for the first time yesterday. US goods and services producers hiked their prices by more than expected last month, dampening hopes that inflation is easing. The Producer Price Index for final demand rose by 0.7% in January, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported. On an anual basis, producer prices jumped by 6% in the year to January. Economists had expected it would fall to 5.4%, from 6.5% in the year to December. Goods prices rose by 1.2% in Janary alone, which is the largest monthly increase since last June. This was driven by higher energy costs, with prices for gasoline increasing by 6,2% in the month. This is a sign that US inflation may be stickier than hoped, which may push the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates still higher, and hold them their for longer than expected. Especially with the US jobs market still strong last week. The dollar is rallying in response, pushing the pound down below $1.20. Just in: the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims has dropped, suggesting the jobs market is still strong. There were 194,00o fresh ‘initial claims’ for jobless support last week, down from 195,000 the previous week, and lower than expected – suggesting firms are holding onto workers. These are low figures in historic terms, which may indicate that the increase in US interest rates has not yet cooled the labour market. Millions of consumers with O2 and Virgin Mobile contracts are to be hit with an inflation-busting 17.3% increase in their bills for making calls, sending texts and using data, adding to pressure on households amid the cost of living crisis. The price hike is the latest in a series of big increases imposed on consumers for vital utilities, and will add to pressure on the government to step in with tougher protections. The telecoms operators – merged under the same umbrella company since 2021 – confirmed the cost of their airtime contracts, or what customers pay for calls, texts and data, would go up by the annual rate of retail prices index (RPI) inflation announced this week, plus 3.9 percentage points. Official figures on Wednesday showed RPI stood at 13.4% in January, landing consumers with a 17.3% increase in their airtime bills in total – almost triple the rate of growth for average workers’ pay. Consumers will see the increase from April. More here: France’s stock market is also celebrating a record high today. France’s CAC 40 index broke over its previous lifetime high this session, hitting 7,387.29 points. Hopes that Europe’s economy will avoid a recession have boosted stocks in Paris, as have Beijing’s push to reopen China’s economy Reuters explains: French stocks have risen nearly 14% so far this year, following a battering in 2022, boosted by hopes that the euro zone will narrowly avoid a recession and surging shares of luxury goods groups that rely heavily on Chinese shoppers. “France has particularly leveraged the faster-than-expected Chinese reopening,” said Andrea Cicione, head of research at TS Lombard. “The fact that there is significant chunk of consumer discretionary in there, particularly luxury goods as opposed to Germany for example, where consumer discretionary is mostly autos, is definitely a positive for France.” The boss of Centrica is refusing to say if he will waive his bonus for the past year, after the British Gas owner tripled its profits this morning. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, could be in line for a personal financial windfall after the company beat forecasts with profits of £3.3bn last year. However, he said on Thursday that it is “too early to have a conversation” about his potential bonus payout despite pressure from campaigners to reject it. Mr O’Shea told reporters: “On the bonus, we’ve been a bit more efficient this year, and we’re a bit earlier in the process. “Last year we reported a little bit later. It’s a bit early for us to say – the annual report will be published in March and it will have everything that you need.” Given the shocking revelations this month that agents working for British Gas had ignored customers’ vulnerabilities and broken into homes to fit pre-payment gas meters, there will surely be an outcry if O’Shea pockets a bonus for 2022. Mike Ashley’s sports empire could drop out of the FTSE 100 when the index is next reshuffled, in March. Frasers Group only rejoined the blue-chip index in September (when the takeover of defence firm Meggitt created a vacancy). It is currently the lowest-valued company on the FTSE 100, at around £3.7bn, so could be dislodged when index provider FTSE Russell recalculates which companies should be in the index. Investec, the most valuable member of the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms, has a market capitalisation of £5.17bn, enough to propel it into the blue-chip FTSE 100. FTSE Russell will conduct the review after the market closes on 28th February, with the reshuffle taking place on 20th March. Proactive Investors reported yesterday that Frasers is on the brink of a drop back to the FTSE 250 index, saying: In order to avoid companies yo-yo-ing between the two indices, a company must be able to climb into the top 90 by market cap to be promoted into the FTSE 100. Likewise, to be demoted, it must fall below the 110th position in terms of market cap. Based on current market caps, Frasers is on the brink of the drop, with its £3.6bn market cap putting it in 109th position. Ed Miliband MP, Labour’s Shadow Climate Change and Net Zero Secretary, has issued a statement on Centrica’s soaring profits: “It cannot be right that, as oil and gas giants rake in the windfalls of war, the Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives refuse to implement a proper windfall tax that would make them pay their fair share. “In a matter of weeks, the Government plans to allow the energy price cap to rise to £3,000. Labour would use a proper windfall tax to stop prices going up in April. “When it comes to oil and gas interests, Rishi Sunak is too weak to stand up for the British people. Only Labour is on your side - with a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis now, and a long term plan to cut bills for good and make Britain a clean energy superpower.” Over in Moscow, Russia’s top central banker has dashed hopes that capital controls could be lifted soon. Capital controls were introduced almost a year ago, including curbs on foreign currency withdrawals. They were brought in after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent the rouble plunging, helping the currency to recover. Reuters has the details: Russia’s central bank does not yet see an opportunity to significantly ease capital controls, Governor Elvira Nabiullina told reporters on Thursday, stating that it could extend restrictions on foreign currency withdrawals in March. Nabiullina said the controls that have been left in place are important for financial stability. Russia introduced capital controls to stabilise the FX market shortly after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine a year ago and the rouble tumbled to a record low. UK consumer spending weakened last week, the latest realtime economic data shows. But, takings at Pret A Manger rose, as workers returned to the office following rail strikes the previous week. The Office for National Statistics has reported that aggregate UK spending on debit and credit cards is estimated to have dropped by 3 percentage points last week. Younger shoppers cut back the most; debit card transactions by those aged 18-34 fell by 12 percentage points. But, the number of in-store transactions at all Pret A Manger locations increased in the week to 9 February 2023, apart from in “London Suburban” where they were broadly unchanged. Pret takings are a proxy for consumer spending and high street visits. The ONS says: This latest recovery in transactions may be partially because of the rail strikes in the previous week. Manchester stores saw the largest increase of 12 percentage points compared with the previous week, followed by Regional Stations where they increased by 9 percentage points. Centrica has beaten City forecasts with its 2022 earnings this morning, reports Keith Bowman, investment analyst at interactive investor: Bowman explains: Higher energy prices following the war in Ukraine helped push upstream adjusted operating profit to £1.79 billion from last year’s £663 million. Profit on the same basis for its British Gas supply business fell 39% to £72 million, while profit at its Irish supply business rose 11% to £31 million. Hindered by the loss of customer numbers as consumers look to reduce outgoings, its boiler and other services business saw an adjusted loss of £9 million. A final dividend of 3p per share follows the reinstatement of shareholder payouts at the half year results in July, and leaves the shares sat on an historic yield of around 4%. Centrica’s existing £250 million share buyback scheme is being extended by a further £300 million. In all, and as with business in general, elevated inflation is raising costs, Bowman adds: The weather and its unseasonal swings also cause uncertainty over customer energy demand, while a lot is already in the price after outperforming the FTSE 100 by 20%-plus over the last year. Here’s Ed Miliband, Shadow Climate and Net Zero Secretary, on Centrica’s profit surge: Shares in Standard Chartered are now up 3.5%, after the bank upgraded its forecasts and posted a 28% rise in profits for last year. Standard Chartered said the reopening of China after the pandemic is giving grounds for optimism, after it made a statutory pre-tax profit of $4.3bn (£3.56bn) for last year. Standard Chartered, which is focused on the Asia-Pacific region, told shareholders that the pace of economic recovery in many of its “footprint markets” was encouraging. “The recent opening-up of China and the generally receding impacts of COVID-19 should help,” it added. It also saw its net interest margin – the difference between what a bank charges for loans and pays for savings – increase by 0.2 percentage points as it benefited from a higher interest rate environment. CEO Bill Winters says the bank is upgrading its expectations, and now targeting “a return on tangible equity approaching 10% in 2023, to exceed 11% in 2024, and to continue to grow thereafter”. The scandal-hit owner of British Gas has reported record profits of £3.3bn boosted by soaring wholesale gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and as many households in Britain struggle with the cost of living, our energy correspondent Alex Lawson reports. Centrica’s bumper profits are likely to anger campaigners calling for tougher windfall taxes, lower bills and better treatment of vulnerable customers against the backdrop of the prepayment meter scandal. The company’s profits for 2022 more than tripled compared with the £948m in 2021, aided by soaring profits in its North Sea oil and gas division. They also surpass the company’s previous profit high of £2.7bn, recorded in 2012. British Gas faced widespread criticism earlier this month when it emerged that debt agents working for Britain’s largest energy supplier had ignored customers’ vulnerabilities and forced them on to prepayment meters to recover debts. The company suspended the use of court warrants to install prepayment meters and the government and Great Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, later ordered all energy suppliers to pause the tactic. Centrica’s North Sea profits are subject to a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators while it also has a 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear power stations, which are subject to the electricity generator levy implemented by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to capture windfall gains. However, Labour has called for the oil and gas windfall tax to be expanded to capture a greater proportion of profits. More here: Windfall tax calls will grow louder following Centrica tripling its profits to £3.3bn last year, even though the company paid nearly £1bn, predicts Tom Gilbey, equity research analyst at investment management firm Quilter Cheviot: Gilbey say: “Centrica produced some strong results this morning as its trading division took advantage of energy trends that came to dominate in 2022. Its adjusted profit grew over 250% to over £3bn , and it more than doubled its free cash flow, putting this to use by paying a dividend – which they only reinstated a year ago - and getting approval to buy back a potential 10% of their shares. It is this that may draw controversy given it is also benefiting from elevated energy prices and it has come under fire in recent weeks for its consumer practices. “The business still expects conditions to remain tough for customers and stressed it will try and support them, pointing to the fact it recruited 700 additional people over 2022 to help. Interestingly, Centrica paid around £1bn in tax, perhaps putting the larger energy producing giants to shame. However, with these profits quite so extraordinary for Centrica, calls are only going to grow for stricter windfall taxes, particularly in the run up to the general election next year. While the results are strong, it is a reminder that Centrica faces a number of headwinds, some of its own making but some out of their control.” Shares in Centrica have jumped by 6% at the start of trading in London. Investors are cheering its new £300m share buyback plan announced this morning, on top of the tripling of its profits last year. This has helped drive the FTSE 100 index to a fresh alltime high. It’s gained around 48 points or 0.6% to 8046 points, beating yesterday’s record high. Asia-Pacific focused bank Standard Chartered are also rallying, up 1.7% after reporting a jump in profits and a new $1bn share buyback programme. As flagged in the introduction, the FTSE 100’s surge to record highs reflects hopes that the world economy may avoid recession, rather than optimism specifically about the UK economy. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, explains: “With more than 80% of FTSE 100 revenues earned abroad, we see the move as more of a consequence of growing optimism surrounding the easing in inflation rates and risk of recessions globally, rather than necessarily an improvement in sentiment towards the domestic economy. “The harsh reality is that with UK inflation still stubbornly high, a recession remains very much on the cards, and that does not present a particularly encouraging environment for British stocks. Indeed, the FTSE 250 index, which has a greater weighting towards British firms, is still trading around 17% off its 2021 highs. “The recent drop in the value of sterling, which has fallen by more than 2% on the dollar so far this month, can also partly explain the boom, as this boosts the value of earnings from overseas.” The British arm of Aldi, the German discount supermarket chain, has announced plans to hire more than 6,000 workers in the UK, as part of its expansion plans. Aldi said new stores were planned in Norwich and Newcastle in England, and that it was also recruiting for 450 jobs across its 11 regional distribution centres. Giles Hurley, chief executive officer of Aldi UK, said: “Demand for Aldi has never been higher as more and more people realise they can make significant savings on every shop without compromising on quality. It’s more important than ever that we are making it even easier for more people to shop with us – including by opening dozens of new stores. “Our success is dependent on the amazing work that colleagues do, day in and day out, and we’re looking forward to welcoming thousands more colleagues to Team Aldi throughout 2023.” Aldi currently has more than 990 stores and employs around 40,000 people. Market research firm Kantar has reported that Aldi, and rival discount chain Lidl, have both seen sales growth, boosting their market share, as households have tried to control their shopping bills. Centrica has announced a new £300m share buyback this morning. That’s on top of its existing £250m share buyback programme. Share buybacks are a way of returning cash to shareholders (and to pump up a company’s stock price). Critics say they simply funnel money from customers, who may be strugging in the cost of living crisis, to wealthier investors. Dr George Dibb, head of the Centre for Economic Justice at IPPR, says the UK should tax such buybacks. ”These scandalous profits are undeserved and come directly from the pocket of bill-payers. We all know that wholesale energy prices have been sky-high for the past year, but that’s no reason that gas suppliers should be making higher profits on the back of higher bills. These profits, which are then being transferred directly to shareholders via buybacks and dividends, are a direct transfer away from bill-payers during a cost of living crisis. It is time to introduce a tax on share buybacks and use those revenues to support public services.” In the US, Joe Biden pushed through a 1% tax on corporate stock buybacks. Last week, the US president called for it to be quadrupled, in his State of the Union speech. Scope, the disability equality charity, are calling for a social energy tariff to help disabled people through the cost of living crisis. Tom Marsland, policy manager at Scope, said: “It’s obscene that energy companies continue to make massive profits as disabled people face devastating situations because they can’t afford enough energy. “Life costs a lot more when you’re disabled. We’re being inundated with heart-breaking calls from disabled people who haven’t eaten for days, who can’t afford energy to charge wheelchairs and stairlifts, but are still racking up huge energy debts. “As we’ve seen, many have been forced onto prepayment meters as a result, putting lives and health in danger. “Energy companies need to start putting disabled customers first. “We need a social energy tariff - a discounted rate - for disabled people, to put an end to sky-high energy bills.” Scope and Age UK have drawn up an open letter asking the government to introduce a social tariff, which can be signed here. Friends of the Earth are also calling for a tougher levy on energy company profits. Sana Yusuf, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, says Centrica’s earnings will fuel ‘further outrage’, given the cost of living crisis: “Another set of bumper profits from one of the companies fuelling the energy and climate crises will no doubt spark further outrage as millions of people struggle to pay their bills and face a drop in government support from April. “The new Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary [Grant Shapps] needs to step up and back growing calls for a tougher windfall tax on the excessive profits of fossil fuel companies like Centrica to help fund the investment in insulation and homegrown renewables needed to bring down bills and cut emissions.” The “obscene” profits reported by Centrica this morning show that the government should bring in a meaningful windfall tax on the energy industry, says the Unite union. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham says: “British Gas owner Centrica has been coining it in from our massive energy bills while sending bailiffs to prey on vulnerable consumers the length and breadth of the country. “These energy companies are showing us everything that is wrong with the UK’s broken economy. “Rishi Sunak should get a grip – pull the plug on rampaging energy profiteering, impose a meaningful, tough windfall tax and give the NHS a pay rise with the proceeds.” Centrica says today it paid nearly £1bn in tax related to its 2022 profits. The current windfall tax, or ‘energy profits levy’, was introduced last May and then increased in November. But critics say it is flawed, because it allows energy producers to offset increased development in the North See off their tax bill. British Gas’s adjusted operating profit decreased by 39% to £72m in 2022. Centrica says this “largely reflects voluntary donations made to support customers and the repayment of furlough funds received by the Group in 2020”. In August, British Gas announced it would donate 10% of its profits to help its poorer customers. The owner of British Gas has reported a surge in annual profits this morning, becoming the latest energy giant to benefit from the jump in energy prices since the invasion of Ukraine. Centrica made total operating profits of £3.3bn, a record, and more than three times as much as the £948m adjusted profits it made in 2021. The jump in earnings comes just weeks after British Gas suspended the forced installation of prepayment meters due to concerns over its treatment of vulnerable customers. Centrica says it benefitted from “strong gas production and electricity generation against a backdrop of higher commodity prices”. The company operates oil and gas production in the North Sea, plus holds interests in Britain’s nuclear power plants and operates an energy trading business. These divisions, rather thatn British Gas, provided the bulk of Centrica’s profits. Such high profits, when the energy crisis is fuelling the cost of living crisis, will intensify calls for tougher windfall taxes on the industry, with BP and Shell have also reported record profits for 2022. Chris O’Shea, Centrica chief executive, says: “Our performance in 2022 demonstrates the benefits of our balanced portfolio and our strong balance sheet. The energy crisis and cost of living pressures have created a challenging environment for customers and communities, but we have been able to provide much needed stability and support. We invested £75m in supporting our energy customers in 2022, which was greater than the £8 post-tax profit per customer earned by British Gas Energy. Whilst customers may see some relief given recent easing of prices, it remains clear that some will continue to need help and we will do what we can to support them in the year ahead.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK’s blue-chip share index is set to hit new record highs today, after hitting the 8,000 point mark for the first time on Wednesday. The FTSE 100 hit 8,003.65 points yesterday, before closing just below the 8k milestone at 7997.83 (a new closing high), as hopes grow that inflation may have peaked. Shares are set to keep rising today, as global stock markets continue to be cheered by optimism that central banks may ease their interest rate increases soon. Jason Hollands, managing director of online investment service Bestinvest, says the UK market is increasingly seen as a bargain by international investors. A number of large investment banks are taking a positive view on the opportunity, Hollands says, while some private investors have been “heavy sellers of UK equity funds for several months”, probably ground down by relentless gloomy news on the domestic economic outlook. However, the FTSE 100 is not a barometer of the UK domestic economy, given its dominance by multinationals such as banks, mining companies and oil giants. Hollands explains: It is a highly international index, which makes around 79% of its revenues overseas. This includes around 13% of revenues earned in China, and so these companies should also be a beneficiary of the expected rebound in the Chinese economy this year following its ditching of draconian COVID restrictions in December. “In recent years, many investors have dismissed UK blue chip shares as ‘boring’, lacking exposure to exciting sectors like technology and social media. But in a more trying economic environment, solid companies churning out reliable dividends are well worth considering. Boring is the new sexy. With an abundance of exposure to energy, commodities, consumer staples and healthcare companies, the FTSE 100 looks well placed for the current environment.” Since the start of January, the FTSE 100 index has gained 7% – which wouldn’t be a bad return for a full year. Other European markets have made an even more sparkling start, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC having gained around 12%. We get new US producer prices data and jobless claims figures later today, which may move the markets – if they change investors’ views of the path of inflation and interest rates.

Director Alla Gordiienko describes it as “a place for emotional shelter” where “everything we do starts with a book”. “A book is the best doctor for the soul,” says the librarian’s child psychologist Lada Tsybulska, one of the many roles that make this place special, especially during a war that traumatises Ukraine’s children. My late mother – Shirley Hughes, beloved author and illustrator of several hundred children’s books and winner of the all-time Kate Greenaway prize for children’s literature – would have found a corner of heaven in this place, were she not a citizen of the real thing. (She died in February 2022, the day after Russia launched its attempted full-scale invasion of Ukraine.) This place is what she dreamed of, and this is why much of Mum’s collection of her own books arrived here last month, why Dogger – who, along with Alfie and Annie Rose, was her most famous character – had to come to Ukraine. And not just to Kyiv: scores of books will move on from here, around the country’s library network, including children’s libraries on the frontline at battered Kherson, to bombarded Mykolaiv, and to Bila Tserkva, 50km south of the capita, to which the library at fallen Mariupol has been evacuated. Backtrack a few months: my brother, Tom, sister, Clara, and I were engaged in the heavy-hearted task of clearing out our family home of 67 years, with all its paintings and dust, books and more dust – plus the treasure trove of our mother’s artwork, dating back to her student days in 1947. And her collection of some 1,000 of her own books. What to do with a basement roomful? Some we kept, a few hundred Clara arranged for distribution to schools in Britain; teachers (outrageously) deprived of books crossed London with empty luggage to fill with their share. And for 555 of the books, a bold plan was being hatched. A friend, Raechel Isolda, was its prime mover; we had met through friends and colleagues at the Prix Bayeux awards for war reporting, given annually in Normandy, and for which I sit on the jury. And it turned out that Raechel’s bedtime reading as a child had been books by one Shirley Hughes. Raechel was working for Bibliothèques Sans Frontières, delivering books to refugee centres, mostly across Poland. The initial idea was to donate my mother’s books to these centres, and Raechel’s aunt Lesley and cousin Ewan duly arrived at the sad basement in Notting Hill to load up their vehicle. We added a score of books by my sister Clara, including her collaboration with Mum, Dixie O’Day. The plan encountered bureaucratic hurdles; the books crossed France and Germany last December only to languish in Poland, and Raechel – by then working as an independent humanitarian worker – had another idea: why not get them to Ukraine? Which she did, with deft juggling of trucks, drivers and paperwork. After spending Christmas in the Polish border entrepôt of Przemysl, Dogger and Alfie set off as part of a job lot, along “HIMAR Highway” through Lviv to Kyiv, into the war. On 17 March this year, the books that had left that basement under a cloud of bereavement now found themselves beautifully wrapped in blue and yellow ribbons, piled up on tables at the library in Kyiv, waiting for 120 children to arrive for a formal presentation, and a reading aloud of Dogger, by yours truly. It was an unforgettably wonderful, and moving occasion: there were videos of Mum (holding the real Dogger – a toy of mine – drawing and painting) on a screen, speeches by Raechel, director Gordiienko and me, and a terrific Q&amp;A with the children. Most of them wore traditional Vyshyvanka embroidered blouses and shirts specially for the occasion – as did I! A long Friday morning of reading, talking, laughter – and my mother’s spirit, here in Kyiv at war. * * * The previous week, as we set up the library, Gordiienko spoke with passion, but also a bright smile, about her work. She has worked here for four decades – “it’s the only job I ever had,” she says. At 17 she was a dancer, but suffered an injury to her leg and was taken in by the library’s founder, Anastasiya Kobzarenko, the only librarian ever to be decorated as a Hero of Ukraine, such was her commitment to this institution, and the official regard in which it was held. Gordiienko comes from Borodianka, near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant north of Kyiv, site of the world’s worst-ever civil nuclear disaster, in 1986: “I was 20 when that catastrophe occurred, so February 2022 was the second time I had had to flee my home.” Gordiienko shows awful images of columns of Russian tanks grinding down her street, a rocket that landed in the garden and the hole it made in her fence. “It was so scary, and strange. Like limbo, until eventually we got out – I, my daughter and grandchildren.” She shows a picture of the little ones, wrapped up in a bomb shelter, smiling nonetheless. The library commemorated its 55th anniversary last year, though, she says, “the enemy changed our plans for a celebration”. She shows a tapestry from 1978, the year the collection moved into this building, depicting a midsummer rite. The commitment to children’s literacy derives from Soviet times, says Gordiienko, “though the ethos has changed entirely. Now, it’s more: ‘What would you like to do?’ The children find books or activities they prefer; if they don’t want to read for themselves, they’ll be read to. And if it means something to them, they’ll come back – and they do.” Since the invasion, she says, “some children come in closed up like hedgehogs, and it’s a matter of letting them open. Sometimes it’s a good idea to let them run around and scream a bit.” She shows the disco, with flashing lights, “where they can let go and enjoy themselves” – though the vinyl LPs by the turntable in the music room are Chopin and folk songs. In Ukraine, publishers of children’s books are “obliged to give the national library a copy of every children’s book published,” says Gordiienko, and the collection is vast. Any library here is inevitably on another frontline: that of re-establishing Ukrainian culture and language in a country where many still speak Russian. Gordiienko explains that “there is no attempt to hide Russian classics and fairytales; coercion is never a good idea. It’s a long game: we conduct everything in Ukrainian, and there will be no new Russian books.” One could be forgiven for forgetting that we are in the middle of the biggest war of our lifetimes, until it’s time to visit the bomb shelter. Children have stayed here for three hours on occasion, grateful for the bookshelves, wifi and Zoom connections. Lada Tsybulska, the library psychologist, works in what she calls “a soul-space”, for children and parents. The position existed before the war to support parents and children, but in the present crisis Tsybulska’s work here is more urgent. An expert in trauma as well as books, she arrived in September 2022 from a similar post in a school. An important ingredient here is what they call Mama Time, “to help mothers unprepared for all this, and the anxiety passed on to children,” she says. “Here, they can be together, whether to share concerns or just chatter. A happy mother is a happy family.” Another set of sessions is for mothers and “pre-schoolers deprived of speaking skills and association because of kindergartens being shut”. When working with older children, many suffering from trauma, “it makes all the difference that I’m a psychologist working in a library, not a clinic. It’s no big deal for a troubled youth to be here, no one’s taking you to hospital, and everything starts with a book.” Beyond that, the library runs a bold scheme in conjunction with the criminal justice system, for incarcerated juveniles. There are Zoom sessions and book loans, “to keep them entertained, but also to teach them Ukrainian history, so there’s an educational element”, says Tsybulska. “The idea is to get them to esteem themselves, to be better citizens when they get out.” Which is not always soon: “Many of them are serious criminals, jailed for murder, rape or assault.” In Gordiienko’s office are gifts from imprisoned juveniles: a wooden schooner, and a carved icon of the Madonna and Child. In a little room, another librarian, Svitlana Kopiova helps children to fold tiny editions by Ukrainian poets, tying each with a ribbon, for soldiers to carry in their pockets. Her own son is back from the battle of Bakhmut, with a badly injured leg. She also teaches children to make rag dolls and angels “which the fighters attach to their uniforms, as talismans, and even their weapons”. * * * Kyiv is not the only place to which my mother’s books are travelling. From the capital I journey south to a frontline on the River Dnipro, to meet the recipients of the books heading to Kherson. During the few minutes it takes to park the car, walk a couple of blocks and climb the steps of the children’s library here, six explosions land from across the river – Russian rockets from the far bank, at the end of a deserted road cutting through a ghost city. Of a population of 330,000, 60,000 remain, all but invisible, cowering from the guns cheek-by-jowl. Kherson was liberated in November, but still endures daily and nightly bombardment. The children’s library, called the Dnipro Seagull Library after the emblem of the town, is for obvious reasons temporarily closed, but when it opens, Mum’s books will be here. Its director, Natalya Popova, shows me around. A lovely glass panel of the seagull of Kherson decorates the staircase. In 2001 there was an injection of funds from the US Peace Corps for a foreign books department with books in 37 languages, Hergé’s Tintin story Le Temple du Soleil displayed prominently. Upstairs, in a reading and lending room, are translated children’s editions of Shakespeare. There are newspapers and magazines: six titles are devoted to pets, and in the Ukrainian book section the overwhelming favourite is a book called 36.6 Cats by Halyna Vdovychenko, illustrated wonderfully by Natalka Haida. In a large, pink-painted hall, “children can act out what they’ve read, sometimes in front of their parents”. In another large upper room there’s a wall map of the Kherson district, with historical and natural landmarks. Our discourse is punctuated by the thud and boom of rockets from across the river. The art department, decorated with a mural of Venice’s Grand Canal, is “where children can learn about ancient Greece and Leonardo da Vinci, but also draw the Cheshire cat from Alice in Wonderland”, says Popova. In the audio centre “they can get acquainted with Haydn and Beethoven, and students from the conservatoire come to play”. Then the media centre, where children can learn “digital responsibility at our Code Club. There used to be computers here, but they were looted” (along with much else in Kherson, including the entire contents of the art museum, and a children’s train from a park playground). During the occupation, says Popova, “everything was so strange. All so familiar, still our city, yet not – it felt completely different. Our staff remained at home, but the Russians came to the library, broke the locks and installed a collaborator from the local school.” The library functioned, but Popova opens boxes of books taken from the shelves and marked Literature of Doubtful Content. They include books on Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity in 2014 and Joseph Stalin’s great famine of the 1930s, plus board games featuring a map of the US. “We’ll open again when we can,” she says, “when it’s safe, and we can make it cosy and comfortable.” * * * Some 50km north of Kherson, the city of Mykolaiv was under relentless bombardment until the Ukrainian offensive last November, after which the children’s library fully reopened. “We’re not yet up to pre-war numbers,” says its director, Tatiana Zhaivoronok, “but they’re coming back, about 60%. During the worst bombardment, we kept up a service: the front door was closed but parents would knock on the windows to ask for books, or call ahead. It gave us such pleasure to help while the city was besieged, and even more so to reopen. A lot of parents and children come from Kherson too, since their library is closed. Books help to distract people from – and deal with – the terrible reality. We need reminding of the time of peace, and books do that.” She shows pictures of the night of 3 April 2022, when a rocket made a direct hit on the library roof. “When we celebrated our centennial a couple of years ago, we never imagined we’d bear witness to things like this.” Many of Mum’s books will come here too: a library founded in 1921 that counts 3,000 registered members, “plus as many visitors and occasional readers”. In the infants’ room, Oksana Golosna explains how “parents come with almost newborns, to listen to fairytales and read-aloud sessions”. In a theatre space, “children can perform what they read”, says Zhaivoronok. In the domestic literature section, most popular are fantasy and fairytale, “though the boys are keen on encyclopedias”. And above all, Vdovychenko and Haida’s 36.6 Cats, and its sequels: Cats to the Rescue, Cat Companions and Cat Detectives. The music room boasts 5,000 scores, “the classics – Bach, Mozart – basic musical education, and folk music”. The Hobbies and You club is especially popular, teaching crafts and collecting. Upstairs, around a wonderful 10-sided table painted purple and green, children discuss their reading, and in the adjacent theatre, act it out. Things have changed here since Soviet times, says Zhaivoronok, “though common to both [the old system and independent Ukraine] is love of children and love of books – the need to bring knowledge and literacy to children”. Some 70% of the books on display are now in Ukrainian, she says, “though Mykolaiv is considered a Russian-speaking city. Our mission is to get children reading Ukrainian now; staff are teaching and reading aloud in Ukrainian. If anyone ever [had] any doubts about learning the Ukrainian language here, the Russians have put paid to them!” * * * Through all this inspiration, a chill wind blows. My mother spent most of her life filling the shelves of children’s libraries, but much of it promoting and protecting them – often in vain. And now her ghost needs to stalk Ukraine. “It’s all about financing now, and they raise the question of library closures, so far at regional level,” says Zhaivoronok. “They want to change them into youth centres,without the same emphasis on books and reading.” Back in Kyiv, Lyudmila Batsai says they are “sometimes told ‘There’s no model in the west for this kind of place, so why should we have it?’ For now we here are safe, but outside Kyiv the trend is towards closing rather than investing.” Her director, Alla Gordiienko, insists: “What we do here can only be done in a children’s place, a space where it is all about them.” When I went to see the Minister for Culture, Oleksandr Tkachenko, to plead (among other things) what I regard as my mother’s case and cause, he said: “We are proud of our children’s libraries,” but added: “libraries need to be modernised.” Recent reports in Britain demonstrate that almost one in five children have no access to books at home, and that 27% of 11-year-olds struggle to read. Some 800 libraries have closed since 2010 and four in 10 teachers have to buy books with their own money. The direct connection between the crisis in the UK and the closure of children’s libraries is brazenly obvious. I am a grateful visitor to Ukraine, and far be it for me to tell this brave country what to do. But I will not silence my mother, and at the donation event in Kyiv, I was quick to emphasise: “What you have here is priceless beyond measure, don’t jeopardise it.” Not least in a country affirming itself and its future in the Ukrainian language, with Ukrainian culture. Where better to begin than right here? * * * It was a heartwarmingly marvellous event at the Kyiv National Library. I spoke about Mum’s adolescence during the blitz of Liverpool, and how she would have understood what Ukraine was going through. About her switch from costume design to illustration as a student and her visit to Florence to behold the great masters and sketch postwar Italy in 1947, aged 20. About how it took my being at home from school, ill, to realise that Mum listened to jazz while she worked. Then I read Dogger, projected on to a screen and translated page by page into Ukrainian. Alla Gordiienko talked about the other libraries to which books were going and said they would “share in our victory”; that “a part of the European Union and the UK have arrived to be here with us, for our children to read and share with one another”. She presented me with a medal and a doll made by gracious Svitlana Kopiova. During the Q&amp;A the children were effervescent. One boy said he had lived in Cirencester, and could not figure out what the English national dish was – “I got a bit tired of fish and chips”. Well, we don’t have borscht or rolled millet, I granted him, but we do have vindaloo. An older girl asked for recommendations of children’s reading in English. Apart from the obvious, I offered: Edward Ardizzone’s Tim books, Alan Garner’s The Owl Service and everything by Philip Pullman. The national TV news ran a long item and another news report read: “Feelings of boundless joy and happiness are possible even during a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian children’s readers and children’s librarians felt these emotions today, because… the National Children’s Library of Ukraine was presented with a unique collection of books by the famous illustrator and writer Shirley Hughes.” Gordiienko has one regret, however, she told the children: “I wanted Ed not to finish the book, so you would all come back to find out whether Dave finds Dogger!” But they will anyway, and there’s the beauty of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/13/its-madness-ukraine-holds-breath-as-putin-turns-nuclear-plant-into-frontline","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"‘It’s madness’: Ukraine holds breath as Putin turns nuclear plant into frontline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/13/its-madness-ukraine-holds-breath-as-putin-turns-nuclear-plant-into-frontline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/13/its-madness-ukraine-holds-breath-as-putin-turns-nuclear-plant-into-frontline","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s madness’: Ukraine holds breath as Putin turns nuclear plant into frontline","bodyText":"On one side of the Dnieper River is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, visible in the haze. Six nuclear reactors and a cooling tower loom over a Soviet-built reservoir. On the opposite bank is Nikopol, a city in southern Ukraine known for its Cossack past and modern tube and metallurgical factories. The distance between them is seven kilometres. Or, measured in rocket terms, about 15 seconds: the time it takes for a Grad missile fired by Russian soldiers ensconced in the atomic station to slam into Nikopol’s chestnut tree-lined boulevards. It is a small and terrifying interval between life and death. The sprawling nuclear plant is Europe’s largest. In March, Russian forces seized it, as part of Vladimir Putin’s blitzkrieg operation to capture the whole of Ukraine. They rolled into the nearby city of Enerhodar and took the station’s local staff hostage. The plant is now on the frontline between Russian-occupied and Ukrainian-controlled territory. In the first phase of the war Nikopol was peaceful, a place of safety for refugees from the eastern Donbas and other troubled regions. And then, on 12 July, Moscow began lobbing incendiary devices across the river. The Russians are using the nuclear station as cover. They have mined the complex. Multiple rocket launchers and tanks nestle among the reactors. Even by Putin’s amoral standards, it is an astonishing act of recklessness. In his latest address on Friday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of “unconcealed nuclear blackmail”. A “terrorist state”, it was threatening the “whole world” with armageddon. He urged the UN and international community to do something. On Friday, Russia’s permanent representation in the UN, Vasyl Nebenzia, said the country did not support a call by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to create a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant. The situation is perilous. According to Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, Russia has fired on the plant several times. Shells landed close to the fire station and director’s office, not far from a radioactive sources storage unit. Power cables and a wastewater pumping station were damaged. One worker was hospitalised, a shift rotation cancelled. Moscow blames Ukrainian artillery and claims it is acting responsibly. Zelenskiy suggests the Russians are shelling the plant as a deliberate provocation, designed to discredit Kyiv and to alienate it from its international partners. The Guardian did not see any evidence in Nikopol of Ukrainian military activity. There were a few thumps in the distance. It was unclear which side was firing. The Kremlin is trying to do something unprecedented: to steal another state’s nuclear reactor. Engineers are working to connect the facility to the electricity grid in occupied Crimea and cut it off from Ukrainian homes. One reactor has already been knocked out. It is a ghoulish game of radioactive Russian roulette, in a country that has known the 1986 Chornobyl atomic disaster. Before the invasion Nikopol was home to 106,000 people. About half have fled. On Thursday more were packing up to leave after a devastating and vandalistic night-time barrage. Russia unleashed 120 Grad missiles on the district, killing three people in Nikopol and another 13 in the neighbouring town of Marhanets, and wounding dozens, including a 13-year-old girl. All were civilians. At number 22 Viktor Usov Street, rescue workers were sifting through the debris. A corner had been gouged out of the five-storey residential building, as if clawed by some monstrous hand. Police had sealed the area off with tape. The remains of a rocket lay serenely on a grassy verge, broken in two: a motor and a tail section complete with fins. “It was midnight. The rocket fell on the apartment next to me. We managed to pull the mum and son out alive. But the elderly father, Anatoliy, was already dead. He was under 2 metres of concrete,” resident Vitaliy Chornozub told the Guardian. He added: “The Russians are fucking pederasts. They bring pain, dirt and tears. I can’t understand why they did this.” Another neighbour, holding a cup of coffee after a sleepless night, offered an explanation. “It’s jealousy,” Yana Sokolova said. “They can’t accept the fact we live better than they do. We are free. Russians are slaves. They want to make us slaves as well.” She added: “Putin is a terrorist. We will never surrender. His attempt to bully us won’t work.” Sokolova said she would stay put, despite the early morning attacks, which have led some residents to drive out before evening curfew and spend the night in tents, set up among sunflower fields. The Grad knocked out the internet connection in Sokolova’s apartment but did not damage her ground-floor shop, she said. “We are tired. But our boys are standing firm,” she added. It is unclear why Russia began offensive operations from inside the nuclear station and the adjacent settlement of Vodiane. One explanation is Moscow’s grandiose war is beginning to falter. Six months on, Russian troops have seized much of the east of the country, including the entirety of the Luhansk region, and a chunk of Donetsk. They are grinding forward, slowly and brutally. In the south, however, Russia suddenly looks vulnerable. Since July the Ukrainian army has used US-made precision-guided Himars weapons to destroy four key bridges over the Dnieper River. And on Tuesday Kyiv struck deep behind enemy lines, wiping out Saky aerodrome on the west of Crimea, destroying at least eight war planes, and prompting thousands to flee back to the Russian mainland. A Ukrainian counter-offensive looks possible, though not inevitable. Until it happens, Russia can use Enerhodar as a full-scale military base, as it did with Chornobyl during the first six weeks of the conflict. Russia’s nuclear agency Rosatom says it is now in charge of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency has demanded access, and called on the Russians to demilitarise it. “It’s complete madness from Russia. They know the Ukrainian army can’t fire back,” said Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the military administration in Kryvyi Rih, 40 miles north of Nikopol. Vilkul, a former deputy prime minister responsible for emergency situations, said Russia had become a “totalitarian sect”, run by a mad dictator obsessed with his place in history. “It’s a strange cult. There is Lenin and victory in the second world war and a religious faith in the nuclear arsenal. Their god is the nuclear button,” he said. He added: “Putin doesn’t really care about Russia. He wants to take his place alongside Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great and Stalin”. How would the war end? “Like Hitler, Putin will destroy his own country,” he predicted. Further up Ustov Street, another Grad had punched a Lego-like hole into a third-floor flat. Its owner, Alexsandr Suvorov, said he had been at work on his computer at midnight when he heard the sound of an outgoing missile. “I knew they arrive from Enerhodar so I immediately moved into the next room. Suddenly, the door blew past me,” he recalled. Showing photos of the wreckage on his mobile phone, Suvorov said he had been extremely lucky. The Guardian met him in the local administration building as he filed a police report. It was unclear when compensation might be paid, or where he might live now. “I would like to leave. It’s very dangerous. First I need to get plywood to cover up the hole,” he said. Other residents were not as fortunate. A rocket landed on a block where most of the tenants were elderly people, killing a woman. A crane was parked up outside; municipal workers trying to make the building safe threw masonry down from a ruined upper storey. Three schools and more than 40 private buildings were damaged, as well as cars and shops. “This is the reality we live in. We don’t know if we will wake up the next day,” said Anna Sidilova, the property’s manager. “Peaceful people live here. They didn’t have any weapons. They just want to live in their own homes.” What did she think of Putin? “He should be punished the same way, according to world law. He should be deprived of everything he has.” Just across the road a Grad had landed on Nikopol’s Soviet war memorial. There was a deep crater in the alley of glory, not far from a needle-shaped monument and a wall inscribed with the names of soldiers who fell during the second world war. The strike spoke to the ideological vacancy of Putin’s Ukraine invasion, ostensibly carried out to protect Russian speakers and to return a wayward province to its historic Russian and Soviet roots. Nobody knows when, or indeed how, Europe’s bloodiest conflict for 80 years will end. For now, Ukrainians are reacting with defiance, bravery and even humour to the carnage and horror around them. At a checkpoint between Nikopol and Dnipro, someone this week erected a tombstone by the side of the road. It had Putin’s face on it and a date, 1952-2022. Fresh earth had been shovelled to make a faux grave. The slab said in Ukrainian: “Vladimir Putin. Go fuck yourself. Never forgive and never forget.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/feb/16/tory-mps-high-energy-bills-net-zero-scrutiny-group","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-16T12:00:06Z","webTitle":"Tory MPs who blame high energy bills on net zero should look to their own policies | Caroline Lucas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/16/tory-mps-high-energy-bills-net-zero-scrutiny-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/16/tory-mps-high-energy-bills-net-zero-scrutiny-group","fields":{"headline":"Tory MPs fear that net zero is hurting poor people. Ignore their crocodile tears","bodyText":"Partygate has suggested that the prime minister has, shall we say, a flexible approach to the rule of law. The laws of physics, you would think, cannot be treated so carelessly – yet that is what is happening inside the Conservative party. There has been a relentless push by some MPs for the UK to abandon our climate targets and slow down, or even abandon, the transition to net zero emissions. The goal of net zero by 2050 at the latest is not some fashionable green meme or virtue signalling by the comfortable middle classes. It is the measure we must take to keep the already painful and life-threatening impacts of climate change within the bounds of the manageable. This goal is shared not just by scientists and environmental campaigners but by 192 governments, more than 90 major banks and all of the world’s major investment managers. Action on climate change is one of the few remaining areas where Britain has a credible claim to global leadership. Only three months ago, we were hosting the UN climate summit, Cop26, the most important international gathering in the UK for decades. We have set the pace in decarbonising our own economy and creating the global governance system to manage the response to the climate crisis. We have done so because it is in our national interest, as successive governments, Labour and Conservative, have recognised. We cannot ask other countries to aim for net zero if we abandon our commitment to it ourselves. Yet that is just what the tiny group of Conservative MPs in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group are trying to make us do, in the latest salvo of their eccentric opposition to sound science. Led by Steve Baker and Craig Mackinlay and some of their faithful cheerleaders in the rightwing press, they are demanding the prime minister abandons the green levies that help finance Britain’s drive to net zero, out of apparent concern over soaring energy bills. They are right to be worried about the impact of energy price rises on everyone in Britain, especially low-income households. The welfare of millions of people is at risk, potentially threatening social cohesion. But their crocodile tears about the impact on the least well-off would be more credible if their party’s action hadn’t contributed to the state we’re in, because the Conservative government’s decision to “get rid of all the green crap” a decade ago means that the UK’s energy bills are £2.5bn higher than they would otherwise have been. Meanwhile, the Cameron government’s cut to energy-efficiency subsidies has had a dramatic effect on the programme to insulate Britain’s notoriously draughty housing stock. In 2012, over 1.5m homes in Britain had their lofts insulated, cutting energy bills and providing a large number of jobs all over the country. Last year, only 32,000 lofts were insulated. Scrapping the zero carbon homes standard, as the Conservatives did in 2015, has led to more than a million new homes being built to lower energy efficiency than they would otherwise have had, resulting in higher bills for those living in them. There is something deeply confused about the Baker-Mackinlay attack on green levies as a burden on poorer people, when those levies have played a significant part in keeping energy bills down. Wind and solar generators in the last quarter of 2021, far from being a charge on bills, actually contributed £160m to lowering them. Furthermore, the MPs’ supposed concern for the least well-off in society didn’t stop them voting this month for a new “green” levy to finance nuclear power stations that will put bills up. In any case, as has frequently been pointed out by energy experts, global gas prices are overwhelmingly responsible for the spike in energy bills, not green levies. Baker and Mackinlay and their ilk are paying more attention to energy lobbyists than the markets. Why else would they be arguing for more fracking or further North Sea gas investment, supposedly to drive bills down, when they know that any gas produced would sell at today’s global gas prices and simply feed windfall profits? But there is a growing risk that in his efforts to keep his job the prime minister will be tempted to add green levies or Britain’s climate targets to the “red meat” being thrown to the Baker-Mackinlay groupuscule, to the concern of climate diplomats such as the architect of the Paris agreement, Laurence Tubiana. The government would do better to take its ideological foot out of its mouth and keep its manifesto promise to spend £9bn of public money on the energy efficiency that would actually help consumers as well as the planet.

Here’s where we stand: Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, has published a video that he said shows his fighters in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. In a post on Telegram, uniformed men are seen lifting a Wagner banner on top of a heavily damaged building. The video has been geolocated to the east of Bakhmut, about 1.2 miles from the city centre, where Wagner fighters have been for a while. A meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 (G20) industrialised and developing nations in New Delhi has ended with no consensus on the war in Ukraine. Most G20 members strongly condemned the Ukraine war, with Russia and China disagreeing, said the G20 president, India, after the meeting. India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said there were “divergences” on the issue of the war in Ukraine “which we could not reconcile as various parties held differing views”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, spoke for less than 10 minutes on the margins of the G20 meeting in New Delhi today, according to a US state department official. Blinken reiterated to Lavrov that Washington was prepared to support Ukraine’s defence for as long as it took, the official said, in what is believed to be their first one-on-one conversation in person since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Blinken said he told Lavrov that Washington would push for the war in Ukraine to end through diplomatic terms that Kyiv agreed to. Blinken said he had also urged Moscow to reconsider its “irresponsible decision” and return to participation in the New Start nuclear treaty, and that he had also urged Russia to release the detained US citizen Paul Whelan. Ukrainian forces are hanging on to their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut under constant attack from Russian troops. Russia says seizing Bakhmut would open the way to fully controlling the rest of the strategic Donbas industrial region bordering Russia, one of the main objectives of the invasion it launched on 24 February 2022. Ukraine says Bakhmut has limited strategic value but has put up fierce resistance. “I believe that, sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” the Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on NV radio late on Wednesday. Russia attacked a five-storey residential block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing four people and injuring eight others. The Zaporizhzhia regional military administration said Russia appeared to have used a S-300 missile for the strike. A spokesperson for Russian proxies in the partially occupied region, which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, said – without producing any evidence – that the strike was the result of the actions of Ukrainian air defences. The Kremlin claimed Russia had been attacked by “terrorists” after conflicting reports of firefights emerged from the Bryansk and Kursk regions, which Russian media blamed on Ukrainian “sabotage groups”. The reports of fighting in Russia near the Ukrainian border began on Thursday morning. The head of the Bryansk region claimed that a “sabotage group opened fire on a moving automobile. As a result, one resident was killed; a 10-year-old child was injured.” In Ukraine, the reports were quickly interpreted as a “false flag” attack launched by Russia to discredit the Ukrainian armed forces. “The story about [the Ukrainian] sabotage group in [Russia] is a classic deliberate provocation,” wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser. There was no immediate video or photo of the fighting to confirm the reports of deaths. Vladimir Putin planned to hold a meeting of the security council, Russia’s main military decision-making body, on Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Peskov said he had also cancelled a trip to Stavropol. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has urged China not to send weapons to help Russia’s war in Ukraine, and instead asked Beijing to exert pressure on Moscow to pull back its forces. In a speech to the German parliament, Scholz said it was disappointing that Beijing had refrained from condemning the Russian invasion, though he welcomed its efforts towards nuclear de-escalation. Evidence collected from Kherson in southern Ukraine shows Russian torture centres were not “random” but instead planned and directly financed by the Russian state, according to a team of Ukrainian and international lawyers headed by a UK barrister. The lawyers, called the Mobile Justice Team, said on Thursday they had investigated 20 torture chambers in Kherson and concluded they were part of a “calculated plan to terrorise, subjugate and eliminate Ukrainian resistance and destroy Ukrainian identity”. A new team of nuclear experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have taken up their post at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine after a delay of almost a month, the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, has said. In a statement, Grossi said the presence of IAEA monitors at the station was “indispensable to help reduce the risk of a nuclear accident”. A Russian regional politician is to appear in court to face accusations that he discredited the armed forces by posting a video of himself listening to a speech by Vladimir Putin with spaghetti draped over his ear. Mikhail Abdalkin, a Communist party lawmaker in the Samara regional parliament, said his case would appear before the Novokuybyshev city court next week. Abdalkin posted his video on “V Kontakte”, Russia’s equivalent of Facebook, shortly after Putin’s state of the nation speech on 21 February. Accompanying the video was a caption saying he had been asked to watch the speech by the deputy chair of the Samara parliament. The video referred to the Russian saying that when noodles have been hung on someone’s ear, that person has been strung along or deceived. “We will fight to prove our non-involvement and innocence,” Abdalkin said. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, has published a video that he said shows his fighters in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. In a post on Telegram, uniformed men are seen lifting a Wagner banner on top of a heavily damaged building. One of the men is shown dancing and holding a guitar, a reference to Wagner’s informal nickname of “the musicians”. Prigozhin was quoted by his press service as saying: The lads are mucking about, shooting home video. They brought this from Bakhmut this morning, practically the centre of the city. The video has been geolocated to the east of Bakhmut, about 1.2 miles from the city centre, where Wagner fighters have been for a while. Ukrainian forces were reported to be hanging on to their positions in Bakhmut earlier today, but to be under relentless attacks from Russian forces. Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, has said his country faces “some difficult choices” as he reconsiders its relationship with its traditional Slavic ally, Russia. In an interview with Politico, Vučić indicated that he believed the time had come to rethink Serbia’s refusal to join western sanctions against Russia. He said: You’re going to get one sentence from me: Serbia will remain on its EU path. Okay, draw your own conclusions. But I think you understand me. He added: We’ll have some difficult choices in the future, no doubt. That’s all I can say. Vučić reiterated that Russia should halt its efforts to recruit Serbs to fight alongside its Wagner paramilitary group in Ukraine. The Serbian legislature bans the participation of its citizens in conflicts abroad and several people have been sentenced for doing so. Serbs who have been recruited to fight in Ukraine “are going to be arrested when they come back to Serbia and [are] within reach of our institutions. You don’t recruit like that in a friendly country,” Vučić added. Serbia is a candidate to join the EU, its main trade partner and investor, but it also maintains trade and military cooperation with Russia, a traditional Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally. Although it repeatedly condemned Russia’s invasion against Ukraine at the UN and several other international forums, Belgrade has also refused to impose sanctions against Moscow. A new team of nuclear experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have taken up their post at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine after a delay of almost a month, the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, has said. The “long-delayed” rotation of IAEA allows the three experts who had been at the site since early January to finally begin their journey back to IAEA headquarters. In a statement, Grossi said the presence of IAEA monitors at the station was “indispensable to help reduce the risk of a nuclear accident”. He added: Our courageous experts – working closely with the plant’s operating staff – are providing technical advice and monitoring the situation in extremely difficult and challenging circumstances. Grossi reiterated his “determination to help protect the plant by agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone there”. Air raid alerts have been reported across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. Euan MacDonald of the New Voice of Ukraine has posted a map showing which regions of Ukraine are covered by the air raid alerts, adding that a MiG-31K fighter jet has taken off in Belarus. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he told Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Washington would continue to support Ukraine for as long as it took when the pair met briefly on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of foreign ministers in New Delhi. Blinken said he had told Lavrov that Washington would push for the war in Ukraine to end through diplomatic terms that Kyiv agreed to. “End this war of aggression, engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace,” Blinken said he had told the Russian foreign minister. He added: President Putin has demonstrated zero interest in engaging, saying there’s nothing to even talk about unless and until Ukraine accepts and I quote ‘the new territorial reality’. Blinken said he had also urged Moscow to reconsider its “irresponsible decision” and return to participation in the New Start nuclear treaty, and that he had told Lavrov that “mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries”. He added: No matter what else is happening in the world, in our relationship, the United States is always ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did even at the height of the cold war. He said he had also urged Russia to release the detained US citizen Paul Whelan, and Washington had “put forward a serious proposal. Russia should take it.” It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 (G20) industrialised and developing nations in New Delhi has ended with no consensus on the war in Ukraine. Most G20 members strongly condemned the Ukraine war, with Russia and China disagreeing, said the G20 president, India, after the meeting. India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said there were “divergences” on the issue of the war in Ukraine “which we could not reconcile as various parties held differing views”.

Copenhagen police said they had attended the scene and recorded “a case of vandalism” and that they were trying to find “traces” in the area. An investigation has been opened into the act, seen as a sign of support for Moscow in the war in Ukraine. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. In the besieged city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, the volunteers collecting the civilian dead risk becoming casualties themselves. “Where? Where?” demands Daniel Wilk, a Canadian driver, in shaky video footage shot recently inside the city and seen by the Guardian. Wilk proceeds quickly, the anxiety of the situation visible in his movements as he is directed to a fence, cutting an uncertain path across the snow as another voice cries “no, no” repeatedly. The bodies, when Wilk gets to them, have been cut in half by the force of the explosion that took their lives, and still lie where they fell three days before. Quickly they are bundled up in a sheet to be removed. People who have managed to reach Bakhmut in the past week use the same word to describe what they have experienced: hell. As flames and smoke ring into the sky from blazing buildings, the city, almost totally encircled by Russian forces, has been raked by constant gunfire and explosions in recent days. With roads leading to the city under constant fire from two sides, and with snipers in the streets, accessing the city has become ever more perilous for rescue teams, as speculation has mounted that Ukrainian forces will have to withdraw. “We haven’t been able to reach the downtown area in recent days,” said Olha Danilova, who like Wilk works for a Ukrainian NGO, Dobryi Rukh, which has been working in Bakhmut for all of the seven months of the Russian assault. The closest we could get was 500 metres from the city centre. It’s very loud. Everything is being shelled with mortars. It’s inaccessible. We were trying evacuate civilian from down by the river last time. We couldn’t even get close. The main road we used to use is being shelled constantly. The 27th [of February] was the worst. That was the hell day. It was the hardest day we’ve had since we’ve been working here. It was a wall of fire. Two walls of fire. It was coming from all sides, and aviation was attacking. Read the full report by Peter Beaumont: Poland and Ukraine have called for international sanctions against Russia’s nuclear energy sector, after the EU adopted its latest package of sanctions that did not include Moscow’s nuclear energy sector because of opposition from some EU member states. “If we want to develop nuclear … we need to suspend Russia in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),” Poland’s climate and environment minister, Anna Moskwa, said at an energy conference in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. We need to end any nuclear cooperation with Russia … and I believe Europe will manage to do so. Nuclear sanctions next package – this is our future challenge we need to face no matter how difficult it is. She said Russia’s occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power in southern Ukraine was a “very huge danger to our economies, to our society, to our security”. “We should get rid of Russians in the nuclear sector, in a civilised world they cannot be present as a partner of business,” Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said at the same conference. He added: They destroy everything, they destroy all seven pillars of nuclear safety and security. Reuters has a quick snap from the sidelines of the G20 meeting that US secretary of state Antony Blinken claims to have told Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov that whatever else was happening in the world, the US was always ready to engage with Russia on the issue of strategic arms control. Blinken and Lavrov met briefly in New Delhi, according to US officials, in what would have been their first face-to-face meeting since Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine commenced in February 2022. Last Tuesday, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said his country would halt its participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty. Moldova’s parliament adopted a declaration on Thursday condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has contributed to a rise in tensions between Moscow and Chișinău. A narrow majority of 55 lawmakers in the 101-seat assembly voted for the declaration, which stated that Moscow’s invasion began with the seizure of the Crimea peninsula in February 2014 and demanded the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine. Reuters reports the declaration said Russia was waging an illegal, unprovoked and unfounded war of aggression in Ukraine that violated the principles of international law, and echoed calls by Kyiv for an international tribunal to prosecute war crimes. Tensions between Russia and Moldova, the small former Soviet republic which borders Ukraine, have grown sharply since the war began. Moldova has protested to Moscow that Russian missiles aimed at Ukraine have entered its airspace and that missile debris has landed inside its borders, and it has accused Moscow of plotting to topple the pro-European government in Chișinău. Russia has denied the allegation and accused Ukraine and other countries of stoking instability in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, where about 1,500 Russian troops are based. Chișinău and Kyiv have dismissed the accusation. The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reports seeing an increase in the number of people claiming that images from Ukraine are fake. He writes that it is his fifth trip to Ukraine and his sense of outrage is only getting stronger. “Listen to the people who are here,” he adds. In Ukraine, the reports of firefights emerged from the Bryansk and Kursk regions were quickly interpreted as a “false flag” attack launched by Russia to discredit the Ukrainian armed forces. “The story about [the Ukrainian] sabotage group in [Russia] is a classic deliberate provocation,” wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser. [Russia] wants to scare its people to justify the attack on another country and the growing poverty after the year of war. The partisan movement in [Russia] is getting stronger and more aggressive. Fear your partisans … The Kremlin claimed Russia had been attacked by “terrorists” after conflicting reports of fighting emerged from the Bryansk and Kursk regions, which Russian media blamed on Ukrainian “sabotage groups” and Ukrainian sources called a “provocation”. The reports of fighting in Russia near the Ukrainian border began on Thursday morning. The head of the Bryansk region claimed that a “sabotage group opened fire on a moving automobile. As a result, one resident was killed; a 10-year-old child was injured.” Other reports of hostages being taken or school buses being fired upon have been discredited, even by local Russian officials. In an online statement later corroborated by the independent Russian news site iStories, a group called the Russian Volunteer Corps claimed its fighters had crossed the border into Russia on Thursday but denied reports of civilian casualties. The reports of the attack set off a flurry of activity in the Kremlin and at Russia’s security services. Russia’s FSB security service claimed it had launched an operation “to destroy armed Ukrainian nationalists who violated the state border”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the president, Vladimir Putin, would plan to hold a meeting of the security council, Russia’s main military decision-making body, on Friday. Peskov said he had also cancelled a trip to Stavropol. He said: We are talking about a terrorist attack. Measures are being taken to eliminate them. Asked whether Russia could change the status of its “special military operation” after the reported attacks, Peskov said: I don’t know. I can’t say for now. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been pictured in New Delhi where he is attending a meeting of top diplomats from the G20 countries. A meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 (G20) industrialised and developing nations in New Delhi has ended with no consensus on the war in Ukraine. Most G20 members strongly condemned the Ukraine war, with Russia and China disagreeing, said the G20 president, India, after the meeting. India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said there were “divergences” on the issue of the war in Ukraine “which we could not reconcile as various parties held differing views”. He said: If we had a perfect meeting of minds on all issues, it would have been a collective statement. Much of the talks were dominated by discussions of the war and China’s widening global influence, he said, adding that members agreed on most issues involving the concerns of less-developed nations, “like strengthening multilateralism, promoting food and energy security, climate change, gender issues and counter-terrorism”. The Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, one of Denmark’s most notable landmarks, has been vandalised with a Russian flag painted across its base. The colours of the white, blue and red ensign were on Thursday found daubed on the rock on which the statue of the heroine from Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale rests. Copenhagen police said they had attended the scene and recorded “a case of vandalism” and that they were trying to find “traces” in the area. An investigation has been opened into the act, seen as a sign of support for Moscow in the war in Ukraine. Read the full story here: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, spoke for less than 10 minutes on the margins of the G20 meeting in New Delhi today, according to a US state department official. Blinken reiterated to Lavrov that Washington was prepared to support Ukraine’s defence for as long as it takes, the official said, in what is believed to be their first one-on-one conversation in person since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Blinken also called for Moscow to reverse its decision to suspend participation in the New Start nuclear treaty and to release detained US citizen, Paul Whelan. The official said: The secretary saw the purpose of this was to deliver these three direct messages, which we see as advancing our interests. We always remain hopeful that the Russians will reverse their decision and be prepared to engage in a diplomatic process that can lead to a just and durable peace, but I wouldn’t say that coming out of this encounter there was any expectation that things will change in the near term. Lavrov did not mention the meeting during a news conference he gave after Thursday’s G20 foreign ministers’ meeting. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, confirmed the meeting took place, telling CNN: Blinken asked for contact with Lavrov. On the go, as part of the second session of the [G20], Sergey Viktorovich [Lavrov] talked. There were no negotiations, meetings, etc. Boris Johnson is delivering the keynote address at London’s soft power summit, where he says democracy matters because Vladimir Putin would never have made “the catastrophic mistake of invading Ukraine”. Putin would “never have been so deluded about the true nature” of Ukraine if Russians lived in a free society with free media. [Putin] would have known that the Ukrainians are a great patriotic people and that they would fight for every inch of their land. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has been speaking at a soft power summit in London, where he was asked by the journalist Mishal Husain about the “striking difference” in polls that showed support for Ukraine between western countries and countries such as India and Turkey. Kuleba said there was a broad notion that the countries in the Global South was against Ukraine, but the reality was far more nuanced. He said there were three rules that he used in communicating with countries: First, he had “to speak with them. The more you speak, the more familiar they get with the issue.” The second was that he had to address them “with a lot of respect. Most of these countries are traumatised with their own history.” Finally, what really worked was “putting them in our shoes”, he said. What really works is just to say, are you ready to concede a square kilometre of your own country to your neighbour, simply because your neighbour decided to take the square kilometre away from you? The answer is always no. Here are some of the latest images from the scene of a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia in south-east Ukraine. At least four people have been killed and eight wounded in the attack, Ukrainian officials said. Russia has violated the world’s very principle of soft power, Olena Zelenska has said, and the world must decide “whether the language of aggression is acceptable to them”. Russia attacked not only Ukraine but all world principles of peaceful coexistence, human rights and the progress we have made. Why negotiate when you can launch missiles? Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, is delivering a video address at a soft power summit in London. The country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson are also expected to speak. You can watch live here: Ukrainian forces hung on to their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut early on Thursday under constant attack from Russian troops seeking to claim their first major victory for more than half a year. Russia says seizing Bakhmut would open the way to fully controlling the rest of the strategic Donbas industrial region bordering Russia, one of the main objectives of the invasion it launched on 24 February 2022. Ukraine says Bakhmut has limited strategic value but has put up fierce resistance. Not everyone in Ukraine is convinced that defending Bakhmut can go on indefinitely. “I believe that sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” the Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on NV radio late on Wednesday. Russia attacked a five-storey residential block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing three people and injuring six others. Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble. One of the people evacuated from the building was a pregnant woman. The building was “almost completely destroyed”, the city’s acting mayor, Anatoly Kurtev, said. The Zaporizhzhia regional military administration said Russia appeared to have used a S-300 missile for the strike. A spokesperson for Russian proxies in the partially occupied region which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed said – without producing any evidence – that the strike was the result of the actions of Ukrainian air defences. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has cancelled a planned trip to Stavropol amid reports of a Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Bryansk region. Russian media has reported that two villages near the border with Ukraine have been attacked, with at least one person killed. Details remain unclear, but the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described the incident as a “terrorist” attack. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Thursday urged China not to send weapons to help Russia’s war in Ukraine, and instead asked Beijing to exert pressure on Moscow to pull back its forces. In a speech to the German parliament, Reuters reports that Scholz said it was disappointing that Beijing had refrained from condemning the Russian invasion, though he welcomed its efforts towards nuclear de-escalation. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, accused Moscow of repressing domestic critics and called on UN-mandated investigators to keep documenting Russia’s alleged abuses in the Ukraine war, in a speech to the Human Rights Council. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, called on Thursday for the G20 to bridge differences over Ukraine, telling the opening of a meeting in New Delhi that global governance has “failed”. “The experience of the last few years – financial crisis, climate change, pandemic, terrorism and wars – clearly shows that global governance has failed,” Modi said in a recorded statement, opening the meeting of G20 foreign ministers. Russia’s foreign minister said on Thursday that many leaders from the west had turned the agenda of a G20 meeting in India “into a farce”. Sergei Lavrov told a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in New Delhi “a number of western delegations has turned the work on the G20 agenda into a farce, wanting to shift the responsibility for their failures in the economy to the Russian federation”. Blinken, meanwhile, said: “Unfortunately, this meeting has again been marred by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine.” Lavrov accused the west of “shamelessly burying” the Black Sea grain initiative that facilitates the export of Ukraine’s agricultural products from its southern ports. Ukraine has said that it would like to renew the deal for a period of at least a year to provide certainty to exporters, and to expand it to include the port of Mykolaiv. Ukraine’s state broadcaster, Suspilne, has reported on its Telegram channel that the water supply in Mykolaiv will be off Thursday between 11am and 5pm due to a shutdown at the pumping station. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Russian media outlets have been carrying reports claiming that Ukrainian forces entered Russian territory in Bryansk region, which borders northern Ukraine. Tass reports that head of the region, Alexander Bogomaz, gave the news, and that “according to the latest information, they entered two villages, there is a battle going on”. Details remain unclear, but Tass also reports: “The security forces confirmed that an operation is being carried out in the border area to destroy violators of the state border.” The state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported on its Telegram channel that the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, in his daily media breifing, said that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, cancelled a planned trip to Stavropol “due to the situation in the Bryansk region”. In his media briefing, Peskov said the incident had been an attack by “terrorists”. Tass suggests that “saboteurs attacked both Lyubechan and Sushany”, and that “Ukrainian forces fired at a vehicle, killing one person and injuring another, a 10-year-old child”. It reports: “The FSB confirmed to TASS that in the border area of the Bryansk region ‘measures are being taken to destroy the armed Ukrainian nationalists who have violated the state border.’” The claims have not been independently verified. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, accused Moscow of repressing domestic critics and called on UN-mandated investigators to keep documenting Russia’s alleged abuses in the Ukraine war, in a speech to the Human Rights Council on Thursday. Blinken described Russia’s civil society crackdown as a “systematic muzzling” and said UN investigators should continue documenting Russia’s Ukraine abuses to provide “an impartial record of what’s occurring, and a foundation for national and international efforts to hold perpetrators accountable”. Reuters reports his video address comes ahead of an expected speech by a senior Russian official, Sergei Ryabkov, who is due to appear before the same Geneva-based body for the first time since Moscow invaded Ukraine more than a year ago. Kateryna Mishchenko is a Ukrainian author, and this morning we have an adapted text of her closing address at Debates on Europe 2023 in which she asks: does Europe want Ukrainians as living partners or dead heroes? Even before Russia’s full-scale invasion, I often heard people refer to Ukraine as Europe’s back yard. Now it resembles a graveyard, the war itself a gravedigger – missiles and shells form huge pits, digging graves for Ukrainians themselves. This cemetery is planted with beautiful flowers – notions of unbreakability, courage and resilience, which should give hope, the promise of rebuilding and that life is possible after all the horror. A few weeks ago, I crossed the border between Ukraine and the European Union. Today there are no fast connections to or from Ukraine. The long journey has its own logic: the mental transformation takes time. In order to move from peace to war or from war to peace, one has to travel through a process, out of accelerated time – where the countdown applies not to seconds, but to human lives – into a time where there is room for reflection and discussion (sometimes just the wasting of words) and, most importantly, where there is time for choice. This mental metamorphosis creates anxiety, fear, disrupts sleep and deprives you of the most basic confidence in the ground under your feet, even when this ground is no longer dug up by shells and grave shovels. The borderline is felt as a kind of mental disorder. Perhaps the current Nato strategy of supporting Ukraine in doses can be viewed through the prism of the fatal political logic of the borderline. The repressed can wait. But for how long? Read more here: Kateryna Mishchenko – Does Europe want Ukrainians as living partners or dead heroes? Guardian journalist Peter Beaumont is driving from Kharkiv to Kramatorsk to cover the situation around Bakhmut. He has this to say about the car journey. We’ve been in Kupiansk for the last two days which has seen increasing shell fire from Russian artillery. We saw a lot of damage there, but coming south past Izium there are villages and towns that have been smashed to pieces. Extraordinary damage. We stopped in one place, where every building was damaged, some reduced to rubble, including what appeared to be a monastery or church. All along this section of the road there are mine warning signs. At one point we were surprised by an explosion ahead of us, a puff of grey smoke above the road. We could see soldiers who seemed unconcerned, so came closer and could see they were blowing up unexploded ordinance right by the road. Russia’s foreign minister said on Thursday that many leaders from the west had turned the agenda of a G20 meeting in India “into a farce”, the Tass news agency reported. “A number of western delegations has turned the work on the G20 agenda into a farce, wanting to shift the responsibility for their failures in the economy to the Russian federation,” Sergei Lavrov told a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in New Delhi. Meanwhile, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said the G20 meeting has been marred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Unfortunately, this meeting has again been marred by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine,” Reuters report Blinken said, adding that G20 countries must continue to call on Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on its Telegram channel that the water supply in Mykolaiv will be off today between 11am and 5pm due to a shutdown at the pumping station.

In a speech to the German parliament, Reuters reports that Scholz said it was disappointing that Beijing had refrained from condemning the Russian invasion, though he welcomed its efforts towards nuclear de-escalation. “My message to Beijing is clear: use your influence in Moscow to urge the withdrawal of Russian troops,” he said. “And don’t deliver any weapons to the aggressor Russia.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday accused the west of “shamelessly burying” the Black Sea grain initiative that facilitates the export of Ukraine’s agricultural products from its southern ports, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. Reuters notes that while remaining in the agreement, Russia has repeatedly complained about the west’s approach to the deal, struck last July, saying countries that have imposed sanctions on Moscow were not doing enough to ease restrictions on Russia’s own exports, in particular of fertilisers. Ukraine has said that it would like to renew the deal for a period of at least a year, to provide certainty to exporters, and to expand it to include the port of Mykolaiv. German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, met with her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, before the G20 meeting in India, the German foreign ministry said on Twitter on Thursday. “In the face of Russia’s brutal attack on Ukraine and the UN Charter, neutrality rewards the aggressor,” Reuters reports the ministry added in the tweet. The G20 meeting has been accompanied by an awkward set of bilateral meetings overshadowed by disagreements over the war in Ukraine, with some of the attenders pointedly not expected to meet face-to-face on the sidelines as might usually be expected. Suspilne, Ukraine’s national brodcaster, has raised the death toll from the strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia to three. It reports on Telegram: Three people were killed as a result of a Russian missile attack on a five-story building in Zaporizhzhia at night, the national police reported. Six injured were hospitalised, rescuers continue to work on the spot. Ukraine’s emergency services have released images from the scene of a missile strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine’s state broadcaster has reported that two people were killed, and that people were believed to be trapped under the rubble. In quotes being carried by Russian state-owned media, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-proxy who is chair of the We Are Together with Russia organisation that operates within the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, has claimed on Telegram, without providing evidence, that the blast was a result of Ukrainian air defence fire. He is quoted as saying: The work of the Ukrainian military over my native Zaporizhzhia led to the destruction of an apartment building and casualties among peaceful, innocent people. Today, at about 2.45am, two explosions sounded in the regional centre, temporarily occupied by the regime of Zelenskiy. According to Tass, Rogov went on to say that the armed forces of Ukraine are constantly firing anti-aircraft missiles over residential areas, not taking into account the security of the civilian population. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied areas of the country which the Russian Federation claimed to annex late last year. Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s first lady, has tweeted about the overnight attack on Zaporizhzhia, writing: Zaporizhzhia bravely resists the Russian aggressor. In retaliation, it attacks civilians. A high-rise building was deliberately hit last night. Three floors are completely destroyed. People died. We continue to search under the rubble. My condolences to the victims. We will not forgive this. Europe’s chief prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi has told Agence France-Presse she wants to go after people undermining sanctions against Russia. The European public prosecutor’s office is charged with probing any offence deemed to have cost the EU money, which often means tracking international crime gangs and sophisticated cross-border VAT fraud operations. The EU has imposed a series of ten packages of economic sanctions on Moscow as punishment for its year-old invasion of Ukraine, and the 49-year-old anti-graft champion wants to go after the gangs circumventing the measures to supply Russia’s war machine. “This is something that we already have been asked by the Commission – if we can deal with it. And our answer was: ‘Yes, we can do it. We are ready to do it’,” she said. “We have specialised prosecutors. We have offices in 22 member states … We are the only available tool in this moment at the European level that can fight with this kind of criminality.” Any decision to add sanctions-busters to the EPPO’s targets would be a political one, taken by the leaders of the EU member states. Not all have been supportive of her role – Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Poland and Ireland have assigned no prosecutors to the EPPO. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for now. My colleague Martin will take you through the rest of the day’s news. The UK Ministry of Defence has published a wartime weather forecast in its update today, predicting that “warmer than average conditions for the remainder of winter and spring”. While this is good news for people trying to stay warm, it will pose a challenge to Ukraine’s armed forces as the ground thaws, creating mud. Poor cross-country movement (CCM) caused by mud does “provide some advantage to defending forces”, the ministry said – presumably by slowing the attackers down. It added that, “It is almost certain that by late March, CCM will be at its worst after the final thaw. This will add further friction to ground operations and hamper the off-road movement of heavier armoured vehicles, especially over churned-up ground in the Bakhmut sector.” The G20 will see US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in the same room for the first time since July, but the two men are unlikely to hold talks, AFP reports. Western delegates fear China is considering supplying arms to its Russian ally and they will use the foreign ministers’ summit to discourage Beijing from intervening in the conflict. India’s longstanding security ties with Russia have put the host of Thursday’s meeting in an awkward diplomatic position after refusing to condemn the invasion over the past year. But EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was confident India would use the meeting to “make Russia understand that this war has to finish”. “Certainly the success of the meeting today will be measured in respect to what we will be able to do on that,” he told reporters Wednesday. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi called Thursday for the G20 to bridge differences over Ukraine, telling the opening of a meeting in New Delhi that global governance has “failed”. “The experience of the last few years – financial crisis, climate change, pandemic, terrorism and wars – clearly shows that global governance has failed,” Modi said in a recorded statement opening the meeting of G20 foreign ministers. “We are meeting at a time of deep global divisions … We all have our positions and our perspectives on how these tensions [can] be resolved. However, as the leading economies of the world, we also have a responsibility for those who are not in this room,” Modi said. India had wanted its G20 presidency this year to focus on issues such as alleviating poverty and climate finance, but the Ukraine war has so far crowded out other agenda items. Ukrainian forces hung on to their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut early on Thursday under constant attack from Russian troops seeking to claim their first major victory for more than half a year. Russia says seizing Bakhmut would open the way to fully controlling the rest of the strategic Donbas industrial region bordering Russia, one of the main objectives of its invasion a year ago on 24 February. Ukraine says Bakhmut has limited strategic value but has nevertheless put up fierce resistance. Not everyone in Ukraine is convinced that defending Bakhmut can go on indefinitely. “I believe that sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on NV radio late on Wednesday. “But for the moment, Bakhmut will be defended with several aims - firstly, to inflict as many Russian losses as possible and make Russia use its ammunition and resources.” No lines of defence should be allowed to collapse, Rakhmanin said. “There are two ways to approach this - an organised retreat or simple flight. And we cannot allow flight to take place under any circumstances,” he said. Among the people evacuated from the apartment block was a pregnant woman, photographs show. A Reuters photographer captured this photo of a Zaporizhzhia resident named Yurji holding the hand of his relative, Anna, who was in the apartment block when it was hit by a Russian missile. Russia attacked a five-storey apartment block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing two people, the city’s acting mayor, Anatoly Kurtev, said. Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble. The building was “almost completely destroyed”, Kurtev said. The Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration said Russia appears to have used a S-300 missile. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Russia attacked a five-storey apartment block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing two people, the city’s acting mayor, Anatoly Kurtev, said. Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble. And Ukrainian forces hung on to their positions in the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut early on Thursday under constant attack from Russian troops seeking to claim their first major victory for more than half a year. “I believe that sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” Ukrainian member of parliament Serhiy Rakhmanin said on NV radio late on Wednesday. “But for the moment, Bakhmut will be defended with several aims – firstly, to inflict as many Russian losses as possible and make Russia use its ammunition and resources.” We’ll have more on these stories shortly. First, here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainians survived the past winter thanks to government efforts to ensure energy and heat, but Russia still poses a threat to the generating system, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. “Winter is over. It was a very difficult one and every Ukrainian, without exaggeration, felt the difficulties,” the Ukrainian president said in a video message delivered after a meeting on energy issues. “But we managed to provide Ukraine with energy and heat. The threat to the energy system remains.” Russia has lost at least 130 tanks and armoured personnel carriers in a three-week battle at the town of Vuhledar in southern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. They said the “epic” fight on a plain near Vuhledar produced the biggest tank battle of the war so far and a stinging setback for the Russians, the New York Times reported. The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four US officials and other sources. The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy G7, to coordinate support for any possible restrictions. The Ukrainian military may decide to withdraw its forces from Bakhmut, an economic adviser to Zelenskiy has said. “Our military is obviously going to weigh all of the options. So far, they’ve held the city, but if need be, they will strategically pull back,” said Alexander Rodnyansky on CNN. “We’re not going to sacrifice all of our people just for nothing.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, said Ukrainian forces were putting up “furious resistance” against Moscow’s attempt to seize Bakhmut. Prigozhin said he so far had seen no signs of a Ukrainian withdrawal. The battle for Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as defenders hold out against relentless shelling and repel waves of Russian troops who have been carrying out a months-long campaign to capture it. Russia’s defence ministry has said its forces repelled what it described as a major Ukrainian drone attack on Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. “Six Ukrainian attack drones were shot down by air defence systems. Another four Ukrainian drones were disabled by electronic warfare,” the ministry said. Vladimir Putin has said he is preparing for a visit to Moscow by China’s president, Xi Jinping, Russian state media reported. The Russian leader said he planned to show the Chinese delegation the Moscow metro’s Bolshaya Koltsevaya line (Big Circle line) during their visit to the Russian capital. The leaders of China and Belarus – Xi Jinping and Alexander Lukashenko – have issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine and negotiations to bring about a political settlement. The joint call amounted to an endorsement of Beijing’s peace plan issued last week that called for respect of national sovereignty and “territorial integrity”. Finland’s parliament has overwhelmingly approved joining Nato. Finnish MPs voted 184 in favour of accepting the Nato treaties, with seven against and one abstaining, increasing the chances of it becoming a member of the transatlantic defensive alliance before its neighbour Sweden. Hungary’s president, Katalin Novák, urged lawmakers on Wednesday to ratify Finland and Sweden’s Nato entry “as soon as possible”. “It is a complex decision, with serious consequences, so careful consideration is necessary,” Novák said on Facebook. Germany will ramp up ammunition production as well as ensure it has enough replacement parts and repairs capacity in its defence industry to better support Ukraine, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said. Russia would only agree to extend the Black Sea grain deal if the interests of its agricultural producers were taken into account, Russia’s foreign ministry has said. The deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey, allows safe exports from Ukrainian ports and is up for renewal this month. Russia brought new legal amendments to parliament on Wednesday that further strengthen the country’s censorship laws, envisaging up to 15 years in jail for discrediting the armed forces or voluntary military organisations such as the Wagner group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/24/north-korea-test-launches-its-largest-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-yet","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-24T16:01:00Z","webTitle":"North Korea test-launches its ‘largest intercontinental ballistic missile yet’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/north-korea-test-launches-its-largest-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-yet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/24/north-korea-test-launches-its-largest-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-yet","fields":{"headline":"North Korea test-launches its ‘largest intercontinental ballistic missile yet’","bodyText":"North Korea has launched what is thought to be its largest intercontinental ballistic missile to date, in a dramatic return to long-range testing that marks the regime’s most serious provocation for years. In response to the ICBM launch – the first full-range test of Kim Jong-un’s most powerful missiles since 2017 – South Korea’s military fired a missile barrage into the Sea of Japan (known as the East Sea in South Korea). The launch will lead to fears that the North has made significant progress in developing weapons capable of sending nuclear warheads anywhere in the US. South Korea’s outgoing president, Moon Jae-in, who has made engaging with North Korea a major goal of his administration, said the launch posed a serious threat to the Korean peninsula, the region and the international community and was a “clear violation” of UN security council resolutions. Countries including the US, UK and France have asked for the security council to hold a public meeting on Friday to discuss the launch, which Japanese authorities said appeared to involve a “new type” of ICBM. The missile has not been identified, but reports suggest it could be a Hwasong-17, a larger missile than the Hwasong-15 test-fired in November 2017. US and South Korean officials recently said that North Korea had been preparing to test-fire the Hwasong-17. According to Japan and South Korea, the missile was fired from the Sunan area, near North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, and travelled 1,080km (670 miles), reaching a maximum altitude of more than 6,200km. It was airborne for 71 minutes and landed about 90 miles west of the Oshima peninsula on Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island. There were no reports of damage to aircraft or vessels in the area. The missile was apparently fired at a high angle to avoid reaching Japan’s territorial waters. No previous North Korean missile had flown for that long or reached that altitude, Japan’s defence ministry said. “This is such an outrageous, unforgivable act,” said Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, in Brussels before a meeting of the G7 group of countries to discuss the war in Ukraine. Japan’s state minister of defence, Makoto Oniki, said: “At a time when the world is dealing with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, North Korea is pressing ahead with launches that unilaterally aggravate provocations against the international community, which is absolutely unforgivable.” The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the launch was a “brazen violation” of UN security council resolutions and risked destabilising the region’s security. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke by phone to counterparts in Japan and South Korea after the launch. Analysts say the unprecedented frequency of missile tests this year is a clear signal that Kim is determined to cement North Korea’s status as a nuclear power, enabling him to approach any future nuclear talks with the US from a position of strength. “Despite economic challenges and technical setbacks, the Kim regime is determined to advance its missile capabilities,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “It would be a mistake for international policymakers to think the North Korean missile threat can be put on the back burner while the world deals with the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The launch will present South Korea’s incoming president, Yoon Suk-yeol, with a considerable policy challenge when he takes office in early May. North Korea has conducted 13 rounds of weapons launches this year, including one on 16 March in which a suspected missile exploded above Pyongyang shortly after launch. The volley of tests fuelled speculation that Kim was gearing up for the launch of a larger weapon theoretically capable of reaching the US mainland. US officials said North Korea had used two launches, on 27 February and 5 March, to evaluate components belonging to the Hwasong-17. A launch last week, probably of the Hwasong-17, ended in failure, with the missile exploding mid-air in the skies above the capital. North Korea’s official media said the two successful tests were aimed at developing cameras and other systems for a spy satellite. Experts have previously said a full Hwasong-17 launch could coincide with the 110th anniversary of the birth of North Korea’s founder, and Kim Jong-un’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, on 15 April. North Korea has previously carried out three full ICBM tests. Kim suspended missile launches during several rounds of nuclear diplomacy with Donald Trump in 2018, although their three meetings failed to make any progress on dismantling North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. With little prospect for a return to nuclear talks with the Biden administration, North Korea hinted at the start of the year that it could break its self-imposed moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests. The Hwasong-17, which is “considerably larger” than the Hwasong-15, according to analysts, was unveiled at a predawn military parade in October 2020 and displayed a second time at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang in October last year. • This article’s story text was amended on 19 April 2022 to note that the Sea of Japan is known in South Korea as the East Sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/mar/06/soaring-gas-prices-are-a-cost-of-this-war-and-britain-cant-avoid-them","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-07T10:43:13Z","webTitle":"Soaring gas prices are a cost of Russia’s war – and Britain can’t avoid them","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/06/soaring-gas-prices-are-a-cost-of-this-war-and-britain-cant-avoid-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/mar/06/soaring-gas-prices-are-a-cost-of-this-war-and-britain-cant-avoid-them","fields":{"headline":"Soaring gas prices are a cost of Russia’s war – and Britain can’t avoid them","bodyText":"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought with it crippling increases in the price of gas. On Friday, the price per therm spiked 25% to hit a record high on energy markets before slipping backwards. A fresh peak above 500p per therm – nine times the price seen just over a year ago – is expected over the next few days as traders panic about the course of the war. Fears that Moscow is planning to restrict supplies of natural gas in response to further rounds of sanctions, driving the price higher still, cannot be easily dismissed, according to some analysts, who concede that Vladimir Putin’s administration is deliberately undercutting any rational view of his tactics in this increasingly bitter, destructive war. Not surprisingly, the major recipients of Russian gas across Europe have spent the last week scrambling to find alternative sources. Italy, which uses gas to generate 40% of its electricity and imports more than 90% of its gas, mostly from Russia, has looked to Algeria and Azerbaijan for alternative supplies. German politicians have talked about cancelling plans to shut down nuclear power plants and ramping up electricity production from coal-powered generators. In the short term, though, Russian gas is an essential element of the energy mix, and without it rationing would be widespread. Heavy industries across Europe have already adopted short-time working or, in several cases, weekly shutdowns to cope with rising prices. Car-company bosses are among many who believe they would never be able to pass on the cost of higher energy to consumers and so have made the choice to restrict production until prices fall. Boris Johnson rightly says Britain has successfully reduced the supply of gas from Russian gas fields to below 5%, but the privatisation of UK supplies in the North Sea ties consumers to the going rate on international energy markets, leaving the UK as exposed as any other country to rising prices. According to industry body Energy UK, recent increases could push the average energy bill from more than £2,000 a year after the lifting of a price cap in April to nearer £3,000 in October, when the cap is reviewed. Consumers are already being quoted fixed-rate tariffs of £3,500 a year. It leaves Britain and Germany among the worst affected by rising prices, in part because they have so little control of domestic supply via public ownership. Energy analyst Ano Kuhanathan says any restriction on Russian gas supplies would hit industrial and residential users hard. He works for Euler Hermes, a branch of the giant German insurer Allianz, and concluded in a report with two colleagues last week that much of Europe will be dependent on Russian gas for several years, despite action to reduce demand and develop alternative energy sources. He dismissed a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which said European leaders could reduce their dependency on Russian gas by a third in just one year, as “extremely aggressive” and almost certainly probably impossible. The IEA highlighted a 10-point plan that included a strong push to insulate homes, a faster windfarm building programme and an advertising push to persuade people to turn down their thermostats by 1C. Emphasising the need to move swiftly, IEA executive director Fatih Birol said: “Nobody is under any illusions any more. Russia’s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon shows Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter.” Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at UCL, said Britain was in a similar position and “reducing demand for gas should be at the centre of the UK’s response to the invasion of Ukraine and high prices”. But Kuhanathan said a shift in strategic planning would leave the energy market dynamics largely unchanged in the short term and that, without rationing, there was little choice but to continue using Russian gas. “Most gas in Europe is carried by pipelines. There could be a switch to liquefied natural gas (LNG), but there is not the storage capacity. “And anyway, Japan and China are among many nations that want huge amounts of LNG, which means the extra supply isn’t there at the moment,” he said. Britain also lacks the storage capacity that could cushion the UK from the full impact of volatile gas prices. Germans were under the illusion that a lack of storage was not something they needed to worry about. But reports last week in the German press revealed that the largest gas storage facility in the country is part owned by the Russian gas supplier Gazprom and was run almost dry in the weeks leading up to the invasion. Given that Russia accounts for 17% of global gas supplies and 12% of oil production, it will be a painful transition to alternative sources, especially if the switch must take place in months rather than years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-a-catastrophe-for-global-economy-as-stock-markets-plunge","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T20:01:19Z","webTitle":"Ukraine war a ‘catastrophe’ for global economy as stock markets plunge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-a-catastrophe-for-global-economy-as-stock-markets-plunge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-a-catastrophe-for-global-economy-as-stock-markets-plunge","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine war a ‘catastrophe’ for global economy as stock markets plunge","bodyText":"The London stock market has suffered its biggest weekly losses since the start of the global pandemic in March 2020, as investors took fright at the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Shares plunged in the City following news of a fire and Russian capture of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, with the one-day drop of more than 250 points in the FTSE 100 index taking the weekly loss to 6.7%. European bourses also recorded big falls amid concerns that the impact of the fighting in Ukraine would spread westwards across the continent. David Malpass, president of the World Bank, told the BBC the war was a “catastrophe” for the global economy. Currency and commodity markets also ended the week amid fresh signs of turbulence, with a flight to the safe haven of the US dollar and the highest crude oil prices in a decade. Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices reached record levels in both Britain and the EU. The UK National Balancing Point (NBP) benchmark soared above 500p a therm at one point, smashing through the previous all-time high set in December, amid a prolonged surge that caused the collapse of a series of household gas suppliers. The FTSE 100 index in London finished 251 points lower on Friday at 6,998, a 3.5% drop. The German and French stock markets fell more than 4%, taking the Dax in Frankfurt to its lowest levels since late 2020, while the Italian index tumbled 6.2% to its lowest level in more than a year. Europe’s Euro Stoxx 600 index closed at its lowest level in almost a year. Nervous investors were taking few chances ahead of what they expect to be another tough week when markets reopen on Monday. Liam Peach, emerging markets analyst at Capital Economics, said: “Russia has fallen into chaos and we’ll get a clearer sense next week of the impact that sanctions are having on the economy. A dollar bond repayment by Gazprom on Monday will be a litmus test of the government’s (and government-linked companies’) willingness to pay external debt, while inflation figures for the week just gone by (due on Wednesday) are likely to show that the collapse in the ruble started to push inflation higher.” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: “The FTSE 100 has had a shocker of a week, posting its largest decline since March 2020, and below the 7,000 level to its lowest point since August last year. In terms of weekly performance, the best performers have been in defence and commodities, with weekly gains for BAE Systems, and the likes of Glencore, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta.” Mining and energy stocks have benefited from the boom in commodity prices which saw the price of Brent crude hitting $120 a barrel at one stage. After a jump of $25 a barrel in the past month, the cost of crude ended the week at $115 a barrel. Wheat prices rose to a 14-year high, while corn prices reached their highest level in eight years. Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means that fears over supply will remain front and centre.” He said there is a “new sense of urgency” for the west to try and strike a nuclear deal with Iran. Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine more than a week ago has raised recession risks for the US and European economies – and far more so for Russia, which has been isolated economically by widening sanctions, economists said. US stocks on Wall Street also fell as concerns over the escalating conflict in Ukraine overshadowed the latest non-farm payrolls data that showed a sharp pick-up in jobs growth last month, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8%. As stock markets slid, investors piled into investments regarded as safer – gold, currencies like the dollar and yen, and government bonds. British 10-year government bonds recorded their biggest weekly rise in more than a decade. As gilts were in demand, this pushed their yields, or returns to investors, down the most since November 2011. Yields go down when bond prices go up. On the currency markets, sterling lost 1% against the dollar to $1.3210. War in Ukraine has boosted demand for safe-haven investments such as gold. Spot gold rose 1.5% to $1,965 an ounce. The Moscow stock exchange stayed closed all week, while the rouble fell to record lows amid wider sanctions on Russia. The rouble hit a record low of 118.35 per dollar in Moscow on Thursday, and ended the week at 105 per dollar. Caleb Thibodeau, of Validus Risk Management, said: “Evolving into arguably the most serious security threat to continental Europe since the Second World War, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia couldn’t have come at a more economically precarious time for the EU.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/03/turn-down-heating-reduce-need-russian-imports-europeans-told","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-03T14:29:16Z","webTitle":"Turn down heating by 1C to reduce need for Russian imports, Europeans told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/03/turn-down-heating-reduce-need-russian-imports-europeans-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/03/turn-down-heating-reduce-need-russian-imports-europeans-told","fields":{"headline":"Turn down heating by 1C to reduce need for Russian imports, Europeans told","bodyText":"Europeans should turn down their thermostats by a degree to save on gas and reduce dependency on Russian imports, which Russia is wielding as a weapon in the Ukraine war, the world’s leading energy adviser has said. Governments in Europe should also impose a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies that have enjoyed a bonanza from soaring energy prices, and use it to cut energy bills for hard-pressed consumers, according to a 10-point plan formulated by the International Energy Agency that would reduce Russian gas imports by about a third before next winter. The planned closure of several nuclear power stations should also be delayed, red tape should be cut to bring forward the construction of more wind and solar generation and efforts to improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses must be stepped up urgently, the IEA said. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, the global energy watchdog, said: “Russia is using its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon. This is clear to everyone in the world.” Adjusting home thermostats by 1C would save about 10bn cubic metres of gas within a year, a useful saving on total Russian gas imports of 155bn cubic metres, if implemented alongside the other measures. Birol said: “It would help to reduce [household] energy bills, but maintain comfort.” The 10-point plan also includes advice to governments not to sign any new gas contracts with Russia’s state-owned energy company Gazprom, or to renew expiring deals; to set a minimum obligation on energy companies to store gas; to speed up the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps; and to seek alternative gas supplies from elsewhere in the world. The EU relies on Russia for about 40% of its gas consumption. Gas prices have soared to record levels in recent months, in part owing to the global economic rebound from Covid-19, but also because Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, engineered a reduction of about 25% in Russian gas supplies to Europe in recent months, in preparation for his invasion. Barbara Pompili, minister for ecological transition for France, holder of the EU’s revolving presidency, said: “More than ever, getting rid of Russian fossil fuels and of fossil fuels in general is essential. What is at stake is both the need to accelerate the fight against climate change and, as we can see now, the short-term energy security of the European continent.” The European Commission will use the IEA’s proposals to inform its own plan of action on energy in response to the Ukraine war, to be published next week. Kadri Simson, the EU’s energy commissioner, said the bloc had already been moving away from gas but that the Ukraine war made it more urgent. “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a watershed moment,” she said. The UK government is also understood to be urgently examining its exposure to gas market turbulence, caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK does not directly contract with Russia for pipeline gas, as Germany and some other EU countries do, as UK gas supplies come mainly from the North Sea, Norway and some tanker deliveries, but the impacts on the prices and availability of gas are felt internationally. Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre and professor of energy policy at Imperial College London, said some of the IEA’s findings could apply to the UK. “Accelerating the deployment of renewables projects, getting on with energy efficiency, [and] maximising output from nuclear stations are all no-brainers in both the UK and EU,” he said. “However, we should not expect that we can magic the capacity to retrofit our houses into existence in no time at all.” The UK could be more exposed than its EU neighbours to gas market turbulence. The government allowed the UK’s last large-scale gas storage facility to close in 2017, despite warnings on how it would affect resilience. After Brexit, the government also opted out of an EU pact to share gas storage in the event of supply constraints. Gross warned: “We will be reliant on attracting gas by paying the market rates. We can secure enough gas but we have to pay the price.” Even if all of the IEA’s advice is followed, the result will be only to reduce EU need for Russian gas by about a third, leaving Europe still heavily reliant on Putin’s control of Russian fossil fuel resources. The IEA said its advice was consistent with the EU’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the European green deal, and would not require any increase of fossil fuel use. However, if Putin were to cut European gas supplies further, causing gas prices to rise even higher than current levels, the EU could come under pressure to expand its use of coal instead of cutting it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/sep/16/wednesday-briefing-cuts-leave-colleges-living-on-bailouts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-16T05:26:15Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Cuts leave colleges living on bailouts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/16/wednesday-briefing-cuts-leave-colleges-living-on-bailouts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/sep/16/wednesday-briefing-cuts-leave-colleges-living-on-bailouts","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Cuts leave colleges living on bailouts","bodyText":"Top story: Hundreds of millions written off Hello, Warren Murray rattling the letter-flap on the door to Wednesday. Almost half of further education (FE) and sixth-form colleges in England have required government financial help after years of funding cuts. The National Audit Office (NAO) says the Department for Education (DfE) has spent more than £700m on emergency funding with vast loans written off and more colleges likely to struggle amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Another £250m was paid out to rescue 36 colleges with serious cashflow problems. According to the NAO report, as of February this year the government was “intervening” financially in 115 colleges out of a total of 242. Government funding cuts over the past decade have hit education for students aged 16 to 19 particularly hard; there has been a real terms cut of 7% in the five years up to 2019. In 2015 government reviews led to 57 college mergers, costing the public purse more than £430m, according to the NAO. Despite the financial pressures more than four in five colleges were rated good or outstanding by Ofsted in 2019 but the NAO says cuts have led to a narrowing of the curriculum and reduced support for students, factors “likely to have detrimental effects on students and the development of skills”. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is expected to release a further education white paper later this year. David Hughes, head of the Association for Colleges, said: “The government and DfE must make the white paper a real turning point for colleges and create a stronger, more resilient and stable education and skills system that works for everyone.” * * * Postcode hack to get a test – Britain’s Covid testing shortage could last weeks, the health secretary has admitted, as it emerged supplies are being taken from hospitals for use in the community.

A 35-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter and bailed while inquiries continue. South Yorkshire police were called to an address in Woodlands, Doncaster, around 3.30pm on Sunday. The force said: “Emergency services discovered a 12-day-old baby boy had been bitten by a dog and suffered serious injuries. The child was taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.” The dog was taken away, police said. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been shown sitting up in bed as he recovers in Germany after being poisoned in Siberia.

The idea is intended to help diagnose and prevent foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). But Clare Murphy from the pregnancy charity BASP said: “Women do not lose their right to medical confidentiality simply because they are pregnant.” Alcohol abuse in pregnancy is a factor in seven out of 10 cases of children being put up for adoption, and Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of Adoption UK, said there was a “balance to be struck” between the mother’s rights and the child’s. “We’re obviously in a situation where some things are going to need to change if we’re going to improve.” * * * Nuclear fizzle – Hitachi is expected today to announce it is permanently scrapping plans for the £16bn Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station on Anglesey off north Wales.

Speaking during the Conservative party conference, Boris Johnson said the proposed shift would help the UK decarbonise, while softening the impact of the kind of gas price fluctuations that have prompted fears of a winter energy crisis in recent weeks. “What I’m saying is we can do for our entire energy production by 2035 what we’re doing with internal combustion engines in vehicles by 2030,” he said, during a visit to a Network Rail site in Manchester. “And what we’re also saying is that by 2035, looking at the progress we’re making in wind power, where we lead the world now in offshore wind, looking at what we can do with other renewable sources, carbon capture and storage with hydrogen potentially, we think that we can get to complete clean energy production by 2035.” The UK generated 43% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2020 but gas-fired power plants still account for a significant proportion. Nuclear power plants, which currently provide about a sixth of the UK’s electricity, would also continue to form part of the energy mix under the net zero plans. As the prime minister confirmed plans to decarbonise the electricity grid, gas was providing just under a third of the UK’s electricity demand, at 11.4GW, according to National Grid data. Britain’s reliance on gas, for heating as well as electricity, has been highlighted by price increases that have prompted warnings of a winter energy crisis, with families facing “desperate choices” as bills go up. A dozen energy suppliers have gone bust this year and more failures are predicted despite a rise in the government-posed cap on bills. Johnson said removing gas from electricity generation would help safeguard against future price surges. “The advantage of that is that it will mean that, for the first time, the UK is not dependent on hydrocarbons coming from overseas with all the vagaries in hydrocarbon prices and the risk that poses for people’s pockets and for the consumer,” he said. “We will be reliant on our own clean power generation, which will help us also to keep costs down.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-beijing-and-moscow-to-cooperate-at-new-level-west-prepared-to-support-kyiv-for-years-says-sunak","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-24T17:54:40Z","webTitle":"US investigating reports American vehicles used in raid inside Russian border – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-beijing-and-moscow-to-cooperate-at-new-level-west-prepared-to-support-kyiv-for-years-says-sunak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-beijing-and-moscow-to-cooperate-at-new-level-west-prepared-to-support-kyiv-for-years-says-sunak","fields":{"headline":"US investigating reports American vehicles used in raid inside Russian border – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. It came as the Kremlin said the use of US-made military hardware by pro-Ukraine fighters who conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was testament to the West’s growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Russian military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked the Russian border region of Belgorod with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. Ukraine will not be able to join Nato as long as the war is going on, the alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday. “I think that everyone realised that, to become a member in the midst of a war, is not on the agenda,” Reuters reports he said at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund of the US in Brussels. “The issue is what happens when the war ends.” Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the police evacuated a family of four children and three adults from Toretsk in Donetsk after the latest round of shelling. The children’s mother says that they have already come under fire five times and run under mines. Suspilne says they lived 300 metres from the frontline and about 800 metres from the positions of the Russian army, but now plan to go to stay with relatives in Vinnytsia. The Russian private army Wagner lost more than 10,000 fighters in the drawn-out battle for Bakhmut, according to the group’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He said about 20% of the 50,000 Russian prisoners recruited to fight in the 15-month war had died in the eastern Ukrainian city, Reuters reported. The figure was in stark contrast with claims from Moscow that it has lost just over 6,000 troops in the war, and is higher than the official estimate of the Soviet losses in the Afghanistan war of 15,000 troops between 1979 and 1989. The World Health Organization assembly passed a motion on Wednesday condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities. The motion passed by 80 votes to nine, with 52 abstentions and 36 countries absent, Reuters reported. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) expects to spend €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in Ukraine next year in support of infrastructure and the economy, a senior source at the bank has said. It comes on top of €3bn already projected for 2022 and the remainder of 2023. The funds have helped the economy continue to function and ensure that there was no run on banks and that civil servants continued to be paid. Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, has accused Washington and London of thwarting efforts to reach a settlement over the conflict in Ukraine and of turning a blind eye to what he said was increasing “terrorism and violence” visited on civilians by Ukraine. Reuters reports that in remarks at a security forum outside Moscow attended by foreign security officials, Naryshkin expressed satisfaction that most countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America had not imposed sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, despite what he called colossal pressure to do so from Washington. The first of three Russian hypersonic missile scientists to be arrested on suspicion of treason will go on trial next week, the court handling the case said on Wednesday. The criminal case against Anatoly Maslov, 76, will open in St Petersburg’s city court on 1 June, the court said on its website. The Netherlands wants to give Ukrainian pilots F-16 training as soon as possible, the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said on Wednesday in a letter to parliament. The training would be coordinated with Belgium, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and other countries could join, Ollongren added. Russia has announced that a court in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don will try five foreign men, including three British nationals, accused of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against Moscow. The trial will begin on 31 May on terrorism-linked allegations and other charges. The men are believed to face trial in absentia. Ukraine’s main Orthodox church said on Wednesday it had decided to switch to a calendar in which Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, a move that distances it from Russia. Ukrainian Christians, a majority of whom are Orthodox, have traditionally celebrated Christmas on 7 January alongside other predominantly Orthodox Christian countries. Germany will buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks and 12 self-propelled howitzers to replenish stocks depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, a member of the parliamentary budget committee that approved the purchase on Wednesday told Reuters. The tanks order will come to €525.6m (£457m) while the howitzers have a price tag of €190.7m; all of them are to be delivered by 2026 at the latest, said the finance ministry documents meant for the parliament. Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, is in Beijing, where, before signing bilateral agreements with China, he said: “Today, relations between Russia and China are at an unprecedented high level.” He said Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia in March was further evidence of the “special” nature of bilateral relations between the two countries. It is expected that Vladimir Putin will visit China later this year. Nine people remain in hospital, utility supplies continue to be disrupted, and more than 500 people remain displaced after the cross-border incursion into Belgorod by anti-Russian partisans on Monday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Russian region. Gladkov also announced two more incidents, stating a drone attack over Novaya Tavolzhanka failed when the explosive device dropped did not detonate, and that shelling in Terezovka has injured one person who has been hospitalised as a result. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting some quotes from Denis Pushilin, the Russian-imposed leader in occupied Donetsk, who has said that the situation for Russian forces on the flanks of Bakhmut has stabilised. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. As Russian militias opposing the Kremlin readied a daring cross-border raid into the Belgorod region this week, a man with slicked-down hair, in full camouflage and holding an automatic rifle stared into a camera lens. “We are Russians just like you,” the man said in the video, later posted online. “We are people just like you. We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people so they can travel, study and were just happy in a free country. But this has no place in modern Putin’s Russia, rotten through and through from corruption, lies, censorship, restrictions on freedoms and repression.” That man was Maximillian Andronnikov, the self-proclaimed commander of the Freedom of Russia Legion, a paramilitary group that, until this week, was chided for its outsized internet and media activity. Under the nickname “Caesar” he has also served as a media spokesperson for the group, which has sought to largely act in the shadows and keep its membership a secret. But with the raids into southern Russia this week, the spotlight has been turned on both the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps, another group composed of Russians who now say they are fighting against Putin. The Netherlands wants to give Ukrainian pilots F-16 training as soon as possible, Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren said on Wednesday in a letter to parliament. The training would be coordinated with Belgium, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, and other countries could join, Ollongren added. On Tuesday, Nato’s chief Jens Stoltenberg said training Ukrainian pilots on western F-16 fighter jets would not make Nato a party to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. A day earlier, senior Russian diplomats said the transfer of F-16 jets to Ukraine would raise the question of Nato’s role in the conflict, Reuters reported. Germany will buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks and 12 self-propelled howitzers to replenish stocks depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, a member of the parliamentary budget committee that approved the purchase on Wednesday told Reuters. The tanks order will come to €525.6m (£457m) while the howitzers have a price tag of €190.7m; all of them are to be delivered by 2026 at the latest, said the finance ministry documents meant for the parliament. The purchase includes an option for another 105 tanks for about €2.9bn, Reuters reported. Germany has supplied 18 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year and has said it intends to plug the gap with new tanks as soon as possible. The 12 howitzers are part of defence ministry plans signed off by the German parliament in March to buy up to 28 howitzers as replacements. Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. It came as the Kremlin said the use of US-made military hardware by pro-Ukrainian fighters who conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was testament to the West’s growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Russian military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked the Russian border region of Belgorod with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. It said it had destroyed four armoured vehicles and five pickup trucks to repel what was one of the largest incursions on to Russian soil from Ukraine since Moscow launched what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine 15 months ago. Footage of some of the destroyed vehicles released by the Russian defence ministry showed US-made military hardware such as Humvee military trucks. Reuters was able to confirm the location of damaged vehicles and surrounding details shown in the video, though could not verify the date it was filmed. The United States, Ukraine’s biggest military supplier, initially played down reports that American-made military hardware was used in the raid. Russia has announced that a court in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don will try five foreign men, including three British nationals, accused of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against Moscow. The trial will begin on 31 May on terrorism-linked allegations and other charges. The men are believed to face trial in absentia. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said the three British men, a Swedish national and a Croatian man had been accused of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces – including the Azov regiment, which battled Russian forces during the siege of the southern port city of Mariupol. The Britons have been identified as John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy. The Swedish national has been named as Mathias Gustafsson and the Croatian as Vjekoslav Prebeg. They face several charges including undergoing training to carry out “terrorist activities”. Members of the Russian Volunteer Corps are seen in Ukraine, close to the Russian border earlier today. Ukraine’s main Orthodox church said on Wednesday it had decided to switch to a calendar in which Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, a move that distances it from Russia. Ukrainian Christians, a majority of whom are Orthodox, have traditionally celebrated Christmas on 7 January alongside other predominantly Orthodox Christian countries. “This question arose with new impetus as a result of Russian aggression,” the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) wrote in a Facebook post announcing the change away from the Julian calendar. “Nowadays, the Julian calendar is perceived as connected with Russian church culture,” it said. Ukraine’s main Catholic church, which considers about one in 10 Ukrainians to be worshippers, announced a similar change in February. Reuters reports the OCU said it would use the revised Julian calendar from 1 September, the start of the liturgical year. It said parishes would have the option to celebrate according to the old Julian calendar if they wished. Russia’s ministry of defence has said that Ukraine mounted an unsuccessful drone attack on one of its Black Sea fleet ships, the Ivan Khurs. In a statement it said: Today at 05:30am, the Ukrainian armed forces made an unsuccessful attempt to attack the Ivan Khurs ship of the Black Sea fleet with three unmanned speedboats. [The Ivan Khurs] is performing tasks to ensure the safety of the operation of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Turkey. All enemy boats were destroyed by fire from the standard armament of a Russian ship 140km northeast of the Bosphorus. The ship Ivan Khurs of the Black Sea fleet continues to fulfill its tasks. The Ivan Khurs is a reconnaissance ship. Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, has accused Washington and London of thwarting efforts to reach a settlement over the conflict in Ukraine and of turning a blind eye to what he said was increasing “terrorism and violence” visited on civilians by Ukraine. Reuters reports that in remarks at a security forum outside Moscow attended by foreign security officials, Naryshkin expressed satisfaction that most countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America had not imposed sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, despite what he called colossal pressure to do so from Washington. He also accused what he called the “Euro-Atlantic elite” of refusing to voluntarily surrender their leadership while doing everything they could to stop what he called alternative centres of power from rising. “Turbulent periods are essentially a test of the extent to which nations and peoples have preserved their true foundations,” said Naryshkin. “Our countries, unlike the west, have preserved a significant margin of strength and strategic depth in this respect,” he said. “I mean a connection with the spiritual dimension of existence, traditions which in the US and Europe long ago gave way to positivism, the cult of material success and outright satanism,” said Naryshkin. Ukraine will not be able to join Nato as long as the war is going on, the alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday. “I think that everyone realised that, to become a member in the midst of a war, is not on the agenda,” Reuters reports he said at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund of the US in Brussels. “The issue is what happens when the war ends.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to attend the next Nato summit in person in Vilnius in July, and has previously said that it would be a timely moment for a political statement about the prospect of Ukraine’s Nato membership. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the police evacuated a family of four children and three adults from Toretsk in Donetsk after the latest round of shelling. The children’s mother says that they have already come under fire five times and run under mines. Suspilne says they lived 300 metres from the frontline and about 800 metres from the positions of the Russian army, but now plan to go to stay with relatives in Vinnytsia. There are an estimated 5.4 million people who have been internally displaced in Ukraine, and the UN has recorded 8.2 million people who have fled the country to other European countries. The first of three Russian hypersonic missile scientists to be arrested on suspicion of treason will go on trial next week, the court handling the case said on Wednesday. The criminal case against Anatoly Maslov, 76, will open in St Petersburg’s city court on 1 June, the court said on its website. He and two colleagues at the same Siberian institute, the Khristianovich Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ITAM), have all been arrested on suspicion of treason in the past year. The case is marked as “top secret” and will be closed to the media and public, the court said. It said Maslov’s custody was extended until 10 November in a closed hearing on Wednesday. Maslov was detained last June in Novosibirsk, the largest city in Siberia and one of Russia’s main science hubs. Maslov’s lawyer Olga Dinze told Reuters that she declined to comment on the case, saying that “the situation is extremely difficult.” Details of the accusations against the three men are classified, but the news portal of the science city where they are based said Maslov was suspected of handing secrets to China. Two sources have told Reuters that Shiplyuk, the director of ITAM, is suspected of passing secrets to China at a conference there in 2017. They said he denies the charge, saying the information in question was publicly available online. Russian private army Wagner lost more than 10,000 fighters in the drawn-out battle for Bakhmut, according to the group’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He said about 20% of the 50,000 Russian prisoners recruited to fight in the 15-month war died in the eastern Ukrainian city, Reuters reported. The figure was in stark contrast with claims from Moscow that it has lost just over 6,000 troops in the war, and is higher than the official estimate of the Soviet losses in the Afghanistan war of 15,000 troops between 1979 and 1989. Ukraine has not said how many of its soldiers have died since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. • This post was amended on 24 May 2023 to correct the number of Wagner group fatalities cited by Yevgeny Prigozhin. Japan held a ceremony on Wednesday marking its planned donation of about 100 military vehicles to Ukraine, as Tokyo seeks to provide equipment that can be of broader military use than its earlier shipments of helmets and hazmat suits. In a ceremony at the defence ministry at which two half-tonne trucks were on display, Japanese vice-defence minister, Toshiro Ino, handed a document to Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Korsunsky, listing the three types of vehicles included in the donation, AP reports. “We hope the invasion ends as soon as possible and peaceful daily lives return,” Ino said. “We will provide as much support as we can.” The donation, which also includes 30,000 food rations, comes as Japan’s government is seeking to ease its military equipment transfer policy under a new national security policy that allows its military a greater offensive role, in a major break from its post-second world war self-defence-only principle. While other countries have provided Ukraine with tanks, missiles and fighter jets, Japan has limited its donations to non-lethal equipment because the transfer policy prohibits the provision of lethal weapons to countries at war. Japan has provided Ukraine with bulletproof vests, helmets, gas masks, hazmat suits, small drones and food rations since Russia’s invasion began last year. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) expects to spend €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in Ukraine next year in support of infrastructure and the economy, a senior source at the bank has said. It comes on top of €3bn already projected for 2022 and the remainder of 2023. The funds have helped the economy continue to function, ensure there was no run on banks and civil servants continued to be paid. Last year the bank, which is founded in 1991 as a post cold-war era institution to support eastern Europe, deployed €1.7bn with significant expenditure on rebuilding gas and rail networks. It also helps Ukraine with the government payroll and making loans available to SMEs to ensure the economy bounced back after the invasion by Russia last February. “The Ukraine economy has proved very resilient. Everything is functioning. Banks are functioning, there has been no bank run. There was a huge shock at the beginning with a minus 30% [in GDP]. But not the situation has stabilised. This resilience is due to the amazing resilience of the people and their capacity to find a solution and continue doing their business and relocate and so forth. So very very impressive,” said Odile Renaud-Basso, president of the bank. The World Bank has estimated that it will take €11bn for critical and priority reconstruction and recovery investments in 2023. The World Health Organization assembly passed a motion on Wednesday condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities. The motion passed by 80 votes to 9, with 52 abstentions and 36 countries absent, Reuters reported. The western-led motion, put forward at the UN agency’s annual meeting, also called for an assessment of the impact of Russia’s aggression on the health sector. There was no immediate reaction from Russia, although it had submitted a counter-proposal recognising the health emergency in Ukraine, but making no mention of its own role in the war. That motion was rejected by the assembly immediately after the first, by 62 votes to 13, with 61 abstentions and 41 countries absent. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that reports that pro-Ukrainian fighters who crossed into Russia earlier this week had used western-made military hardware were consistent with the west’s growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was no secret that the Ukrainian armed forces were receiving more and more equipment from the west. The Russian military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked a Russian border region with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. Images of some of the destroyed vehicles broadcast on Russian state media showed US-made military hardware. Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, is in Beijing, where, ahead of signing bilateral agreements with China, he said: “Today, relations between Russia and china are at an unprecedented high level”. He said Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia in March was further evidence of the “special” nature of bilateral relations between the two countries. It is expected that Vladimir Putin will visit China later this year. Nine people remain in hospital, utility supplies continue to be disrupted, and over 500 people remain displaced after the cross-border incursion into Belgorod by anti-Russian partisans on Monday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Russian region. Gladkov also announced two more incidents, stating a drone attack over Novaya Tavolzhanka failed when the explosive device dropped did not detonate, and that shelling in Terezovka has injured one person who has been hospitalised as a result. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting some quotes from Denis Pushilin, Russian-imposed leader in occupied Donetsk, who has said that the situation for Russian forces on the flanks of Bakhmut has stabilised. The Russian-built Crimea Bridge linking the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula to the Russian region of Krasnodar was reopened on Wednesday after being closed for several hours for “exercises”, an official from Crimea’s Russian-imposed administration said. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that 2,000 people have been left without electricity in Putyvl in Sumy oblast. It cites the regional energy authority claiming it was due to Russian shelling. The chief executive of Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy business, Rosatom, discussed security at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi. Alexey Likhachev was attending a meeting in Beijing. Older people have suffered and died at a disproportionately high rate since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a UN report showed on Wednesday, with some perishing because they were barred from fetching medicines or leaving basements. The report compiled by UN human rights monitors showed that about a third of the civilians killed in the first year of the war were over 60. The UN found older people were hit exceptionally hard by power outages due to Russian attacks on critical infrastructure trapped many in their upstairs apartments. Others had to be evacuated in haste, sometimes in wheelbarrows because there was no time to fetch their mobility devices. Many were left behind. Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Wednesday his country is plannning to launch a submarine purchase programme this year. US popular support for Washington’s backing of Ukraine has faded a little but remains widespread, a survey by the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy and Norc shows. UK prime minister Rishi Sunak has told a defence conference in London that Ukraine’s western allies are prepared to support the country in the war “for years”, the FT reports. Older people have suffered and died at a disproportionately high rate since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a UN report showed on Wednesday, with some perishing because they were barred from fetching medicines or leaving basements. The report compiled by UN human rights monitors showed that about a third of the civilians killed in the first year of the war, or 1,346 of 4,187 documented victims, were over 60. Reuters reports the UN found that older people were hit exceptionally hard by power outages due to Russian attacks on critical infrastructure since October 2022 that trapped many in their upstairs apartments when their elevators broke down. Others had to be evacuated in haste, sometimes in wheelbarrows because there was no time to fetch their mobility devices. Many were left behind. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. The UN has recorded at least 18,500 casualties (including more than 6,660 killed) on territory controlled by the Kyiv government since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Russian-built Crimea Bridge linking the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula to the Russian region of Krasnodar was reopened on Wednesday after being closed for several hours for “exercises”, an official from Crimea’s Russian-imposed administration said. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to his social media channels to say: The peace of our parents’ generation is the peace that was left as a legacy by those who defeated the penultimate great aggression in Europe. And the peace of our children’s generation is the peace we are gaining right now in the battles against the last aggression in Europe. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that 2,000 people have been left without electricity in Putyvl in Sumy oblast. It cites the regional energy authority claiming it was due to Russian shelling. The claims have not been independently verified. The chief executive of Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy business, Rosatom, discussed security at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi. Alexey Likhachev was attending a meeting in Beijing, Reuters reports the firm said on Wednesday. The ZNPP, which is Europe’s largest plant, has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Rival forces have accused each other of endangering nuclear safety by firing at the plant. Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Wednesday his country is plannning to launch a submarine purchase programme this year. Reuters reports Poland has increased military spending since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the government pledging to double the size of the army and spend 4% of GDP on defence in 2023. Reuters has a quick snap that the Russian-installed governor of Crimea has said the Crimea Bridge is closed due to drills. The bridge that links Crimea to the Russian region of Krasnodar Krai was attacked in October last year. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. There have been reports of the sounds of explosions in the Sumy region, but the regional authority has told Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, that the noise is the result of military exercises. Meanwhile an alert has been declared warning of artillery fire on Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk oblast. In Russia’s Belgorod region, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov has announced two more incidents, stating on Telegram that a drone attack over Novaya Tavolzhanka failed when the explosive device dropped did not detonate, and that shelling in Terezovka has injured one person who has been hospitalised as a result. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports in its morning news bulletin that Kherson and Sumy regions were shelled overnight, with no casualties. It said that yesterday two people died and three others were injured after the Kherson region was hit 64 times, and that 11 people were injured in the Donetsk region by shelling. One of those injured, it reports, is a child born in 2020. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting some quotes from Denis Pushilin, who has said that the situation for Russian forces on the flanks of Bakhmut has stabilised. Pushilin, the Russian-imposed leader in occupied Donetsk, which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, is quoted as saying on the Solovyov Live TV channel: The peak of anxiety, when there was the most active phase, when the enemy tried to attack on the flanks and surround the guys in Bakhmut itself, has passed, according to my information. I was talking with the guys who are there, including with Wagner, and they also say that combat-ready units have approached there, and this work is being done. Pushilin also said that from today the ministry of internal affairs of the Russian-imposed local occupying authority would be present in Bakhmut, and that employees of the ministry of emergency situations would be arriving to assess the volume of demining, and the materials and personnel needed to carry it out. He said every building and “every metre of the territory” needs to be checked. Nine people remain in hospital, utility supplies continue to be disrupted, and over 500 people remain displaced after the incursion into Belgorod on Monday, according to a new status update from Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Russian region. In a message posted to Telegram, he said: The night was not entirely peaceful. There have been a large number of drone attacks. Most of the air defence systems coped, but there are damages in Belgorod: cars, private houses, office buildings. The most important thing is that there are no casualties at all. A gas pipeline was damaged in the Grayvoron District, a small fire is going on. Also, the restoration of electrical networks, which were damaged during the entry of the sabotage and reconnaissance group, is under way. All work to restore power supply in the Grayvoron district will be completed today. After that, water supply and cellular communications will be restored. There are nine people in hospitals: three people are in intensive care in a serious condition. There are more than 550 people in temporary accommodation centres. I also hope that as soon as the security forces complete the cleansing of the territory and allow it, you will be able to return to your homes. The overall calculation of damage over the past few days in the Grayvoron district has not been completed.⠀ I also received additional information from the Yakovlevsky district. At night, explosive devices were dropped twice from drones in the village of Tomarovka on two administrative buildings. There were no fires, deaths or injuries. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, citing the regional authority head, has reported that a Shahad drone strike on a village in the Kharkiv region has left “a school building, a cultural centre and office premises on fire”. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, is in Beijing, where, ahead of signing bilateral agreements with China, he said: “Today, relations between Russia and china are at an unprecedented high level.” Reuters reports that he said Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia in March was further evidence of the “special” nature of bilateral relations between the two countries. US popular support for Washington’s backing of Ukraine has faded a little but remains widespread, a survey by the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy and Norc shows. The Associated Press reports that the survey found half of the people in the US support the Pentagon’s ongoing supply of weapons to Ukraine for its defence against Russian forces. That level is nearly unchanged in the past year, while about a quarter are opposed to sustaining the military lifeline that has now topped $37bn. Big majorities among both Democrats and Republicans believe Russia’s attack on Ukraine was unjustified, according to the poll, taken last month. And about three out of four people in the US support the United States playing at least some role in the conflict, the survey found. Mark Galeotti, head of the London-based Mayak Intelligence consultancy and author of several books on the Russian military, has told Reuters that the two groups involved in the fighting in Belgorod are made up of anti-Kremlin Russians ranging from liberals and anarchists to neo-Nazis. The Guardian has not verified this claim independently. “They’re hoping that in some small way they can contribute to the downfall of the Putin regime. But at the same time, we have to realise that these are not independent forces ... They are controlled by Ukrainian military intelligence,” he said. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak repeated Kyiv’s position that it had nothing to do with the operation. The United States says it does not “enable or encourage” Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, but that it is up to Kyiv to decide how it conducts military operations. Reuters has put together interesting analysis of what Belgorod means for Russia’s military operations. A two-day incursion from Ukraine into Russia’s western borderlands could force the Kremlin to divert troops from front lines as Kyiv prepares a major counteroffensive, and deal Moscow a psychological blow, according to military analysts interviewed or quoted by the agency. Though Kyiv has denied any role, the biggest cross-border raid from Ukraine since Russia invaded 15 months ago was almost certainly coordinated with Ukraine’s armed forces as it prepares to attempt to recapture territory, the experts said. The Guardian has not verified this. “The Ukrainians are trying to pull the Russians in different directions to open up gaps. The Russians are forced to send reinforcements,” said Neil Melvin, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). Ukraine says it plans to conduct a major counteroffensive to seize back occupied territory, but Russia has built sprawling fortifications in its neighbour’s east and south in readiness, Reuters reports. The incursion took place far from the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region and around 100 miles (160 km) from the front lines in the northern Kharkiv region. “They’ll have to respond to this and put troops there and then have lots of troops all along the border area, even though that may not be the way the Ukrainians are coming,” Melvin said. Russia’s military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked its western Belgorod region with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has told a defence conference in London that Ukraine’s Western allies are prepared to support the country in the war “for years”, the FT reports. He added that Russia’s strategy of “waiting it out . . . for people [in the west] to get tired, bored . . . is not going to work”, the paper reported. “We are now leading a conversation with allies about what longer-term multilateral and bilateral security agreements we can put in place with Ukraine.” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Wednesday that China was willing to work with Russia to promote their pragmatic cooperation in various fields and take it to a “new level” Reuters reports. Pragmatic cooperation between China and Russia has shown a “good” development trend, and the scale of investment between the two is also continuously seeing an upgrade, Li told Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin during a meeting in Beijing. Mishustin was the highest ranking Russian official to visit the Chinese capital since Moscow sent thousands of its troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top stories this morning: the Chinese premier Li Qiang said on Wednesday that China was willing to work with Russia to promote their pragmatic cooperation in various fields and take it to a “new level”. His comments come as Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, visits Beijing, where he is expected to sign bilateral agreements with China. And the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has told a conference in London that Ukraine’s western allies are prepared to support the country “for years”, the FT reports. Sunak also said that Russia’s strategy of “waiting it out . . . for people [in the west] to get tired, bored . . . is not going to work” and that the UK was “leading a conversation with allies about what longer-term multilateral and bilateral security agreements we can put in place with Ukraine.” We’ll have more on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: Moscow claims to have repelled an attack led by Ukraine-aligned militias that led to a series of chaotic battles in Russia’s Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, over the past two days. The governor of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said late Tuesday measures put in place to stop terrorism after the crossborder attack had been lifted. It came only a few hours after Moscow claimed to have pushed the fighters back over the border. Gadkov said Russia’s defence ministry and security agencies were still engaged in a “mopping up” campaign. Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin has arrived in China, Moscow’s foreign ministry said, for a visit in which he will meet president Xi Jinping and ink a series of deals on infrastructure and trade. The training of Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jets has begun in Poland, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. He told a meeting of EU defence ministers in Brussels: “I am happy that finally the training of the pilots for the F-16 has started in several countries. It will take time, but the sooner the better … For example, in Poland.” Borrell also said EU countries had provided 220,000 artillery shells and 1,300 missiles to Ukraine since March. Member states are discussing raising Europe’s military budget by another €3.5bn, €1bn of which would be earmarked for Ukraine. The Ukrainian port of Pivdennyi has halted operations because Russia is not allowing ships to enter it, in effect cutting it out of a deal allowing safe Black Sea grain exports, a Ukrainian official said. A Moscow court extended the detention of the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, detained in Russia on espionage charges at the end of March. During a brief hearing, the court ordered that Gershkovich should remain in jail until 30 August, Russian news agencies reported. The US called for Gershkovich’s immediate release. US president Joe Biden has chosen a new leader for the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, a joint position that oversees much of America’s cyber warfare and defence. If confirmed, air force Lt. Gen. Timothy Haugh will take charge of highly influential US efforts to bolster Ukraine’s cybersecurity and share information with Ukrainian forces fighting Russia’s invasion. Ukrainian forces still controlled the south-western edge of the city of Bakhmut and fighting in the city itself has decreased, deputy Ukrainian defence minister Hanna Maliar claimed on Tuesday. She wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Kyiv’s forces had made some progress “on the flanks to the north and south of Bakhmut” and that Russian forces, which say they have taken the city itself, were continuing to clear areas they control. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited marines on the Vuhledar-Maryinka defence line in the Donetsk region, as part of celebrations for the national day of Ukrainian marines. Ukraine’s general staff said that on Monday Russia carried out 20 missile strikes against Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv oblasts, using cruise missiles, Iskander-M ballistic missiles, and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles over the past day. It also claimed that Russia launched 48 airstrikes using Shahed drones, and targeted both civilian and military targets with up to 90 strikes using multiple-launch rocket systems. A top Russian official who faces sanctions in the west over Moscow’s war on Ukraine has visited Saudi Arabia and held talks with his counterpart in the kingdom. Russian interior minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev’s visit to Riyadh came days after Zelenskiy addressed an Arab League summit held in Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea port city of Jeddah. Germany is looking into options to support a coalition of countries that plan to train Ukrainian pilots in flying F-16 fighter jets, German defence minister Boris Pistorius said. He added that any potential German contribution could be minor only, as Germany itself does not own any of the US-built jets. Ukraine is investigating the alleged role of Belarus in the forced transfer of children from Russian-occupied territories, the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general told Reuters. The announcement came in response to a report by the exiled Belarusian opposition alleging that 2,150 Ukrainian children, including orphans aged six to 15, were taken to so-called recreation camps and sanatoriums on Belarusian territory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/10/french-election-polls-open-with-macron-and-le-pen-vying-closely-for-presidency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-10T09:53:59Z","webTitle":"France election: voting under way with Macron and Le Pen vying closely for presidency ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/french-election-polls-open-with-macron-and-le-pen-vying-closely-for-presidency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/10/french-election-polls-open-with-macron-and-le-pen-vying-closely-for-presidency","fields":{"headline":"France election: voting under way with Macron and Le Pen vying closely for presidency ","bodyText":"Polling is under way across mainland France for the first round of a fiercely contested presidential election. Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen are the frontrunners among the 12 candidates to win through to the second round in two weeks but opinion polls have suggested the race will be close. At midday local time, the official number of those who had voted was declared as 25.48%, a 3-point drop from the presidential election of 2017. In recent weeks the radical left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon has closed the gap with the two frontrunners, and pollsters say the level of abstention is likely to play a major role in the eventual result. Some analysts have suggested up to a third of voters could shun the ballot, the highest number in 20 years. Macron voted near his home in the northern French seaside town of Le Touquet. The president and his wife Brigitte left their home shortly after midday and greeted the crowds waiting outside in the sunshine. Several youngsters posed for selfies with the Macrons, who spent more than ten minutes shaking hands with those in the crowd and kissing babies. Among the first to turn out to vote was the former conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy, followed shortly afterwards by the Socialist candidate, Anne Hidalgo, who was the first candidate to cast her ballot, at about 8.30am at a polling station near her home in Paris’s 15th arrondissement. The prime minister, Jean Castex, voted shortly afterwards in Pyrénées-Orientales, followed by the former Socialist president François Hollande in Corrèze. Hollande, who led France between 2012 and 2017, was accompanied by his partner, the actor Julie Gayet. Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) queued up with a crowd of locals waiting to vote at an infants’ school in Marseille, where he has been the local MP since 2017. The mainstream right candidate Valérie Pécresse voted shortly afterwards in her local polling station in Yvelines, west of Paris. Fabien Roussel, the presidential candidate for the Communist party, voted in the north of France. Nathalie Arthaud, of Lutte Ouvrière (Workers’ Struggle), who is standing in her third presidential election, also voted on Sunday morning. Le Pen turned up at a polling station in the northern French town of Hénin-Beaumont, where she scored 46.5% of the vote in the first round of the 2017 presidential election. Le Pen, who is favourite to be in the second round vote, was greeted by a crowd outside and posed for photographs before voting. The radical rightwing candidate Éric Zemmour and the Ecology candidate, Yannick Jadot, voted in different places in Paris. Another of the 12 candidates, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan of the rightwing Debout la France (Stand Up France) party, also on his third presidential campaign, voted in the Essonne department, south of Paris. About 48.7 million people are eligible to vote in the presidential contest. The winner will lead the European Union’s second-largest economy and the EU’s only nuclear power. Time differences mean voting began in France’s overseas territories at midday Paris time on Saturday. In French Polynesia the number of voters who had turned out was estimated at 12.34%, compared with 22.24% at the same time in the last presidential election in 2017. The main issues in this election have been the cost of living with voters angry about rising fuel and food prices, caused mainly by the war in Ukraine. Health, employment and environmental concerns have also featured in candidates’ manifestos. Immigration has been pushed as a major concern by the far-right Le Pen and her rival on that side of politics, the former journalist and television pundit Zemmour who has seen his support collapse in recent weeks. In the run-up to Sunday’s vote result there had been a period of “electoral silence” during which candidates were prevented from campaigning and no opinion polls could be published to avoid voters being influenced in the hours before the ballot. The first indication of which two candidates will be in the runoff will be announced at 8pm French time – when polling stations in the major cities close – based on partial counts from a certain number of polling stations in towns and cities selected as a representative mix of France. No results are expected before then, and under France’s election rules no estimates are allowed before then, except for the rate of abstention. The campaign starts again at 8pm on Sunday and will then continue for another two weeks until the second-round vote. Frédéric Dabi, director of the opinion pollsters Ifop, told Le Monde: “We’ve a strange campaign that’s been unlike other presidential elections.” The war in Ukraine, a “lack of interest” and the absence of the usual national debate that sees candidates argue their projects had left many voters uninterested, he said. Macron, who has remained favourite to win the first round, entered the race late and his campaign was derailed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He held just one national meeting earlier this month. Le Pen ended the week just a few percentage points behind him. Political analysts have warned the predicted Macron-Le Pen duel for the second round could be overturned if abstention is high. The polling company Harris Interactive suggested 70% of French voters considered the presidential campaign “disappointing”. About 20% of voters who said they had decided who they would vote for admitted they could change their mind, adding to the uncertainty. Masks are no longer required in France except on public transport, but voters have been advised to wear a face covering if their polling station is particularly busy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/feb/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-forces-bakhmut-china-us","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T23:03:41Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: US does not expect significant Russian gains this year; Lukashenko arrives in China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-forces-bakhmut-china-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/feb/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-forces-bakhmut-china-us","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: US does not expect significant Russian gains this year; Lukashenko arrives in China","bodyText":"This blog is now closed. You can catch up on the latest Ukraine war coverage here. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A senior Pentagon official has said the US did not expect Russia to make significant territorial gains in Ukraine in the near term and described the frontlines of the war as a “grinding slog”. Colin Kahl, the US undersecretary of defence for policy, told a House of Representatives hearing: “I do not think that there’s anything I see that suggests the Russians can sweep across Ukraine and make significant territorial gains anytime in the next year or so.” A military drone attempted to strike a gas facility in the Moscow region, according to a senior Russian official, and photos of the wreckage suggested it was Ukrainian-made, indicating a rare attempted strike hundreds of miles behind Russian lines. The alleged attack was one of several reports of successful or attempted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) strikes in at least four regions of Russia. Russia’s Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg temporarily suspended all flights earlier today amid unconfirmed media reports of an unidentified object such as a drone being seen nearby. Some flights were diverted back to Moscow while the airport was shut for about an hour. Russia’s defence ministry later announced there had been a training exercise between air defences and civilian aviation authorities. Emergency services put out a fire at an oil depot in southern Russia overnight after a drone was spotted flying overhead, the RIA news agency said. The fire in the Russian town of Tuapse, Krasnador, was reported at 2.30am local time and spread to an area of about 200 sq metres before it was extinguished. “The oil tanks were not affected. There was no spill of oil products. No injuries,” said Sergei Boyko, who leads the local administration. The Russian defence ministry has stated that it foiled two attempted Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil using drones overnight. It said: “28 February, at night, the Kyiv regime attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar territory and the Republic of Adygea.” The claims have not been independently verified. The military situation is becoming increasingly difficult around the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday, as many of Ukraine’s battlefields turn to mud. The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address: “The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions for fortification and defence.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the town – the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine – also shooting down four Himars missiles and five drones launched by Ukrainian forces. Vladimir Putin has told Russia’s FSB security service to step up its intelligence activity and stop “sabotage groups” entering the country. In a speech to FSB officials, the Russian leader instructed the agency to strengthen its activity to counter what he described as growing espionage and sabotage operations against Russia by Ukraine and its western allies. He also admitted that FSB members had been killed in Ukraine. Russia is open to negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said, but he insisted Moscow would “never compromise” on what he described as new “territorial realities”. Speaking to reporters during a regular briefing, Peskov said Moscow would not renounce its claims to four Ukrainian regions that Putin annexed in September. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has reiterated the Biden administration’s concern that China is considering providing lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Speaking after a meeting with leaders in the Kazakh capital, Astana, Blinken warned that Beijing would face “implications and consequences” if it decided to provide such support. China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, the US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing yesterday. China has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support”, he added. A hacking attack caused some Russian regional broadcasters to put out a false warning urging people to take shelter from an incoming missile attack, the emergencies ministry said. “As a result of the hacking of servers of radio stations and TV channels, in some regions of the country information about the announcement of an air alert was broadcast. This information is false and does not correspond to reality.” A similar attack caused commercial radio stations in some Russian regions to send air alarm messages on Wednesday last week. Ukraine will become a Nato member in the “long term”, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. The Nato chief stressed that the immediate priority was Ukraine remaining an independent country in the face of the Russian invasion. He said Finland and Sweden’s bids to join the alliance were a “top priority” and that the Nordic countries have had the “quickest accession process in Nato’s modern history”. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of the Putin, has arrived in Beijing for a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Vladimir Putin has formally signed a law suspending Russia’s participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US, state media reported. The text of the law’s explanatory note read: The Russian Federation suspends the treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms, signed in Prague on April 8 2010. Russian state-run Tass news agency reported that the document was published today, and the law came into force as of the moment of its official publication. Putin announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New Start, earlier this month. “They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities,” said Putin in a speech before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In this regard, I am forced to state that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty. Finland has begun construction of a 200km fence on the Russian border, the country’s border guard has announced. Terrain work would begin today “with forest clearance and will proceed in such a way that road construction and fence installation can be started in March”, the Finnish border guard said in a statement. The 3km pilot project at the border crossing near Imatra is expected to be completed by the end of June, it added. Construction of a further 70km, mainly in southeastern Finland, will take place between 2023 and 2025. The fence will be more than 3 metres tall with barbed wire at the top, and particularly sensitive areas will be equipped with night vision cameras, lights and loudspeakers. Currently, Finland’s borders are secured primarily by light wooden fences, mainly designed to stop livestock. Although the Finland-Russia border has “worked well” in the past, Brig Gen Jari Tolppanen told AFP in November that the war in Ukraine had changed the security situation “fundamentally” and that a border fence was “indispensable” to stop large-scale illegal entries from Russian territory. The head of the UN’s nuclear agency, Rafael Grossi, has expressed “concern” about Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, citing the facility’s “fragile” power situation, delays in staff rotations, an increased security presence onsite and nearby fighting. In a statement, the International Atomic Energy chief said: The sound of artillery fire near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and the temporary loss of its only remaining back-up power line have again underlined persistent nuclear safety and security risks during the military conflict in the country. IAEA experts who have been at the plant since early January reported hearing about 20 “detonations” yesterday afternoon, “apparently in the vicinity of the plant, which is located on the frontline of an active combat area”. Grossi added: This is a concerning trend that shows the urgency and importance of establishing a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, was captured by Russian forces in March 2022, soon after their invasion of Ukraine. The Chinese satellite firm Spacety provided satellite images to the Russian mercenary Wagner group, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink, told a congressional hearing today. Spacety was added to a US trade blacklist earlier this month for allegedly supporting the Russian military, along with another Chinese satellite company, China HEAD Aerospace Technology Co. Spacety, which was also put under sanctions by the US treasury department in January, at the time said it had complied with international sanctions against Russia. A senior Pentagon official has said the US did not expect Russia to make significant territorial gains in Ukraine in the near term and described the frontlines of the war as a “grinding slog”. Colin Kahl, the US undersecretary of defence for policy, told a House of Representatives hearing today: You may see small portions of territory change hands in the coming weeks and months. I do not think that there’s anything I see that suggests the Russians can sweep across Ukraine and make significant territorial gains anytime in the next year or so. Kahl was asked repeatedly by US lawmakers about sending the jets to Ukraine, Reuters reports. He replied: It is a priority for the Ukrainians, but it is not one of their top three priorities. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of the Russian leader Vladimir Putin, has arrived in Beijing for a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. A military drone attempted to strike a gas facility in the Moscow region, according to a senior Russian official, and photos of the wreckage suggested it was Ukrainian-made, indicating a rare attempt to strike hundreds of miles behind Russian lines. The alleged attack was one of several reports of successful or attempted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) strikes in at least four regions of Russia. The Moscow region governor, Andrei Vorobyov, on Monday confirmed a UAV crash-landed in the village of Gubastovo near the capital and was apparently aiming for a “civilian infrastructure site”. The target was said to be a Gazprom gas compression station in the Moscow suburbs, just over 50 miles south-east of the Kremlin. Photographs of the drone posted to social media indicate it was a Ukrainian-made UJ-22. Ukraine does not publicly claim responsibility for attacks inside Russia. The UAV apparently clipped trees just before its target and landed 10 metres from the outer fence of the gas compression station, a Gazprom representative confirmed to Russian media. Ukrjet, the producer of the UJ-22, claims the drone can fly 500 miles (800km) and is armed with an interchangeable payload. The strike was among others launched on Tuesday. If they were launched from Ukrainian territory, then it would make them some of the most ambitious since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion last February. Read the full story here: It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has reiterated the Biden administration’s concern that China is considering providing lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Speaking after a meeting with leaders in the Kazakh capital, Astana, Blinken warned that Beijing would face “implications and consequences” if it decided to provide such support. China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing yesterday. China has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support”, he added. Vladimir Putin has told Russia’s FSB security service to step up its intelligence activity and stop “sabotage groups” entering the country. In a speech to FSB officials, the Russian leader instructed the agency to strengthen its activity to counter what he described as growing espionage and sabotage operations against Russia by Ukraine and its western allies. He also admitted that FSB members had been killed in Ukraine. Russia’s Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg temporarily suspended all flights earlier today amid unconfirmed media reports of an unidentified object such as a drone being seen nearby. Some flights were diverted back to Moscow while the airport was shut for about an hour. Russia’s defence ministry later announced there had been a training exercise between air defences and civilian aviation authorities. Emergency services put out a fire at an oil depot in southern Russia overnight after a drone was spotted flying overhead, the RIA news agency said. The fire in the Russian town of Tuapse, Krasnador, was reported at 2.30am local time and spread to an area of about 200 sq metres before it was extinguished. “The oil tanks were not affected. There was no spill of oil products. No injuries,” said Sergei Boyko, who leads the local administration. The Russian defence ministry has stated that it foiled two attempted Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil using drones overnight. It said: “28 February, at night, the Kyiv regime attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar territory and the Republic of Adygea.” The claims have not been independently verified. A drone that was downed in the Moscow region had probably been intended to attack civil infrastructure, according to the region’s governor. The drone was downed earlier today near a gas distribution station close to the city of Kolomna, 70 miles (110km) south-east of Moscow, the Russian state-run Ria Novosti news agency reported, citing local emergency services. The military situation is becoming increasingly difficult around the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as many of Ukraine’s battlefields turn to mud. The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address: “The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions for fortification and defence.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the town – the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine – also shooting down four Himars missiles and five drones launched by Ukrainian forces. Russia is open to negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said, but he insisted Moscow would “never compromise” on what he described as new “territorial realities”. Speaking to reporters during a regular briefing, Peskov said Moscow would not renounce its claims to four Ukrainian regions that Vladimir Putin annexed in September. A hacking attack caused some Russian regional broadcasters to put out a false warning urging people to take shelter from an incoming missile attack, the emergencies ministry said. “As a result of the hacking of servers of radio stations and TV channels, in some regions of the country information about the announcement of an air alert was broadcast. This information is false and does not correspond to reality.” A similar attack caused commercial radio stations in some Russian regions to send air alarm messages on Wednesday last week. Ukraine will become a Nato member in the “long term”, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. The Nato chief stressed that the immediate priority was Ukraine remaining an independent country in the face of the Russian invasion. He said Finland and Sweden’s bids to join the alliance were a “top priority” and that the Nordic countries have had the “quickest accession process in Nato’s modern history”. The loss of an A-50 Mainstay plane would be significant as it is critical to Russian air operations in “providing an air battlespace picture”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in response to earlier claims from Belarusian anti-war partisans to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft on Sunday. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield, 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early-warning and control aircraft (Awacs). Poland will cut its oil imports from Russia to “close to zero” in February and March, the country’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. His remarks came after Poland’s largest oil company, PKN Orlen, said Russia had unexpectedly halted supplies of oil to Poland via the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’m here to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has reiterated the Biden administration’s concern that China is considering providing lethal aid to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Speaking after a meeting with leaders in the Kazakh capital, Astana, Blinken warned that Beijing would face “implications and consequences” if it decided to provide such support. He said: We will not hesitate, for example, to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, or otherwise engage in supporting the Russian war effort. He said he had raised the issue directly with the top Chinese diplomat, Wang Yi, last week “because of concern we have based on information that we have, that China is considering moving beyond the non-lethal support that some of its companies have been providing to actually lethal material support for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine”. He added: China can’t have it both ways when it comes to the Russian aggression in Ukraine. It can’t be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand, while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that four fires have broken out in Kherson today as a result of Russian shelling. There are no casualties reported. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires from the besieged frontline city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Vladimir Putin, speaking at an expanded board meeting of Russia’s FSB service, also admitted that FSB members had been killed in Ukraine. Putin said: Unfortunately, there are losses in our ranks. He was quoted by the state-run Ria Novosti news agency as saying: The leadership of the FSB must do everything to additionally support the families of our fallen comrades. We will always remember their heroism and courage. Putin added that “2022 was a special year for the whole country and for your service”, and said FSB units were “directly involved” in what he described as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. He said: I would like to thank the management and all employees of the department, especially those who acted at the forefront, in the liberated territories, in the frontline zone and, I would add, behind enemy lines. I want to thank you for this work, dear comrades. Vladimir Putin has told Russia’s FSB security service to step up its intelligence activity and stop “sabotage groups” entering the country. In a speech to FSB officials, reported by Reuters, the Russian leader instructed the agency to strengthen its activity to counter what he described as growing espionage and sabotage operations against Russia by Ukraine and its western allies. He ordered officials to step up the protection of key Russian infrastructure, and prevent any attempts by western security services to revive what he called “terrorist cells” on Russian territory. He said: Western intelligence services have traditionally always been actively working in Russia, and now they have thrown additional personnel, technical and other resources against us. We need to respond accordingly. He said the FSB had to prevent illegal weapons flows into Russia, and to strengthen security in four regions of Ukraine that he annexed last year, a move that has not been recognised by most UN countries. Oleh Bendyk showed off a video taken in Ukraine’s eastern forests. It shows a group of soldiers from Bendyk’s 103rd brigade sheltering in a sandy trench. Around them a battle rages. There are explosions, booms, and the rattle of small arms fire. A grad missile crashes down among the pine trees, in a large orange fireball. “Some bastards are firing at us from over there. But we can’t see who they are because of the forest,” a soldier says. He adds: A Grad now! Do you see how we get hit? It’s been like this since 7am. And now it’s 11am. That’s how it fucking is, folks! Bendyk and his fellow Ukrainian soldiers have been holding off a surging Russian offensive west of Kreminna, a city that Moscow captured last year. Further along the same front, Ukrainian soldiers are doggedly defending the town of Bakhmut, once home to 70,000 people. Fighting has gone on there for months. In his latest video address on Monday Volodymyr Zelenskiy acknowledged that the situation was “constantly becoming more difficult”. Bakhmut was “extremely tense”, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, confirmed. The “most prepared assault units” from the Wagner mercenary group were trying to break through and surround the city, he said. The Russian army and Wagner have been making incremental gains in the area. In January they took the nearby town of Soledar. So far they have been unable to capture the ruined centre of Bakhmut, despite multiple attempts. About half of Donetsk oblast in the Donbas region remains under Kyiv’s control, a year after Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion. According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia’s president has ordered his military to seize all of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces by the end of March. A decisive Russian offensive has yet to happen. “That was an ordinary day,” Bendyk said of the hellish forest video, shot in late January. Some days are a lot worse, when our guys get injured or killed. The Russians have a lot of artillery. They go quadrant by quadrant. We need more counter-battery fire. Read the full story by my colleague Luke Harding here: Poland will cut its oil imports from Russia to “close to zero” n February and March, the country’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki said: At the beginning of this year imports from Russia decreased to 10% ... and February-March, from information I get from Orlen, it will be 0%, so a number close to zero. His remarks came after Poland’s largest oil company, PKN Orlen, said Russia had unexpectedly halted supplies of oil to Poland via the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline. Ukraine “has always been Europe, Ukraine will always be Europe,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted on Twitter. The Ukrainian president said it was a year ago, on the fifth day of Russia’s invasion of his country, that Kyiv applied to join the EU. This year “is the time to decide on the launch of membership negotiations”, he said. He added: It’s Ukraine that has brought the EU together like never before. It’s Ukraine that’s defending European values for generations to come. It’s Ukraine where Europe becomes whole, free, and at peace. Together in struggle, together in victory. Ukraine will become a Nato member in the “long term”, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. The Nato chief stressed that the immediate priority was Ukraine remaining an independent country in the face of the Russian invasion. Speaking at a joint press conference with Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, in Helsinki, Stoltenberg said: Nato allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a member of our alliance, but at the same time that is a long-term perspective. He said Finland and Sweden’s bids to join the alliance were a “top priority” and that the Nordic countries have had the “quickest accession process in Nato’s modern history”. Stoltenberg’s remarks came a day after Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said talks with Helsinki and Stockholm over their Nato membership bids would resume on 9 March. The US and other Nato member countries are hoping Finland and Sweden will become members at a Nato summit due to held on 11 July in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. German-made Leopard tanks have been spotted near the besieged town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, according to an adviser to the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. Speaking to state broadcaster Russia 1, Yan Gagin said: There have been claims that Leopards have appeared near Artemovsk [the Russian name for Bakhmut]. He added that there was “no need to sensationalise” the presence of the Leopard tanks near the frontline. He said: Given the muddy weather now, it will make it difficult for heavy vehicles like the Leopard to move. [It] is the same armoured target as all the others. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary Wager group, on Sunday said there was information that Leopard tanks had arrived at Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut, but that there had not yet been “encounters” with the tanks on the battlefield. A drone that was downed in the Moscow region had probably been intended to attack civil infrastructure, according to the region’s governor. The drone was downed earlier today near a gas distribution station close to the city of Kolomna, 110km (70 miles) south-east of Moscow, the Russian state-run Ria Novosti news agency reported, citing local emergency services. There was no damage to any infrastructure and no casualties, the governor said. Russia’s defence ministry earlier said it had foiled two attempted Ukrainian drone attacks on two southern Russian regions overnight. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are some images we have received from the news wires of Antony Blinken’s visit to Kazakhstan to meet top diplomats from all five former Soviet republics after the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US secretary of state is meeting the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in Astana today before travelling on to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Blinken will stress the US “commitment to the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of central Asian countries”, the state department said in a statement that mirrored the wording it has been using to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said that Russia is open to negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine, but insisted Moscow would “never compromise” on what he described as new “territorial realities”. Speaking to reporters during a regular briefing, Peskov said Moscow would not renounce its claims to four Ukrainian regions that Vladimir Putin annexed in September. The Russian president signed “accession treaties” formalising Russia’s annexation of the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk regions after Kremlin-orchestrated fake referendums that Ukraine and the west consider illegal. Peskov said: There are certain realities that have already become an internal factor. I mean the new territories. The constitution of the Russian Federation exists, and cannot be ignored. Russia will never be able to compromise on this. These are important realities. He said Moscow was open to talks if Kyiv accepted its control over those regions. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four regions. Peskov added: With a favourable state of affairs and the appropriate attitude from the Ukrainians, this can be resolved at the negotiating table. But the main thing is to achieve our goals.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday pledged support for Kazakhstan’s independence on a trip to boost influence in central Asia. The airline carrier Wizz Air has announced it will suspend flights to Moldova’s capital, Chișinău, from 14 March because of concerns about the safety of its airspace. In a statement, the company said it had taken the “difficult but responsible” decision to suspend flights because of the “high, but not imminent” risk in Moldova’s airspace. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back with you later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly to continue our live coverage. The Russian ministry of defence has stated that it foiled two attempted Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil using drones overnight. It said: 28 February, at night, the Kyiv regime attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar territory and the Republic of Adygea. The UAVs were suppressed by the electronic warfare units of the Russian Federation armed forces. Both drones lost control and deviated from their flight path. One UAV fell in a field, another UAV, deviating from the trajectory, did not harm the attacked civilian infrastructure facility. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian news sources including Tass are carrying a statement from the Russian ministry of defence which claims that the closure of airspace around St Petersburg this morning was part of a training exercise. Tass quotes a ministry statement saying: On 28 February, the duty forces of the western zone of responsibility for air defence conducted a training session on interaction with civilian air traffic control authorities. During the training, the duty air defence forces worked out the issues of detecting, intercepting and identifying the alleged target of the intruder, as well as interacting with emergency services and law enforcement agencies in the event of an emergency situation. Unverified media reports in Russia had earlier claimed that the closure was due to an unidentified object being spotted near the airport. Oleksiy Sorokin of the Kyiv Independent points out how far away the oil depot in Tuapse is from Ukraine’s territory. [See 8.48 GMT] Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to the Telegram messaging app to celebrate the anniversary of Ukraine applying to become a member of the European Union. He writes: A year ago, on the fifth day of the full-scale war, we applied for Ukraine’s accession to the European Union. We obtained the candidacy. This year is the time to decide on the launch of membership negotiations. It is with Ukraine that the majestic project of a peaceful, free and united Europe will be complete. We are together in the struggle, and therefore we will be together in victory. Long live Europe. Long live freedom. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine sent to us over the news wires. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was kept fully informed about a temporary airspace ban over the city of St Petersburg on Tuesday, the Kremlin said, but it declined to comment further on what caused the hour-long disruption to flights, Reuters reports. The Wikimedia Foundation was fined 2m roubles (£22k) in Russia on Tuesday over what authorities said was its failure to remove “fake information” about Russia’s actions in Ukraine from the Wikipedia website, Reuters reports. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, has posted on Telegram to say that one person was killed and a private residential building was destroyed by shelling this morning in Kherson. A hacking attack caused some Russian regional broadcasters to put out a false warning on Tuesday urging people to take shelter from an incoming missile attack, the emergencies ministry has said. “As a result of the hacking of servers of radio stations and TV channels, in some regions of the country information about the announcement of an air alert was broadcast,” Reuters reports the ministry said in a statement. “This information is false and does not correspond to reality.” Among the regions where the fake messages were broadcast was Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move not widely internationally recognised. On regional TV an image was shown with a symbol of a man running for cover from incoming missiles and a message reading “Everybody to the shelter, now,” according to images posted on social media. A similar attack caused commercial radio stations in some Russian regions to send air alarm messages last Wednesday. Tass reports that flights at Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg have been resumed. Flights were stopped after an unknown object was reportedly spotted flying near it. Russia’s Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg has temporarily suspended all flights on Tuesday, the city government has said, amid unconfirmed Russian media reports of an unidentified object, such as a drone, above the city. Reuters reports that the government of Russia’s second city said on its official Telegram channel that it had halted all flights at the airport until noon local time (9am GMT). It did not provide a reason for the suspension. The state-run Tass news agency said airspace within a 200km (124-mile) radius of Pulkovo had been closed until 1.20pm local time (10.20 GMT), citing an unnamed source. An unconfirmed media report from online Russian news outlet Baza said an unidentified object had been spotted in the sky and that fighter jets had been dispatched to investigate. Emergency services put out a fire at an oil depot in southern Russia overnight after a drone was spotted flying overhead, the RIA news agency said on Tuesday. The fire in the Russian town of Tuapse was reported at 2.30am local time (23.30pm Monday GMT) and spread to an area of about 200 sq metres before it was extinguished, Reuters notes a local official said. “The oil tanks were not affected. There was no spill of oil products. No injuries,” said Sergei Boyko, who leads the local administration. Tuapse lies on Russia’s southern coast, about 240 km (149 miles) south-east of the Crimean peninsula. Moscow has reported sporadic incidents at oil and gas infrastructure in regions near Ukraine since the war started a year ago. Russian officials have often blamed Kyiv for sending drones into Russian territory. Tass reports that the airspace within a radius of 200km (124 miles) of St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport is closed until 10.20am GMT (1.20pm local time). Russia’s Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg has now temporarily suspended all flights on Tuesday, the city government said on its Telegram channel. Reuters reports that it did not provide a reason. The stoppage will last until 9am GMT (noon local time). There are also unconfirmed reports on social media that a fire broke out overnight at the oil refinery in Tuapse in Russia’s Krasnodar region. Tuapse sits near the coast of the Black Sea, south of Crimea and north of Sochi. The unconfirmed speculation is that it was struck by a drone attack. Images purportedly from the scene show a pillar of smoke rising into the air, and a fire on the grounds of the refinery. Reuters is reporting that a number of Russian domestic flights to St Petersburg were turned back to their departure points on Tuesday, according to the Flight Radar flight-tracking website. At least five flights en route from the capital, Moscow, to St Petersburg had been turned back towards Moscow as of 8am GMT (11am local time), after initially circling in the air, flight paths on Flight Radar showed. It was not immediately clear why, though Reuters said that an unconfirmed media report from online Russian news outlet Baza claimed an unidentified object had been spotted in the sky and that fighter jets had been dispatched to investigate. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has offered this round-up of overnight events on its Telegram channel, writing: At night, Russian troops shelled Sviatohirsk in Donetsk region – they hit a part of the state emergency service. A rescuer was killed and four others were injured. Also at night, the Russian army shelled Zelenivka near Kherson, no people were injured. Over the past 24 hours, one person was killed and nine others were injured in the shelling by the Russian army in Donetsk region. Three people were injured in the Kherson region. Russian troops continue to advance in five directions. In the last day, defence forces repelled more than 60 attacks, as well as destroyed 12 drones and struck four areas where the Russian army was concentrated. The claims have not been independently verified. The regional government in Sumy, in Ukraine’s north-east, recorded 36 strikes on its territory in overnight Russian shelling, according to reports from Ukraine’s state broadcaster, Suspilne. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday pledged support for Kazakhstan’s independence on a trip to boost influence in central Asia, which has been rattled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “As you know well, the US strongly supports Kazakhstan’s sovereignty, its independence, its territorial integrity,” Blinken said as he met his Kazakh counterpart. “Sometimes we just say those words and they actually have no meaning. And of course, in this particular time, they have even more resonance than usual,” Blinken said, referring to Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Blinken said the US was “determined to make even stronger” its relationship with Kazakhstan. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London from my colleague Samantha Lock in Sydney. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The loss of an A-50 Mainstay would be significant as it is critical to Russian air operations for “providing an air battlespace picture”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in response to earlier claims from Belarusian anti-war partisans to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft on Sunday. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). Attribution and damage has not been officially corroborated. However, the loss of an A-50 Mainstay would be significant as it is critical to Russian air operations for providing an air battlespace picture,” the latest British intelligence report reads. This will likely leave 6 operational A-50s in service, further constraining Russian air operations.” The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, says the situation around the besieged town of Bakhmut is “extremely tense”. Despite significant losses, the enemy threw in the most prepared assault units of Wagner, who are trying to break through the defences of our troops and surround the city,” Syrskyi was quoted as saying on the Ukraine’s media military centre Telegram messaging platform on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s head of military intelligence has brushed aside claims that China is considering furnishing arms to Russia, telling US media that he saw no “signs that such things are even being discussed”. Senior US officials voiced concerns that they were “confident” China was considering providing lethal equipment to Moscow. But when asked about the possibility in an interview with Voice of America published on Monday, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said: I do not share this opinion … As of now, I do not think that China will agree to the transfer of weapons to Russia. I do not see any signs that such things are even being discussed.” Earlier this month, US secretary of state Antony Blinken aired Washington’s concerns about potential arms shipments in a tense meeting with his Chinese counterpart, and the director of the CIA said on Sunday that he believed Beijing was still weighing the possibility. Asked specifically about the US assessment, Budanov said: “I am the head of intelligence and I rely, with all due respect, not on the opinions of individual people, but only on facts. I do not see such facts.” China has more sophisticated technology and resources at its disposal to possibly provide to Russian forces in Ukraine, US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing on Monday. Price noted the impact of the provision of Iranian-produced drones, or UAVs, has had in Ukraine in targeting civilian sites and energy infrastructure but warned the consequences of Chinese involvement could be “potentially dire and tragic”. According to a transcript of the press briefing published by the US department of state, Price said: Now, of course the PRC has at its disposal technology and resources that Iran doesn’t have, and so one could imagine the implications of the provision of significant amounts of lethal assistance. It’s for that reason that we don’t want to see it happen. We’re continuing to warn very clearly about the consequences that would befall Beijing should it proceed down this path. Ultimately, Beijing is going to have to make its own sovereign decision. Our goal is to see to it that Beijing makes informed decisions … there would be costs and there would be consequences if the PRC were to go down this route.” China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing on Monday. Although China has “attempted to maintain this veneer of neutrality” it has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support”, Price told reporters. According to a transcript of the press briefing published by the US department of state, Price said: The PRC has told the world that, essentially, it is not taking a position, but rather it has tried to portray itself as an honest broker. In word and in deed, however, the PRC has been anything but an honest broker. Leaving aside the question of lethal assistance – which we don’t believe the PRC has provided yet, but we do believe it is considering – leaving that aside, the PRC has already provided important forms of assistance to Russia, including in the context of its aggression against Ukraine. It’s provided Russia with diplomatic support, with political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support, including by parroting Russia’s dangerous propaganda, dangerous lies, and disinformation on the world stage.” Price added that he hopes China “begins to use its influence in a constructive way”. There are countries around the world that, if they sought to bring this war to an end, would have a significant amount of leverage with the Russian Federation, with other key countries. The PRC certainly falls within that category. But to date, at least, despite the PRC’s protests to the contrary, we have seen them very clearly take a side in this war.” Price continued: So if China were serious about seeking to bring an end to this war, it would have influence, it would have leverage over the government in Moscow that we would hope it would use in a constructive way. It does give us pause, concern, that … the PRC has engaged with Russia, including with high-level visits, Wang Yi’s visit to Moscow just within recent days, even while the PRC is not engaged symmetrically with Ukraine.” As the battles continue to rage across eastern Ukraine, here are some of the latest images to be sent over our newswires today. The military situation is becoming increasingly difficult around Bakhmut, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as many of Ukraine’s battlefields turn to mud and Russian forces attempt to close ring around the eastern Ukrainian town. Zelenskiy said in his Monday night address: Bakhmut direction – the situation is getting more and more difficult. The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions, to gain a foothold and ensure defence.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the town – the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine – also shooting down four Himars missiles and five drones launched by Ukrainian forces. “The number of enemy personnel is increasing,” Ukraine’s general staff said, adding that six nearby Donetsk settlements came under Russian shelling. Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence, said Russia is “increasing the intensity of its assaults” using “tactics of exhaustion and total destruction”. In a Telegram post late on Monday night, she said: To put it briefly and simply: the situation at the front is complicated. The enemy army is increasing the intensity of its assaults. The most difficult situation remains in the Bakhmut direction. During offensive operations, the enemy uses tactics of exhaustion and total destruction. At the same time, the enemy is suffering significant losses, losing from 600 to 1,000 people daily.” In the Donetsk region, suddenly warmer weather has softened the frozen ground, turning battlefields into mud. The spring thaw can turn roads into rivers and fields into impenetrable bogs. “Both sides stay in their positions, because as you see, spring means mud. Thus, it is impossible to move forward,” one Ukrainian commander told Reuters. Russia is trying to encircle Bakhmut, forcing Ukraine to pull out its garrison. That would give Moscow its first major prize in more than half a year after Russia intensified its attacks on several locations along the front in the east. The fierce fighting for the industrial city has been the longest-running battle of Russia’s year-long invasion. Moscow’s troops have made clear, if slow, progress north and south of Bakhmut, attempting to cut off Ukrainian forces inside the ruined city, which once held around 75,000 people. “Vicious battles are going on there. The command is doing everything it can to stop the enemy from advancing through our territory,” Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern military command, told Ukrainian television. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and this will be the last time I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold. The military situation around Bakhmut, the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine, is becoming “increasingly difficult”, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Russian forces appear to be making more strident attempts to close ring around the eastern Ukrainian town as Ukraine’s eastern military command describes “vicious battles” to stop Russian troops from advancing further through the territory. US officials say China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine. US department of state spokesperson Ned Price made the comments during a news briefing on Monday, claiming China has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support”. It’s 7.30am in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The military situation is becoming increasingly difficult around the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as many of Ukraine’s battlefields turn to mud. “In the Bakhmut sector, the situation is constantly becoming more difficult,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions for fortification and defence.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot near the town – the focal point of Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine – also shooting down four Himars missiles and five drones launched by Ukrainian forces. Belarusian anti-war partisans claim to have severely damaged a Russian military aircraft in what an opposition leader has called the “most successful diversion” since the beginning of the war. BYPOL, the Belarusian partisan organisation, said it had used drones to strike the Machulishchy airfield 12km from Minsk, severely damaging a Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft (Awacs). China has “very clearly” taken Russia’s side and has been “anything but an honest broker” in efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, US department of state spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing on Monday. China has provided Russia with “diplomatic support, political support, with economic support, with rhetorical support,” he added. Russia has given a lukewarm response to a Chinese peace plan to end the war in Ukraine but said it was paying “a great deal of attention” to the detail. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any initiatives that might bring peace closer were worthy of attention and Beijing’s voice should be heard, but the nuances of the proposal are important and, for now, he didn’t see any signs suggesting a peaceful resolution could be achieved. “Any attempt to formulate theses for reaching a peaceful settlement of the problem is welcome, but, of course, the nuances are important,” Peskov told the Izvestia daily. Russia will not resume participation in the Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US until Washington listens to Moscow’s position, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in remarks published on Tuesday. Russian president Vladimir Putin last week announced Russia’s decision to suspend participation in the latest Start treaty, after accusing the west of being directly involved in attempts to strike its strategic airbases. Peskov told the daily Izvestia in an interview that the “attitude of the collective west”, led by the US needs to change towards Moscow. “The security of one country cannot be ensured at the expense of the security of another,” Peskov said. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, is due to visit Beijing on Tuesday for a meeting with China’s president Xi Jinping, in a high-profile trip symbolising the widening gulf between the US and China over the war in Ukraine. Xi’s meeting with Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, is seen internationally as a sign of where Beijing’s sympathies lie. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, met with Zelenskiy and other key Ukrainian government officials in a surprise visit to Ukraine to reaffirm Washington’s support for Kyiv on Monday. Following talks with prime minister Denys Shmyhal, Yellen said that the US has provided nearly $50bn in security, economic and humanitarian assistance, and announced another multibillion-dollar package to boost the country’s economy. Poland has announced a joint initiative with the European Commission to trace Ukrainian children who have been abducted and taken to Russia during the ongoing war in Ukraine. The aim of the scheme is to track down the missing children and to “ensure those responsible are brought to justice”, Poland’s EU affairs minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk said. “We need to return the abducted children to Ukraine and punish Russia for its crimes,” Shmyhal said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-blasts-hit-kyiv-city-centre-says-mayor-us-finalising-plans-to-deliver-patriot-air-defence-system","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T19:00:13Z","webTitle":"US ‘has no expectation’ fighting in Ukraine will stop in winter; Russian rockets hit administration building in Kherson – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-blasts-hit-kyiv-city-centre-says-mayor-us-finalising-plans-to-deliver-patriot-air-defence-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-blasts-hit-kyiv-city-centre-says-mayor-us-finalising-plans-to-deliver-patriot-air-defence-system","fields":{"headline":"US ‘has no expectation’ fighting in Ukraine will stop in winter; Russian rockets hit administration building in Kherson – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US expects that the war in Ukraine will continue “for some time going forward” and there is “no expectation” that fighting will stop in the winter months. Kirby also confirmed that a US citizen has been released as part of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, but did not release additional details, citing privacy concerns. The Ukrainian military said it shot down 13 Iranian-made drones over Kyiv and the surrounding region following Russia’s first major drone attack on the capital in weeks. Authorities described the assault early on Wednesday as a continuation of Russia’s “energy terror” against the country. There were no victims, the spokesperson for Kyiv’s rescue services, Svitlana Vodolaga, told Ukraine’s Suspilne news. Wednesday’s Russian drone strikes damaged five buildings in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv – though air defences thwarted many more, authorities said. The attacks underline how Ukraine’s biggest city remains vulnerable to the regular Russian attacks which have devastated infrastructure and other population centres, mostly in the country’s east and south in recent weeks. One unofficial Telegram channel has posted a picture of what appears to be a piece of a downed drone with the words “For Ryazan!!!” written on it in Russian. On 5 December, a Russian military airbase in the city of Ryazan in western Russia was attacked. A Russian Tu-95 bomber plane, which has been used to attack Ukraine, was damaged and three soldiers at the base were fatally wounded, according to Russia’s ministry of defence. Russian forces firing multiple rocket launchers hit the regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to a senior Ukrainian official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said two floors of the building on the central square of the recently liberated city had been damaged, but that no one was reported hurt. An unconfirmed video circulating on social media showed a huge plume of smoke pouring up from the top of the administration building. Russian drone strikes on Kyiv and the region around the Ukrainian capital, on Wednesday, did not damage any energy facilities, national power grid operator Ukrenergo said. “Thanks to the brilliant work of the air defence forces, the energy infrastructure facilities were not damaged (on Wednesday) – all 13 drones were shot down,” Ukrenergo said on Telegram. The Russian assault on Wednesday morning came as the US was expected to decide whether to supply Ukraine with its advanced Patriot air defence system. US officials told CNN that the missiles could be delivered in a matter of days after the repeated Russian barrages against Ukrainian cities. The Patriot, which would be the most advanced surface-to-air missile system the west has provided to Ukraine, is usually in short supply, with US allies around the world vying for it. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia has not received any proposals about a “Christmas ceasefire” in Ukraine, adding that the topic was “not on the agenda”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, earlier this week called on G7 leaders to back a peace solution that would start with Russia withdrawing troops from Ukraine, beginning this Christmas. Peskov insisted at Tuesday’s briefing that Kyiv needed to accept new territorial “realities” that included Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions as its “new subjects” – annexations that most UN countries have condemned as illegal. Ukraine’s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Wednesday that it was Peskov and President Vladimir Putin who had to accept the “new reality” that “there are no stolen Ukrainian territories within the [Russian Federation] ‘forever’”. Ukraine’s state-run energy agency, Energoatom, said it will offer higher bonuses to staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant who remain loyal to Kyiv. Energoatom said Russian forces have told Ukrainian workers at the plant that they will not be paid in the new year unless they sign contracts with Russia’s nuclear energy company, Rosatom. Nearly seven million children in Ukraine, or almost every child in the country, have been put at “desperate risk” as a result of continued attacks on Ukrainian critical energy infrastructure, the UN’s children agency has warned. Without sustained access to electricity, children in Ukraine are “facing a bleak winter huddled in the cold and the dark” with temperatures of below -20C, Unicef said. Many schools in the country have been destroyed or damaged by missile attacks, leaving children unable to continue the online learning opportunities which, for many, is their only access to education, it said. Ukrainian investigators have uncovered a “torture chamber“ in Kherson city where children were allegedly detained and abused by Russian occupying forces, Ukraine’s human rights chief said. Russian security services kept the children in what they called “the children’s cell” where they were given little water and almost no food, Dmytro Lubinets said, citing local residents’ testimonies. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Europe to support a war tribunal to try senior Russian officials as he accepted the EU’s top human rights award. The EU and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, have lent support for the creation of a special tribunal to try senior Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. President Zelenksiy said 184 Ukrainian athletes have been killed as a result of Russia’s war since its troops invaded Ukraine in February. The Ukrainian leader noted the figure during a conversation with the head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Thomas Bach. It is not possible to independently verify the number of Ukrainian athletes that have been killed in the war. The European Union is united in its support for Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the German parliament, adding, with apparent reference to Hungary, that attempts to undermine the bloc’s values by blocking foreign policy measures would fail. Support for Ukraine, including sanctions against Russia, would be maintained and intensified for as long as President Vladimir Putin keeps up his war against Kyiv, Scholz added. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has now been released as part of a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was released by Russia along with 64 Ukrainian soldiers and the bodies of four fallen soldiers, Yermark said. Murekezi told the Guardian earlier this month that he felt “trapped” after he was released in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk without his papers. The new head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said she intends to go to Moscow to discuss access to prisoners of war “when the moment is there”. Mirjana Spoljaric Egger told reporters she had personally been “speaking with Russian counterparts”, adding that she sees the possibility of a major prisoner of war swap deal in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Russian oil revenues fell last month despite a boost in production to just below levels before the invasion of Ukraine, the International Energy Agency has said. The IEA estimated that Russia earned about $15.8bn (£12.8bn) from oil sales in November, the second lowest this year after $14.7bn in September, a sign that western efforts to choke off the Kremlin’s income are working. Pope Francis urged people to spend less on Christmas celebrations and gifts this year and send the difference to Ukrainians to help them get through the hunger and cold of winter. The pope, who has been making appeals for Ukraine at nearly every public event since Russia invaded its neighbour in February, made the unscripted plea at the end of his weekly general audience. Volodymyr Zelenksiy has said 184 Ukrainian athletes have been killed as a result of Russia’s war since its troops invaded Ukraine in February. The Ukrainian leader noted the figure during a conversation with the head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Thomas Bach, today. It is not possible to independently verify the number of Ukrainian athletes that have been killed in the war. Zelenskiy informed Bach of Kyiv’s opposition to the idea of Russian athletes taking part in the 2024 summer games in Paris, Ukraine’s presidential office said. Bach said last week that the participation of Russian and Belarusian sportsmen and women at the 2024 Olympics was still unclear. Ukraine was disappointed by what he called the IOC’s intention to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete under a neutral flag, Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy was quoted by his office as saying: One cannot try to be neutral when the foundations of peaceful life are being destroyed and universal human values are being ignored. A just response to such actions can only be the complete isolation of the terrorist state in the international arena. In particular, this applies to international sporting events. The White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US expects that the war in Ukraine will continue “for some time going forward” and there is “no expectation” that fighting will stop in the winter months. Asked about prospects for negotiating an end to the war with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirby told reporters: Just given what we’re seeing in the air and on the ground in Ukraine, it’s difficult to conclude that this war will be over by year’s end. So there is active fighting going on right now. We would expect that that will continue for some time going forward. He warned against assuming that the harsh winter weather would curtail war manoeuvres in the air or on the ground. He said: While that is true, we have no expectation that the fighting will stop in the winter months to come. Kirby also confirmed that a US citizen has been released as part of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, but did not release additional details, citing privacy concerns. The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, earlier identified the American as Suedi Murekezi. Ukraine’s state-run energy agency, Energoatom, said it will offer higher bonuses to staff at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant who remain loyal to Kyiv. The nuclear station in southern Ukraine, Europe’s largest, has been occupied since the early days of the war but is still being operated by its Ukrainian staff. Energoatom said Russian forces have told Ukrainian workers at the plant that they will not be paid in the new year unless they sign contracts with Russia’s nuclear energy company, Rosatom. Statements by these Russian forces are “another shameless lie”, Energoatom said in a statement. It added: Energoatom continues to guarantee the payment of wages and all compensations provided for in the collective agreement to ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) employees. In addition, from January 1, Energoatom is also increasing from 20% to 50% the bonus for ZNPP personnel who stay loyal to Ukraine. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The new head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said she intends to go to Moscow to discuss access to prisoners of war “when the moment is there”. Mirjana Spoljaric, who took over as ICRC head in October, told reporters in Geneva she had personally been “speaking with Russian counterparts”. Speaking just days after returning from Ukraine, she said the ICRC was intent on gaining access to POWs taken by both sides since Russia’s troops invaded Ukraine in February. She said: We are in daily conversations at different levels, because access to prisoners of war is an ongoing engagement. The ICRC was “determined to access all prisoners, no matter where they are”, she said, adding, “We also want to access civilians detained”. The Russian MP and deputy head of “A Just Russia” party, Oleg Nilov, was filmed joking that a Ukrainian child “dreams of rockets” at a charity event in Russia. In the video, Nilov pick’s a child’s wish under a charity Christmas tree and says: Vova, a boy from Kyiv dreams of rockets. Vova, you’ll get rockets - just wait. He adds “that’s a joke of course”. From my colleague Isobel Koshiw: Russian oil revenues fell last month, despite a boost in production, to just below levels before the invasion of Ukraine, the International Energy Agency has said, in a sign that western efforts to choke off the Kremlin’s income are working. The IEA estimated that Russia earned about $15.8bn (£12.8bn) from oil sales in November, the second lowest this year after $14.7bn in September. The revenue fall came despite a rise in Russia’s exports of crude oil and products to 8.1m barrels a day, the highest level since April, two months after Russia invaded Ukraine. It is a positive signal for western countries hoping to curb the Kremlin’s funding from energy exports, which represent Russia’s largest source of revenues. The EU and G7 introduced a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil on 5 December as governments tried to strike a balance between cutting the Kremlin’s revenues and keep control of fuel price inflation. The price of non-Russian oil was about $81 a barrel on Wednesday. Industry watchers have questioned how effective the cap will be because Russian oil is already trading below $60 a barrel. The IEA said the country’s export crude blend, Urals, slid to about $43 a barrel as of early December. Read the full story here: It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, here to bring you all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukrainian investigators have uncovered a “torture chamber“ in Kherson city where children were allegedly detained and abused by Russian occupying forces, Ukraine’s human rights chief, Dmytro Lubinets, said. Russian security services kept the children in what they called “the children’s cell” where they were given little water and almost no food, Lubinets said, citing local residents’ testimonies. According to the testimonies, the children were subjected to psychological abuse at the hands of their Russian captors, who told them that their parents had abandoned them and that they would never return home. One 14-year-old boy was arrested and later tortured just for taking a picture of broken Russian equipment, Lubinets said. The Ukrainian ombudsman said: We recorded the torture of children for the first time. I thought that the bottom could not be broken after Buchi, Irpin... but we really reached the bottom in Kherson. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. The Guardian has visited a separate “torture room” in Kherson city where Ukraine says dozens of men were detained, electrocuted, beaten and some of them killed by Russian soldiers. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has now been released as part of a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was released by Russia along with 64 Ukrainian soldiers and the bodies of four fallen soldiers, Yermark said. My colleague Pjotr Sauer spoke earlier this month with Murekezi, who said he felt “trapped” after he was released by Russian forces in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk without his papers. Murekezi was detained on 10 June by Russian proxy forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he said he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi and his close friends and relatives said he did not participate in any fighting in Ukraine, to where he moved about four years ago, eventually settling in Kherson. You can read the full interview with Murekezi here: The German parliament’s budget committee approved a 10 bn euro purchase of F-35 fighter jets produced by US defence giant Lockheed Martin, two members of the committee told Reuters. It is one of the first major defence projects where Berlin will tap money from a 100 billion euro special fund that Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced in a major policy shift days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The money is meant to bring the Bundeswehr’s weapons and equipment back up to standard after decades of attrition after the end of the cold war. Germany aims to buy 35 F-35 stealth fighter jets in total, including missiles and other weapons and equipment, with the first eight aircraft to be delivered in 2026. The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Wednesday she saw the possibility of a major prisoner of war swap deal in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. “On an all-for-all exchange, it has happened in the past, it is a known practice, and it can happen in the Russia-Ukraine international conflict as well,” Mirjana Spoljaric Egger told reporters. “So this possibility is certainly one that can be taken by the parties.” She declined to give further details, Reuters reported. The Moscow-installed head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in eastern Ukraine, Denis Pushilin, said Russian forces will “liberate” the Ukrainian cities of Chernihiv and Odesa. The so-called DPR is one of four regions in Ukraine that Moscow proclaimed as its own in September in a move that Ukraine and its allies have condemned as illegal. Pushilin told the Russian state-owned news agency Ria yesterday that more than half of Donetsk was under Russian control. It is not possible to independently verify his claim. In this video, shared by the BBC’s Francis Scarr, Pushilin said Moscow was currently focused on “liberating” the entire Donetsk region. The UK’s defence ministry has said Russia is still likely to be planning deeper advances within Donetsk, but has said it is “highly unlikely” that they will be able to do so. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Europe to support a war tribunal to try senior Russian officials as he accepted the EU’s top human rights award on behalf of the “brave people of Ukraine”. In a video address to the European parliament, Zelenskiy said the tribunal must start working and called on lawmakers to help set it up. He added: It is necessary to make it a reality as soon as possible. The Ukrainian leader made the appeal as he received the EU’s annual Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The award was for “those Ukrainians fighting on the ground, for those who have been forced to flee, for those who have lost relatives and friends, for all those who stand up and fight for who and what they believe in”, the European parliament’s president, Roberta Metsola, said when the announcement was first made. Zelenskiy’s address to the EU parliament continued: The cities and villages destroyed by Russia, destroyed lives should be reflected in the sentences not only for those who directly committed all this but also for those who organised and started this aggression. He insisted his country will win “so that there will be no attempts to apply, again, the genocidal policy against our people, both in Ukraine and throughout Europe”. The European Union and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, have lent support for the creation of a special tribunal to try senior Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Kyiv, after a series of explosions hit the capital in what authorities described as a continuation of Russia’s “energy terror” against the country. Nearly seven million children in Ukraine, or almost every child in the country, have been put at “desperate risk” as continued attacks on Ukrainian critical energy infrastructure cause widespread blackouts and disruption of heating and water, the UN’s children agency has warned. Without sustained access to electricity, children in Ukraine are “facing a bleak winter huddled in the cold and the dark” with temperatures of below -20C, Unicef said. Many schools in the country have been destroyed or damaged by missile attacks, leaving children unable to continue the online learning opportunities which, for many, is their only access to education, it said. Unicef’s executive director, Catherine Russell, said: Beyond the immediate threats the freezing conditions bring, children are also deprived of the ability to learn or stay connected with friends and family, putting both their physical and their mental health at desperate risk. An estimated 1.5 million children are at risk of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorders and other mental conditions this winter, the agency said. The harsh winter, combined with the war’s impact on families’ livelihoods and incomes as well as the energy and socioeconomic crisis triggered by the war, will be particularly hard for the 6.5 million people, including 1.2 million children, who are currently displaced within Ukraine, it said. Russell called on Unicef and humanitarian colleagues to be given “rapid and unimpeded” access to children and families in need of humanitarian assistance no matter where they are. She added: The rules of war are clear – children and the essential civilian infrastructure they rely on to survive must be protected. Ukraine’s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has hit back at the Kremlin’s comments that Kyiv must take into account the new territorial “realities” that include Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov yesterday rejected President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s three-step proposal for peace in which Russia would begin to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine this Christmas. Peskov insisted Ukraine needed to accept new territorial “realities”, including that the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk provinces of Ukraine were Russia’s “new subjects”. Most UN member countries have condemned Moscow’s annexation of the Ukrainian regions as illegal. In response, Podolyak said it was Peskov and President Vladimir Putin to accept the “new reality” that “there are no stolen Ukrainian territories within the [Russian Federation] ‘forever’”. The head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Andriy Yermak, said Ukraine had secured the release of 64 Ukrainian members of the military as well as a US citizen in its latest prisoner swap with Russian forces. The American was 35-year-old Suedi Murekezi. Yermak said: Sixty-four soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who fought in Donetsk and Lugansk - in particular participated in the defence of the city of Bakhmut - are going home. Murekezi had been “helping our people” before ending up in Russian custody, he added. Russian forces firing multiple rocket launchers hit the regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to a senior Ukrainian official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said two floors of the building on the central square of the recently liberated city had been damaged, but that no one was reported hurt. Russia has been shelling Kherson city from the opposite side of the Dnieper River since leaving the city and withdrawing from the western bank of the river. An unconfirmed video circulating on social media showed a huge plume of smoke pouring up from the top of the administration building. The jailed Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, said he was transferred to a solitary punishment cell for 12 days for having used the word “fuck” in a conversation with a cellmate. In a series of tweets, Navalny said he was released from the punishment cell on Monday only to be locked up again a day later. It is the ninth occasion he has been transferred to solitary confinement, also called a “punishment cell”, since he was relocated to a penal colony more than 250km (150 miles) east of Moscow six months ago, he said. Navalny, the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin, is serving prison terms totalling 11 and a half years on a range of charges, including for fraud, all of which he rejects as trumped-up charges. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia has not received any proposals about a “Christmas ceasefire” in Ukraine, adding that the topic was “not on the agenda”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, earlier this week called on G7 leaders to back a peace solution that would start with Russia withdrawing troops from Ukraine, beginning this Christmas. Asked whether Moscow had seen any proposals for a ceasefire at Christmas, Peskov told reporters: No, no such offers have been received from anybody. This topic is not on the agenda. Peskov insisted at yesterday’s briefing that Kyiv needed to accept new territorial “realities” that included Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions as its “new subjects” – annexations that most UN countries have condemned as illegal. There could be “no question” of Russia starting to pull out its troops by the end of the year, he added on Tuesday. He also spoke about reports that the US is finalising plans to send the Patriot missile defence system to Ukraine. Peskov said Patriots would “definitely” be a target for Russia, but that he would not comment on unconfirmed media reports. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is almost 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top news stories so far: Russian drone strikes have damaged five buildings in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv – though air defences thwarted many more, authorities said. No casualties have been reported, according to the Associated Press. The attacks underline how Ukraine’s biggest city remains vulnerable to the regular Russian attacks which have devastated infrastructure and other population centres, mostly in the country’s east and south in recent weeks. Ukraine says it shot down all the Iranian-supplied drones launched early Wednesday morning at Kyiv and the surrounding region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Telegram, which thanked Ukraine’s air defence forces for shooting down 13 out of the 13 attack drones. One unofficial Telegram channel has posted a picture of what appears to be a piece of a downed drone with the words “For Ryazan!!!” written on it in Russian. On 5 December, a Russian military airbase in the city of Ryazan in western Russia was attacked. A Russian Tu-95 bomber plane, which has been used to attack Ukraine, was damaged and three soldiers at the base were fatally wounded, according to Russia’s ministry of defence. Russian drone strikes on Kyiv and the region around the Ukrainian capital, on Wednesday, did not damage any energy facilities, national power grid operator Ukrenergo said. Since October, Russia has been targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with big waves of missile and drone strikes. The United States is finalising plans to send its sophisticated Patriot air defence system to Ukraine in a potentially pivotal move. Washington could announce a decision as soon as Thursday on providing the Patriot, two officials told Reuters, on Tuesday. The Patriot is considered one of the most advanced US air defence systems and is usually in short supply, with allies around the world vying for it. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had not received any proposals about a “Christmas ceasefire” in Ukraine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called earlier this week on Russia to start withdrawing its troops from his country by Christmas as the first step towards a peace deal in the conflict, which has been raging for almost 10 months. Zelenskiy delivered an address to New Zealand’s parliament on Wednesday, becoming the second foreign leader to do so. Zelenskiy began by thanking New Zealand and its government for the opportunity to speak. The European Union is united in its support for Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the German parliament, adding, with apparent reference to Hungary, that attempts to undermine the bloc’s values by blocking foreign policy measures would fail. “Anyone who thinks he can undermine the values of the EU, to which every member state has committed itself, by blocking its foreign and security policies, will fail,” he told legislators on Wednesday. Holcim, the world’s largest cement maker, said on Wednesday it would exit the country, adding that the business there would then operate independently under a different brand. Holcim sold its Russian unit to the local management team, it added. Pope Francis urged people to spend less on Christmas celebrations and gifts this year and send the difference to Ukrainians to help them get through the hunger and cold of winter. The pope, who has been making appeals for Ukraine at nearly every public event since Russia invaded its neighbour in February, made the unscripted plea at the end of his weekly general audience. A suspected officer with Russia’s Federal Security Service was among seven people accused by US federal prosecutors of helping Russia illegally obtain sensitive electronic components from US companies. Prosecutors claimed the seven worked with two Moscow-based companies controlled by Russian intelligence services to acquire electronic components in the US that have civilian uses, but can also be used to help make nuclear and hypersonic weapons and in quantum computing. The United States, one of the architects of the G7’s price cap on Russian oil, is so far happy with the way the mechanism is functioning, Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s energy envoy said on Tuesday. Generators are as important as armour in helping Ukraine survive Vladimir Putin’s energy terrorism this winter, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Ukraine needed an additional €800m (£686m) to survive the winter and €1.5bn to restore the long-term damage to the energy grid, its president told an emergency conference in Paris that convened to coordinate infrastructure and humanitarian aid over the next four months. More than €1bn was raised to support Ukraine this winter at the aid conference in Paris, France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said. The money, pledged by 46 countries and 24 international organisations, would be split between restoring Ukraine’s depleted energy network, the food sector, water supply, health and transportation. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the moment. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday it was in the interest of Germany and Europe for the remaining Balkan states to become EU member states, and welcomed the decision to grant Bosnia candidate status. “It is in our German and our European interest for the rest of the Balkans to become part of the European Union,” Scholz told MPs in an address at the Bundestag in Berlin. Diplomats in Brussels on Tuesday agreed to accept Bosnia as a candidate for membership, a decision expected to be endorsed by EU heads of government at Thursday’s summit in Brussels. In the queue for membership Bosnia joins four other western Balkan countries – Montenegro, Serbia, the Republic of North Macedonia and Albania – as well as Turkey, Moldova and Ukraine. Supporters of the European Union’s eastward expansion argue that the bloc’s engagement with the western Balkans is vital for protecting European security in the face of Russian aggression. Moldova’s and Ukraine’s candidacy were confirmed in June, shortly after Russia’s invasion of the latter, though the process of joining can take decades. Croatia is currently the only western Balkan state that has secured EU membership. The Kremlin said, on Wednesday, it had not received any proposals about a “Christmas ceasefire” in Ukraine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called earlier this week on Russia to start withdrawing its troops from his country by Christmas as the first step towards a peace deal in the conflict, which has been raging for almost 10 months. Pope Francis urged people to spend less on Christmas celebrations and gifts this year and send the difference to Ukrainians to help them get through the hunger and cold of winter. The pope, who has been making appeals for Ukraine at nearly every public event since Russia invaded its neighbour in February, made the unscripted plea at the end of his weekly general audience. “Brothers and sisters, I tell you, there is so much suffering in Ukraine, so much, so much,” he said, adding that he wanted to draw attention to the particular problems Ukrainians will bear in the coming months. “It is beautiful to celebrate Christmas, but let us lower the level of Christmas spending. Let’s have a more humble Christmas, with more humble gifts, and send what we save to the Ukrainian people, who need it,” he said, prompting several rounds of applause in the audience hall. “They are suffering so much, they are going hungry, they feel the cold and many are dying because there are not enough doctors and nurses available,” he said. He spoke as millions of civilians enduring Europe’s biggest conflict since the second world war have had to contend with cuts to power, heat and water caused by Russian attacks on infrastructure as sub-zero temperatures take hold. “Let’s not forget. Christmas, yes. In peace with the Lord, yes. But with Ukrainians in our hearts. Let’s make this concrete gesture for them,” he said. Russian drone strikes on Kyiv and the region around the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday did not damage any energy facilities, national power grid operator Ukrenergo said. Since October, Russia has been targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with big waves of missile and drone strikes. “Thanks to the brilliant work of the air defence forces, the energy infrastructure facilities were not damaged (on Wednesday) – all 13 drones were shot down,” Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app. The European Union is united in its support for Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the German parliament, adding, with apparent reference to Hungary, that attempts to undermine the bloc’s values by blocking foreign policy measures would fail. “Anyone who thinks he can undermine the values of the EU, to which every member state has committed itself, by blocking its foreign and security policies, will fail,” he told legislators on Wednesday. Budapest earlier this week dropped its objections to an EU loan to Kyiv after the partial unfreezing of financial support for Hungary, Reuters reported. The EU had blocked the funds over rule of law concerns. Support for Ukraine, including sanctions against Russia, would be maintained and intensified for as long as President Vladimir Putin keeps up his war against Kyiv, Scholz added. “Nobody is suffering as much from Russia’s war as the Ukrainians - and we stand firmly by their side,” he said. Russian drone strikes have damaged five buildings in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv – though air defences thwarted many more, authorities said. No casualties have been reported, according to the Associated Press. The attacks underline how Ukraine’s biggest city remains vulnerable to the regular Russian attacks which have devastated infrastructure and other population centres, mostly in the country’s east and south in recent weeks. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a brief video statement, said the “terrorists” fired 13 Iranian-made drones and all were intercepted. Such drones have been part of Russia’s firepower along with mortar, artillery and rocket strikes across Ukraine in recent weeks. The head of the Kyiv city administration, Serhii Popko, wrote on Telegram that the strikes came in two waves, and shrapnel from the intercepted drones damaged one administrative building, while four residential buildings sustained minor damage. Ukraine says it shot down all the Iranian-supplied drones launched early Wednesday morning at Kyiv and the surrounding region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Telegram where thanked Ukraine’s air defence forces for shooting down 13 out of the 13 attack drones. “This morning the terrorists launched 13 Shahed [drones]… all 13 were shot down by our air defence forces. Well done guys. I’m proud!” he said, adding: “Don’t ignore the air raid alerts.” In recent weeks, Ukraine has been increasingly successful at catching Russian air attacks on its energy infrastructure. During the last major attack on 5 December – which was aimed at targets across Ukraine as well as Kyiv – it said it shot down 60 out of 70 rockets fired by Russia. Rescuers and police experts examine the remains of a drone after a strike on an administrative building in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. One unofficial Telegram channel has posted a picture of what appears to be a piece of a downed drone with the words “For Ryazan!!!” written on it in Russian. On 5 December, a Russian military airbase in the city of Ryazan in western Russia was attacked. A Russian Tu-95 bomber plane, which has been used to attack Ukraine, was damaged and three soldiers at the base were fatally wounded, according to Russia’s ministry of defence. Russia said the attack was carried out by a drone. Ukraine did not take responsibility for the attack but Ukraine’s air defence forces posted pictures of the aftermath with the caption. “Ryazan. Rest in Peace.” Svitlana Vodolaga, a spokesperson for Kyiv’s rescue services, told Ukraine’s Hromadske on Wednesday morning that one of the drones had “For Ryazan” written on it. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered an address to New Zealand’s parliament on Wednesday, becoming the second foreign leader to do so. Zelenskiy began by thanking New Zealand and its government for the opportunity to speak. “This year has shown the whole world how much can be done, with enough determination and knowledge of what needs to be done.” The president called on New Zealand to push for peace and to unite around the 10-point plan he had laid out at the G19 summit. He urged New Zealand in particular to contribute to the eighth point – protection of the environment. Zelenskiy said the environmental harm from Russia’s war would affect millions of people for years. Russian attacks have contaminated the country’s oceans and 7.4 million acres of forest, he said. “There’s no true peace where ecocide has taken place and its consequences have not been neutralised.” After the address, the government pledged a further NZ$3m of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, as well as fresh sanctions on Iranian individuals and an entity involved in the manufacture and supply of drones to Russia. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern thanked the Ukrainian leader for taking the time to speak to New Zealand, when he was leading his people through a crisis and said she hoped the Pacific nation had made its support for Ukraine clear. “Our support for Ukraine was not determined by geography, it was not determined by history or by diplomatic ties or relationships – our judgment was a simple one: we asked ourselves the question ‘what if it was us?’.” Zelenskiy has previously spoken to other parliaments including in the UK, US, European Union, and Australia. The only other leader of a foreign government to address New Zealand’s parliament was Australia’s Julia Gillard in 2011. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for this morning. My colleague Tom Ambrose will take you through the rest of the day’s developments from Ukraine. Kyiv’s city administration has said on Telegram that the number of drones shot down this morning has risen to 13. In news from Russia, Holcim, the world’s largest cement maker, said on Wednesday it would exit the country, adding that the business there would then operate independently under a different brand. Holcim sold its Russian unit to the local management team, it added. The sale will have no significant impact on the company as the unit generated less than 1% of the group’s net sales in 2021, it further said. The group first de-consolidated its Russian unit and announced it would leave the country in March, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company initially kept its operations running, saying it was supplying essential building materials. “Holcim’s board of directors expresses its heartfelt concern about the tragic human suffering in the region” the firm said in a statement on Wednesday. Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has recounted her experience of the blasts, saying in a post on Twitter, “Kyiv startled awake by explosions early this morning. I sat in the windowless hallway repeating verbs of motion slowly. I hated learning them at the time. Who knew what a useful decompression exercise they could be.” There were no victims from the drone debris that damaged two city administrative buildings, the spokesperson for Kyiv’s rescue services, Svitlana Vodolaga, has told Ukraine’s Suspline news. The Kyiv city administration says another drone has been shot down, bringing the total number of Shahed drones downed in this morning’s attacks to 11. In a post on Telegram, the administration said that air alerts were still in place. Two Kyiv city administrative buildings in the central Shevchenkivskyi district have been damaged by “debris from a drone”, Kyiv’s city administration has said in a post on Telegram. News organisation Nexta has posted this video taken near where the damage occurred. It has not been independently verified by the Guardian. News organisation Euromaidan has posted this video with sound from one of this morning’s blasts: The Guardian has not been able to verify the footage independently. The head of Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said that Russia was continuing its “energy terror” against Ukraine after Russian drones attacked the capital. He said that most of Wednesday morning’s drones had been shot down by Ukraine’s air defence forces. Kuleba warned that the air raid alert had not come to an end and advised residents to take safety precautions. “The danger remains. Stay in shelters,” Kuleba wrote on Telegram. “Russia continues the energy terror of the country. But we are getting stronger every day.” Vitaliy Bunechko, the head of Zhytomyr region, which is next to Kyiv, has warned on Telegram that there may be a second wave of drone attacks, following this morning’s attacks on Kyiv. Bunechko advised people to remain in bomb shelters. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko has posted on Telegram saying that ten Shahed drones were shot down in the Kyiv region this morning. Iran supplied the drones to Russia, which has been using them to target infrastructure and civilian targets in Ukraine. The United States is finalising plans to send its sophisticated Patriot air defence system to Ukraine in a potentially pivotal move Washington could announce a decision as soon as Thursday on providing the Patriot, two officials told Reuters on Tuesday. The Patriot is considered one of the most advanced US air defence systems and is usually in short supply, with allies around the world vying for it. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has warned NATO against equipping Kyiv with Patriot missile defences, and it is likely the Kremlin will view the move as an escalation. With the war in its tenth month, the Patriot system would help Ukraine defend against waves of Russian missile and drone attacks that have pounded the country’s energy infrastructure. Millions of civilians who are enduring Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two have had to contend with cuts to electricity, heat and water as harsh winter conditions take hold. Gaining Patriot air defence capability would be “very, very significant” for the Kyiv government, said Alexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and onetime leader of Ukraine policy at the White House. “These are going to be quite capable of dealing with a lot of different challenges the Ukrainians have, especially if the Russians bring in short-range ballistic missiles” from Iran. The Pentagon declined comment. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian officials. It is currently 7.10am in Kyiv. Isobel Koshiw, one of the Guardian’s correspondents in Ukraine, is in Kyiv, where she says that, “The air raid sirens sounded at 05.57 but the first explosion – which could have been anti-aircraft – was reported to one Ukrainian Telegram channel at 0608. So 11 mins. Recently there’s been at least a 30 min gap between a warning and an explosion.” She posted this video taken in central Kyiv, on which one of the blasts can be heard: Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko says that three blasts were heard in Kyiv this morning: Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko says that blasts hit the Kyiv’s central Shevchenkivskyi district early on Wednesday. “Emergency services dispatched,” Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. “Details later.” Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of the Kyiv region, said that air defence systems were at work. The UK’s ambassador said she was “Staying away from windows and hearing explosions outside.” Emergency services’ maps showed the capital and the region surrounding it had been under air raid siren alerts for about 20 minutes before the blasts. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news for the next few hours. Breaking: On Wednesday morning, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that strikes had hit Kyiv’s city centre and emergency services were being dispatched. Explosions were heard in the early hours of Wednesday in the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv, two Reuters witnesses said. The emergency services’ maps showed the capital and the region surrounding it have been under air raid siren alerts for about 20 minutes before the blasts. Meanwhile the United States is finalising plans to send its sophisticated Patriot air defence system to Ukraine in a potentially pivotal move while allies pledged just over €‎1bn ($1.05bn) to help Ukrainians survive the freezing winter. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime here are the other key recent developments: A suspected officer with Russia’s Federal Security Service was among seven people accused by US federal prosecutors of helping Russia illegally obtain sensitive electronic components from US companies. Prosecutors claimed the seven worked with two Moscow-based companies controlled by Russian intelligence services to acquire electronic components in the US that have civilian uses, but can also be used to help make nuclear and hypersonic weapons and in quantum computing. The United States, one of the architects of the G7’s price cap on Russian oil, is so far happy with the way the mechanism is functioning, Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s energy envoy said on Tuesday.

More than €1bn was raised to support Ukraine this winter at the aid conference in Paris, France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said. The money, pledged by 46 countries and 24 international organisations, would be split between restoring Ukraine’s depleted energy network, the food sector, water supply, health and transportation. Ukrainian forces have reportedly damaged a key bridge outside the southern city of Melitopol, a key objective for Kyiv in the region. Video posted online showed that two supports of the bridge had been damaged during the attack, just days after Ukraine hit a Russian barracks situated in a resort in the city, with Himars rockets causing substantial damage and casualties. Ukrainian officials gave the all clear on Tuesday after air raid sirens blared across the country following warnings that Russia may carry out a new wave of missile strikes. Ukrainian media said the alerts may have been triggered by MiG fighter jets that took off from Ryazan, near Russia’s border with Ukraine, and flew towards Belarus. Russia and Ukraine pounded each other’s forces in heavy fighting in the eastern region of Donetsk on Tuesday. Moscow is battling to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, two of four territories the Kremlin claims to have annexed in votes rejected by most countries as illegal. Ukraine must take into account the new territorial “realities” that include Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin has said. Ukraine’s president said on Monday that Russia could begin to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine to show they are capable of abandoning their aggression. In response, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there could be “no question” of Moscow beginning to pull out its troops by the end of the year. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, will hold talks to discuss the events of 2022 in late December, the Russian business daily Vedomosti reported. Dmitry Peskov told the newspaper that the date and the agenda of the meeting are already known, but an official announcement will come later. The talks will unlikely be face-to-face, the paper said. The Belarusian ministry of defence has announced a “sudden combat readiness check” of its troops. The exercises are mostly taking place in the north-west of the country, not close to Ukraine’s border. This is one in a string of announcements by Belarus since mid-October which Kyiv say is designed to stoke fear in Ukrainians. Germany will approve another €50m in winter aid for Kyiv following Russia’s missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said. She said Berlin was working to deliver generators, blankets and heating fuel to Ukraine over Christmas. The UK Foreign Office announced it was imposing sanctions on 12 Russian commanders for their role in attacks on Ukrainian cities. They include Maj Gen Robert Baranov, identified by Bellingcat as the commander of programming and targeting Russian cruise missiles, as well as four Iranians, including the co-owner and managing director of MADO, an Iranian drone engine manufacturer. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday that there was an agreement on removing heavy weapons from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Talks were under way, he said, adding: “We managed to protect Chornobyl and our goal is to protect Zaporizhzhia. The coming weeks will be crucial.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/mar/30/vulkan-files-leak-reveals-putins-global-and-domestic-cyberwarfare-tactics","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"‘Vulkan files’ leak reveals Putin’s global and domestic cyberwarfare tactics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/30/vulkan-files-leak-reveals-putins-global-and-domestic-cyberwarfare-tactics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/mar/30/vulkan-files-leak-reveals-putins-global-and-domestic-cyberwarfare-tactics","fields":{"headline":"‘Vulkan files’ leak reveals Putin’s global and domestic cyberwarfare tactics","bodyText":"The inconspicuous office is in Moscow’s north-eastern suburbs. A sign reads: “Business centre”. Nearby are modern residential blocks and a rambling old cemetery, home to ivy-covered war memorials. The area is where Peter the Great once trained his mighty army. Inside the six-storey building, a new generation is helping Russian military operations. Its weapons are more advanced than those of Peter the Great’s era: not pikes and halberds, but hacking and disinformation tools. The software engineers behind these systems are employees of NTC Vulkan. On the surface, it looks like a run-of-the-mill cybersecurity consultancy. However, a leak of secret files from the company has exposed its work bolstering Vladimir Putin’s cyberwarfare capabilities. Thousands of pages of secret documents reveal how Vulkan’s engineers have worked for Russian military and intelligence agencies to support hacking operations, train operatives before attacks on national infrastructure, spread disinformation and control sections of the internet. The company’s work is linked to the federal security service or FSB, the domestic spy agency; the operational and intelligence divisions of the armed forces, known as the GOU and GRU; and the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence organisation. One document links a Vulkan cyber-attack tool with the notorious hacking group Sandworm, which the US government said twice caused blackouts in Ukraine, disrupted the Olympics in South Korea and launched NotPetya, the most economically destructive malware in history. Codenamed Scan-V, it scours the internet for vulnerabilities, which are then stored for use in future cyber-attacks. Another system, known as Amezit, amounts to a blueprint for surveilling and controlling the internet in regions under Russia’s command, and also enables disinformation via fake social media profiles. A third Vulkan-built system – Crystal-2V – is a training program for cyber-operatives in the methods required to bring down rail, air and sea infrastructure. A file explaining the software states: “The level of secrecy of processed and stored information in the product is ‘Top Secret’.” The Vulkan files, which date from 2016 to 2021, were leaked by an anonymous whistleblower angered by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Such leaks from Moscow are extremely rare. Days after the invasion in February last year, the source approached the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and said the GRU and FSB “hide behind” Vulkan. “People should know the dangers of this,” the whistleblower said. “Because of the events in Ukraine, I decided to make this information public. The company is doing bad things and the Russian government is cowardly and wrong. I am angry about the invasion of Ukraine and the terrible things that are happening there. I hope you can use this information to show what is happening behind closed doors.” The source later shared the data and further information with the Munich-based investigative startup Paper Trail Media. For several months, journalists working for 11 media outlets, including the Guardian, Washington Post and Le Monde, have investigated the files in a consortium led by Paper Trail Media and Der Spiegel. Five western intelligence agencies confirmed the Vulkan files appear to be authentic. The company and the Kremlin did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The leak contains emails, internal documents, project plans, budgets and contracts. They offer insight into the Kremlin’s sweeping efforts in the cyber-realm, at a time when it is pursuing a brutal war against Ukraine. It is not known whether the tools built by Vulkan have been used for real-world attacks, in Ukraine or elsewhere. But Russian hackers are known to have repeatedly targeted Ukrainian computer networks; a campaign that continues. Since last year’s invasion, Moscow’s missiles have hit Kyiv and other cities, destroying critical infrastructure and leaving the country in the dark. Analysts say Russia is also engaged in a continual conflict with what it perceives as its enemy, the west, including the US, UK, EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which have developed their own classified cyber-offensive capabilities in a digital arms race. Some documents in the leak contain what appear to be illustrative examples of potential targets. One contains a map showing dots across the US. Another contains the details of a nuclear power station in Switzerland. One document shows engineers recommending Russia add to its own capabilities by using hacking tools stolen in 2016 from the US National Security Agency and posted online. John Hultquist, the vice-president of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which reviewed selections of the material at the request of the consortium, said: “These documents suggest that Russia sees attacks on civilian critical infrastructure and social media manipulation as one and the same mission, which is essentially an attack on the enemy’s will to fight.” What is Vulkan? Vulkan’s chief executive, Anton Markov, is a man of middle years, with cropped hair and dark bags around the eyes. Markov founded Vulkan (meaning volcano in English) in 2010, with Alexander Irzhavsky. Both are graduates of St Petersburg’s military academy and have served with the army in the past, rising to captain and major respectively. “They had good contacts in that direction,” one former employee said. The company is part of Russia’s military-industrial complex. This subterranean world encompasses spy agencies, commercial firms and higher education institutions. Specialists such as programmers and engineers move from one branch to another; secret state actors rely heavily on private sector expertise. Vulkan launched at a time when Russia was rapidly expanding its cyber-capabilities. Traditionally, the FSB took the lead in cyber affairs. In 2012 Putin appointed the ambitious and energetic Sergei Shoigu as defence minister. Shoigu – who is in charge of Russia’s war in Ukraine – wanted his own cyber-troops, reporting directly to him. From 2011 Vulkan received special government licences to work on classified military projects and state secrets. It is a mid-sized tech company, with more than 120 staff – about 60 of whom are software developers. It is not known how many private contractors are granted access to such sensitive projects in Russia, but some estimates suggest it is no more than about a dozen. Vulkan’s corporate culture is more Silicon Valley than spy agency. It has a staff football team, and motivational emails with fitness tips and celebrations of employee birthdays. There is even an upbeat slogan: “Make the world a better place” appears in a glossy promotional video. Vulkan says it specialises in “information security”; officially, its customers are big Russian state companies. They include Sberbank, the country’s largest bank; the national airline Aeroflot; and Russian railways. “The work was fun. We used the latest technologies,” said one former employee who eventually left after they grew disillusioned with the job.“The people were really clever. And the money was good, well above the usual rate.” As well as technical expertise, those generous salaries bought the expectation of discretion. Some staff are graduates of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which has a long history of feeding recruits to the defence ministry. Workflows are organised on principles of strict operational secrecy, with staff never being told what other departments are working on. The firm’s ethos is patriotic, the leak suggests. On New Year’s Eve in 2019 an employee created a lighthearted Microsoft Excel file with Soviet military music and a picture of a bear. Alongside it were the words: “APT Magma Bear”. The reference is to Russian state hacking groups such as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, and appears to point to Vulkan’s own shadowy activities. Five months later, Markov reminded his workers of Victory Day, a 9 May holiday celebrating the Red Army’s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. “This is a significant event in the history of our country,” he told staff. “I grew up on films about the war and had the good fortune to communicate with veterans and to listen to their stories. These people died for us, so we can live in Russia.” One of Vulkan’s most far-reaching projects was carried out with the blessing of the Kremlin’s most infamous unit of cyberwarriors, known as Sandworm. According to US prosecutors and western governments, over the past decade Sandworm has been responsible for hacking operations on an astonishing scale. It has carried out numerous malign acts: political manipulation, cyber-sabotage, election interference, dumping of emails and leaking. Sandworm disabled Ukraine’s power grid in 2015. The following year it took part in Russia’s brazen operation to derail the US presidential election. Two of its operatives were indicted for distributing emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s Democrats using a fake persona, Guccifer 2.0. Then in 2017 Sandworm purloined further data in an attempt to influence the outcome of the French presidential vote, the US says. That same year the unit unleashed the most consequential cyber-attack in history. Operatives used a bespoke piece of malware called NotPetya. Beginning in Ukraine, NotPetya rapidly spread across the globe. It knocked offline shipping firms, hospitals, postal systems and pharmaceutical manufacturers – a digital onslaught that spilled over from the virtual into the physical world. The Vulkan files shed light on a piece of digital machinery that could play a part in the next attack unleashed by Sandworm. A system ‘built for offensive purposes’ A special unit within the GRU’s “main centre for special technologies”, Sandworm is known internally by its field number 74455. This code appears in the Vulkan files as an “approval party” on a technical document. It describes a “data exchange protocol” between an apparently pre-existing military-run database containing intelligence about software and hardware weaknesses, and a new system that Vulkan had been commissioned to help build: Scan-V. Hacking groups such as Sandworm penetrate computer systems by first looking for weak spots. Scan-V supports that process, conducting automated reconnaissance of potential targets around the world in a hunt for potentially vulnerable servers and network devices. The intelligence is then stored in a data repository, giving hackers an automated means of identifying targets. Gabby Roncone, another expert with the cybersecurity company Mandiant, gave the analogy of scenes from old military movies where people place “their artillery and troops on the map. They want to understand where the enemy tanks are and where they need to strike first to break through the enemy lines,” she said. The Scan project was commissioned in May 2018 by the Institute of Engineering Physics, a research facility in the Moscow region closely associated with the GRU. All details were classified. It is not clear whether Sandworm was an intended user of the system, but in May 2020 a team from Vulkan visited a military facility in Khimki, the same city on the outskirts of Moscow where the hacking unit is based, to test the Scan system. “Scan is definitely built for offensive purposes. It fits comfortably into the organisational structure and the strategic approach of the GRU,” one analyst said after reviewing the documents. “You don’t find network diagrams and design documents like this very often. It really is very intricate stuff.” The leaked files contain no information about Russian malicious code, or malware, used for hacking operations. But an analyst with Google said that in 2012 the tech firm linked Vulkan to an operation involving a malware known as MiniDuke. The SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, used MiniDuke in phishing campaigns. The leak shows that an undercover part of the SVR, military unit 33949, contracted Vulkan to work on multiple projects. The company codenamed its client “sanatorium” and “dispensary”. Internet control, surveillance and disinformation In 2018, a team of Vulkan employees travelled south to attend the official testing of a sweeping program enabling internet control, surveillance and disinformation. The meeting took place at the FSB-linked Rostov-on-Don Radio Research Institute. It subcontracted Vulkan to help in the creation of the new system, dubbed Amezit, which was also linked in the files to the Russian military. “A lot of people worked on Amezit. Money and time was invested,” a former employee recalled. “Other companies were involved as well, possibly because the project was so big and important.” Vulkan played a central role. It won an initial contract to build the Amezit system in 2016 but documents suggest parts of Amezit were still being improved by Vulkan engineers well into 2021, with plans for further development in 2022. One part of Amezit is domestic-facing, allowing operatives to hijack and take control of the internet if unrest breaks out in a Russian region, or the country gains a stronghold over territory in a rival nation state, such as Ukraine. Internet traffic deemed to be politically harmful can be removed before it has a chance to spread. A 387-page internal document explains how Amezit works. The military needs physical access to hardware, such as mobile phone towers, and to wireless communications. Once they control transmission, traffic can be intercepted. Military spies can identify people browsing the web, see what they are accessing online, and track information that users are sharing. Since last year’s invasion, Russia has arrested anti-war protesters and passed punitive laws to prevent public criticism of what Putin calls a “special military operation”. The Vulkan files contain documents linked to an FSB operation to monitor social media usage inside Russia on a gigantic scale, using semantic analysis to spot “hostile” content. According to a source familiar with Vulkan’s work, the firm developed a bulk collection program for the FSB called Fraction. It combs sites such as Facebook or Odnoklassniki – the Russian equivalent – looking for key words. The aim is to identify potential opposition figures from open source data. Vulkan staff regularly visited the FSB’s information security centre in Moscow, the agency’s cyber-unit, to consult on the secret program. The building is next to the FSB’s Lubyanka headquarters and a bookshop; the leak reveals the unit’s spies were jokingly nicknamed “book-lovers”. The development of these secret programs speaks to the paranoia at the heart of Russia’s leadership. It is terrified of street protests and revolution of the kind seen in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Moscow regards the internet as a crucial weapon in maintaining order. At home, Putin has eliminated his opponents. Dissidents have been locked up; critics such as Alexei Navalny poisoned and jailed. It is an open question as to whether Amezit systems have been used in occupied Ukraine. In 2014 Russia covertly swallowed the eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Since last year, it has taken further territory and shut down Ukrainian internet and mobile services in areas it controls. Ukrainian citizens have been forced to connect via Crimea-based telecoms providers, with sim cards handed out in “filtration” camps run by the FSB. However, reporters were able to track down real-world activity carried out by fake social media accounts linked to Vulkan as part of a sub-system of Amezit, codenamed PRR. Tools for automated domestic propaganda The Kremlin was already known to have made use of its disinformation factory, the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, which has been put on the US sanctions list. The billionaire Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin’s close ally, is behind the mass manipulation operation. The Vulkan files show how the Russian military hired a private contractor to build similar tools for automated domestic propaganda. This Amezit sub-system allows the Russian military to carry out large-scale covert disinformation operations on social media and across the internet, through the creation of accounts that resemble real people online, or avatars. The avatars have names and stolen personal photos, which are then cultivated over months to curate a realistic digital footprint. The leak contains screenshots of fake Twitter accounts and hashtags used by the Russian military from 2014 until earlier this year. They spread disinformation, including a conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton and a denial that Russia’s bombing of Syria killed civilians. Following the invasion of Ukraine, one Vulkan-linked fake Twitter account posted: “Excellent leader #Putin”. Another Vulkan-developed project linked to Amezit is far more threatening. Codenamed Crystal-2V, it is a training platform for Russian cyber-operatives. Capable of allowing simultaneous use by up to 30 trainees, it appears to simulate attacks against a range of essential national infrastructure targets: railway lines, electricity stations, airports, waterways, ports and industrial control systems. An ongoing security risk? The intrusive and destructive nature of the tools that Vulkan has been hired to build raise difficult questions for software developers who have worked on these projects. Can they be described as cyber-mercenaries? Or Russian spies? Some almost certainly are. Others are perhaps mere cogs in a wider machine, performing important engineering tasks for their country’s cyber-military complex. Until Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Vulkan staff openly travelled to western Europe, visiting IT and cybersecurity conferences, including a gathering in Sweden, to mingle with delegates from western security firms. Former Vulkan graduates now live in Germany, Ireland and other EU countries. Some work for global tech corporations. Two are at Amazon Web Services and Siemens. Siemens declined to comment on individual employees but said it took such questions “very seriously”. Amazon said it implemented “strict controls” and that protecting customer data was its “top priority”. It is unclear if former Vulkan engineers now in the west pose a security risk, and whether they have come to the attention of western counter-intelligence agencies. Most, it would seem, have relatives back in Russia, a vulnerability known to have been used by the FSB to pressure Russian professionals abroad to collaborate. Contacted by a reporter, one ex-staffer expressed regret at having helped Russia’s military and domestic spy agency. “To begin with it wasn’t clear what my work would be used for,” they said. “Over time I understood that I couldn’t carry on, and that I didn’t want to support the regime. I was afraid something would happen to me, or I would end up in jail.” There were enormous risks, too, for the anonymous whistleblower behind the Vulkan files. The Russian regime is known for hunting down those it regards as traitors. In their brief exchange with a German journalist, the leaker said they were aware that giving sensitive information to foreign media was dangerous. But they had taken life-changing precautions. They had left their previous life behind, they said, and now existed “as a ghost”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/mar/15/trevor-noah-anti-war-message-russian-tv-bravest-thing-ive-ever-seen","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-15T15:41:07Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah on anti-war message on Russian TV: ‘One of the bravest things I’ve ever seen’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/15/trevor-noah-anti-war-message-russian-tv-bravest-thing-ive-ever-seen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/mar/15/trevor-noah-anti-war-message-russian-tv-bravest-thing-ive-ever-seen","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah on anti-war message on Russian TV: ‘One of the bravest things I’ve ever seen’","bodyText":"Trevor Noah “Seemingly every day, Russia becomes more and more isolated from the rest of the world,” said Trevor Noah on Monday’s episode of the Daily Show. “They can’t fly anywhere, they can’t order anything off of Amazon, they can’t even use Airbnb, which means now they need to film themselves going to the bathroom. “And every day, the Russian people become more cut off from the truth about the war,” he continued. The Kremlin has shut down independent media, yet one person managed to slip an anti-war message on to state television: during a Monday evening broadcast, Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, burst onto the set of the nightly news, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign which read: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English, “Russians against the war.” Ovsyannikova’s protest, visible for several seconds before the channel switched to a pre-recorded segment, was “one of the bravest things I’ve ever seen”, said Noah. “Although, knowing Russia’s propaganda machine, it’s probably going to find a way to like twist this whole thing. They’ll be like, ‘You saw the sign, there is no war. Everything is normal. All good.’” In another crackdown on free speech, the Kremlin has also taken Facebook, Twitter and Instagram offline. Given 48 hours notice by the government, many Instagram influencers released distraught final videos. “It feels like a big part of my heart and my life is being taken away from me,” said Olga Buzova, a Russian reality TV star, in a tearful video. “If you thought being a Ukrainian refugee was bad,” said Noah, “imagine being forced to pick up your whole life on Instagram and move it over to Cameo. That’s tragic.” Jimmy Kimmel “Trump’s buddy Vladimir Putin is doing whatever he can to prevent Russian citizens from knowing the truth about what he’s up to in Ukraine,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Monday evening, from bans of Instagram and Facebook to rumors spread by the Kremlin that the US trained birds to carry Ukrainian biological weapons in to Russia. “Which, listen, the only deadly bird we’ve developed in this country is this one,” he said over a picture of the Twitter logo. “And we’re primarily using it on ourselves.” In other news, “Yesterday, Tom Brady, the greatest quarterback of all time, woke up, noticed daylight saving time, and thought ‘What should I do with this extra hour of sunlight? I know: I’ll play a 23rd season of football.” Forty-one days after he announced his retirement, the seven-time Super Bowl winner announced that he will play another season of football with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “Tom Brady is like your friend who announces she’s quitting Instagram and then posts something three hours later,” Kimmel noted. “I guess he realized that if he retired there wouldn’t be anyone around to make sure Gronk doesn’t eat a gallon of Tide Pods.” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on day 19 of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and “things are going nyet bueno” for Putin; Russia has gained limited territory and suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment. According to one report, Russians were so confident of a swift victory that instead of bringing extra ammunition or rations into Ukraine, they brought dress uniforms for a victory parade. “Kinda jumped the gun guys,” said Colbert. “That’s like scheduling your first Tinder date at the altar.” According to reports, desperate Russians have taken to breaking into supermarkets and shops, and raiding homes in search of food and valuables as their own supply lines have failed. “Reminder: they’re just 90 miles from their home bases,” said Colbert. “That’s like driving from New York to Philly and turning cannibal at Trenton. “With his invasion going poorly, Putin has only one man to blame: anyone but him,” Colbert added, noting reports that Russian spy chiefs have been placed under house arrest. “That’s right, they’re stuck at home with nothing to do except watch the popular Russian reality show Love is Blindfolded and Thrown into a Van.” Putin has also reportedly fired generals in response to his invasion losses. “Of course he fired them!” Colbert exclaimed. “They allowed Ukrainians to capture their greatest weapon: truck full of onions.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers tore into Donald Trump for reckless comments about leveraging US nuclear power in Ukraine. “I think it goes without saying that this is a very precarious moment in which reckless military escalation could lead to even more catastrophe,” said Meyers. “We need to help the millions of people who are suffering and support diplomatic paths toward an end to the conflict. “The last thing we need right now is, I don’t know, a former president bragging that is he were still in office he would use nuclear weapons,” such as Trump did on Fox News last Thursday. “Biden, every time he gets up he says ‘they are a nuclear nation,’” Trump said. “He should say we are a nuclear nation, and you know, I rebuilt our whole nuclear arsenal stronger, bigger, better than ever before. It’s better and it’s bigger than Russia.” “Everybody knows that we’re a nuclear nation,” Meyers retorted. “Is that one of those things that he just found out and he thinks he’s the only one who knows?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/feb/27/eu-will-provide-weapons-for-ukraine-josep-borrell","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-27T20:16:02Z","webTitle":"It is a matter of life and death.

So the EU will provide weapons for Ukraine’s armed forces ","bodyText":"At this dark hour, when we see Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and massive disinformation campaigns and information manipulation, it is essential to separate lies – invented to justify what cannot be justified – from facts. The facts are that Russia, a major nuclear power, has attacked and invaded a peaceful and democratic neighbouring country, which posed no threat to it, nor provoked it. Moreover, president Putin is threatening reprisals on any other state that may come to the rescue of the people of Ukraine. Such use of force and coercion has no place in the 21st century. What Putin is doing is not only a grave violation of international law, it is a violation of the basic principles of human coexistence. With his choice to bring war back to Europe, we see the return of the “law of the jungle” where might makes right. The target is not only Ukraine, but the security of Europe and the whole international rules-based order, based on the UN system and international law. His aggression is taking innocent lives, crushing people’s wish to live in peace. Civilian targets are being struck, clearly violating international humanitarian law, forcing people to flee. We see a humanitarian catastrophe developing. For months, we pursued unparalleled efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution. But Putin lied to the faces of all who met him, pretending to be interested in a peaceful solution. Instead, he opted for a full-scale invasion, a fully fledged war. Russia must cease its military operations immediately, and unconditionally withdraw from the entire territory of Ukraine. The same goes for Belarus, which has to immediately stop its involvement in this aggression and respect its international obligations. The European Union is united in offering its strong support to Ukraine and its people. This is a matter of life and death. I am preparing an emergency package to support the Ukrainian armed forces in their fight. The international community will now in response opt for a full-scale isolation of Russia, to hold Putin accountable for this aggression. We are sanctioning those who finance the war, crippling the Russian banking system and its access to international reserves. The EU and its partners have already imposed massive sanctions on Russia that target its leaders and elites and strategic sectors of the Kremlin-run economy. The aim is not to harm the Russian people, but to weaken the Kremlin’s ability to finance this unjust war. In doing this, we are closely aligned with our partners and allies – the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea and Australia. We also see many countries from around the world rallying to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, including the United Kingdom. We stand together on the right side of history in the face of Russia’s horrifying attack on a free and sovereign country. To justify its crimes, the Kremlin and its supporters have engaged in a massive disinformation campaign, which started already weeks ago. We have seen Russian state media and their ecosystem peddling untruths in social media networks with the aim of deceiving and manipulating. The Kremlin propagandists call the invasion “a special operation”, but this cynical euphemism cannot hide the fact that we witness a fully fledged invasion of Ukraine, with the aim to crush its freedom, legitimate government and democratic structures. Calling the Kyiv government “neo-Nazi” and “Russophobic” is nonsense: all manifestations of nazism are banned in Ukraine. In modern Ukraine, extreme rightwing candidates are a fringe phenomenon with minimal support, without passing the barrier to enter the parliament. The Ukrainian government did not cut the Donbas off and it has not prohibited the use of Russian language and culture. Donetsk and Luhansk are no republics, they are Ukrainian regions controlled by Russia-backed and armed separatist groupings. We know this – and many Russians know this. There have been courageous protests in cities across Russia since the invasion started, demanding the end of the aggression against a peaceful neighbouring nation. We hear their voices and recognise their courage in speaking out, and we also see many prominent public figures in Russia protesting this senseless invasion. I continue to work with our partners around the world to ensure the joint action of the international community against the Kremlin’s behaviour. On 25 February, only Russia vetoed a UN security council Resolution on Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. From all over the world, countries condemn Russia’s attacks, and at the General Assembly the entire international community needs to join forces and help to end Russia’s military aggression by adopting the related UN resolution. With this war on Ukraine, the world will never be the same again. It is now, more than ever, the time for societies and alliances to come together to build our future on trust, justice and freedom. It is the moment to stand up and to speak out. Might does not make right. Never did. Never will.

Russian forces have seized residential quarters of the key eastern city and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on its outskirts and the nearby towns, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed significant damage in Sievierodonetsk and nearby Rubizhne. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said “nobody is going to surrender Sievierodonetsk”. He said that the regional centre of Luhansk was experiencing the most intense fighting, saying: “Fierce battles are taking place in Sievierodonetsk, our defenders are fighting for every inch of the city.” The Russian ministry of defence claims that “the Ukrainian group in the Donbas suffers significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment”. Russia claims to have shot down two MiG-29 aircraft and a Mi-8 helicopter in the Mykolaiv region, and also 11 unmanned drones in the last 24 hours. The UK Ministry of Defence has said it is unlikely that either side has gained significant ground in the last 24 hours. 800 civilians have taken refuge in a chemical factory in Sievierodonetsk, according to a lawyer for Dmytro Firtash, whose company owns the facility. “These 800 civilians include about 200 out of the plant’s 3,000 employees and approximately 600 inhabitants of the city of Sievierodonetsk,” Lanny Davis, a US lawyer, said in a statement published on the company website. Russian-installed officials in the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region reportedly plan to stage a referendum later this year on joining Russia. A Kremlin-backed official, Vladimir Rogov, was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Tass as saying: “The people will determine the future of the Zaporizhzhia region. The wording of the questions will be presented in the near future. The vast majority of residents of our region want to return to their native harbour as soon as possible and become part of greater Russia.” Ukraine says any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent. Dozens of radiation detectors around Ukraine’s Chornobyl nuclear power plant have started transmitting radiation data for the first time since Russia invaded, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Radiation levels in the area surrounding Chornobyl are now back to normal after detectors came back online today, according to the UN nuclear watchdog. Millions of people could die of hunger unless Russia lifts the blockade on Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea, Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, has warned. Lebanon’s minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bou Habib, told a meeting of Mediterranean ministers that rises in the cost of fuel and basic foodstuffs were exacerbating the crisis in his country. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the onus was on Ukraine to solve the problem of resuming grain shipments. Lavrov said no action was required on the Russian side. “We state daily that we’re ready to guarantee the safety of vessels leaving Ukrainian ports and heading for the Bosphorus gulf. To solve the problem, the only thing needed is for the Ukrainians to let vessels out of their ports, either by de-mining them or by marking out safe corridors.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he “simply cannot see the preconditions for ending the war” in an interview with the Financial Times. Victory meant restoring “all” of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea – annexed by Russia in 2014 – and separatist-held areas, he suggested. “We have to achieve a full de-occupation of our entire territory,” he said. Ukraine is launching a “Book of Executioners”, a system to collate evidence of war crimes Kyiv says were committed during Russia’s occupation, Zelenskiy said yesterday. Ukraine has filed eight more war crimes cases to court in addition to the three sentences already handed down to Russian soldiers, according to its prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Russia has handed over to Kyiv the bodies of 210 Ukrainian fighters, most of whom died defending the city of Mariupol from Russian forces at a vast steel works, the Ukrainian military confirmed. Ukraine and Russia each handed over the bodies of 50 of their deceased soldiers in an exchange that included 37 Ukrainian soldiers killed at Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks, the Ukrainian ministry for reintegration has confirmed. The exchange took place on the front lines in the southeast Ukrainian region of Zaporizhzhia, the ministry said. The Kremlin said any meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine must be “productive and well prepared”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said western sanctions must be lifted in order for Russian grain to be delivered to international markets. More than 1,000 Ukrainian service personnel and foreign mercenaries, who had surrendered in Mariupol, have been transferred to Russia for an investigation there, a law enforcement source told Russian state-owned news agency, Tass. Norway has donated 22 self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, including spare parts, ammunition and other gear, the Norwegian defence ministry said. Laurence Boone, the chief economist at the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has said the world economy was paying a “hefty price” for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She said: “As Russia and Ukraine are large commodity exporters, the war has sent energy and food prices soaring, making life much harder for many people across the world.” Russian proxy fighters in east Ukraine have said they are opening a trial against two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who were captured fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. The two men, who are serving in the Ukrainian military, and Ibrahim Saadun, a captive from Morocco, were shown sitting in a courtroom cage reserved for defendants in a video released on pro-Russian social media channels on Tuesday. The European Union needs to build warehouses and extend railway tracks across the Ukrainian border to help Kyiv in its attempts to move more grain out of the country to those who need it, says the country’s trade representative. Ukraine will not be able to export more than 2m tonnes of grain a month, around a third of prewar levels, as long as its main trade routes through its Black Sea ports remain blockaded by Russia, said Taras Kachka. The World Bank has approved $1.49bn of additional financing for Ukraine to help pay wages for government and social workers, expanding the bank’s total pledged support for Kyiv to more than $4bn. The latest round of funding is supported by financing guarantees from Britain, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Latvia. Russia is ramping up oil exports from its major eastern port of Kozmino as it aims to offset the impact of EU sanctions with the surging demand from Asian buyers. Sources told Reuters that Russia has already increased the amount of crude pumped to Kozmino on its main Asian oil route, the East Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline, by 70,000 barrels a day (bpd). Moscow’s chief rabbi has reportedly fled Russia, after coming under pressure to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Journalist Avital Chizhik-Goldschmidt tweeted late on Tuesday: “Can finally share that my in-laws, Moscow chief rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt and Rebbetzin Dara Goldschmidt, have been put under pressure by authorities to publicly support the ‘special operation’ in Ukraine – and refused.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/03/windfall-taxes-price-caps-and-vat-cuts-how-nations-are-addressing-europes-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-03T16:39:43Z","webTitle":"Windfall taxes and an ‘anti-Putin shield’: how Europe is tackling energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/windfall-taxes-price-caps-and-vat-cuts-how-nations-are-addressing-europes-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/03/windfall-taxes-price-caps-and-vat-cuts-how-nations-are-addressing-europes-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Windfall taxes and an ‘anti-Putin shield’: how Europe is tackling energy crisis","bodyText":"The debate over whether Britain should introduce a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies has been reignited by bumper profits at BP. The one-off levy is among a suite of measures that have been proposed to tackle the energy crisis, which has sent household bills soaring. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated existing supply problems and left governments across Europe scrambling to protect consumers from the cost of living crunch. The Centre for Economics and Business Research has estimated that, without government intervention, energy costs could increase by 40% across the eurozone in 2022, up from a 13% rise in 2021. Deliberations over sanctions on Russian energy supplies and measures to limit the fallout of the conflict continue in Europe. In the UK, analysts have said bills could reach as much as £3,000 a year in October, when the price cap is due to go up again, if wholesale gas prices do not fall. Here is how different governments across Europe have reacted. Great Britain The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been repeatedly criticised for acting slowly on tackling the energy crisis. The government has so far resisted calls from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas operators, arguing that it would discourage investment in domestic energy supplies. In February, Sunak said 28m households will receive a £200 discount on their bills from October. The cost will be recovered over the next five years. Ministers rejected calls for a cut on the 5% VAT rate on energy bills in favour of a one-off rebate of £150 for households in England in council tax bands A-D. A further £144m has been set aside to support vulnerable people and those on low incomes. Italy The Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, on Monday laid out a €14bn (£11.8bn) support package to tackle energy costs. His measures include subsidies for vulnerable families and a €200 cash payment for pensioners and those on low incomes. Draghi also found extra funds for local governments and will offer tax credits for energy-intensive industries. The measures come on top of the €20bn the cash-strapped nation has already spent on cushioning the impact of the energy price rise. The initiatives will be funded by a hike in Italy’s windfall tax, introduced in January. The levy on energy industry profits will rise to 25% from 10%. Germany Economists have warned that a sudden halt to Russian gas would trigger a “sharp recession” in Germany. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has promised “tangible relief” to citizens and last week unveiled a €30bn collection of measures. These include a temporary reduction in fuel taxes and cheaper, 90-day tickets to make public transport more affordable. The move builds on an existing €15bn relief package which involved an increase in the tax-free allowance for long-distance commuters. Berlin has also fast-tracked a revamp of legislation from 1975 aimed at handling energy shocks. The reworked bill will include measures to shut down companies during a gas shortage and strengthen EU security of supply regulations. Rules brought in five years ago state that EU members must help one another when gas supplies are tight. Spain Spain’s government was one of the first to take action to protect households against a sharp rise in energy bills. It agreed last September to remove taxes from home energy bills, which would instead be paid by enforcing a windfall tax on companies profiting from the surge in energy prices. A string of other measures have followed, including a ban on increasing gas bills by more than 5% for customers with lower energy consumption. Last week the European Commission agreed a price cap on gas for Spain and Portugal for 12 months. Consumers have been helped by a cut to VAT on energy bills and a reduction in a separate tax on electricity. France Emmanuel Macron made energy policy a key pillar in his successful presidential re-election campaign. He said he would make France “the first major nation to abandon gas, oil and coal” ahead of his win last month. In the short term, the French government has forced majority state-owned electricity supplier EDF Energy to lower costs. The operator, which is behind the Hinkley Point B nuclear power plant in the UK, told investors it would take a €8.4bn hit from the energy price cap, which meant it lowered the cost of electricity below the market rate. Electricity taxes have been reduced for households and businesses. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has estimated government efforts to curb costs since the Ukraine invasion are worth about €25bn. Poland The Polish government has urged European counterparts to impose tough sanctions on Russia’s oil and gas industry after gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland were cut last week by the Russian energy giant Gazprom. Both countries have said there is no immediate risk to supplies. Polish ministers have repeatedly intervened since late last year to protect households from the energy price hike. The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, introduced an “anti-inflation shield”, cutting VAT on food and gas to 0%. A wider economic package, dubbed the “anti-Putin shield”, is being rolled out to support companies and jobs. The Netherlands The Dutch government was swift to act as the energy crisis began to escalate last year. Last October, energy taxes were cut for households and €150m was allocated to boosting home insulation. In March, the government raised a one-off energy allowance for low-income households by €600 to €800. The government has also lowered VAT on energy from 21% to 9% until the end of the year. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been cut for the rest of 2022. Norway In December, Norway’s government set out a series of measures to help households totalling more than 8bn kroner (£664m). Last month its parliament agreed an extension to a support scheme to tackle high electricity prices, worth €850m through to March 2023. Support for students and widows has also been ramped up. Sweden Sweden began introducing policies to tackle the energy crisis at the start of the year. These extended to compensation for households with high energy usage and fuel duty cuts. The government has also offered €6,700 in support for buying electric vehicles. Sweden is also expected to spend €48m on a housing allowance for families with children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/01/tariff-shields-and-turning-off-lights-how-europe-is-tackling-the-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T10:40:36Z","webTitle":"Tariff shields and turning off lights: how Europe is tackling the energy crisis ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/tariff-shields-and-turning-off-lights-how-europe-is-tackling-the-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/01/tariff-shields-and-turning-off-lights-how-europe-is-tackling-the-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Tariff shields and turning off lights: how Europe is tackling the energy crisis ","bodyText":"Governments across Europe are scrambling to cushion citizens from soaring energy prices and have so far allocated a total of about €280bn (£240bn) to helping reduce the impact of the crisis, according to the thinktank Bruegel. Pressure is mounting for joint action beyond a voluntary 15% cut in consumption agreed in July, and the EU will hold an emergency summit on 9 September to discuss measures including a bloc-wide price cap. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said this week the bloc was working on “an emergency intervention and a structural reform of [Europe’s] electricity market”, whose limitations are being cruelly exposed. Options include an emergency block-wide price cap, and – more fundamentally – a decoupling of electricity and gas prices, a move backed by several member states and adopted as an “Iberian exception” this summer by Spain and Portugal with the aim of slashing electricity bills. Under the present EU-wide mechanism, electricity prices are pegged to the price of the most expensive fuel used in power generation, which is currently natural gas – whose price has surged since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sending electricity prices soaring too. Encouragingly, the continent’s gas storage reservoirs, which will be critical to getting through the winter, have reached the commission’s 80% capacity target two months ahead of schedule, and Spain, Italy, Germany and France have exceeded it. But the coming months nonetheless look likely to be tough for millions across the continent. Here is a look at the scale of the energy crisis in several European countries, and – with Britain’s government accused of inaction – what capitals are doing about it. France has frozen gas prices at October 2021 levels and capped electricity price increases at 4% until at least the end of the year, and handed out €100 to low- and middle-income households to help pay energy bills. The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has said any price increases next year would be similarly “contained”, with no catchup costs, while the government spokesperson Olivier Véran said France would “not allow what is happening in the UK to happen here”. Without government energy intervention – known as le bouclier tarifaire, or the tariff shield, part of a €65bn package to tackle the cost of living crisis – French gas bills would have risen by 60% and electricity bills by 45%, Le Maire has said. France, traditionally a net exporter of electricity, is currently a net importer because several of the nuclear reactors that generate about 70% of its electricity – making it far less reliant on Russian gas – are shut for maintenance and have corrosion problems. The country has embarked on a “sobriety programme” aimed at cutting energy consumption by 10%, including setting temperatures in public buildings higher in summer and lower in winter. The private sector and households are expected to make similar efforts. Prime minister Elisabeth Borne has warned companies face energy rationing if they do not reduce consumption, while President Emmanuel Macron has said the French will have to make sacrifices during a “difficult” winter as a new era of instability due to climate change and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine meant the end of abundant energy, water and new products. Natural gas, mostly used to heat private homes and to power industry, makes up a quarter of Germany’s overall energy mix, and at the start of the war 55% it came from Russia. By this month, however, the figure had fallen to 9.5%. Olaf Scholz’s government has embarked on an ambitious programme to wean itself off Russian gas completely, scrambling to build floating LNG import terminals and vowing to massively expand onshore windfarms. Some coal plants that were due to be shuttered have been reactivated, though the government has yet to say what it will do about the last three remaining nuclear power plants, due to be shut down at the end of the year. Several energy-saving measures have been enacted, including limiting temperatures in public buildings to 19C from September and turning off heating in common areas such as corridors, with the private sector encouraged to follow suit. Most heating and electricity bills are up by about 10% year on year, but the real shock will come in 2023: Berlin’s tenants’ association expects landlords to demand additional retrospective energy payments equivalent to two months’ rent. Facing “a tripling, at the very least,” of monthly consumer bills next year, the government is paying all people in regular employment a one-off rebate of €300 in September. Students and welfare recipients have already received double their usual lump-sum payment to assist with heating private homes. Italy is one of Europe’s most vulnerable countries, with 40% of gas imports dependent on Russia. Without government intervention, up to 120,000 firms risk closure over the next nine months, industry associations have said. Electricity bills have already risen sharply and the power regulator Arera has warned of a 100% year-on-year increase by 1 October. Restaurant owners have posted bills totalling thousands of euros on social media or displayed them in their windows. As political parties clamour for rapid action, the government has said it is studying more options to help households and businesses. But the crisis is aggravated by political instability after Mario Draghi’s resignation as prime minister in July. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, who is tipped to be among the winners of the 25 September elections, has said that if prices do not fall, the next government “will have to ration electricity and gas, starting with businesses”. Although Draghi signed a series of bilateral agreements with Algeria, Africa’s biggest gas exporter, to secure alternative supplies, Salvini said that without intervention there was “absolutely a concrete risk of having to decide who will heat their homes and plants and who will not; who will turn on the lights and who will not.” The country is also working on an emergency energy-saving plan under which domestic radiators would be lowered by 2C in winter, cities would cut street lighting by 40%, public offices would close early and shops would shut by 7pm and restaurants 11pm. Spain is not nearly as dependent on Russian gas as some EU states – Russia provided 10% of its gas imports this year – but the Socialist-led coalition government recently introduced a series of energy-saving measures targeting a 7-8% reduction in gas use. Last week, parliament approved a decree limiting air conditioning and heating temperatures in public and large commercial buildings such as malls, cinemas, railway stations and airports. Shop window lights must be switched off after 10pm. On Thursday, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said his government would cut VAT on gas from 21% to 5% from October until the end of the year to help Spanish households with their energy bills. In June the EU approved an €8.4bn Spanish and Portuguese plan to reduce wholesale electricity prices in the Iberian market by capping the price of gas used to produce electricity. Operating as a direct grant to electricity producers, it should save households 15% to 20% on their energy bills, the government says. Spain’s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, said Spain was far better prepared for winter than some countries, but people could do more. “Do I need to tell families to shower in cold water, like the German government has?” she told El Mundo. “That wouldn’t even occur to me. But I can urge people to readopt habits such as turning off lights when they’re not needed, or not turning the heating up so high.” Different countries face very different problems. Poland, a major European producer of low-grade coal, which it exports and uses to fire the power stations that generate about 70% of its electricity, imposed an embargo on Russian coal in April. That mattered because the country also relies heavily on coal for domestic heating, which requires a higher grade, almost half of which – about 5m tonnes – Poland used to import mainly from Russia. With that source closed off, prices have trebled. In June the government tried to guarantee supplies by ordering state-owned companies to buy an extra 4.5m tonnes for domestic consumption, lifted quality standards for home burning, and tried unsuccessfully to cap prices. This month it announced a one-off payment of 3,000 złotys (about €630, or £540) for each coal-burning household, with smaller subsidies for different types of heating fuel such as wood and LPG, a move that has been criticised as environmentally harmful and not means-tested. The Netherlands is the EU’s largest natural gas producer and western Europe’s biggest after Norway but it has imported up to 15% of its gas from Russia as it has wound down production from its Groningen gasfield because of earthquakes. It is offering the lowest-earning households a one-off energy subsidy of €1,300,hiking the miniumum wage and lowering VAT on energy to 9%, but has said it will only dramatically increase output from the Groningen field if Russia shuts off all gas supplies to Europe. The government is doubling LNG imports and said last month that the country had cut its gas consumption by about 33% in the first half of the year, partly due to warm weather, but it has said it remains exposed to any wider European gas crisis. Even non-EU Norway, a huge natural gas producer that generates almost 90% of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, has seen domestic power prices soar owing to low water levels in its reservoirs and unusually high electricity exports. The government is considering limiting exports and has capped electricity bills at 0.7 Norwegian krone (€0.7 or £0.61) per kWh, with the state covering 80% (rising to 90% in October) above that. Critics say many households will still struggle, and further measures are under discussion. • This article was amended on 4 and 7 September 2022. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Norway had capped its electricity price at “€7 per kWh”. This was changed to “7 krone, or €0.7”. The correct figure is 0.7 krone, €0.07, or £0.06."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/07/what-have-nord-stream-2-and-gas-got-to-do-with-ukraine-standoff","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-07T13:21:09Z","webTitle":"What have Nord Stream 2 and gas got to do with the Ukraine standoff?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/what-have-nord-stream-2-and-gas-got-to-do-with-ukraine-standoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/07/what-have-nord-stream-2-and-gas-got-to-do-with-ukraine-standoff","fields":{"headline":"What have Nord Stream 2 and gas got to do with the Ukraine standoff?","bodyText":"Why is gas an issue in the Ukraine crisis? Gas is not just a source of energy, sometimes it is a political weapon. As western countries weigh possible sanctions against Russia for an invasion of Ukraine, the future of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline hangs in the balance. But it’s complicated. The EU gets 41% of its gas from Russia; Russia earns 60% of its import revenues from the bloc. The crisis over Ukraine comes as Europe is struggling to deal with soaring gas prices and internal divisions over how to wean itself off fossil fuels in response to the climate emergency. What is Nord Stream 2? Nord Stream 2 is a 750-miles pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, with the potential to supply 26m German homes. The pipeline has been completed but has not yet certified by Germany’s energy regulator. It’s much more than another engineering project. The Baltic Sea pipeline bypasses Ukraine and is seen as depriving Kyiv of lucrative transit fees. One former Polish foreign minister even likened it to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that carved up eastern Europe between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. What happens to Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine? The US has insisted the pipeline will not move forward if Russia invades Ukraine. Somewhat less emphatically, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has said the pipeline would be up for discussion as part of sanctions measures. The EU needs unanimity among 27 member states to impose sanctions. While Germany’s voice would probably be decisive, stopping Nord Stream 2 would need support from other member states, such as Austria and Bulgaria, that are highly dependent on Russian gas and nervous about antagonising Moscow. They are among 10 member states in central and eastern Europe that import more than 75% of their gas from their eastern neighbour. EU officials fear any move against Nord Stream 2 would trigger retaliation from Moscow. Will Russia turn off the pipes? That’s impossible to answer without seeing inside the mind of Vladimir Putin, who likes to keep the world guessing. But the Kremlin has shown previously it is ready to use gas as a weapon, during the supply crises of 2006 and 2009, which had a severe impact on central and eastern Europe. Russia is heavily dependent on fossil fuel revenues, but has made efforts to increase supplies to China, a big and powerful customer, over the last 15 years. Last week Moscow agreed a 30-year contract to supply China with gas and build a new pipeline. But the EU remains a lucrative customer, for now. Can the EU cope without Russian gas? Gazprom already stands accused of market manipulation in Europe in an effort to pressure European regulators to grant a swift approval to Nord Stream 2, which needs to clear regulatory hurdles. The Russian state energy company has dismissed the charges as lies. With the support of the US, EU officials are searching the globe for alternative gas suppliers. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, and energy commissioner Kadri Simson are holding talks on energy security with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington on Monday. The US is the biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas to the EU. Talks are under way on increasing LNG supplies to the EU from Norway, Qatar, Azerbaijan and Algeria. Analysts at the Brussels thinktank Bruegel argue that the EU could get by without Russian gas supplies until the summer with increased imports, a few logistical headaches and some effort to reduce demand. In the longer term, Bruegel writes, the EU would face more painful political choices, including costly action to reduce demand, such as emergency closures of industrial plants. Will the crisis force the EU to reduce dependence on Russian gas? Despite successive gas disputes with Russia and the huge diplomatic fallout over the annexation of Crimea and downing of flight MH17 in 2014, the EU has done little to wean itself off Russian gas. Borrell said in a blogpost before his Washington trip that the EU had not done enough to “enhance our capacity to face potential gas supply cuts”, while Russia had been building up its foreign currency reserves, a measure to insulate itself from western sanctions. The latest crisis could force a reckoning, as should the EU’s climate policy, which has a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050. The problem is many member states see gas as a bridge away from coal or nuclear power. The need for a “gas bridge” is disputed by environmentalists, but the policy choice has already been made in many European capitals. Europe’s thirst for gas, it seems, is not going to disappear anytime soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/apr/20/top-10-books-about-gardening-grounding-lulah-ellender","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-20T11:00:27Z","webTitle":"Top 10 books about gardening","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/20/top-10-books-about-gardening-grounding-lulah-ellender","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/apr/20/top-10-books-about-gardening-grounding-lulah-ellender","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 books about gardening","bodyText":"Books about gardens and gardening range from instructional manuals to narrative works spotlighting our emotional connections with plants and planting. While there is definitely a place for how-to garden books, these are not the volumes I reach for when I’m looking for inspiration or want to think more deeply about why and how we grow. Gardens can be places of liberation, queer expression and political defiance as well as of simple beauty and peace. When I was writing Grounding I turned to writers whose work explored these aspects of gardening and our relationship with the natural world. Their books illuminate our colonial past, unpick ideas of belonging and home and describe the ways the small act of nurturing a plant or patch of land can change the world for the better. In my book I explore the connections between artists and writers and their gardens, and some of the books I’ve chosen here also reflect this interest in creativity and the human impulse to cultivate beauty. Gardening and writing have been the mainstays of my life over a period of great uncertainty. I hope you find similar solace in some of these books. 1 Elizabeth and Her German Garden by Elizabeth von Arnim This semi-autobiographical novel is an account of the protagonist Elizabeth’s efforts to create a garden from wilderness at her country estate. Wittily drawn and with feminist overtones unusual for its time (it was published in 1898), the book shows how the garden provides Elizabeth a place of escape from her husband (known as “the Man of Wrath”) and her children. Originally published anonymously to avoid her husband feeling he was being publicly ridiculed, Arnim reveals the garden as a refuge from stifling domesticity and the demands of others. This is a utopian vision of feminine retreat, experimentation, freedom and creativity in a society where there were few places of self-determination for women. 2 Modern Nature by Derek Jarman A poetic, powerful and wide-ranging account of Jarman’s garden at Prospect Cottage, Dungeness on the Kent coast. Creating beauty in the shadow of a nuclear power station on a shingle desert, Modern Nature shows Jarman’s deep love and knowledge of plants, his huge creative force and his belief in gardening as a radical act. As he becomes ill with Aids we see the garden replenish him and provide a stake in the future, as well as sending him back to the gardens of his childhood. 3 Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer Kimmerer is a renowned botanist, professor in environmental biology and member of the Potawatomi Nation. This book helps us to better understand our reciprocal relationship with the world, encouraging compassion and wonder as ways to repair the damage we’ve done to the planet. Although it is not specifically about gardens, Kimmerer’s knowledge and perspective will change the way you see and connect to your garden. 4 The Well-Gardened Mind by Sue Stuart-Smith Psychotherapist and psychiatrist Stuart-Smith investigates the ways gardens improve our state of mind and wellbeing. Using a bewitching blend of stories and science, this book shows just how powerfully we are affected by our surroundings, and the potential for healing we find in the natural world. It’s a life-affirming read that helps explain why a few minutes with your hands in the soil makes you feel so much better. 5 The Well-Tempered Garden by Christopher Lloyd Forthright, funny and hugely knowledgable, Lloyd’s writing on gardens always lifts my spirits. His glorious garden at Great Dixter in East Sussex is beloved by gardeners around the world, and throughout his life he was generous with advice and hospitality. This book is full of practical insights and wisdom on all aspects of gardening, peppered with anecdotes and wry asides. Keep it close to hand. 6 The Morville Hours by Katherine Swift This beautiful, evocative book tells the story of a National Trust garden in Shropshire using the structure of a medieval book of hours. Swift excavates the history of this plot of land and the people who have lived there, as well as her personal travails creating a garden in a temporary home. The story spans centuries but also zooms in close, revealing the beauty in a flower along with the echoes of the past. 7 The Complete Illustrated Holistic Herbal by David Hoffmann A practical, comprehensive guide to using plants medicinally that will help any gardener grow plants to heal themselves, their family and their community. There’s something immensely appealing about the autonomy we gain from growing our own medicine. This book shows you what and when to gather and grow, and how to prepare and apply different treatments. 8 The Edible Garden by Alys Fowler Fowler’s polyculture garden mixes edibles with annual and perennial planting to create a gorgeously wild abundance. She sees foraging and growing our own food as a way to counteract capitalism’s inherent inequalities and structural oppression. Every book she writes is brilliant, but this is the one I return to over and over. 9 The Wild Iris by Louise Glück A book of poems covering a year in the garden, this book portrays the creative interplay between words and plants, the page and the natural world. Glück deftly conveys the strange elasticity of time in a garden – the longevity and simultaneous transience. Plants speak poems, perspectives shift, material and spiritual worlds collide. She explores the cycles of nature, death and rebirth in precise, sharp language in this intimate exploration of loss, longing and beauty. 10 My Garden by Jamaica Kincaid A passionate, poetic collection of New Yorker column essays exploring Kincaid’s relationship with her garden and the plants she grows (or fails to grow). She weaves botanical and colonial history with personal stories of the intuitive way she grew her garden in Vermont. Kincaid is interested in ownership, displacement and the history of botanical classification, asking us to examine imperial history and ancestral memory within the context of the garden. • Grounding: Finding Home in a Garden by Lulah Ellender is published by Granta.

The International Energy Agency recorded the steepest ever increase in electricity demand last year, which triggered blackouts in major economies and led to historic energy price highs and record emissions. The IEA’s annual electricity report said this could continue for another three years, with serious consequences for consumers and economies unless there is a faster structural change to the way electricity is produced. “Sharp spikes in electricity prices in recent times have been causing hardship for many households and businesses around the world and risk becoming a driver of social and political tensions,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. The IEA found that the world’s demand for electricity surged by 6% last year, following the global economic rebound from the 2020 pandemic recession, the steepest increase since 2010 when economies began to bounce back from the global financial crisis. The total increase in electricity demand was over 1,500 terawatt-hours, the largest on record. About half of the growth in electricity demand took place in China alone, where it rose by an estimated 10% compared with 2020. China and India both suffered from power cuts in the second half of the year because coal supplies failed to keep pace with the demand on their power plants, leading to an economic slowdown in Asia. In the UK, electricity market prices have reached record highs in recent months, in large part because the power grid continues to rely on gas-burning power plants for almost half of its electricity. The cost of running of these sites has rocketed following a global gas supply crunch which has triggered record high market prices across Europe. The rising cost of keeping the lights on has left the UK facing a national energy crisis as household bills have rocketed, energy suppliers have collapsed and factories have been forced to shut. The global strain on electricity systems has also led to record emissions from power generation as economies turn to cheaper coal power plants to keep a lid on soaring costs. “Policymakers should be taking action now to soften the impacts on the most vulnerable and to address the underlying causes,” Birol said. “Higher investment in low-carbon energy technologies including renewables, energy efficiency and nuclear power – alongside an expansion of robust and smart electricity grids – can help us get out of today’s difficulties.” The IEA’s report found that renewable energy sources grew by 6% in 2021, but that increase was unable to keep pace with the surge in demand as economies reopened following the sudden Covid-19 lockdowns that had choked economic growth. In order to meet the rebound in demand for power, coal-fired plants generated 9% more electricity last year, or more than half of the global increase in power demand, to reach an all-time peak as gas became more expensive. Electricity generated by gas power plants grew by 2% last year, according to the IEA, while nuclear generation increased by 3.5%. The return to dirtier sources of electricity caused the world’s total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power generation to climb by 7% to a new all-time high after having declined the two previous years, the IEA said. Birol warned that emissions from electricity would need to decline by 55% by 2030 if the world hopes to limit the rise in global heating by becoming “net zero carbon” by 2050. “But in the absence of major policy action from governments, those emissions are set to remain around the same level for the next three years,” he said. “Not only does this highlight how far off track we currently are from a pathway to net zero emissions by 2050, but it also underscores the massive changes needed for the electricity sector to fulfil its critical role in decarbonising the broader energy system.” • The headline of this article was amended on 18 January 2022 to more accurately reflect the words of the IEA, which warned of price volatility rather than price rises."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-vows-to-retake-territory-more-than-1000-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-sent-to-russia-moscow-says-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-09T00:20:25Z","webTitle":"Russian bombardment of Sievierodonetsk ‘pushes Ukrainian troops back to city’s outskirts’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-vows-to-retake-territory-more-than-1000-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-sent-to-russia-moscow-says-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-vows-to-retake-territory-more-than-1000-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-sent-to-russia-moscow-says-live","fields":{"headline":"Russian bombardment of Sievierodonetsk ‘pushes Ukrainian troops back to city’s outskirts’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Russian president Vladimir Putin said that domestically manufacturing goods to circumvent Western sanctions over Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine was not a cure-all solution, adding that Russia is now seeking out new trade partners. “The substitution of imports is not a panacea,” Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs. The group expressed concerns over a lack of imported goods in their attempts to develop vaccines. “We are not trying to completely replace imports,” Putin said, adding that Russia “must collaborate with those it is possible to collaborate with”. “But for critically important technologies, we have to have our own know-how,” he said. “We are developing them.” After Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in February, Western countries have imposed harsh sanctions on Russia that include import and export restrictions which have debilitated supply chains. Russia’s pharmaceutical industry is heavily dependent on imports. Authorities announced in April that they had built three factories in Moscow to produce medicines to ease the blow of the import ban. That’s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine. Here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand as of 3am. Ukrainian forces have been pushed back by a Russian bombardment in the frontline eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and now only control its outskirts. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said most of the city was now in Russian hands and that it was no longer possible to rescue civilians stranded there. The battle for Sievierodonetsk - where the fate of Donbas is being decided - is probably the most difficult seen so far during the war, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. “Battle for Sievierodonetsk is probably one of the most difficult during this war, and in particular the fate of Donbas is being decided there,” he said in his latest national address on Wednesday night. A Russian-backed official in Ukraine’s partially occupied southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia said Russia has begun to send grain from occupied areas to Turkey and the Middle East through Crimea. A Russian official in Crimea, Oleg Kryuchkov, said the first train carrying grain had arrived from Melitopol, a city in Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin also claimed shipments of grain will restart in the coming days from the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk after work to de-mine the area. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow was willing to open corridors to allow grain exports from Ukraine, but that these efforts relied on the Ukrainian side to remove mines from their ports. Kyiv dismissed Lavrov’s remarks as “empty” words and said military equipment was required to protect the coastline and a navy mission to patrol the export routes in the Black Sea. A Ukrainian journalist confronted Lavrov about grain exports from Ukraine during a visit to Ankara, Turkey. “Apart from cereals, what other goods did you steal from Ukraine and who did you sell them to?” Muslim Umerov asked. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is “threatening to unleash an unprecedented wave of hunger and destitution, leaving social and economic chaos in its wake”. A new report by the UN said an estimated 94 countries, home to around 1.6bn people, are “severely exposed to at least one dimension of the crisis and unable to cope with it”. Russian-installed officials in the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region reportedly plan to stage a referendum later this year on joining Russia. A Kremlin-backed official, Vladimir Rogov, was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Tass as saying: “The people will determine the future of the Zaporizhzhia region.” Ukraine says any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent. More than 1,000 Ukrainian servicemen and foreign mercenaries, who had surrendered in Mariupol, have been transferred to Russia for an investigation there, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. More Ukrainian prisoners of war will be taken to Russia “later on”, a Russian law enforcement source told the outlet. Moscow’s chief rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, has left Russia after coming under pressure to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a relative. Goldschmidt flew to Hungary to raise money for refugees in Eastern Europe after refusing to publicly support what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Two British men captured by Russian forces while fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol face 20 years in prison, according to a video shared by Russian state media. Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, appeared in court in the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Britain’s economy will suffer more than any other major industrial country from the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK will grow by 3.6% in 2022 before posting zero growth in 2023, according to the Paris-based thinktank the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). Ukraine has received the first billion dollars of the $40 billion aid package that the US Congress approved last month. In a tweet on Wednesday, US ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A Brink said: “Supporting Ukraine means strengthening its economy. Direct support of $1 billion is already here to help Ukraine and its people move forward.” Zelenskiy said he met with American philanthropist Howard Buffet, son of billionaire investor Warren Buffet, in Kyiv to discuss rebuilding efforts. “We discussed assistance that would be valuable for our state. I offered him the chance to join projects restoring irrigation systems in the Odesa region, supporting our people, (and) mine clearance,” Zelenskiy said in a tweet. Russian authorities have further cracked down against citizens who speak out about the fighting in Ukraine. A Moscow court on Wednesday extended the detention of Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr., a journalist and former associate of assassinated Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, accusing him of spreading lies about the Russian military. Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov, who has been accused of spreading misinformation about the Russian military, said a criminal case had been opened against him. Moscow’s chief rabbi was also confirmed to have fled the country. Civilian evacuations continue across Ukraine as many flee in armoured cars and buses to safety. Western-supplied artillery systems are already making a difference on the ground for Ukraine and it is “just a question of time” before its forces win back significant ground in the south, the governor of the Mykolaiv region said on Wednesday. Governor Vitaliy Kim, whose region is partially occupied by Russia but remains just one of two that retains significant access to the Black Sea, told Reuters that Ukrainian forces had “some success” in recent weeks in a counterattack in the neighbouring Kherson region. Asked when western weapons would start to make a difference on the ground against Russian forces, he said: “It is already happening ... and we will have (more) success.” “We are talking about artillery,” he said. “It is already working in our region.” He declined to say what specific western artillery systems were working there. The battle for Sievierodonetsk - where the fate of Donbas is being decided - is probably the most difficult seen so far during the war, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Addressing the nation late on Wednesday evening, he said: Sievierodonetsk remains the epicentre of the confrontation in Donbas. We defend our positions, inflict significant losses on the enemy. [The] battle for Sievierodonetsk is probably one of the most difficult during this war, and in particular the fate of Donbas is being decided there. This is a very fierce battle, very difficult. Probably one of the most difficult throughout this war. I am grateful to everyone who defends this direction. In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided there.” Zelenskiy described Donetsk as a “ghost town that has lost most people, thousands of lives and absolutely all prospects”. “Only the return of Ukraine, which will definitely happen, only our flag and only Ukrainian law will mean a normal life for these territories, for these cities - again. The life that was there. Peaceful, safe, open to the world,” he added. “Russia has been waging digital war against Ukrainian since 2014,” Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation George Dubinskiy said in an interview on Wednesday. Speaking to France 24, Dubinskiy said that in addition to defending its land borders, Ukraine is also defending its digital ones. The European Parliament has backed a resolution that calls for Ukraine to be a candidate for EU membership, Oleksandr Korniyenko, the first deputy speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, tweeted on Thursday. “The majority of MEPs are together with the Ukrainian people!” he added. A British man fighting in Ukraine has been captured by pro-Russian separatists, an international legion backing the Kyiv government said on Wednesday. “It was announced in the Ukrainian press that the Russians had completed a criminal investigation against three foreigners whom they were preparing to put on trial and that they risked the death penalty,” Damien Magrou, spokesman for the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine (LIDU) told AFP. Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov tweeted on Wednesday that he has been placed on the country’s national and international wanted list. Soldatov is the editor-in-chief of Agentura.ru, a website that focuses on Russia’s secret services’ activities. He has been accused of spreading misinformation about the Russian military. Ukraine has received the first billion dollars of the $40 billion aid package that the US Congress approved last month. In a tweet on Wednesday, US ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A Brink said, “Supporting Ukraine means strengthening its economy. Direct support of $1 billion is already here to help Ukraine and its people move forward...” Russian authorities kept up their crackdown against citizens who speak out about the fighting in Ukraine, extending a critic’s detention on Wednesday, confirming charges against two others and prompting Moscow’s chief rabbi to flee the country. In the latest development, a Moscow court on Wednesday extended the detention of Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr., a journalist and former associate of assassinated Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, accusing him of spreading lies about the Russian military. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that he has met with American philanthropist Howard Buffet, son of billionaire investor Warren Buffet, in Kyiv to discuss rebuilding efforts. “We discussed assistance that would be valuable for our state. I offered him the chance to join projects restoring irrigation systems in the Odesa region, supporting our people, (and) mine clearance,” Zelenskiy said in a tweet. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. “Russia has been waging digital war against Ukrainian since 2014,” Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation George Dubinskiy said in an interview on Wednesday.

Agence-France Presse reports: “It was announced in the Ukrainian press that the Russians had completed a criminal investigation against three foreigners whom they were preparing to put on trial and that they risked the death penalty,” Damien Magrou, spokesman for the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine (LIDU) told AFP. “One of the three names mentioned in the article, Andrew Hill, is a legionnaire who has a contract with the Ukrainian army,” he added. Magrou stressed that under the Geneva Convention Hill should be considered a prisoner of war, and treated as such. According to the LIDU, Hill has been held “in captivity for some weeks” by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. “Executing prisoners is a war crime,” it said. The international legion had given the names of a Dutchman, an Australian, a German and a Frenchman, without specifying the date or circumstances of their death. Russia claimed this week that it had killed “hundreds” of foreign fighters in Ukraine since the start of its invasion in February. Ukraine has received the first billion dollars of the $40 billion aid package that the US Congress approved last month. In a tweet on Wednesday, US ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A Brink said, “Supporting Ukraine means strengthening its economy. Direct support of $1 billion is already here to help Ukraine and its people move forward...” Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov tweeted on Wednesday that he has been placed on the country’s national and international wanted list. Soldatov is the editor-in-chief of Agentura.ru, a website that focuses on Russia’s secret services’ activities. He has been accused of spreading misinformation about the Russian military. According to Russia’s interior ministry, Soldatov “is wanted for violating an article of the Criminal Code.” The ministry’s website did not include additional dertails. Russian authorities kept up their crackdown against citizens who speak out about the fighting in Ukraine, extending a critic’s detention on Wednesday, confirming charges against two others and prompting Moscow’s chief rabbi to flee the country. The Associated Press reports: Russia adopted a law criminalizing spreading allegedly false information about its military shortly after its troops rolled into Ukraine in late February. The offense is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Human rights advocates have counted dozens of cases. Russians must use the term “military operation” when speaking of the fighting in Ukraine. In the latest development, a Moscow court on Wednesday extended the detention of Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr., a journalist and former associate of assassinated Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. The court extended Kara-Murza’s detention from June 12 to Aug. 12 on accusations that he spread “false information” about the country’s armed forces. The activist rejects the charges. Kara-Murza in 2015 and 2017 survived poisonings that he blamed on the authorities. Russian officials have denied responsibility. Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov, who spent years exposing the activities of Russian security agencies and is now living in London, reported this week that a criminal case had been opened against him. Soldatov is accused of spreading false information about the Russian military. Soldatov reported that his bank accounts in Russia have been frozen. Russian authorities confirmed they have filed similar charges against popular Russian fiction writer Dmitry Glukhovsky, who also now lives outside of Russia. Glukhovsky had posted a video showing a tank shelling a residential building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, along with commentary criticizing Russia’s military operation. He is a former journalist and author of the best-selling novel “Metro-2033.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that he has met with American philanthropist Howard Buffet, son of billionaire investor Warren Buffet, in Kyiv to discuss rebuilding efforts. “We discussed assistance that would be valuable for our state. I offered him the chance to join projects restoring irrigation systems in the Odesa region, supporting our people, (and) mine clearance,” Zelenskiy said in a tweet. Buffett is a director of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate founded by his father, and CEO of the Howard G. Buffett Foundation. The foundation describes itself as one of the US’s biggest private charitable foundation and as of the end of 2020, had assets worth $529 million. According to its website, the foundation’s priorities include global food security, conflict mitigation and public safety. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukrainian forces have been pushed back by a Russian bombardment in the frontline eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and now only control its outskirts, according to the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai. Russian forces have seized residential quarters of the key eastern city and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on its outskirts and the nearby towns, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said. A Russian-backed official in Ukraine’s partially occupied southeastern region of Zaporizhia said Russia has begun to send grain from occupied areas to Turkey and the Middle East through Crimea. A Russian official in Crimea, Oleg Kryuchkov, said the first train carrying grain had arrived from Melitopol, a city in Zaporizhzhia. It has not been possible to verify these claims. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow was willing to open corridors to allow grain exports from Ukraine, but that these efforts relied on the Ukrainian side to remove mines from their ports. Kyiv dismissed Lavrov’s remarks as “empty” words and said military equipment was required to protect the coastline and a navy mission to patrol the export routes in the Black Sea Russian-installed officials in the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region reportedly plan to stage a referendum later this year on joining Russia. A Kremlin-backed official, Vladimir Rogov, was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Tass as saying: “The people will determine the future of the Zaporizhzhia region.” Ukraine says any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, warned that the consequences for the world of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are “speeding up” and “threatening to unleash an unprecedented wave of hunger and destitution, leaving social and economic chaos in its wake”. A new report by the UN said an estimated 94 countries, home to around 1.6bn people, are “severely exposed to at least one dimension of the crisis and unable to cope with it”. Millions of people could die of hunger unless Russia lifts the blockade on Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea, Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, has warned. Lebanon’s minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bou Habib, told a meeting of Mediterranean ministers that rises in fuel and basic food stuffs were exacerbating the crisis in his country. Ukraine and Russia each handed over the bodies of 50 of their deceased soldiers in an exchange that included 37 Ukrainian soldiers killed at Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks, the Ukrainian ministry for reintegration has confirmed. The exchange took place on the front lines in the southeast Ukrainian region of Zaporizhzhia, the ministry said. Ukraine has filed eight more war crimes cases to court in addition to the three sentences already handed down to Russian soldiers, according to its prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. So far, Ukraine has opened more than 16,000 investigations into possible war crimes by the Russian army since the conflict began, Venediktova added. Ukraine is launching a ‘Book of Executioners’, a system to collate evidence of war crimes, President Zelenskiy said. More than 1,000 Ukrainian servicemen and foreign mercenaries, who had surrendered in Mariupol, have been transferred to Russia for an investigation there, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. More Ukrainian prisoners of war will be taken to Russia “later on”, a Russian law enforcement source told the outlet. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he “simply cannot see the preconditions for ending the war” in an interview with the Financial Times. Victory meant restoring “all” of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea – annexed by Russia in 2014 – and separatist-held areas, he suggested. “We have to achieve a full de-occupation of our entire territory,” Zelenskiy said. Dozens of radiation detectors around the Chornobyl nuclear power plant have started transmitting radiation data for the first time since Russia invaded, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Radiation levels in the area surrounding Ukraine’s Chornobyl nuclear power plant are now back to normal after detectors came back online today, the IAEA said. Moscow’s chief rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, has left Russia after coming under pressure to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a relative. Goldschmidt flew to Hungary to raise money for refugees in Eastern Europe after refusing to publicly support what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Russian proxy fighters in east Ukraine have said they are opening a trial against two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who were captured fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. The two men, who are serving in the Ukrainian military, and Ibrahim Saadun, a captive from Morocco, were shown sitting in a courtroom cage in a video released on pro-Russian social media channels on Tuesday. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my US colleague, Maya Yang. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. An update from the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, who said Russian forces control most of the strategic Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk and are heavily shelling the twin city of Lysychansk, causing major damage. In an online post, he said there was no chance of Ukrainian troops in the Luhansk region being encircled, Reuters reports. Russian forces temporarily control 90% of the region, Haidai added. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, warned that the consequences for the world of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are “speeding up” and “threatening to unleash an unprecedented wave of hunger and destitution, leaving social and economic chaos in its wake”. While this year’s food crisis is “about lack of access”, next year’s “could be about lack of food”, he said while presenting the UN’s second report on the repercussions of the war, AFP reports. Guterres said: The war’s impact on food security, energy and finance is systemic, severe, and speeding up. There is “only one way to stop this gathering storm: the Russian invasion of Ukraine must end”, he urged. He said he had asked colleagues to help find “a package deal that allows for the safe and secure export of Ukrainian-produced food through the Black Sea, and unimpeded access to global markets for Russian food and fertilisers”. The deal is “essential” for hundreds of millions of people in developing nations, including in sub-Sarahan Africa, he said. The UN report said an estimated 94 countries, home to around 1.6bn people, are “severely exposed to at least one dimension of the crisis and unable to cope with it”. The report says that the war may increase the number of food-insecure people by 47m people in 2022, bringing it to 323m by the end of the year. It is estimated that up to 58m more Africans may fall into poverty this year, the document adds. Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed comments by the former German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has insisted she was not naive in her dealings with Vladimir Putin. In her first major interview since stepping down as chancellor in December, Merkel said she had “nothing to apologise for” despite meeting frequently with the Russian president during her 16 years in power and championing a commerce-driven, pragmatic approach towards Moscow. Podolyak criticised Merkel for deepening Europe’s reliance on Russian energy, tweeting: If Chancellor Merkel always knew that Russia was planning a war and Putin’s goal is to destroy the EU, then why would (Germany) build the Nord Stream 2 (pipeline)? He said Merkel had “shoved” Europe towards increased dependency on Russian energy supplies. Podolyak asked: Why does Germany have to fix this mistake now? Under Merkel’s chancellorship, Germany became hugely reliant on Russian energy imports and Merkel drew criticism for her backing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline that was to double Russian gas deliveries to Germany. Her successor, Olaf Scholz, announced that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 project had been shelved in late February in reaction to Russia’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine. The Ukrainian journalist Muslim Umerow challenged the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, over accusations that Russia is stealing from Ukraine. Lavrov responded by saying Ukrainians “are always so preoccupied with what you can steal” before returning to Russia’s official line that forces were “denazifying’ eastern Ukraine. A Russian-backed official in Ukraine’s partially occupied southeastern region of Zaporizhia said Russia has begun to send grain from occupied areas to Turkey and the Middle East through Crimea. Yevgeny Balitsky, head of the Moscow-installed military-civilian administration in the occupied areas, told Russia’s Rossiya 24 news channel: We are sending grain through Russia, and primary contracts are signed with Turkey. The first trains have departed through Crimea for the Middle East. Balitsky did not specify which Middle Eastern countries were allegedly being supplied with the wheat, only saying: It was a traditional market for Ukraine. A Russian official in Crimea, Oleg Kryuchkov, said the first train carrying grain had arrived from Melitopol, a city in Zaporizhzhia. It has not been possible to verify these claims. More than seven million people have fled Ukraine since Russian troops invaded the country on 24 February, according to the UN’s refugee agency. Figured published today show a total of 7,023,559 border crossings have been recorded since the Russian invasion began. Ukraine’s former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, speaks to our Luke Harding and Dan Sabbagh about “cold, cruel” Vladimir Putin and the west’s response to the Russian invasion: Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko has described Vladimir Putin as “absolutely rational, cold, cruel, black evil” and claimed he is determined to go down in Russian history alongside Stalin and Peter the Great. In an exclusive interview, Tymoshenko dismissed the suggestion that the Russian president was “crazy”. “He acts according to his own dark logic,” she said. “He’s driven by this idea of historic mission and wants to create an empire. That’s his hyper-goal. It comes from a deep inner desire and belief.” Tymoshenko, a leader of the 2004 Orange revolution and twice prime minister, had several one-on-one meetings with Putin. They held negotiations in 2009 after Putin, then prime minister, turned off the gas supply to Ukraine. Tymoshenko stood for president in 2010, 2014 and 2019, finishing second twice and then third. Close up, Putin was “always cautious” in what he said and always suspicious that he might be being taped, she said. “He is from a KGB school,” she said. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February, he made no secret of his belief that there was “no such nation as Ukraine, and no such people as Ukrainians”, she said. His ambitions went beyond seizing Ukrainian territory and toppling its pro-western, pro-Nato government, Tymoshenko suggested. His geopolitical aim was to take over Belarus, Georgia and Moldova as well, and to control central and eastern Europe including the Baltic states, just as Moscow did in Soviet times, she said. Tymoshenko was in Kyiv on 24 February when Russia launched a multi-pronged attack in the early hours. She said peacetime political rivalries and grudges immediately vanished. That morning she went to the presidential administration together with other senior opposition figures and met Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom she ran against in 2019. “We hugged each other and shook hands. Everyone was shocked, pale and afraid. None of us planned to leave Kyiv,” she said. “Everyone knew we should stand until the last. We agreed to support our president and our army and to work for victory.” Zelenskiy’s decision to remain in the capital and to “overcome his fear” was important, she said. As Russian bombs fell, Tymoshenko took refuge in the basement of the modern office building belonging to her Batkivshchyna political party in Kyiv’s Podil district, which was hit several times by missiles. Asked if she was ready to shoot Russian soldiers, she said: “Yes. I have legal weapons. The Kremlin put me on a kill list, according to sources. We were prepared.” Read the full interview here: Yulia Tymoshenko on war in Ukraine: ‘It’s a chance for the free world to kill this evil’ Ukrainian forces have been pushed back by a Russian bombardment in the frontline eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and now only control its outskirts, according to the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai. Speaking to the RBC-Ukraine media outlet, Haidai said it made no sense for Ukrainian special forces to stay inside the city after Russia started levelling the area with shelling and air strikes. Regional leaders had said Ukrainian forces might have to “pull back” to stronger positions in Sievierodonetsk amid heavy fighting in the city and frontline villages to the south as Russia pursues a breakthrough in Donbas. It was “impossible” to say that Sievierodonetsk had been completely seized by Russian troops, Haidai said, adding: Our (forces) now again control only the outskirts of the city. But the fighting is still going on, our (forces) are defending Sievierodonetsk, it is impossible to say the Russians completely control the city. Haidai had earlier insisted that a retreat was not being planned. “Do not breed betrayal. Do not spoil the mood of the armed forces! Nobody is going to surrender Sievierodonetsk!” he said, adding that Ukraine’s defenders would fight for “every inch”. It is 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian-installed officials in the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region reportedly plan to stage a referendum later this year on joining Russia.

Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Sievierodonestk but Moscow’s forces do not control the frontline eastern city, regional officials say. Russian forces have seized residential quarters of the key eastern city and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on its outskirts and the nearby towns, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said.

The Kremlin said any meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine must be “productive and well prepared”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said western sanctions must be lifted in order for Russian grain to be delivered to international markets.

Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Sanctions imposed on the Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and his two sisters could be suspended after a legal challenge at the European court of justice by the businessman once described as one of Vladimir Putin’s “favourite oligarchs”. Usmanov, as well as his sisters Saodat Narzieva and Gulbakhor Ismailova, each filed separate legal appeals in April in an attempt to overturn sanctions that have blocked them from travelling across the EU or making use of assets located in member states, including a $600m (£484m) yacht. The Guardian understands an interim decision on whether to suspend sanctions could be issued within the next two weeks, pending a final ruling that is likely to be due by the end of the year. That would give the oligarch and his relatives access to bank accounts and assets that have either been frozen or seized. The Uzbek-born Usmanov has been subject to an asset freeze and EU travel ban since late February, after Russia invaded Ukraine. The sanctions came after the bloc identified him as one of “Putin’s favourite oligarchs”. Similar sanctions have since been applied against the metals and telecoms magnate in the US and UK, where he was a major sponsor of Everton football club. The EU later extended sanctions to Ismailova and Narzieva, for being financially “associated” with their brother. The move resulted in the impounding of a $600m yacht – the largest in the world – after German federal police, who investigated a complex web of holding companies, claimed to have identified Ismailova as the only beneficial owner of the vessel. A spokesperson for Usmanov and his sisters said the yacht’s ownership “was never concealed” and that all the required documents related to the structure of ownership via a trust were provided to relevant authorities, including in the EU, US and Germany. The EU sanctions listing for Usmanov also said the oligarch had “transferred considerable assets to his sister Soadat Narzieva [sic] including a single payment or gift of $3m”. The sanctions notice added that Narzieva “held 27 Swiss bank accounts, holding hundreds of millions of dollars, which can be linked to her brother”. Read Kalyeena Makortoff’s full article: Decision on lifting EU sanctions against Alisher Usmanov and his sisters expected soon Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said more than 31,000 Russian troops have died in Ukraine since the start of the invasion in February. Zelenskiy added that the war is costing Russia’s armed forces “300 lives a day” and will soon reach a level that would be unacceptable for Moscow. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Russian-installed officials in the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region plan to stage a referendum later this year on joining Russia, according to reports. A Kremlin-backed official, Vladimir Rogov, was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Tass as saying: The people will determine the future of the Zaporizhzhia region. The referendum is scheduled for this year. He did not give further details about the date for any such vote but said the administration would draw up plans for how to proceed with a referendum even if Russia could not gain control over the entire region. Zaporizhzhia city, the main urban centre, is still held by Ukraine. Around 60% of the Zaporizhzhia region, with a 1.6m pre-war population, is under Russian control, part of a swathe of southern Ukraine that was seized early in the war. In neighbouring Kherson province, Russian-installed officials have also discussed plans for a referendum. Ukraine says any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent. The Kremlin says it is for people living in the regions to decide their future. Rogov was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Ria as saying: The overwhelming number of residents of our region want to quickly to return to their native harbour and become part of big Russia. In 2014, Moscow and its proxies carried out a referendum in Ukraine’s Crimea which were condemned by western nations as being illegal. A British former intelligence officer said he did not see Vladimir Putin still being president of Russia “three to six months from now”. Putin’s days will be “numbered” once western sanctions on Russia, especially energy measures, begin to take effect, Christopher Steele told the BBC. Steele pointed to “signs that Putin’s health is failing” and said if US and UK sources were correct, the Russian leader could be “incapacitated” in that time. Oleksandr Syenkevych, mayor of Mykolaiv, has posted to Telegram about humanitarian efforts aimed at improving water supplies in the city that is in the south of Ukraine, between Odesa and Kherson. He posted: Mykolaiv received five brand new water carriers from the International Committee of the Red Cross in Ukraine. After completing all the necessary documents, we will immediately put them into operation. I sincerely thank our partners. I want to note that the Red Cross is actively helping our city to solve the problem of water supply. This organisation supplies drinking water to our residents and helps us purchase reagents for water purification. Ukraine and Russia each handed over the bodies of 50 of their deceased soldiers in an exchange that included 37 Ukrainian soldiers killed at Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks, the Ukrainian ministry for reintegration has confirmed. Reuters reports that in a statement on its website, the ministry said the exchange took place on the front lines in the southeast Ukrainian region of Zaporizhzhia. It said such exchanges would continue. Kyiv has dismissed assurances from Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Moscow will not use the situation to its advantage if Ukraine allows grain shipments to leave safely via the Black Sea as “empty”. Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, tweeted: Ukraine has made its position on the sea ports clear: military equipment is required to protect the coastline and a navy mission to patrol the export routes in the Black Sea. Russia cannot be “allowed to use grain corridors to attack” southern Ukraine, Nikolenko warned. Millions of people could die of hunger unless Russia lifts the blockade on Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea, Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, has warned. The next few weeks will be crucial to resolving the global food crisis, Di Maio said after a virtual meeting that included Mediterranean countries as well as G7 president Germany and the UN’s food and agriculture organisation. Di Maio said: I want to say clearly, we expect clear and concrete signals from Russia, because blocking grain exports means holding hostage and condemning to death millions of children, women and men. Lebanon’s minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bou Habib, told ministers that rises in fuel and basic food stuffs were exacerbating the crisis in his country. He called for the war in Ukraine to “stop at any cost”, adding that if it could not, “concerned parties... must be pressured to allow the safe export of grains and other commodities without any delay”. Bou Habib said: The world cannot continue to be at the mercy of military crises in Europe or other regions of the world. Moscow’s chief rabbi, Pinchas Goldschmidt, has left Russia after coming under pressure to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a relative. Avital Chizhik-Goldschmidt, a New York-based journalist, tweeted that Goldschmidt had refused to publicly support what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. She said he had flown to Hungary two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, raising money for refugees in Eastern Europe before continuing on to Israel. Our Ruth Michaelson has the full report on the meeting between Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, in Ankara: Speaking alongside Çavuşoğlu following talks between the two, Lavrov said Russia was willing to open corridors to allow grain exports from Ukraine, but that these efforts relied on the Ukrainian side to remove mines from their ports. Russia claims that Ukraine is responsible for mining the Black Sea, which the Ukrainians deny, saying that Russia is responsible. Lavrov said a move by the United Nations to restore Ukrainian grain exports “could be beneficial, but this is a symbolic step”. He said: To solve this problem, Ukraine should de-mine their ports, only after that can ships travel in the region. The delivery of grains and cereals from Russia, western countries look at this as a catastrophe, but the share of Ukrainian grain in the international market is just one percent, so the food security crisis isn’t actually stemming from this war, we cannot say this situation will cause a food crisis. German estimates put Ukraine’s wheat production at 11.5% of the global market. “There is a real global food crisis,” said Çavuşoğlu, who also pointed to a crisis in the global fertiliser trade. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Turkish maritime and military experts have deactivated at least three mines that drifted down from the Black Sea into the Bosphorus strait, disrupting global shipping traffic. Floating mines have also been detected and defused off the coast of Romania, which borders the Black Sea. In March, Russian intelligence service the FSB claimed at least 420 naval mines were drifting in the Black Sea following a storm, and claimed the mines were set by the Ukrainian side. The Ukrainians have dismissed this as disinformation, and say that Russia is likely responsible for mining the Black Sea. “The efforts of my Turkish counterpart are of vital importance, they are doing their best to make sure the vessels and ships can be removed from the ports,” said Lavrov, in reference to a Turkish initiative to accompany ships crossing the Black Sea holding vital Ukrainian grain supplies. On our side there are no obstacles or challenges, the Russian Federation is not creating any obstacles for the passage of ships or vessels, we are not preventing anything. We are opening corridors for grain transportation and working on that with our Turkish friends. Zelensky has said he’s against the demining process...so the ball is in their court, the problem doesn’t lay with us in that regard. Asked by a reporter about efforts to extract grain from the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv, where Russia recently attacked the city including striking grain silos, Lavrov replied: Putin has said himself that we are ready to make sure those ports are operating safely and security, if the Ukrainians are cleaning and cleansing their ports from mines we will not use abuse our military powers and will make sure ships depart from those ports safely and securely. The press conference ended abruptly following a question by a Ukrainian television reporter, who asked Lavrov about Russian efforts to reportedly resell plundered Ukrainian wheat to countries facing food shortages. “We are not presenting any obstacles whatsoever for the transport of wheat, Zelenskiy should give order to make sure ships depart from the region,” he said, before walking away from the lectern. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has been speaking to reporters at his regular briefing, where he restated that any meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents must be “productive and well prepared”. Peskov said: Our position is well known. Any meeting at the highest level must be productive and well prepared. The Kremlin also spoke about the ongoing food crisis and said western sanctions must be lifted in order for Russian grain to be delivered to international markets. No “substantive discussions” about lifting sanctions were ongoing, Peskov said. He also said there are no grounds for Russia to default on its debts, as the country struggles to make interest payments to bondholders. Peskov blamed the sanctions, which have seen almost half of the country’s foreign currency reserves frozen, for “pushing Russia into an artificial man-made debt default”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke in a phone call and agreed that everything needed to be done to get Ukraine’s grain exports out of the country, especially by sea routes, a German government spokesperson said. Scholz spoke about his 28 May phone call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to Zelenskiy, the spokesperson added. Zelenskiy tweeted that he raised the issue of Russia’s treatment of prisoners of war as well as EU integration of Ukraine. Ukraine has filed eight more war crimes cases to court, according to its prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. The eight cases are in addition to the three sentences already handed down to Russian soldiers, she said. Venediktova said on television: Every day we see an increase (in investigations). We are talking about people who didn’t just come as military combatants … but also came to rape, kill civilians, loot, humiliate and so on. In May, 21-year-old sergeant Vadim Shishimarin was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. So far, Ukraine has opened more than 16,000 investigations into possible war crimes by the Russian army since the conflict began, Venediktova added. Kyiv’s top prosecutor has previously said that the list of suspects includes “top military, politicians and propaganda agents of Russia” and that “200 to 300 new cases of war crimes are added every day”. Many of the alleged war crimes have been identified in the eastern Donbas region, and include the possible forcible transfer of adults and children to Russia, and the torture and killing of civilians. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes while it carries out what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Sievierodonestk but Moscow’s forces do not control the frontline eastern city, regional officials say. Russian forces have seized residential quarters of the key eastern city and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on its outskirts and the nearby towns, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said “Nobody is going to surrender Sievierodonetsk”. He said that the regional centre of Luhansk is seeing the most intense fighting, saying: “Fierce battles are taking place in Sievierodonetsk, our defenders are fighting for every inch of the city.” The Russian ministry of defence claims that “the Ukrainian group in the Donbas suffers significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment”. Russia claims to have shot down two MiG-29 aircraft and a Mi-8 helicopter in the Mykolaiv region, and also 11 unmanned drones in the last 24 hours. The UK Ministry of Defence has said it is unlikely that either side has gained significant ground in the last 24 hours. Dozens of radiation detectors around the Chornobyl nuclear power plant have started transmitting radiation data for the first time since Russia invaded, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Radiation levels in the area surrounding Ukraine’s Chornobyl nuclear power plant are now back to normal after detectors came back online today, according to the UN nuclear watchdog. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the onus was on Ukraine to solve the problem of resuming grain shipments. Lavrov said no action was required on the Russian side. “We state daily that we’re ready to guarantee the safety of vessels leaving Ukrainian ports and heading for the Bosphorus gulf. To solve the problem, the only thing needed is for the Ukrainians to let vessels out of their ports, either by demining them or by marking out safe corridors.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he “simply cannot see the preconditions for ending the war” in an interview with the Financial Times. Victory meant restoring “all” of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea – annexed by Russia in 2014 – and separatist-held areas, he suggested. “We have to achieve a full de-occupation of our entire territory,” Zelenskiy said. Ukraine is launching a ‘Book of Executioners’, a system to collate evidence of war crimes Kyiv says were committed during Russia’s occupation, Zelenskiy said yesterday. Ukrainian prosecutors say they have registered more than 12,000 alleged war crimes involving more than 600 suspects since the Kremlin started its invasion on 24 February. Russia has handed over to Kyiv the bodies of 210 Ukrainian fighters, most of whom died defending the city of Mariupol from Russian forces at a vast steel works, the Ukrainian military confirmed. More than 1,000 Ukrainian servicemen and foreign mercenaries, who had surrendered in Mariupol, have been transferred to Russia for an investigation there, a law enforcement source told Russian state-owned news agency, Tass. Vladimir Rogov, part of the Russian-imposed administration in occupied Zaporizhzhia in the south of Ukraine, has said a referendum will be held this year. He is quoted as saying “The wording of the questions will be presented in the near future. The vast majority of residents of our region want to return to their native harbour as soon as possible and become part of greater Russia.” Norway has donated 22 self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, including spare parts, ammunition and other gear, the Norwegian defence ministry said. Laurence Boone, the chief economist at the Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) has said the world economy was paying a “hefty price” for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She said “As Russia and Ukraine are large commodity exporters, the war has sent energy and food prices soaring, making life much harder for many people across the world.” Russian proxy fighters in east Ukraine have said they are opening a trial against two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who were captured fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. The two men, who are serving in the Ukrainian military, and Ibrahim Saadun, a captive from Morocco, were shown sitting in a courtroom cage reserved for defendants in a video released on pro-Russian social media channels on Tuesday. The European Union needs to build warehouses and extend railway tracks across the Ukrainian border to help Kyiv in its attempts to move more grain out of the country to those who need it, says the country’s trade representative. Ukraine will not be able to export more than 2m tonnes of grain a month, around a third of pre-war levels, as long as its main trade routes through its Black Sea ports remain blockaded by Russia, said Taras Kachka. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the onus was on Ukraine to solve the problem of resuming grain shipments by de-mining its ports. Speaking in Ankara, where he was visiting his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Lavrov said no action was required on the Russian side because it had already made the necessary commitments. “We state daily that we’re ready to guarantee the safety of vessels leaving Ukrainian ports and heading for the Bosphorus gulf. We’re ready to do that in cooperation with our Turkish colleagues.” “To solve the problem, the only thing needed is for the Ukrainians to let vessels out of their ports, either by de-mining them or by marking out safe corridors, nothing more is required.” Reuters reports Çavuşoğlu said a UN plan to open a corridor to restart Ukrainian grain exports was reasonable and requires more talks with all sides to ensure ships would be safe. Ukraine has accused Russia of the theft of its grain, which it has begun exporting out of ports that have fallen under occupation since Russia started its latest invasion of Ukraine in February. Laurence Boone, the chief economist at the Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), has said the world economy was paying a “hefty price” for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “A humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, leaving thousands dead, forcing millions of refugees to flee their homes and threatening an economic recovery that was under way after two years of the pandemic,” she said. “As Russia and Ukraine are large commodity exporters, the war has sent energy and food prices soaring, making life much harder for many people across the world.” Boone said the OECD had cut its global growth forecast for 2022 from 4.5% to 3%, while inflation in the organisation’s 38 wealthy-country members would average almost 9% – double the forecast in last December’s economic outlook. Growth in 2023 is expected to be 2.8%, down from the 3.2% forecast six months ago. Read more from our economics editor Larry Elliott here: UK to be major economy worst hit by Ukraine war, says OECD During that press conference in Ankara, Reuters reports Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said he hoped the situation with exporting grain could be resolved, provided Kyiv de-mines the waters around Ukraine’s ports. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in in Ankara, Turkey today, and is giving a press conference with his counterpart for the host nation, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. Some of the key lines reported so far by Reuters: Lavrov has said peace talks have to re-open before there could be any possible meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Lavrov also asserted that what he termed “Russia’s special military operation” is going to plan. Cavusoglu said a UN plan to open a corridor to restart Ukrainian grain exports was reasonable and requires more talks with all sides to ensure ships would be safe. Cavusoglu said their meeting was fruitful, including a will to return to negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv for a possible ceasefire. Turkey hosted face-to-face talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives in the earliest stages of the war. The Russian ministry of defence has issued its operational briefing for the day. As ever, the claims within it have not been independently verified. The ministry claims that “the Ukrainian group in the Donbas suffers significant losses in manpower, weapons and military equipment.” Russia claims to have shot down two MiG-29 aircraft and a Mi-8 helicopter in the Mykolaiv region, and also 11 unmanned drones. It also say that “high-precision air-launched missiles in the Kharkov region hit an armoured plant, in the workshops of which the repair and restoration of tanks and other armoured vehicles of the armed forces of Ukraine was carried out.” Russia also claims to have caused at least 480 casualties overnight. As the battle continues for Sievierodonetsk, there is a flurry of claim and counterclaim about events on the ground. Rodion Miroshnik has posted an update to Telegram of what he says is happening in the city. Miroshnik is the ambassador to Russia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic. He writes: Ukrainian formations retain control over only a small part of the Sievierodonetsk chemical plant AZOT. Ukrainian militants are firing indiscriminately at the quarters adjacent to the enterprise. Snipers are at work. The circle of allied troops around the remaining group is narrowing. According to information from the field, the Sievierodonetsk airport has already been cleared of Ukrainian formations. The shelling that was carried out from there stopped. The remaining militants are hiding in forest plantations around the airport. Allied forces are searching for and clearing them. This is how the “powerful counter-offensive” promised by Kyiv looks like in reality. None of Miroshnik’s claims have been independently verified. Russia is the only UN member to recognise the Luhansk People’s Republic as an entity. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency is carrying some quotes from Vladimir Rogov, who is part of the Russian-imposed administration in occupied Zaporizhzhia in the south of Ukraine. He told the agency that there is progress towards holding a referendum on the region being annexed by Russia. RIA Novosti quotes him saying: The referendum will be held this year. Preparations will take several months. The wording of the questions will be presented in the near future. The vast majority of residents of our region want to return to their native harbour as soon as possible and become part of greater Russia. Rogov also said that it was planned to restore freight and passenger rail links with Crimea from Zaporizhzhia. These services were stopped eight years ago when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted to Telegram to say that “Nobody is going to surrender Sievierodonetsk”. He writes that the regional centre of Luhansk is seeing the most intense fighting, saying: “Fierce battles are taking place in Sievierodonetsk, our defenders are fighting for every inch of the city.” In his latest message he claims Russians “do NOT control the Lysychansk-Bakhmut route, but fire heavily. We do not use this road, it is too dangerous”. Haidai writes: The plans of the racists have not changed, they ‘want’ to capture Sievierodonetsk and the ‘way of life’ by 10 June. All the racist forces have been thrown into this. In addition, the orcs [slang term for Russian forces] again plan to cross the Seversky Donets River to create a bridgehead for the offensive. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv in western Ukraine, has said in his morning update on Telegram that overnight the region experienced one air alarm over the threat of a cruise missile strike, but “the danger did not come true” He said that yesterday 405 internally displaced people arrived in the region by evacuation trains, and that “everything is calm in Lviv region”. The Tass news agency is reporting a statement from the Russian Embassy in the United States which is highly critical of the US transfer of weaponry and supplies to Ukraine – claiming it is irresponsible. It states: The [Biden] administration is also demonstrating irresponsibility regarding the transfer of long-range artillery systems to Ukraine. The main risk is an escalation of the conflict if the armed forces of Ukraine use these systems to strike at the territory of the Russian Federation. This is fraught with unpredictable consequences. In addition, Washington ignores the obvious threat of putting modern high-precision weapons into the hands of radical nationalists, terrorists and bandit formations not only on the territory of Ukraine, but also abroad. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog now from my colleague Samantha Lock. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukraine is launching a ‘Book of Executioners’, a system to collate evidence of war crimes Kyiv says were committed during Russia’s occupation, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. Ukrainian prosecutors say they have registered more than 12,000 alleged war crimes involving more than 600 suspects since the Kremlin started its invasion on 24 February. Next week, a special publication is to be launched - ‘The Book of Executioners’ - an information system to collect confirmation of data about war criminals, criminals from the Russian army,” Zelenskiy said in a video address. Zelenskiy said this would be a key element in bringing to account Russian servicemen who have committed what Ukrainian authorities have described as murders, rape and looting. “These are concrete facts about concrete individuals guilty of concrete cruel crimes against Ukrainians,” Zelenskiy said. He cited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where investigators found what they say is evidence of mass executions. Norway has donated 22 self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, including spare parts, ammunition and other gear, the Norwegian defence ministry said. “The Norwegian government has waited to publicly announce the donation for security reasons. Future donations may not be announced or commented upon,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. With neither side prevailing on the battlefield, there seems little prospect of negotiations. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he “simply cannot see the preconditions for ending the war” in an interview with the Financial Times. Victory meant restoring “all” of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea – annexed by Russia in 2014 – and separatist-held areas, he suggested. “We have to achieve a full de-occupation of our entire territory,” Zelenskiy said by video link at an event hosted by the newspaper on Tuesday. Most observers in Kyiv now expect the war to continue through the summer until at least the end of the year. China has spoken against third parties’ attempts to “drag countries of the region into the conflict of world powers”, Russian state-owned media agency Tass reports. The outlet quoted China’s foreign minister Wang Yi as saying during his meeting with Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in the city of Nur-Sultan on Tuesday: China has always played a constructive role in the assistance to peaceful talks. It is necessary under the present-day situation to be aware of third parties’ attempts to drag countries of the region into the conflict of world powers and to avoid their threats to take a certain side. China will never be pursuing geopolitical interests in Central Asia and will also not permit outer powers to initiate chaos in this region.” A stalemate with Russia is “not an option”, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, reiterating a plea for foreign help in the war. Ukraine’s fierce resistance of Russia’s invasion led to a stalemate in parts of the country, with Moscow re-focussing its forces in the east. In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper on Tuesday, he said: Victory must be achieved on the battlefield. We are inferior in terms of equipment and therefore we are not capable of advancing. We are going to suffer more losses and people are my priority.” Asked what Ukraine would consider a victory, Zelenskiy said restoring the borders Ukraine controlled before Russia’s invasion on 24 February would be “a serious temporary victory”. But he said the ultimate aim was the “full de-occupation of our entire territory”. Asked about talks with Russia, which have been suspended since late March, Zelenskiy said he had not changed his position, adding that war should be ended at the negotiating table. He said he was ready for direct talks with Vladimir Putin, adding that there was “nobody else to talk to” but the Russian president. According to the latest Ukrainian military operational report, Ukraine is holding back the Russian assault on its key eastern city. Our warriors successfully hold back the assault in the city of Sievierodonetsk, the combat is ongoing.” An attempt to capture the nearby towns of Toshkivka and Ustinivka was also unsuccessful, according to the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. Russian forces have been bombarding Ukrainian positions with intense artillery barrages, airstrikes and non-stop street-by-street fighting, according to the regional governor of Luhansk province. Serhiy Haidai said earlier this week that tough street battles were continuing with varying degrees of success. “The situation constantly changes, but the Ukrainians are repelling attacks,” he said. Between 10,000 and 11,000 civilians remain in the city. Dozens of radiation detectors around the Chornobyl nuclear power plant have started transmitting radiation data for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA said the radiation monitoring network in the area stopped functioning when Russian forces occupied the Chornobyl site in February and held it for five weeks before withdrawing on March 31. Radiation levels in the area surrounding Ukraine’s Chornobyl nuclear power plant are now back to normal after detectors came back online today, according to the UN nuclear watchdog. Most of the 39 detectors sending data from the Exclusion Zone ... are now visible on the IRMIS (International Radiation Monitoring Information System) map. The measurements received so far indicated radiation levels in line with those measured before the conflict.” “The resumption of radiation data transmission from the Exclusion Zone is a very positive step forward for nuclear safety and security in Ukraine,” the agency’s Director General Rafael Grossi said in the statement. “It ends a long period of virtual information blackout that created much uncertainty about the radiation situation in the area, especially when it was under Russian occupation,” the agency’s director general Rafael Grossi said in the statement. Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine to be sent across our newswires today. Russia continues to attempt assaults against Sievierodonetsk although Ukrainian defences are holding, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Though it is unlikely that either side has gained significant ground in the last 24 hours, the department added. Regarding the unfolding situation in the eastern frontline city of Sievierodonetsk, the full report, released just after 6am BST, reads: Russia continues to attempt assaults against the Sieverodonetsk pocket from three directions although Ukrainian defences are holding. It is unlikely that either side has gained significant ground in the last 24 hours. While Russia is concentrating its offensive on the central Donbas sector, it has remained on the defensive on its flanks.” Referring to Ukraine’s south-western Kherson region, British intelligence said Ukrainian forces have recently achieved some success through counterattacks, including regaining a foothold on the eastern bank of the Ingulets River. With the frontage of the occupied zone stretching for over 500km, both Russia and Ukraine face similar challenges in maintaining a defensive line while freeing up capable combat units for offensive operations. In the occupied Kherson region, Russia is forcibly aligning its administration with that of the Russian Federation by introducing the Russian rouble as legal tender and employing Russian teachers to introduce the Russian curriculum and language to schools. Russia will highly likely claim its occupation of Kherson as evidence of delivering improved governance and living standards to the Ukrainian people.” Russia has handed over to Kyiv the bodies of 210 Ukrainian fighters, most of whom died defending the city of Mariupol from Russian forces at a vast steel works, the Ukrainian military confirmed. Ukraine’s defence intelligence directorate issued a statement late on Tuesday: The process of returning the bodies of the fallen defenders of Mariupol is under way. To date, 210 of our troops have been returned – most of them are heroic defenders of Azovsta. Work continues on bringing home all of the captured Ukrainian defender.” More than 1,000 Ukrainian servicemen and foreign mercenaries, who had surrendered in Mariupol, have been transferred to Russia for an investigation there, a law enforcement source told Russian state-owned news agency, Tass. More Ukrainian prisoners of war will be taken to Russia “later on”, the outlet cited a the Russian law enforcement source as saying. Over 1,000 people from Azovstal have been transferred to Russia. Law enforcement officers are working with them. Investigators also plan to send a number of other captives to Russia in the future, following a series of face-to-face confrontations.” Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy previously said he thought more than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - who also include border guards, police and territorial defence - were being held by Russia. Kyiv is seeking the handover of all the estimated defenders in a prisoner swap, but Russian lawmakers have demanded that some of the soldiers be put on trial The Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer previously reported that more than 900 Ukrainian troops who had been trapped at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steel plant, where Ukrainian forces held out for weeks, had been sent to a prison colony on Russian-controlled territory within Ukraine. Some residents who managed to escape are also saying they were given no choice but to travel to Russia in what Kyiv regards as “deportations”, Agence France-Presse added. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest news for the next few hours. Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold their ground in bloody street-to-street fighting in the eastern frontline city of Sievierodonetsk as president Zelenskiy calls for a “full de-occupation” of Ukrainian territory. If you’re just waking up, or just dropping in to find the latest information, here’s a summary of the main points you might have missed: Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Sievierodonestk but Moscow’s forces do not control the frontline eastern city, regional officials say. Russian forces have seized residential quarters of the key eastern city and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on its outskirts and the nearby towns, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said. The Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, conceded that Russian forces control the industrial outskirts of the city. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed significant damage in Sievierodonetsk and nearby Rubizhne. Some 800 civilians have taken refuge in a chemical factory in Sievierodonetsk, according to a lawyer for Dmytro Firtash, whose company owns the facility. “These 800 civilians include around 200 out of the plant’s 3,000 employees and approximately 600 inhabitants of the city of Sievierodonetsk,” Lanny J. Davis, a US lawyer, noted in a statement published on the company website. More than 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered in the southern port city of Mariupol have been transferred to Russia, according to Russian state-owned news agency, Tass. More Ukrainian prisoners of war will be taken to Russia “later on”, the outlet cited a Russian law enforcement source as saying. Some residents who managed to escape are saying they were given no choice but to travel to Russia in what Kyiv regards as “deportations”, Agence France-Presse added. A stalemate with Russia is “not an option”, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, reiterating a plea for foreign help in the war. “Victory must be achieved on the battlefield,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday, adding that he “simply cannot see the preconditions for ending the war”. Victory meant restoring “all” of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea – annexed by Russia in 2014 – and separatist-held areas, he suggested. Russian proxy fighters in east Ukraine have said they are opening a trial against two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who were captured fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. The two men, who are serving in the Ukrainian military, and Ibrahim Saadun, a captive from Morocco, were shown sitting in a courtroom cage reserved for defendants in a video released on pro-Russian social media channels on Tuesday. Ukraine’s first deputy minister of agrarian policy and food, Taras Vysotskyi, said it would take six months to clear the coast of Russian and Ukrainian mines. His remarks dealt a blow to a proposal under discussion where ships leaving Ukrainian ports would be given safe escort by Turkish naval vessels. The European Union needs to build warehouses and extend railway tracks across the Ukrainian border to help Kyiv in its attempts to move more grain out of the country to those who need it, says the country’s trade representative. Ukraine will not be able to export more than 2m tonnes of grain a month, around a third of pre-war levels, as long as its main trade routes through its Black Sea ports remain blockaded by Russia, said Taras Kachka. The World Bank has approved $1.49bn of additional financing for Ukraine to help pay wages for government and social workers, expanding the bank’s total pledged support for Kyiv to over $4 billion. The latest round of funding is supported by financing guarantees from Britain, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Latvia. Russia is ramping up oil exports from its major eastern port of Kozmino as it aims to offset the impact of EU sanctions with the surging demand from Asian buyers. Sources told Reuters that Russia has already increased the amount of crude pumped to Kozmino on its main Asian oil route, the East Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline, by 70,000 barrels per day (bpd). The United States Treasury Department has banned US money managers from buying any Russian debt or stocks in secondary markets, on top of its existing ban on new-issue purchases, in its latest sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Former German chancellor Angela Merkel said she tried to prevent the situation in Ukraine and has no regrets while in office. “It’s a great sadness that it didn’t work out, but I don’t blame myself for not trying,” Merkel said about talking to Vladimir Putin during a televised interview on Tuesday. Moscow’s Chief Rabbi has reportedly fled Russia, after coming under pressure to support Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Journalist Avital Chizhik-Goldschmidt tweeted late on Tuesday: “Can finally share that my in-laws, Moscow Chief Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt and Rebbetzin Dara Goldschmidt, have been put under pressure by authorities to publicly support the ‘special operation’ in Ukraine — and refused.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/13/xr-scientists-glue-hands-to-business-department-in-london-climate-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-13T15:16:52Z","webTitle":"XR scientists glue hands to business department in London climate protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/xr-scientists-glue-hands-to-business-department-in-london-climate-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/13/xr-scientists-glue-hands-to-business-department-in-london-climate-protest","fields":{"headline":"XR scientists glue hands to business department in London climate protest","bodyText":"Twenty-five scientists have pasted pages of scientific papers to the windows of the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and glued their hands to the glass to highlight the climate science they said the government was ignoring. The scientists, affiliated with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion, arrived at the department’s building at 1 Victoria Street, Westminster, London, just after 11am. Doctors and health professionals staged a decoy action to give them space to get into position. The action came a week after the government published a new energy strategy that promised to continue the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas, failed to set targets for onshore wind, and gave nuclear power a central role. Dr Aaron Thierry, a 36-year-old ecologist who had his hand glued to the window of BEIS, said: “I really wish I was not here, but also I’m really glad that I’m here with all these scientists who know what’s right. “Last week the world’s scientists released a report that sounded the final alarm for the planet. It said we must end our addiction to fossil fuels now. The UK government’s response a few days later was to announce it will increase its exploration for oil and gas with the intention of extracting every last drop. “Science tells us that this approach will condemn our civilisations to destruction. We will not stand by and let this happen. Scientists have been sounding the alarm for decades but have been ignored by governments.” Richard Ecclestone, a former inspector with Devon and Cornwall police who was acting as legal observer of the protest for XR, said the scientists had decided on the action because of the energy strategy. “They put this action together to draw the attention of the department for business, to remind them of what the science is,” he said. “They’ve taken quotes from recent scientific reports saying basically there’s irrefutable evidence now that we cannot continue to search for and exploit oil and gas reserves, or that will mean death.” Dr Charlie Gardner, 43, a conservation scientist and associate senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: “At both the domestic and international policy level, there are very powerful actors who don’t want our society to decarbonise. “There are people who are very wealthy and powerful from the way that the world is set up now and they don’t want that to change, they don’t want to decarbonise because that will limit their opportunity to generate money from fossil fuels. “As a result we have government departments making decisions that will lead us to calamity, and as a scientist I know what impacts this has, I can see that coming, and I can’t be passive, I can’t just let that happen. I need to act.” At least 10 scientists were arrested after spray-painting extinction symbols in the glass facade of the BEIS building. Among them was Prof Colin Davis, the chair in cognitive psychology at Bristol university. Gardner said they had escalated the protest with spray-painting in an effort to provoke the police into making arrests. “Colin is a professor of psychology, and I can’t speak for him but his work is about how to influence people and I believe it is his understanding of how to influence the public, how to bring about social change, his professional understanding [that] has led him to believe this is the most powerful action he can take,” Gardner said. The Guardian has contacted the Metropolitan police for more details of arrests linked to the protest. A BEIS spokesperson said: “We are gradually driving down demand for oil and gas, but we cannot have a cliff edge by turning off our domestic source overnight. Doing so would put our energy security, British jobs and industries at risk and simply increase foreign imports, not reduce demand. Our British energy security strategy sets out a long-term plan to ramp up cheap renewables as we transition away from expensive fossil fuels.” South of the river, other supporters of XR had ended a mass march by surrounding the buildings that house the UK headquarters of the oil and gas company Shell. Several had managed to get inside and glue themselves and several XR flyers to the reception desk. Others were glued to the floor in the private office complex surrounding the site. XR said it was demanding a meeting with Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive. Outside, about 100 people from XR’s whistleblowing platform, TruthTeller, each held up a placard with the name of an individual Shell employee and the words “Please join us”. Chloe Naldrett, 42, a theatre producer from Bristol, was glued by her hand to the floor just outside the revolving doors to the Shell reception, where she was telling the site’s security manager why she was refusing to leave. The science, she told him, “said no more fossil fuels. No more fossil fuels!” Naldrett told the Guardian: “We’re here outside Shell because Shell have absolutely no intention of stopping investing in fossil fuels … They currently have plans to expand their fossil fuel business by 20% for the next few decades. And that, for me, is a death sentence for my children. “I’m here as a mother doing the only thing that I feel I can do … I’m now taking direct action, out of a place of desperation really, because what else can I do for them?” One XR protester had managed to infiltrate the eighth floor of the Shell building. In a video shot inside the building and circulated to journalists by XR, Andy Smith said: “I’m taking this action to basically highlight Shell’s aggressive approach to extracting oil in foreign countries. The people who live in those countries don’t want you there, Shell; just like you don’t want me in your building.” The protests were part of a week of civil disobedience by XR in London. The environmental protest group, which called on supporters to take a week off work to take part, began its “rebellion” on Saturday with blockades in the West End, and on Sunday supporters blocked bridges over the Thames."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/oct/30/japan-ports-swamped-by-pumice-spewed-from-undersea-volcano","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-30T04:54:58Z","webTitle":"Japan ports swamped by pumice spewed from undersea volcano ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/30/japan-ports-swamped-by-pumice-spewed-from-undersea-volcano","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/oct/30/japan-ports-swamped-by-pumice-spewed-from-undersea-volcano","fields":{"headline":"Japan ports swamped by pumice spewed from undersea volcano ","bodyText":"Vast amounts of pumice pebbles, spewed out months ago by an undersea volcano, have clogged dozens of ports and damaged fishing boats along Japan’s southernmost coastlines. Deputy chief cabinet secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said on Friday that the pumice had so far affected 11 ports on Okinawa and 19 others in the Kagoshima prefecture, on Japan’s southernmost island of Kyushu, and forced the central government to establish a disaster recovery task force. About 40 fishing boats have been damaged, including six that were unable to move, and ferry services connecting remote islands in Okinawa and Kagoshima have been temporarily suspended. Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki said there had been a “huge impact on the fisheries and tourism industries as well as the environment” and that the problem must be tackled quickly. The clean-up operation has begun – in one port in the village of Kunigami on the northern tip of Okinawa’s main island, about about 10 tonnes of pumice were reportedly being removed every day by huge diggers, with more washing ashore. One prefectural government official was quoted as saying the “unprecedented” operation could take two to three weeks to complete. “We have no choice but to proceed with the cleanup work by trial and error,” Kyodo News quoted the official as saying. “We will think about how to dispose of the pumice stones after checking safety aspects.” The grey pebbles came from the Fukutokuokanoba undersea volcano, hundreds of kilometres away in the Ogasawara island chain, which erupted in mid-August. The islands lie about 1,000km (600 miles) south of Tokyo. The Japanese Coast Guard distributed a map showing the drift pattern of the pumice and warned vessels in the area to keep a close eye to avoid their engine systems becoming clogged by the pebbles. One of its own patrol vessels became stranded during training exercises on Saturday after encountering the pebbles off the coast of Okinawa. Isozaki warned that the pebbles were moving north and could affect entire Japanese coasts. “Seeing as the pumice on the sea surface could spread to a wide area of Japan, we will continue to deal with the matter carefully,” he said. The government task force, at its first meeting late on Thursday, decided to provide support for local municipalities as a disaster recovery project, and that the damage to fishing industries will be covered by insurance, Isozaki said. The total cost of the disaster is still unknown. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that about 750 fishing boats had been unable to leave port in Okinawa due to concerns about engine trouble, and that about 150 Indian mackerel, which were being farmed locally, died after apparently swallowing pumice. The Nuclear Regulation Authority also watches the pebble movements to avoid any impact on Japan’s coastal nuclear power plants.

Has that message been heard? The second of four parts of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report, the latest comprehensive review of our knowledge of the climate crisis, was termed by some scientists “the bleakest warning yet”. Half of the world’s people are “highly vulnerable” to serious impacts from the climate crisis, a billion people in coastal areas face inundation, mass die-offs of species including trees and coral have already begun, and close to a tenth of the world’s farmland is set to become unsuitable for agriculture. By any standards, these are stark and brutal findings. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said: “I have seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like this. Today’s IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering, and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.” But the report has been overshadowed, understandably, by the war in Ukraine, and has received less policymaker and media attention than it deserved. That does not mean the IPCC report will be ignored. Governments are working on their responses to the scientists’ warnings, and later this year at the next UN climate summit, Cop27, they are obliged to lay out their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Will Cop27 be affected by the war in Ukraine? Cop27 is to be held this November in Egypt, a country that has forged strong diplomatic and economic ties with Russia in the recent past. Any meetings among the G20 major economies will also take place under the shadow of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, insiders point out that the climate negotiations have gone on for 30 years, despite wars and other conflicts among UN nations. Climate diplomats are practised at keeping other geopolitical tensions at least partly at bay. Perhaps of even greater relevance to the climate crisis will be the decisions governments make on energy policy in response to the Ukraine war. This week, the International Energy Agency urged a suite of actions – from households turning down their thermostats by 1C to windfall taxes on energy companies and the rapid construction of new wind and solar power generation – that could reduce the EU’s reliance on Russian gas by a third or more. The other options open to policymakers if Vladimir Putin turns off gas supplies to Europe would include a return to coal-fired power generation, the dirtiest form of fossil fuel. The choices that governments make now, ahead of next winter, will have profound consequences for the climate crisis. What actions could and should governments take as a direct result of the IPCC report? One of the key messages of the IPCC working group 2 report is that climate change is already occurring, all over the world. Even if we succeed in limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C, the limit countries agreed to target at Cop26 in Glasgow last November, we will still face more extreme weather, droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises. The IPCC made clear that countries must seek to adapt now to these changes, to stave off the worst damage. Adaptation can mean building seawalls and river barriers, planting trees on hillsides to stop landslips amid floods, conserving or regrowing mangrove swamps to absorb the impact of coastal storm surges, painting roofs white to reflect the sun’s heat, or making buildings and built infrastructure such as telecommunications networks, roads and railways more resilient to extreme weather. Far too little effort has gone into adaptation up to now, the IPCC found. Rich countries promised last year at Cop26 to double their funding for adaptation in the poor world, but nearly all countries are still badly prepared. Will adaptation be enough? No. There are “hard limits” to adaptation, the IPCC made clear: the impacts of temperatures rising unchecked would overcome all our efforts to adjust. Flood barriers may hold back a river in spate today, but as the icecaps and glaciers melt, as heatwaves take hold, and as droughts threaten agriculture, we will face too many threats and they will grow too severe for any adaptation effort to allow life to proceed as normal. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions urgently, to stop temperatures rising further, must still be the priority, according to the IPCC. How should that be done? Early next month, the IPCC will release the third part of its four-part assessment, by working group 3, covering “mitigation” – the ways in which countries can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, alternatives to fossil fuels such as nuclear power, and novel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Working group 3 will set out pathways and policy choices governments could take to reach the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C, including some of the likely costs and economic benefits of those choices. After that, a “synthesis report” drawing together all three parts of the IPCC’s sixth assessment will be published in October, for policymakers to discuss at Cop27."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/24/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidential-election-say-projected-results","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-25T06:08:01Z","webTitle":"Victorious Macron vows to unite France after fending off Le Pen threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidential-election-say-projected-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/24/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidential-election-say-projected-results","fields":{"headline":"Victorious Macron vows to unite France after fending off Le Pen threat","bodyText":"The pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron has vowed to unite a divided France after winning a second term as French president in a decisive victory against the far-right’s Marine Le Pen, who nonetheless won more than 13 million votes in a historic high for her anti-immigration party. Macron became the first French leader to win re-election for 20 years, scoring 58.54% to Le Pen’s 41.46%. Addressing a victory rally at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, where his supporters waved French and European flags, Macron vowed to respond “efficiently” to the “anger and disagreement” of voters who chose the far right. “I know that a number of French people have voted for me today, not to support my ideas but to stop the ideas of the far right,” he said and called on supporters to be “kind and respectful” to others, because the country was riven by “so much doubt, so much division”. He added: “I’m not the candidate of one camp any more, but the president of all of us.” Macron beat Le Pen with a lower margin than the 66% he won against her in 2017. Turnout was also lower than five years ago, with abstention estimated at a record 28%. Le Pen succeeded in delivering the far right its biggest-ever score in a French presidential election, after campaigning on the cost of living crisis, and promising a ban on the Muslim headscarf in public places as well as nationalist measures to give priority to native-French people over others for jobs, housing, benefits and healthcare – policies Macron had criticised as “racist” and “divisive”. Le Pen called her score “a shining victory in itself”, adding: “The ideas we represent are reaching new heights.” Macron’s victory was swiftly welcomed by EU leaders after a campaign the French president had described in its final days as a “battle for Europe” against the Eurosceptic Le Pen. The European Council president Charles Michel tweeted: “Bravo Emmanuel. In this turbulent period, we need a solid Europe and a France totally committed to a more sovereign and more strategic European Union.” The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “I am delighted to be able to continue our excellent cooperation.” The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said French voters had delivered “a strong message in favour of Europe”. Macron’s first foreign trip as president is expected to be to Berlin to see Scholz. Several hundred demonstrators from ultra-left groups took to the streets in some French cities to protest against Macron’s re-election and Le Pen’s score. Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris, Lyon and the western city of Rennes. There was a large police presence in central Paris hours after the election win, after police opened fire on a car, killing two people inside, according to local reports. The vehicle was reportedly driving against the flow of traffic on the Pont Neuf when it sped towards the officers. An investigation has been launched into “attempted voluntary manslaughter on persons in charge of public authority”, Agence France-Presse reported. It is not known if the incident was linked to the election result. ‘President of the rich’ During a frantic final two weeks’ campaigning, Macron had travelled to town squares across France to shake off what he felt was the unjustly persistent tag of a being an aloof “president of the rich”. He had promised to dedicate the next five years to restoring France to full employment, arguing that his policies such as loosening French labour laws had already succeeded in creating jobs and that he would definitively put an end to the country’s decades of mass unemployment. But although Macron has promised his own swift new package of laws to address the cost of living crisis and tempered his time frame for raising the retirement age, he ultimately focused far less on his own manifesto in the final days and more on stopping what he called the “unthinkable”: the far-right, anti-immigration Le Pen taking the helm in France, the eurozone’s second biggest economy and a nuclear power. Macron will use his win to bolster his push for an increased EU defence project, closer collaboration on immigration and more regulation to counter the weight of giant tech platforms such as Google. France holds the rotating European Council presidency until the end of June. Macron had framed the choice between himself and Le Pen as “a referendum on Europe, ecology and secularism” and said the far-right leader’s demands for EU treaty change would have led to France being pushed out of the bloc. He called her a “climate sceptic” and said her plan to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public places, including the street, would breach the French constitution and religious liberties, and spark “a civil war”. Macron accused Le Pen of being financially “dependent” on Vladimir Putin’s Russia after she took out a Russian loan for her party in 2014, and said her ties to the Kremlin meant she would have been a dangerous choice at the time of war in Ukraine. Le Pen, in turn, had said that “fear was the only argument he had left”. But Macron knew that, after campaigning to stop Le Pen, his support at the ballot box would reflect as much the rejection of the far right as support for his own programme. “If the French put their trust in me on April 24, I know full well … that there will be a part of the people who voted for me who would have done it to block the Front National,” he had told the TV programme Quotidien, deliberately using the former name for Le Pen’s party, now renamed the National Rally. “And so it won’t mean they have given me a blank cheque and that they support and find brilliant every point of my programme.” A significant number of the 7.7 million first-round voters for the radical left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who narrowly missed reaching the final, had said they felt torn over abstaining or voting to keep out Le Pen. Macron had leaned to the left in the final days to try to court Mélenchon voters, promising to speed up measures against climate breakdown and expand environmental policy. His first task is to appoint a new prime minister, who he promised would be specifically devoted to addressing the climate crisis. The focus will now shift to the parliamentary elections in June, where Macron will seek to get a majority for his centrist grouping, possibly expanding alliances with the right. He had promised a “big new political movement” and could go as far as rebranding his party, La République En Marche. Both Le Pen and Mélenchon are seeking to increase how many lawmakers their parties have. For his first step, Macron has promised to introduce a package of measures to ease the pressure of the cost of living crisis before summer, including continuing caps on gas and energy prices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/23/wednesday-briefing-mariupol-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T06:29:57Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: 100,000 trapped in Mariupol, says Zelenskiy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/wednesday-briefing-mariupol-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/23/wednesday-briefing-mariupol-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: 100,000 trapped in Mariupol, says Zelenskiy","bodyText":"Top story: ‘They want to raze it to the ground’ Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the top stories. Almost 100,000 people trapped in the ruined city of Mariupol face starvation amid “constant” Russian bombardment, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said. More than 7,000 people escaped the city in the past 24 hours, he said. The besieged southern port city has been left a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, Human Rights Watch says. According to 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who fled to Poland: “During the last five days, the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.” A local official said: “It is clear that the occupiers are not interested in the city of Mariupol, they want to raze it to the ground, to reduce it to ashes of a dead land.” There have been signs of Ukrainian forces going on the offensive, retaking a town near Kyiv and launching counterattacks in the south. The Pentagon has said Russia’s forces may have been reduced by as much as 10% in the four weeks of fighting. Ukraine’s military, meanwhile, has alleged the Russian invasion forces have only three further days of fuel, food and ammunition after breakdowns in their supply lines. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking on CNN, has refused to rule out that Russia might use nuclear weapons if it sees itself as facing “existential threat”. The US defence department spokesman John Kirby branded the remarks “dangerous … not the way a responsible nuclear power should act”. Russian forces “looted and destroyed” a laboratory at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials have said, with “highly active samples” falling into the invaders’ hands. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war, as the EU prepares to set up a “trust fund” to help Ukraine repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. “Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house,” Guterres said. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled areas of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv has said, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” Keep up with further developments at our live blog. * * * ‘For me, this is right’ – Ash Barty, the world No 1, has stunned the tennis world by announcing her retirement at the age of 25. Barty delivered the bombshell news in an online interview released this morning. “I just know at the moment in my heart [that] for me as a person, this is right … I’m so grateful for everything tennis has given me – it’s given me all my dreams plus more.” Barty said she had been thinking about retiring “for a long time” and had “a gut feeling” after last year’s Wimbledon win but there was “a little part of me that wasn’t quite satisfied, wasn’t quite fulfilled”. Winning the Australian Open “feels like the perfect way, my perfect way to celebrate what an amazing journey my tennis career has been”. “I just know that I am absolutely – I am spent – I just know physically I have nothing more to give. And that to me is success. I have given absolutely everything I can to this beautiful sport of tennis.” Barty departs at the peak of her powers, as the reigning Australian Open and Wimbledon champion who has held the world No 1 position since winning the 2019 French Open. It was the Queenslander’s second coming after she took an indefinite break in 2014, while ranked outside the Top 200, because “it was too much too quickly for me as I’ve been travelling from quite a young age”, saying she wanted to experience life “as a normal teenaged girl”. Barty was the Wimbledon girls’ singles champion in 2011, aged 15. * * * ‘Confront this challenge’ – Rishi Sunak will promise “security” to cash-strapped families today as he announces measures to tackle the cost of living crisis while committing to fixing the public finances. Sunak is predicted to use his spring update to announce a cut in fuel duty of at least 5p a litre, but hinted on Tuesday night there may be a more extensive package of support. Options include raising the threshold at which workers start paying national insurance contributions (NICs); deferring the 1.25-point NICs increase; uprating state benefits in line with the 8% inflation rate expected for April; and providing help to energy-intensive businesses. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has accused the chancellor of introducing the controversial NICs rise to give himself the scope to promise tax cuts ahead of the next general election. The statement has been turned by Russia’s war on Ukraine into the latest of a string of mini-budgets. In pre-released extracts of his speech, Sunak says: “We will confront this challenge to our values not just in the arms and resources we send to Ukraine but in strengthening our economy here at home.” The cross-party Treasury select committee has warned the invasion of Ukraine will damage the UK economy. In its report on the impact of sanctions on Vladimir Putin, the committee said Russia was heading for “economic catastrophe” but the war would have as yet unquantifiable costs to the UK. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; P&amp;O has revealed it is paying £36.5m compensation for the 800 seafarers it sacked without warning. It is understood those who accept will have to sign agreements not to disparage the company. The RMT union has said seafarers from abroad are being brought in on as little as £1.80 an hour. &gt; The UK appears set to criminalise illicit refugee crossings of the Channel and could ship asylum seekers to other countries for processing, after the government won a string of votes in the Commons to wind back changes by the House of Lords. &gt; Severe damage to the airliner that crashed in China on Monday with 132 people on board poses “a very high level of difficulty” in establishing a cause, authorities say. &gt; Gambling addiction rates in the UK may be nine times higher than the betting industry claims, according to a study that found 1.4 million people are being harmed by their own gambling while a further 1.5 million are at risk. &gt; Three girls have been held in an all-boys prison for at least eight months owing to “appalling” and systemic failures in the prison system, MPs and campaigners have said. * * * Government by WhatsApp – Communication within government during the pandemic was often by instant messaging, such as by WhatsApp, a senior Cabinet Office official has accepted. It has emerged a series of messages were lost from Boris Johnson’s phone in April 2021 amid security precautions after it was found that the prime minister’s phone number was listed on the internet, according to Sarah Harrison, the chief operating officer at the Cabinet Office. The loss of the messages comes despite ministers being “required to make a separate record of any conversation” relevant to work. WhatsApp is only supposed to be allowed “for ephemeral chat and/or unclassified material”. A court challenge over the use of private messaging in government is being undertaken by the Good Law Project and the Citizens, a non-profit media organisation. * * * Takes the biscuits – It was about 9pm in late November when a rare Marsican brown bear nicknamed Juan Carrito sauntered into Roccaraso, a ski resort town in Italy’s Abruzzo region, before turning into a side alley, smashing a small window of Dolci Momenti (Sweet Moments) bakery and clambering in to scoff a batch of biscuits. Juan Carrito, who was a fixture in the town, has since been tranquilised and moved away, though some residents want him back. “It was a disaster at the time, we had to throw everything away and disinfect everything,” says the bakery owner, Marina Valentini. “Now I have to deal with the crazy publicity: tourists come in and ask: ‘Are these the biscuits the bear ate’?” Today in Focus podcast: What comes after the pandemic Two years after the first UK coronavirus lockdown, Laura Spinney reflects on what the years after the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic looked like, and what we might expect in a post-Covid era. Lunchtime read: ‘They’re entitled to know the world isn’t always a safe place’ With the Ukraine invasion still raging, Covid cases rising again and the ongoing climate crisis, young people are picking up anxieties from social media and the playground. So what’s the best way to talk to your children about the permacrisis? Sport Jason Roy has been hit with a suspended two-match ban from international cricket and a £2,500 fine, the reasons for which are being kept out of the public domain by the England and Wales Cricket Board. An ECB statement said the limited‑overs opener had accepted a charge of bringing the game into disrepute, with the suspended element of his ban “dependent on good behaviour” over the next 12 months. Left-arm spinner Jack Leach heads into the deciding third Test against West Indies today, fresh from a gruelling workload of 94.5 overs during the drawn second Test at Kensington Oval that returned six of his 11 wickets on tour but in which both he and England were thwarted by Kraigg Brathwaite’s stickability. Two late goals saw Barcelona beat Real Madrid by three goals to two in their Women’s Champions League quarter-final first leg; while Paris Saint-Germain’s record goalscorer Marie-Antoinette Katoto showed her class yet again as she scored twice to help secure a 2-1 victory against Bayern Munich. Paul Canoville, the first black footballer to play for Chelsea, has increased the pressure on the Ricketts family by becoming the latest figure to speak out against their attempt to buy the club. Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has revealed his World Cup winner’s medal was among the items stolen during a recent burglary at his home. Rafael Nadal’s preparations for the upcoming clay-court season have hit a setback after he was diagnosed with a rib stress fracture following his straight-sets defeat against Taylor Fritz in the Indian Wells final on Sunday. Nadal will be out for four to six weeks.

We have a shrinking economy, a fuel crisis that may bring on energy rationing and forced blackouts, extreme weather events, the increased chance of nuclear war, and risk of the growth of a new pandemic riding on the back of the last. The Doomsday Clock – a symbol created by scientists to represent the likelihood of a human-made catastrophe – places us at just 100 seconds before midnight, the closest we’ve been to Armageddon in the project’s 75-year history. In the face of these threats, it may be hard to maintain a rose-tinted view of the future – unless, that is, you are the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. In 2018, his book Enlightenment Now argued that our interpretations of news events make us far too gloomy. There has never been a better time to be alive, he said, thanks to the social, economic, political, technological, and medical advances of the past 300 years. At the time of its publication, Pinker’s book attracted as much scorn as praise. One common criticism was that he had oversimplified complex subjects and neglected any phenomena that might suggest a lack of progress. Pinker has, however, attempted to address many of the criticisms, and the recent challenges facing the world do not appear to have changed his opinion. On Radio 4’s Today programme last week, he revisited the arguments of Enlightenment Now to explain why he believes there are still reasons to remain optimistic in 2022. “We have to remember that there’s no law of nature that spaces bad things apart,” he said. “Bad things happen, and they will appear to come in clusters – but it doesn’t mean that we’re being punished for our collective sins or that we’re in a uniquely dangerous moment.” He maintains humanity has the tools to deal with the challenges we face. There is certainly something comforting about seeing cause for hope in crises. But do we really have good grounds for optimism? To find out, the Observer examines four indices of progress and the ways they have been affected by recent events. Health in the time of Covid The Covid-19 pandemic is the obvious place to start. According to the World Health Organization, more than 6.4 million have so far died of the infection, since the virus emerged. In a sample of 37 countries, the British Medical Journal found all but six had experienced a reduction in life expectancy as a result. That’s not to mention the burden of long Covid, which is thought to affect around two million people in the UK alone. This is certainly a step backwards for global health. But it is worth noting that Pinker has never claimed that we will see continuous progress without any setbacks. His argument is more concerned with the ways we cope with problems and find potential solutions. Did we deal with the threat better than we would have been able to in years gone by? The jury is still out on the UK government’s initial response to the crisis. But the rapid development of Covid vaccines is undoubtedly a triumph of scientific progress. According to a recent study from Imperial College’s Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, the vaccination programme saved at least 14 million people – and potentially as many as 19.8 million – in its first year. This simply wouldn’t have been possible in years gone by; all previous vaccines had taken at least five years to develop, and at the start of the pandemic many scientists believed the possibility of creating a new one from scratch was naively optimistic. That may be some cause of optimism for our ability to deal with future health threats. Wealth and happiness One of Enlightenment Now’s core arguments is that people today are far wealthier than people in previous decades – and that this has resulted in higher life satisfaction, through greater comfort, more free time and better education. Pinker dismisses the idea that inequality is a driver of unrest – it is each person’s absolute wealth that matters, he says, which means we do not need to worry too much if much of a country’s gains in GDP go disproportionately to the richest echelons of society. The evidence for this is not quite as clearcut as Pinker would claim, however. Recent research by veteran economist Richard Easterlin found that China’s and India’s recent economic growth have done very little for the population’s overall happiness. More comprehensively, a study by Małgorzata Mikucka at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium analysed life satisfaction in 46 countries from 1981 to 2012. It found that an increase in GDP only brought about greater happiness if it was accompanied by reduced inequality and increased social capital. None of this bodes well for our lives over the next few months and years. The Office for National Statistics has just reported that the UK’s GDP has shrunk in the second quarter of 2022, suggesting that we are on the brink of a recession, while the average salary is set to fall behind inflation by 8% this year – the biggest drop in real wages in over 100 years. And according to the International Monetary Fund, the cost of living crisis is likely to widen inequality by hitting the poorest homes hardest. It’s worth remembering that, by the start of this year, real wages had not fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis – suggesting that this is more than a momentary blip in our living standards. War and peace One of Pinker’s most controversial claims concerns our propensity to kill each other. He first made the case that human violence is at an all-time low in The Better Angels of Our Nature, published in 2011, and then revisited the idea seven years later in Enlightenment Now. Much of Pinker’s argument concerns warfare. Using data concerning the sheer number of conflicts, their length, the proportion of lives lost, and the level of military investment, Pinker notes a downward trend across the centuries. Clearly, there are exceptions – the huge numbers of lives lost in both world wars, for one; you can only reach his conclusion by looking at average numbers across the globe over large time periods. Pinker argues that various forces – such as the increasing importance of international trade, the rise of democracy, and the actions of institutions such as the UN – have made war much less desirable for most leaders, pushing us into the period known by some historians as the “long peace”. But many other scholars have questioned these conclusions. One analysis by Aaron Clauset at the University of Colorado in Boulder, for example, concluded that the “long peace” may just be a statistical fluke. It is possible for any probabilistic events to cluster in certain periods and to disappear in others. For an analogy, consider how many times you can throw a coin and it lands on tails, despite the probability being 50:50. You might conclude that the coin is biased – but with more throws the overall frequencies will tend to balance out. According to Clauset’s paper, the “long peace” may be similarly ephemeral. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and growing tensions over Taiwan, have of course placed the thought of global war at the front of everyone’s minds. We can hope that diplomacy will prevent disaster, but optimistic historical analyses provide cold comfort when our fate can depend on the erratic decisions of dictators such as Vladimir Putin. The environment With the record-breaking heatwaves this year, and the threat of wildfires sweeping across the UK, it feels like we are already witnessing the start of the climate emergency – and unless we take drastic action, it is only set to worsen. Pinker certainly doesn’t deny climate change, which he acknowledges is a “gargantuan problem”, but he has criticised “eco-pessimism” and the prevalence of what he considers to be alarmist green messaging. In Enlightenment Now, he describes many environmental successes, such as the reduction of water pollution, the elimination of acid rain and a recent deceleration in deforestation. He points to data showing that many countries’ CO2 emissions are now plateauing. For an escape route from disaster, he points to ideas such as carbon taxing, combined with a reliance on nuclear power and technologies such as carbon capture, which involves scrubbing CO2 from power stations before it is released and locking it underground. Needless to say, the “eco-pessimists” are unimpressed. Technologies such as carbon capture do offer some promise, but their efficacy is unproven. And we will also require strong political will, which has been far from obvious in the years since Pinker’s book was published. A UN report from 2021 found most governments were “nowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5C and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement”, though it is possible that a drive to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas could galvanise efforts to switch to renewables. Pinker’s optimism relies on the fact that we – and our governments – will act rationally, according to the Enlightenment principles of reason, science and humanism. Our combined brainpower may certainly have the capacity to solve the climate crisis, but to believe that our politicians will take action in time – that may require a leap of faith.

Although the water will be treated before being discharged, it will still contain tritium, a radioactive hydrogen isotope represented on a government website by a cute fish-like creature with rosy cheeks. The character’s appearance in an online flyer and video on the reconstruction agency’s website angered Fukushima residents. “It seems the government’s desire to release the water into the sea takes priority over everything,” Katsuo Watanabe, an 82-year-old Fukushima fisher, told the Kyodo news agency. “The gap between the gravity of the problems we face and the levity of the character is huge.” Riken Komatsu, a local writer, tweeted: “If the government thinks it can get the general public to understand just by creating a cute character, it is making a mockery of risk communication.” Social media users named the character Tritium-kun – or Little Mr Tritium – an apparent reference to Pluto-kun, who appeared in the mid-1990s to soften the image of plutonium on behalf of Japan’s nuclear industry. The reconstruction agency, which oversees recovery efforts in the region destroyed by the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown, removed the promotional material on Wednesday, a day after it first appeared. Experts say tritium is harmful to humans only in large doses, and that with dilution the treated water poses no scientifically detectable risk. The character was created to explain that the release of tritium into the sea is standard practice at nuclear power plants around the world. Local fishing communities say the water’s release will destroy a decade of hard work to rebuild consumer confidence in their seafood. Work to release the diluted water will begin in about two years, the government has said, and the process is expected to take decades. “Nuclear power plants are highly specialised and difficult to understand,” an agency official told Kyodo, adding that the tritium mascot would be redesigned to take into account public sentiment. Japan’s decision to discharge the water also angered neighbouring countries. South Korea said it was considering taking the issue to the international tribunal for the law of the sea, possibly to seek an injunction, according to a spokesperson for the president, Moon Jae-in. The Chinese foreign ministry said releasing the water would set a bad precedent for the disposal of wastewater. “The ocean is not Japan’s rubbish bin, the Pacific Ocean is not Japan’s sewers,” said Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesperson. Zhao invited Japan’s deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, to drink some of the treated water, after Aso said it was harmless enough to consume. “A Japanese official said it is OK if we drink this water, so then please drink it,” Zhao said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2020/jul/20/tory-rebels-are-far-from-finished-in-push-for-tougher-china-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-20T18:29:38Z","webTitle":"Tory rebels are far from finished in push for tougher China policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/20/tory-rebels-are-far-from-finished-in-push-for-tougher-china-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/jul/20/tory-rebels-are-far-from-finished-in-push-for-tougher-china-policy","fields":{"headline":"Tory rebels are far from finished in push for tougher China policy","bodyText":"When Mike Pompeo meets a group of Conservative backbench MPs on Tuesday who have been pressing for the UK to take a harder line on China, it will not be for a victory lap as some in Downing Street might hope. The hawkish US secretary of state wants to encourage the Conservative rebels to keep pushing for Britain to go further than banning Huawei from 5G phone networks and suspending the extradition treaty with Hong Kong. Not they need much encouragement. There are no shortage of Tory backbenchers who want further diplomatic and economic restrictions on Beijing, a cause espoused so keenly by former Brexiters such as David Davis and more centrist MPs such as Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, that they sometimes compete among themselves. “There are multiple issues we need to push ahead with as part a general China reassessment and we are keen that the government continues to move,” said Bob Seely, who helped organise a bloc of 50 MPs in a year-long campaign to demand that Huawei be blocked from future 5G networks. Top of the list now are calls for China to be barred from involvement in building nuclear power stations, whether as a minority investor in Hinckley Point, in Somerset, or as a prime contractor, as in the case of a proposed project at Bradwell in Essex. Others want a review of Beijing’s impact on UK higher education. More than 120,000 Chinese attend British universities, making a critical contribution to their funding, but there remains concern about China’s involvement in UK research in areas such as facial recognition and cryptography. The climate is changing so fast that Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory party leader, even called on Monday for a ban on TikTok, the popular video sharing app, “because of its proximity to Chinese intelligence services” – a point that defenders of the company have argued makes little sense given it is a home for “short, homemade videos”. But it is hard to escape the conviction that China policy is being driven by the Conservative backbenchers – many looking for a grand cause after winning the Brexit argument – in alliance with an aggressive, trade-obsessed White House. “Like a lot of countries, we are flapping in the wind,” said a political adviser who worked under Theresa May’s premiership. “But if Dominic Cummings wouldn’t let IDS run the Brexit campaign, why would he let him set the policy on China?” The hawks’ position has been helped by the crisis in Hong Kong, where China’s decision to impose a draconian national security law and in effect end the “one country, two systems” model has helped ensure there is Labour and other opposition support for a tougher line. Concerns loom large across the political spectrum about the brutal treatment of China’s Uighur Muslim minority, where there are reports of mass enforced sterilisation and detainment in “re-education camps”. Confronted with drone footage of blindfolded and shackled prisoners on the BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, tried to imply it amounted to a “fake accusation” and then that there may have been “single cases” of mistreatment. In the Commons on Monday, Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, was quick to support her opposite number, Dominic Raab, when he announced the suspension of the extradition treaty. “This must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy,” she said. Meanwhile, China defenders have almost evaporated, even though it is less than five years since David Cameron and George Osborne were plugging a new “golden era” in Chinese-British relations and encouraging companies such as Huawei and China General Nuclear to invest in the UK. Business lobby groups say there are now genuine worries that China could hit back with targeted restrictions on British business and multinationals such as GlaxoSmithKline and Rolls-Royce. But one business source added: “Nobody wants to speak out at the moment.” It is an astonishing change in sentiment in little more than a few months, partly fuelled by the impact of the coronavirus crisis. That revealed how the extent to which the UK and other western countries are dependent on Chinese manufacturing and trade – including in areas such as the supply of paracetamol and other drugs and the manufacture of personal protective equipment. Tim Summers, a senior consulting fellow on the Asia-Pacific programme at Chatham House, csaid: “There is not much nuance in the argument at the moment.” He added: “It seems to have got to the point where there are worries about the supply of plastic gloves, when the reality was that the NHS didn’t stockpile enough before the pandemic hit.” A letter signed by 17 Conservative backbenchers two days ago that called for the UK to suspend extradition arrangements with Hong Kong was only three paragraphs long and emotively argued. “We are all going to have to ask ourselves if we recognise the Chinese Communist party’s definitions of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion,” it read. There is little doubt that there is more to come, and there are even growing predictions of a decoupling between the west and China as countries such as the UK are forced to chose between a US-led bloc and a far eastern one, although there would be economic costs in doing so. China was the UK’s sixth-ranked destination for good and services, accounting for 3.6% of the total, while Chinese companies have made investments in the UK that have been welcomed by ministers, such as the purchase and rescue of British Steel and its plant in Scunthorpe by Jingye Group in March, which helped to protect 3,000 jobs. Veerle Nouwens, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said: “It is important for the UK to draw red lines around issues such as human rights. But the conversation around decoupling is not as easy as some people make it out to be either.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/oct/07/winter-blackout-risk-great-britain-rises-after-cable-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-07T08:00:47Z","webTitle":"Winter blackout risk in Great Britain rises after cable fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/07/winter-blackout-risk-great-britain-rises-after-cable-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/oct/07/winter-blackout-risk-great-britain-rises-after-cable-fire","fields":{"headline":"Winter blackout risk in Great Britain rises after cable fire","bodyText":"The risk of winter blackouts has increased after a fire affecting a key subsea cable further eroded Great Britain’s backup electricity supply cushion, already diminished by the shutdown of gas plants and nuclear reactors. The National Grid’s electricity system operator, ESO, said the “de-rated margin” – the amount of excess capacity that could be called upon if needed – was expected to be 6.6% or 3.9 gigawatts (GW). That would be higher than the margins seen in 2015-16 and the following year. But the ESO said a worst-case scenario, such as multiple power plant outages, low wind speeds, and a bitterly cold winter, could cause the margin plunge to just 4.2%, or 2.5GW. That would be well below the 5.1% it forecast in 2015, before a notoriously difficult winter when National Grid was forced to ask businesses to reduce their electricity usage to keep the lights on. With margins likely to be tighter than the Grid would like, it expects to issue a similar number of electricity market notices to last year, when it sent six of the official pleas to energy suppliers to increase the amount of electricity they make available. The ESO took the unusual step this year of issuing an early version of its Winter Outlook, its annual assessment of Great Britain’s electricity safety net. It said at the time that the margin could fall to 5.3%, owing to the retirements of the Dungeness B and Hunterston B nuclear power stations and shutdowns at the Baglan Bay, Severn Power and Sutton Bridge gas power stations. But its worst-case scenario has worsened since September, when a large fire affected the IFA high-voltage power cables importing electricity from France. Half of the 2GW cable is expected to be unavailable until March. Despite the downgrade, National Grid said there was no risk of blackouts as a result of the tighter margin. Fintan Slye, the executive directive of ESO, said: “The Winter Outlook confirms that we expect to have sufficient capacity and the tools needed to meet demand this winter. Margins are well within the reliability standard and therefore we are confident that there will be enough capacity available to keep Britain’s lights on.” However, speaking at an event hosted by the Financial Times on Wednesday, the National Grid chief executive, John Pettigrew, said the gap between supply and demand could be smaller than in recent years. Tighter margins can lead to higher bills as the Grid faces the excess cost of paying energy suppliers more for extra supplies to top up the backup margin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/jan/20/the-reactor-by-nick-blackburn-review-the-fallout-of-grief","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-20T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"The Reactor by Nick Blackburn review – the fallout of grief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/20/the-reactor-by-nick-blackburn-review-the-fallout-of-grief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jan/20/the-reactor-by-nick-blackburn-review-the-fallout-of-grief","fields":{"headline":"The Reactor by Nick Blackburn review – the fallout of grief","bodyText":"As a therapist, Nick Blackburn is attuned to the use of story as decoy; when what we want to talk about is too painful, or obscured from our view, misdirection and displacement edge in to fill the gaps and silences. He is aware of the danger of being seduced by those compensatory stand-in stories, of being, in the words of psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller, captured by your patient’s delusion. “Your work as a clinician,” Blackburn quotes Miller as saying, “is not to understand what he says. It’s not to participate in his delusion. Your work as a clinician is to understand the particular way, the peculiar way he makes sense of things.” But The Reactor is not a book about Blackburn’s attempts to understand what underlies his patients’ stories, rather a fragmentary unrolling of his own particular, peculiar way of making sense of the death of his father. Here is a man whom we meet only in glimpses, the details of whose biography and identity are less significant than his absence and the manner in which he is unavailable to both his son and the reader. This is not a memoir that attempts to piece together a mass of wayward strands and details of a life in order to provide a vaguely comforting sense of the person who once inhabited it. Instead, it is a reckoning with the reality that loss can be just as cataclysmic even when its terrain and contours are indistinct and may never come into perfect focus. That reckoning is itself variously and sometimes luridly disguised. Blackburn’s most closely tended alternative narrative is that of the explosion of the fourth reactor at the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl in 1986, a disaster that the author initially acquaints himself with via YouTube films, becoming mesmerised by visual details that seem as though they might come from a dream or a fairytale: golden corridors of corrugated yellow metal, polished marble, “the red forest and the crumbling dachas”, “catfish fattening in still waters”. But it is scientific process that really appears to compel him, and the way it can be made to function as a metaphor for the violent experience of bereavement: “Radioactive atoms want to become stable again,” he writes, “so they release energy until they get back to a balanced state.” Throughout, Blackburn ponders the half-life of grief, its power to contaminate the lives around it, its insidious unpredictability. As anyone who has endured loss might understand, it also alters time, the reality that preceded it coming to seem both implausibly far away and crushingly, inescapably, present. There is both a becalming and a turbulence that also characterises Blackburn’s attempts to write about it: “I get anxious because in a way creative activity always has a manic quality, dancing and dancing like the red shoes, like a nuclear meltdown.” His response to the mania of creation is to seek ever more connections: alongside Chernobyl, he takes us into the life, and death, of fashion designer Alexander McQueen; the music of Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan (“Bob says: Life isn’t about finding yourself, or finding anything, life is about creating yourself, and creating things”); the 2018 documentary about a “free love” commune, Wild Wild Country, and Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal; Derek Jarman and Billy Elliot, Sister Wendy and Ian Curtis. Thinking of Fleetwood Mac makes him think of the Manhattan project, which makes him think of the poet Thomas Wyatt, after which he reflects: “Connecting things (in hindsight) can be really exhausting sometimes, don’t you think?” And sometimes, that feeling of exhaustion extends to the reader, who may reasonably think that another’s tenuously linked thoughts and preoccupations are not unlike other people’s dreams: fascinating to them, and possibly to their therapist, but not as utterly captivating to the outsider as they would wish. A page on which the word “Nuclear” is followed by a line break and then the word “Unclear” and nothing else is not, let us be truthful, especially illuminating. But The Reactor does have considerable power. It movingly evokes the psychic mayhem of parental loss, that point at which, whatever one’s relationship, the idea of origins and foundations comes under scrutiny, if not outright assault. And while it confirms the isolated, individual nature of grief and can hardly be thought of as a work of consolation, it also suggests that the attempt to tell one’s story, and the attempt to listen, is not to be underrated. • The Reactor: A Book about Grief and Repair is published by Faber (£12.99).

Tucker Carlson, however, took a different approach. Hours before Putin ordered his forces into Ukraine, Fox News’ biggest star was still praising the Russian president. Putin’s bellicose threats towards Ukraine and assembling of up to 190,000 troops on the country’s border, was, Carlson said, a mere “border dispute”. Carlson, who played into Kremlin talking points by declaring that Ukraine was “not a democracy”, launched an apparent attempt to humanize Putin. “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia?” Carlson said as he then recited a rightwing tip sheet of pet causes. “Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity?” Just over 24 hours later, Putin effectively declared war on Ukraine. Carlson was roundly condemned, but he wasn’t alone. Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s sometime adviser turned podcast host, has praised Putin for being “anti-woke”, for not flying pride flags, and for his hostility to trans people. Charlie Kirk, a rightwing media personality and the founder of Turning Points USA, suggested Putin felt emboldened by “energy policies that Joe Biden put forward”. “Could it be that Greta Thunberg and Leonardo DiCaprio actually might be to blame for what Vladimir Putin is doing?” Kirk asked on his eponymous internet show. “That’s a take you will not hear anywhere else,” he added. By the end of the week Carlson’s colorful defense of Putin was being played on Russia 1 and the Kremlin-backed RT television network. “As Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, the biggest star on Fox News was busy doing what he does best: being thoroughly and appallingly wrong,” Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist for the Washington Post, wrote. By Thursday night, after Putin’s forces had begun bombing Ukraine, and after widespread US and global outrage at the carnage, Carlson had changed his tune. “I don’t think anybody approves of what Putin did yesterday. I certainly don’t,” he said on his show. Carlson added: “Vladimir Putin started this war.” He continued: “He is to blame tonight for what we’re seeing tonight in the Ukraine.” But those expecting a mea culpa from Carlson, who has recently also become enamored with the authoritarian regime of Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, were disappointed. The overt praise for Putin may have receded, but Carlson and his Fox News co-hosts and pundits have continued to blame others for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Well, I think we all know if Donald Trump were president, this would not have happened,” Lara Trump, Fox News contributor and daughter-in-law of the former president, told Fox and Friends on Thursday. “We exuded strength on the world stage when Donald Trump was there. Now you see Joe Biden in office. And gosh, how many times have we all talked about how weak America has looked since the day that Joe Biden was inaugurated?” Fox News Twitter feed on Friday essentially served as a tribute to the same viewpoint, lavishly quoting almost identical statements from Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn. “Rather than blame the actual aggressor for attacking his weaker neighbor, right-wing media pinned the blame on Biden for supposedly projecting weakness and vulnerability to Putin,” Media Matters, a non-profit which monitors conservative media, wrote. “In the right-wing media echo chamber [...] the fault for this invasion lies with a mind-boggling variety of scapegoats, including Joe Biden, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, American environmentalists, the LGBTQ community, and even the team here at Media Matters for America - anybody, that is, other than Putin.” The narrative has received some pushback from journalists at Fox News itself, particularly Jennifer Griffin, the network’s national security correspondent, who has spent weeks painstakingly correcting her opinion-host colleagues as Russia surrounded Ukraine. On Thursday morning, the anchors on the morning show Fox and Friends were opining about how sanctions against Russia “have not worked”. Steve Doocy asked Griffin if “the people at the Pentagon” were frustrated given American troops were not involved. “No, I wouldn’t say that, Steve. In fact they know that they had limited options going into this because Russia of course is a nuclear power, and Nato and the US are not going to go to war with Russia over Ukraine, their goal is to contain this and keep this from spilling over into an article 5 nation,” Griffin said. “You talk about how the sanctions haven’t worked, I don’t know that we can say that yet. Overnight, the stock market in Russia fell by half, 50%. “This is just the beginning of what is being described as a ‘shock and awe,’ if you will, of rolling sanctions that have not even begun to be felt yet by Putin, by his oligarchs, by the cronies there.” The talk and tone among the hosts of Fox News and others in the right-wing media ecosystem is unlikely to change any time soon. But in some corners there are journalists willing to drag those hosts back to reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/27/government-pledges-17bn-of-public-money-to-new-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-27T16:18:50Z","webTitle":"Government pledges £1.7bn of public money to new nuclear plant ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/27/government-pledges-17bn-of-public-money-to-new-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/27/government-pledges-17bn-of-public-money-to-new-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Government pledges £1.7bn of public money to new nuclear plant ","bodyText":"The government will make its first direct investment in a large-scale nuclear reactor since 1995 after pledging to plough up to £1.7bn of taxpayers’ money into a new power plant. Treasury documents published alongside the autumn statement did not name which nuclear project would be in line for the public funds, but the Guardian understands it is most likely to be the planned £20bn Sizewell C plant in Suffolk. Government officials are locked in talks with Sizewell C’s developer, the French state-backed energy company EDF, about how to finance its successor to the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. The first investment would be enough to hand the UK government an 8.5% stake in Sizewell C, and potentially oust China General Nuclear (CGN) from the project with help from private investors. The plant, which is still going through the planning process, could eventually power 6m homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, concerns about costs and the involvement of state-owned CGN. The Guardian understands that the government is eager to replace CGN, which has a 20% share of Sizewell, through a combination of government and private sector investment, due to growing security concerns over Chinese involvement in critical national infrastructure. The government set out new legislation earlier this week for a financial support framework for nuclear plants which would make the projects more attractive to investors by piling part of the upfront cost on to household energy bills before the plants start generating electricity. By making a direct investment in a nuclear plant through the new financial framework, known as a Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model, the government could effectively put both taxpayers and energy bill payers on the hook for costly construction delays. The Treasury said the £1.7bn of direct government funding would help to secure a final investment decision in a major nuclear power plant before the end of this parliament, which was a key pillar within the government’s net zero strategy, published last week. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “This is a big vote of confidence in nuclear and a historic step forward for nuclear investment.” “We can’t get to net zero without investing in new nuclear capacity, and this is a clear signal from government to investors that it sees nuclear as essential to our clean energy transition,” he said. “This is not only an investment in a greener future, but also in jobs and skills right across the country.” A spokesperson for the Treasury was not immediately available to comment. The government’s nuclear ambitions are also backed by £385m for research and development of ‘advanced nuclear’ technologies, and it has set aside £120m to address the nuclear industry’s barriers to entry. The Treasury also revealed that it would make up to £230m from the Global Britain Investment Fund available to support investment in the UK’s offshore wind manufacturing sector."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-hails-eu-decision-russian-forces-encircle-troops-in-lysychansk-kyiv-officials-say-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-24T23:00:10Z","webTitle":"Kyiv orders troops to pull out of Sievierodonetsk – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-hails-eu-decision-russian-forces-encircle-troops-in-lysychansk-kyiv-officials-say-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jun/24/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-hails-eu-decision-russian-forces-encircle-troops-in-lysychansk-kyiv-officials-say-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Kyiv orders troops to pull out of Sievierodonetsk – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The Canadian senate passed prime minister Justin Trudeau’s budget on Thursday, allowing it to seize and dispose of assets sanctioned as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Canadian government will now be allowed to seize and dispose of assets of people and entities that have been sanctioned due to the invasion. The government will then be able to use the funds to support Ukraine. The European Council on Friday has approved 9 billion euros of financial aid to Ukraine. In a statement made by Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki at the European Council summit in Brussels, he said, “There is a war in Ukraine, and there is nothing to pay nurses, teachers, police, border guards, or many other public services.” Ukraine’s main domestic security agency said on Friday it had uncovered a Russian spy network involving Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach who was previously accused by the United States of being a Russian agent. The State Security Service (SBU) said Derkach, whose whereabouts were not made clear, set up a network of private security firms to use them to ease and support the entry of Russian units into cities during Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion. Over 3,000 dolphins in the Black Sea have died as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukrainian scientists working in the “Tuzlovsky Lymans” reserve, a national nature park. NEXTA reports that the “work of sonar and explosions prevent them from finding food” and that dead dolphins have been increasingly found on the coasts of Bulgaria and Romania, in addition to Ukraine. It would require Ukraine a decade to rebuild infrastructure of its Black Sea ports, whose blockade by Russia is preventing global grain exports, according to Ukraine’s deputy agriculture minister. “For alternative routes, it would take 10 years of investment to try to build the necessary infrastructure to replace this Black Sea port infrastructure, which we spent about 20 years building, starting in 2000,” Taras Vysotskiy said on Friday. Russia has condemned the European Union’s decision to accept Ukraine and Moldova as membership candidates. Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry said, “With the decision to grant Ukraine and Moldova the status of candidate countries, the European Union has confirmed that it continues to actively exploit the CIS on a geopolitical level, to use it to ‘contain’ Russia,” referring to Russia’s sphere of influence within the Commonwealth of Independent States consisting of former Soviet states. Mass kidnappings have been occurring in Melitopol, said the mayor of the southeastern Ukrainian city. “More than 500 people have been abducted in the last four months,” Ivan Fedrov said, adding that mass kidnappings have resumed in the Russian-occupied territory last week. Russia has launched 70 missiles at Odesa since February 24, the southwestern city’s regional prosecution has said. According to the prosecution, the majority of the missiles have targeted residential areas and public utilities. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand the blog over to my colleagues in Australia who will bring you the latest updates on Ukraine. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. Footage has emerged of the ruins in central Popasna in the Luhansk region of Ukraine, Euromaidan Press reports. After two months of intensive fighting against Russian forces, Ukrainian troops left the city in early May, leaving behind numerous buildings that have been destroyed by the Russian military. The Canadian senate passed prime minister Justin Trudeau’s budget on Thursday, allowing it to seize and dispose of assets sanctioned as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Canadian government will now be allowed to seize and dispose of assets of people and entities that have been sanctioned due to the invasion. The government will then be able to use the funds to support Ukraine. The European Council on Friday has approved 9 billion euros of financial aid to Ukraine. In a statement made by Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki at the European Council summit in Brussels, he said, “There is a war in Ukraine, and there is nothing to pay nurses, teachers, police, border guards, or many other public services.” Morawiecki added that European countries such as his are continuing to provide military assistance to Ukraine. “The advantage [of Russia] in artillery, according to the allies and our own sources is 1:8, 1:10. How difficult it is to fight such an overwhelming enemy force. That is why Poland, as well as the United States, Great Britain, and the Baltic States, are doing everything possible to help Ukraine get the weapons,” he said. Ukraine’s main domestic security agency said on Friday it had uncovered a Russian spy network involving Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach who was previously accused by the United States of being a Russian agent. Reuters reports: The State Security Service (SBU) said Derkach, whose whereabouts were not made clear, set up a network of private security firms to use them to ease and support the entry of Russian units into cities during Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion. Derkach could not immediately be reached for comment. He has previously denied wrongdoing and said he has been targeted for exposing corruption. In a statement, the SBU cited testimony from Derkach’s parliamentary aide Ihor Kolykhayev. It said he was arrested at the beginning of the war, and accused him of being a go-between between Derkach and Russia’s military intelligence agency. Kolykhayev said Derkach’s security firms “had to ensure the passage of (Russian) vehicles, get into armoured vehicles with Russian flags, and thus ensure (the Russian army’s) peaceful entry into the city.” The SBU said Derkach received sums of $3-4 million every several months in order to fulfil the plan. Derkach was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in September 2020 for what it said were attempts to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The Treasury’s sanction announcement at the time said Derkach had been “an active Russian agent for over a decade.” Over 3,000 dolphins in the Black Sea have died as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukrainian scientists working in the “Tuzlovsky Lymans” reserve, a national nature park. NEXTA reports that the “work of sonar and explosions prevent them from finding food” and that dead dolphins have been increasingly found on the coasts of Bulgaria and Romania, in addition to Ukraine. It would require Ukraine a decade to rebuild infrastructure of its Black Sea ports, whose blockade by Russia is preventing global grain exports, according to Ukraine’s deputy agriculture minister. “For alternative routes, it would take 10 years of investment to try to build the necessary infrastructure to replace this Black Sea port infrastructure, which we spent about 20 years building, starting in 2000,” Taras Vysotskiy said on Friday. Since the Russian invasion in February, millions of tonnes of wheat and other grain have been stuck in Ukrainian ports, prompting international concern surrounding food prices an hunger. “These alternative routes are important” but can only carry around a third of Ukraine’s exports, he said. Ukraine’s Western allies are looking for ways to unblock the ports, particularly Odessa, the main point of departure for the country’s agricultural produce. “Without very concrete guarantees allowing ships to enter and leave safely, we cannot allow such actions,” Vysotskiy said, adding that Russia was not ready to provide these assurances. Meanwhile, about 20 million tonnes of grain from last year’s harvest are still stuck in Ukraine, he said. However, he noted that the grain could be “stored very efficiently for up to two years” under the right conditions. “10 to 15 percent of the port infrastructure was destroyed by rockets from Russia,” Vysotskiy also said, referring to a recent Russian strike on one of the country’s biggest grain terminals in Mykolaiv. Vysotskiy said that Kyiv had “evidence that about half a million tonnes were stolen from the regions partially occupied,” referring to Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Lugansk. “We have received evidence from satellite images showing grain has been transported to Syria,” Vysotskiy added. Russia has condemned the European Union’s decision to accept Ukraine and Moldova as membership candidates. Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry said, “With the decision to grant Ukraine and Moldova the status of candidate countries, the European Union has confirmed that it continues to actively exploit the CIS on a geopolitical level, to use it to ‘contain’ Russia,” referring to Russia’s sphere of influence within the Commonwealth of Independent States consisting of former Soviet states. Although it could take years for the countries to join the European bloc, the decision to accept them as candidates is a symbol of the EU’s intention to reach deep into the former Soviet Union. “They are not thinking of the negative consequences of such a step,” she added. By expanding to Ukraine and Moldova, two former Soviet republics, Zakharova said, the EU was sacrificing its democratic ideals at the expense of “unrestrained expansion and the political and economic enslavement of its neighbours.” Mass kidnappings have been occurring in Melitopol, said the mayor of the southeastern Ukrainian city. “More than 500 people have been abducted in the last four months,” Ivan Fedrov said, adding that mass kidnappings have resumed in the Russian-occupied territory last week. Fedorov also said that Russian forces have been extracting harvest grain from the city’s silos. “As for the latest crops, the rucists announce the following harvesting criteria: they either take 50% or 70% of the crops. They also announce the price at which they are willing to buy – less than $80 per tonne. This is less than the actual cost price. Meanwhile, only one person was authorized by the occupiers to run such negotiations and buy out the crops,” he said. Russia has launched 70 missiles at Odesa since February 24, the southwestern city’s regional prosecution has said. According to the prosecution, the majority of the missiles have targeted residential areas and public utilities. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The last Ukrainian forces fighting in the heavily contested eastern city of Sievierodonetsk have been ordered to withdraw in order to avoid being encircled. The anticipated loss of Sievierodonetsk is the latest battlefield reverse for Kyiv after its defeat in the port city of Mariupol, as fears grow that the neighbouring city of Lysychansk could also fall to Russia within days. A district south of the city of Lysychansk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region has been “fully occupied” by Russian forces, a local Ukrainian official said. The loss of Hirske and several other settlements around it leaves Lysychansk in danger of being enveloped from three sides by advancing Russian forces. A Ukrainian goat has been hailed a national hero after it triggered a string of Russian grenades around a hospital in Zaporizhzhia, injuring at least 40 Russian soldiers. The goat, who had escaped from a farm, is said to have headed straight for the boobytrap after Russian forces pinned grenades around the edge of a local hospital in the village of Kinski Rozdory. Ukraine will need at least a decade to clear all the mines and explosives from its land and territorial waters after the war, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s state emergency service has said. So far Ukraine has managed to clear 620 sq km of land littered with thousands of explosive devices, Oleksandr Khorunzhiy said. Nearly 300,000 sq km are still seen as “contaminated”, he said. An official in the Russian-installed administration of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region was killed in an apparent assassination when his car exploded as he got into it. Dmitry Savluchenko was head of the families, youth and sports department of the Kherson military-civilian administration. The Kremlin has described the attack as “nothing but an act of terrorism”. An oil refinery in the south of Russia that was hit by a drone attack earlier this week has resumed operations, according to reports. Both primary crude-oil distillation units at the Novoshakhtinsk refinery were down after the attack, but at least one was back online as of Friday, according to sources. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed crowds at Glastonbury festival and asked them to “spread the truth about Russia’s war” and “prove that freedom always wins”. In a video message to festivalgoers, Zelenskiy said Ukrainians would not allow Russia’s war to break them and that he wanted to stop the invasion before it “ruined people’s lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America”. Russia is trying but has been unable to target western weapons flowing into Ukraine, including longer-range systems that Kyiv hopes will be decisive on the battlefield, a senior US defence official said. The official also appeared to play down the significance of Russian advances in Ukraine and said a Ukrainian pullback from Sievierodonetsk would allow them to take a better defensive position. The UN nuclear watchdog has said it is increasingly concerned about the welfare of Ukrainian staff at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was aware of reports “indicating a deteriorating situation for Ukrainian staff” at the country’s largest nuclear power plant. The lawyer defending Aiden Aslin, one of two Britons sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court, said they had not yet submitted an appeal because the Britons seemed to be holding out for intervention from the UK. Appeals must be lodged by 8 July but Aslin’s lawyer said “they hope that the British authorities will still contact either the Russian Federation or the Donetsk People’s Republic”. European leaders have granted Ukraine candidate status nearly four months after Zelenskiy launched his country’s attempt to join the EU in the early days of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy welcomed the move, calling it “a unique and historic moment” in relations with the 27-nation bloc. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the EU’s decision was a “domestic” matter. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said the decision would have “negative consequences”. G7 foreign ministers have called on Russia to “cease its attacks and threatening actions” and to unblock the Ukrainian Black Sea ports for food exports. Russia is exacerbating food insecurity with its blockades and bombing attacks on key infrastructure in Ukraine, they said in a statement. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said there could be no effective solution to the looming food crisis unless Ukraine and Russia found a way to properly resume trade. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today. My colleague Maya Yang will be here shortly to take over. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the decision by the EU to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova will have “negative consequences”. In a statement, the ministry’s spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said: With the decision to grant Ukraine and Moldova the status of candidate countries, the European Union has confirmed that it continues to actively exploit the CIS on a geopolitical level, to use it to ‘contain’ Russia. They are not thinking of the negative consequences of such a step. An oil refinery in the south of Russia that was hit by a drone attack earlier this week has resumed operations, according to reports. The Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in the Rostov region said the first of two drones flying from the direction of Ukraine struck on Wednesday morning, hitting a crude distillation unit and triggering a blast and ball of fire. Video shared on social media showed what appeared to be an unmanned aerial vehicle crashing into the oil refinery, in what would be an embarrassing penetration of Russia’s air defence systems. Vasily Golubev, the governor of the Rostov region, appeared to confirm the incident, writing that fragments of two drones had been found on the territory of the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery, where a large fire broke out on Wednesday morning. Both primary crude-oil distillation units at the refinery were down after the attack, but at least one was back online as of Friday, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. One source said: The refinery is back online after the fire. June refining will be little affected, while in July they will have maintenance. It is not clear how much it may affect the output. Ukraine will need at least a decade to clear all the mines and explosives from its land and territorial waters after the war, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s state emergency service has said. So far Ukraine has managed to clear 620 sq km of land littered with thousands of explosive devices, including 2,000 bombs dropped from the air, Oleksandr Khorunzhiy said. Nearly 300,000 sq km – roughly half the size of Ukraine’s territory – are still seen as “contaminated”, he said at a news conference. Khorunzhiy said: Up to 10 years, that’s the optimistic figure. Because we don’t know what’s happening on the territories where active combat is ongoing right now. He added: Just imagine the number of bombs that have been dropped on us by the enemy. The first priority was to demine infrastructure, residential areas and roads, and it would take longer to clear woods, rivers and the coastline, he said. A Ukrainian goat has been hailed a national hero after it triggered a string of Russian grenades around a hospital in Zaporizhzhia, injuring at least 40 Russian soldiers. Russian forces were setting up a tripwire and had pinned grenades around the edge of a local hospital in the village of Kinski Rozdory, placing the trap as a “circular defence”, according to Ukraine’s chief intelligence directorate. The goat, who had escaped from a farm, is said to have headed straight for the boobytrap, with the Russian munitions exploding in a chain reaction, injuring dozens of soldiers who were waiting in ambush. Ukraine’s defence intelligence said: As a result of the goat’s ‘chaotic’ movements, the animal ‘disposed of’ several grenades. As a result of a chain reaction, several [Russians] sustained injuries of varying degrees of severity. At least 40 Russian soldiers are thought to have been injured. The condition of the animal is not currently known. The goat has since been hailed as “the Goat of Kyiv”, a reference to the mythical pilot, the Ghost of Kyiv, who is credited to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes during Russia’s invasion of the capital. In a video address to the Glastonbury festival, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on crowds to support Ukraine by sharing his message about Russia’s war on his country. ‘The more people join us in defending freedom and truth, the sooner Russia’s war in Ukraine will end,” he said. The lawyer defending Aiden Aslin, one of two Britons sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court, said they had not yet submitted an appeal because they seemed to be holding out for intervention from the UK. Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were sentenced on charges of “terrorism” by a court that is not internationally recognised earlier this month in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Russian state-owned news agency Tass quoted Pinner’s lawyer, Yulia Tserkovnikova, that the defence attorneys were preparing an appeal, which must be lodged by 8 July. But Pavel Kosovan, defending Aslin, said the appeals had not yet been filed. He told Reuters: I suspect they hope that the British authorities will still contact either the Russian Federation or the Donetsk People’s Republic. Earlier this week, Aslin’s family said he had been told the execution will be carried out. His captures claimed there had been no attempt by UK officials to negotiate on his behalf, Aslin said. Russia has transformed an existing life-threatening wave of food crises into a tsunami by blocking the export of 25m tonnes of grain from Ukraine’s ports, Germany’s foreign minister has said. Speaking at the start of an inter-ministerial food conference in Berlin, a precursor to the G7 meeting in Germany starting this weekend where aid groups will demand a big financial commitment to help Africa, Annalena Baerbock said 345 million people worldwide were currently threatened by food shortages. She said the hunger crisis was building “like a life-threatening wave before us” but it was Russia’s war that had “made a tsunami out of this wave”, and she said Russia was using hunger as a weapon of war. In an international blame game playing out across Africa, Russia claims it is western sanctions that are slowing the flow of Russian food. As many as 25 African countries, including many of the least developed countries, import more than one-third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia, and 15 of them more than half. Her remarks led Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and prime minister, to make a reference to the German starvation tactics in the second world war. He said: “German officials are accusing Russia of using hunger like a weapon. It is amazing to hear this from officials whose country kept Leningrad in blockade for 900 days, where almost 700 thousand people died of starvation.” But Baerbock’s criticism of Russia was backed by Arif Husain, the chief economist at the UN World Food Programme, who said it was not sanctions that were causing the food crisis but war. “We tend to address the symptoms and forget the root cause, and the root cause is war,” he said. Read the full article here. Vladimir Putin said Russia was not responsible for the global food crisis, blaming the west instead for preventing the export of Russian grain. Speaking at a Brics Plus virtual summit that brought together the leaders of 17 countries including China, India, Brazil and South Africa, the Russian leader described the food market as “unbalanced in the most serious way”. Putin accused western countries, in particular the US, of “destabilising global agricultural production” with restrictions on the delivery of fertiliser from Russia and Belarus, and by making it difficult for Moscow to export grain. He said rising prices on agricultural staples such as grain have most affected developing countries, “where bread and flour are a necessary means of survival for the majority of the population”. He dismissed the “hysteria” surrounding grain that has been trapped in Ukrainian ports, and claimed it would not solve any problems on the global grain market. Russia was a “responsible actor” in the global food market, he claimed. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The last Ukrainian forces fighting in the heavily contested eastern city of Sievierodonetsk have been ordered to withdraw in order to avoid being encircled.

The loss of Hirske and several other settlements around it leaves Lysychansk in danger of being enveloped from three sides by advancing Russian forces. No town is safe for residents in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk as fighting intensifies, local officials claim. “There is no place, no town in Donetsk region where it would be safe,” Pavlo Kyrylenko told Agence France-Presse, citing the latest intelligence data. “It is extremely dangerous for residents to stay in any places of the region.” An official in the Russian-installed administration of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region was killed in an apparent assassination when his car exploded as he got into it. Dmitry Savluchenko was head of the families, youth and sports department of the Kherson military-civilian administration. The Kremlin has described the attack as “nothing but an act of terrorism”.

In a video message to festivalgoers, Zelenskiy said Ukrainians would not allow Russia’s war to break them and before it “ruined people’s lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America”. Ukraine is running out of shells for the majority of its artillery in part because of an eight-year-long clandestine Russian campaign of bullying and sabotage, according to Ukrainian experts. Russia spent years targeting Ukrainian and other eastern European ammunition storage facilities and suppliers before launching its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Washington Post reports. Russia is trying but has been unable to target western weapons flowing into Ukraine, including longer-range systems that Kyiv hopes will be decisive on the battlefield, a senior US defence official said. The official also appeared to play down the significance of Russian advances in Ukraine and said a Ukrainian pullback from Sievierodonetsk would allow them to take a better defensive position.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. At least 71,000 Ukrainians have entered the US since March, with Joe Biden’s pledge to welcome 100,000 people fleeing the Russian invasion on track to be met over the summer. So far more than 15,000 Ukrainians have entered the country after being approved for sponsorship through the Uniting for Ukraine program, according to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data reported by NBC. Another 23,000 people have been approved but have not yet made the journey. Travel arrangements are down to the Ukrainians or their sponsors. Since the programme launched in April, sponsors – including friends, relatives, NGOs and church groups – have applied online to support more than 60,000 Ukrainians seeking to enter the country. There are about 1,400 new online applications to sponsor individual Ukrainians, according to a breakdown of figures by the Washington Post. The US has become an increasingly hostile environment for many migrants and refugees in recent years, but Ukrainians have been largely welcomed without controversy. Read the full story here. Germany’s economic minister, Robert Habeck, has admitted the country would face “difficult societal decisions” in the event of a gas shortage. In an interview with Der Spiegel, Habeck said some industries that need gas “will have to be turned off” when there is not enough in Germany. He has raised the alert level under Germany’s emergency gas plan after supplies of gas from Russia were slashed. Last week the Russian energy firm Gazprom reduced deliveries via the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany by 60%, blaming the move on a delayed repair. The reduction had put Germany in a position it had never been in before, Habeck said, with German industries and households reliant on energy imports to meet their needs. Germany would “have to make difficult societal decisions”, Habeck said, adding that there were “no good decisions only less wrong ones”. The consequences for some sectors could be “catastrophic” with the effects felt for “a long time”, the minister said. Russia is trying but has been unable to target western weapons flowing into Ukraine, including longer-range systems that Kyiv hopes will be decisive on the battlefield, a senior US defence official has told Reuters. The official also appeared to play down the significance of Russian advances in Ukraine and said a Ukrainian pullback from Sievierodonetsk would allow them to take a better defensive position, the agency reported. “In moving the Ukrainian armed forces from Sievierodonetsk back, what they are doing is putting themselves in a position where they can better defend themselves,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Russian ministry of defence has repeatedly claimed in its daily operational briefings to have successfully targeted and destroyed foreign-supplied weapons arriving in Ukraine. Neither set of claims have been independently verified. The last Ukrainian forces fighting in the heavily contested eastern city of Sievierodonetsk have been ordered to withdraw in order to avoid being encircled, as fears grow that the neighbouring city of Lysychansk could also fall to Russia within days. The anticipated loss of Sievierodonetsk is the latest battlefield reverse for Kyiv after its defeat in the port city of Mariupol. According to some estimates about 12,000 civilians remain in Sievierodonetsk, out of a prewar population of 160,000. All three bridges offering escape routes west over the Siverskyi Donets River to the twin city of Lysychansk have been destroyed in fighting, and the mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, says the humanitarian situation is critical. The Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Friday: “The situation right now is as such that staying at these destroyed positions just for the sake of being there doesn’t make sense.” He said Ukrainian forces had “received the order to retreat to new positions and continue fighting there”, but did not give further details. Russians were also advancing toward Lysychansk from Zolote and Toshkivka, and Russian reconnaissance units had been conducting forays on the city edges but were driven out by its defenders, he added. Haidai said Sievierodonetsk had been “nearly turned to rubble” by continual bombardment. “All critical infrastructure has been destroyed. Ninety per cent of the city is damaged, 80% [of] houses will have to be demolished.” Read more of Peter Beaumont’s report here: Last Ukrainian forces in Sievierodonetsk ordered to withdraw The UN nuclear watchdog has said it is increasingly concerned about the welfare of Ukrainian staff at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said: “The IAEA is aware of recent reports in the media and elsewhere indicating a deteriorating situation for Ukrainian staff at the country’s largest nuclear power plant.” Reuters reports it added it was “increasingly concerned about the difficult conditions facing staff”. It said two units at the plant had been refuelled in recent months, and this would require a physical inspection. Ukraine has previously objected to the idea that the IAEA might visit and inspect the plant, Europe’s largest, while it is under Russian occupation, because of the legitimacy that would confer on the current operators. G7 foreign ministers called on Russia to “cease its attacks and threatening actions” and to unblock the Ukrainian Black Sea ports for food exports. Russia is exacerbating food insecurity with its blockades and bombing attacks on key infrastructure in Ukraine, they said in a statement. Foreign ministers from the G7 countries agreed that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had brought about the current global food crisis and that Moscow was responsible for the matter, Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, told reporters. Meanwhile, the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said the world was facing “an unprecedented global hunger crisis” with a “real risk” of multiple famines this year. There could be no effective solution to the crisis unless Ukraine and Russia, which produce about 29% of global wheat exports, find a way to properly resume trade, he said. Guterres did not elaborate on talks with Russia and Ukraine in Turkey to discuss a UN plan over a possible Black Sea corridor for exporting Ukrainian grains, saying: “Public statements could hinder success.” Ukraine says Russian forces are attempting to surround the embattled city of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine and are mounting assaults on its sister city of Sievierodonetsk to establish full control, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, declined to comment on the governor’s earlier remarks that Ukrainian troops would “have to be withdrawn” from Sievierodonetsk. Information was “closed to the public”, he told reporters. Ukraine is running out of shells for the majority of its artillery in part because of an eight-year-long clandestine Russian campaign of bullying and sabotage, according to Ukrainian experts. Russia is firing more than 60,000 shells per day, which is 10 times more than the Ukrainians, according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maylar. Most of Ukraine’s artillery relies on the same 122mm- and 152mm-calibre rounds that Russia uses, but outside of Russia very little supply exists, the Washington Post reports. Ukraine’s shortage of shells is in large part because Russia spent years targeting Ukrainian and other eastern European ammunition storage facilities and suppliers before launching its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the paper reports. A “shadow war” is taking place for the limited number of 152mm shells on the global market, the paper said. According to an arms broker, officials in an eastern European country were unable to purchase artillery rounds because Russians had warned them that they would “kill them if they sold anything to the Ukrainians”. Countries that still have stocks of 152mm rounds are largely ex-Soviet nations and some African and Middle Eastern countries, many of which are hesitant to sell to Ukraine because of their close ties with Russia. In some cases, Ukraine thought it had made a deal to buy these shells but then a Russian-backed buyer would swoop in at the last minute and aggressive outbid, the arms broker said. Malyar told the paper that “the Russians are working very hard to ensure that we can’t sign contracts for this — and then if we sign a contract, to prevent us from getting the shells delivered here”. According to military analysts, Russia has long known that in a drawn-out war of attrition against Ukraine, Kyiv would risk running out of ammunition. A former Ukrainian defence minister, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, said there were “constant discussions that we need to produce the ammunition ourselves”. Ukrainian officials suspect Russian and separatist saboteurs as well as Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, were engaged in a campaign across Europe and inside Ukraine to destroy arms depots and suppress the supply of munitions to Ukraine, the paper reports. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed crowds at Glastonbury festival and asked them to “spread the truth about Russia’s war” and “prove that freedom always wins”. In a video message to festivalgoers, Zelenskiy said people in Ukraine wanted to “live the life as we used to, enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer”. Zelenskiy said: But we cannot do that because the most terrible has happened. Russia has stolen our peace. Ukrainians would not allow Russia’s war to break them and before it “ruined people’s lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America”, adding that “they are all under threat now”. Zelenskiy said: That is why I turn to you for support. Glastonbury is the greatest concentration of freedom these days and I ask you to share this feeling with everyone whose freedom is under attack. Spread the truth about Russia’s war. Help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of this war. He finished the video address by saying that time was “priceless” and “every day measured in human lives”. A district south of the city of Lysychansk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region has been “fully occupied” by Russian forces, a local Ukrainian official said. Speaking on television, the municipal head of Hirske, Oleksiy Babchenko, said: Unfortunately, as of today … the entire Hirske district is occupied. There are some insignificant, local battles going on at the outskirts, but the enemy has entered. From the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske: Lysychansk is the last major Ukrainian-controlled city in the eastern region of Luhansk. The loss of Hirske and several other settlements around it leaves Lysychansk in danger of being enveloped from three sides by advancing Russian forces. Russia’s defence ministry said it had encircled about 2,000 Ukrainian troops, including 80 foreign fighters, at Hirske. It has not been possible to independently verify this claim. More from the Kremlin’s Dmitry Peskov, who said he could not comment on a report that Germany was looking at expropriating part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The magazine Der Spiegel reported that Germany’s economy ministry was considering converting parts of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, built by Russia’s Gazprom, into a connection for a liquefied natural gas terminal on the Baltic Sea coast. If Germany took concrete steps to do so, those would be a matter for lawyers, Peskov told reporters. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has been at his regular briefing, where he said the decision by the European Union to grant Ukraine official candidate status was a “domestic” matter. Peskov said Russia’s relations with the European bloc would be “very difficult to spoil further”. He said: It is very important for us that all these processes do not bring more problems to us and more problems in the relations of these countries with us. Turning to Moldova, which was also granted EU candidate status this week, Peskov said the ex-Soviet country “wants to become European more than the Europeans themselves”. He added: It seems to them that the more anti-Russian they seem, the more Europeans should like them. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The battle for two key cities in eastern Ukraine is edging towards “a fearsome climax” as Russian forces attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops defending Lysychansk, officials say. Russia’s efforts to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk – the two remaining cities under Ukrainian control in Luhansk – have turned into a bloody war of attrition, with both sides inflicting heavy casualties. Moscow, over the last two weeks, has managed to make steady gains. Ukrainian troops defending Sievierodonetsk will “have to be withdrawn”, the regional governor confirmed this morning. “Remaining in positions smashed to pieces over many months just for the sake of staying there does not make sense,” Sergey Haidai told Ukrainian television. Ukrainian troops have, however, repelled an attack on the southern outskirts of Lysychansk, according to Haidai. No town is safe for residents in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk as fighting intensifies, local officials claim. “There is no place, no town in Donetsk region where it would be safe,” Pavlo Kyrylenko told Agence France-Presse, citing the latest intelligence data. “It is extremely dangerous for residents to stay in any places of the region.” An official in the Russian-installed administration of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region was killed in an apparent assassination when his car exploded as he got into it. Dmitry Savluchenko was head of the families, youth and sports department of the Kherson military-civilian administration. The Kremlin has described the attack as “nothing but an act of terrorism”. European leaders granted Ukraine candidate status late on Thursday, in a historic decision that opens the door to EU membership for the war-torn country and deals a blow to Vladimir Putin. EU leaders meeting in Brussels approved Ukraine’s candidate status nearly four months after the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, launched his country’s bid to join the bloc in the early days of the Russian invasion. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, declared it was “a good day for Europe”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was historic decision that sent “a strong signal towards Russia in the current geopolitical context”. Zelenskiy welcomed the move, saying: “Ukraine’s future is in the EU.” He added: “It’s a victory … we have been waiting for 120 days and 30 years,” referring to the duration of the war and the decades since Ukraine became independent on the breakup of the Soviet Union. “And now we will defeat the enemy.” Moscow’s foreign ministry blamed the United States for a Lithuanian ban on sanctioned goods crossing from the Russian mainland to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Lithuania has prevented goods that are banned by EU sanctions from transiting its territory by rail. Russia has threatened repercussions. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said Europe needs to ramp up efforts to cut its dependency from Russian fossil fuel imports. The US will send another $450m in military aid to Ukraine, including some additional medium-range rocket systems. The latest package includes four high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and tens of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition as well as patrol boats, Pentagon officials announced on Thursday. With the latest shipments, the US contribution to Ukraine’s military will amount to $6.1bn so far, the White House spokesperson John Kirby said. More than 150 cultural sites in Ukraine have been partially or totally destroyed, according to a Unesco report. The damage includes 70 religious buildings, 30 historical buildings, 18 cultural centres, 15 monuments, 12 museums and seven libraries. Ukraine is recording 200 to 300 war crimes committed by Russian forces on its territory every day, the prosecutor general has claimed. “War crimes are our trouble. Every day we have 200 to 300 of them … We have a duty: when there is a crime, we have to start an investigation,” Iryna Venediktova told Ukrainian television. The Kremlin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov has responded to the news of that car bomb attack in occupied Kherson which appears to have claimed the life of Dmitry Savluchenko, a member of the Russian-imposed administration there. Peskov is quoted by Tass as saying: I can only say: our military is there, and, of course, this terrorist activity requires special attention. These are nothing but acts of terrorism. And, accordingly, they can only be treated that way An official in the Russian-installed administration of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region was killed in an apparent assassination, the deputy head of the administration has told Reuters. Dmitry Savluchenko, head of the families, youth, and sports department of the Kherson military-civilian administration, was killed in a bomb blast. Russia’s Tass news agency said there were two burnt-out cars in a courtyard of Kherson, the regional capital where the blast took place, and that the windows of one four-storey house had been shattered. RIA Novosti are reporting that the car was blown up when Savluchenko got into it. Kherson sits just north-west of the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula and was occupied during the first week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began in February. Savluchenko’s reported death has been hailed by some on social media, who described him as “local traitor”. He had, it is claimed, run pro-Russian youth groups in the region, before being appointed to the new administration. There are some unverified images of the scene of the explosion on social media. Olaf Scholz has said Europe needs to ramp up efforts to cut its dependency from Russian fossil fuel imports. Reuters quotes the German chancellor telling reporters in Brussels: “All together, we are very, very well prepared for the difficult challenge linked to Russian fossil fuel imports. This is an effort that we need to speed up further now – and of course this is linked to big challenges but we will support each other.” He said the bloc had imposed sanctions on Russian coal and oil at an early stage, and had as well worked on adjusting its infrastructure so that European countries can import gas from other countries, too. Moscow’s foreign ministry on Friday blamed the US for a Lithuanian ban on sanctioned goods crossing from the Russian mainland to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Lithuania has prevented goods that are banned by EU sanctions from transiting its territory by rail. Russia has threatened repercussions. The foreign ministry also said in a statement that it was “impossible” to hold expert level consultations with Washington on a number of bilateral issues that had been due to take place in the near future. Reuters notes it did not specify which issues it was referring to, or when talks were supposed to take place. Here are some of the latest pictures sent to us this morning from Ukraine over the news wires. The Guardian’s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour writes for us this morning: Speaking at a private dinner in London recently, a senior serving British military officer argued the west had no choice but to see Ukraine as just one phase in a decade-long battle with Russia. “If Ukraine wins, Russia will never accept that. If Russia wins, it will go further,” he warned. Yet in Whitehall they fear the “F word” – fatigue – and worry that the west with its TikTok-attention span and bias towards instant gratification does not have the resolve for the years-long sacrifice required to defeat Russia, or even stem the military tide in the villages of eastern Ukraine. That anxiety is shared by Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, who in a speech to marketing professionals in Cannes this week pleaded with them to use their creative ingenuity to keep the world focused on his country’s struggle: “Don’t let the world switch to something else,” he said. Read more of Patrick Wintour’s analysis: Why the west risks condemning Ukraine to slow strangulation The military channel of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has posted to Telegram to to say that the Russian Federation has opened up criminal cases against large numbers of commanders of brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces. It then goes on to say: As a result of the shelling of the cities of Donetsk, Dokuchaevsk, Makeevka, Gorlovka and Svetlodarsk, as well as the settlements of Vladimirovka, Zaitsevo, Yasinovka and Ivanovka of the DPR, two civilians were killed, five civilians were injured, 30 houses and civilian infrastructure were damaged, including a school building As a result of artillery attacks in the cities of Popasnaya and Stakhanov, a civilian was injured in the LPR [the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic], and the equipment of a water pumping station was damaged. The messages says that “according to the investigation, in the period from 22 June to 23 June, 2022, [the named] servicemen gave and executed criminal orders for targeted artillery attacks from heavy weapons on civilian infrastructure.” The claims have not been independently verified. There are accusations and counter-accusations flying across Telegram this morning. The official Ukrainian account for the occupied city of Mariupol is accusing Russian forces there of building fortifications “under the guise of residential buildings”. It quotes mayor Vadym Boychenko saying: The occupiers begin to build alleged residential buildings. The works are underway in the north-western part, almost on the outskirts of the city. That is, from the approximate direction of a counter-offensive. There is information from Mariupol residents that the occupiers are immediately digging trenches and deploying equipment behind these new buildings. At the same time, Rodion Miroshnik, the ambassador to Russia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, has claimed of a missile shot down overnight that “based on the flight path and calculated data, the target was the administration of the head of the Luhansk People’s Republic.” Neither of the sets of claims have been independently verified. Russia is the only UN member state to recognise the Luhansk People’s Republic as a legitimate authority. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just posted another comment on the decision of the EU to grant Ukraine candidate country status to Telegram. He writes: It is officially recognized that Ukraine is not a bridge, not a pillow between the West and Russia, not a buffer between Europe and Asia, not a sphere of influence, not a “grey” zone, not a transit territory. Not the border between orcs and elves. Ukraine is a future equal partner for at least 27 EU countries. Ukraine is a candidate for accession to the European Union! Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, has given an interview to state television in Belarus, and the Russian foreign ministry has put out what they regard as the key lines on social media, with Lavrov talking about “cancel culture” again. It quotes Lavrov saying: The West fears honest competition. Hence, a desire to cancel the culture of any country that stands on its own, nationally-oriented positions. When at last the Ukrainians have the grace to suggest resuming the diplomatic process, we will see what situation has emerged on the ground. Ukraine tried to build its sovereignty by cancelling its own history. The West encouraged that approach and that conceptual vision of the Ukrainian state just to harm Russia. Ukrainian troops defending the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk will “have to be withdrawn”, the regional governor confirmed this morning. “Remaining in positions smashed to pieces over many months just for the sake of staying there does not make sense,” Sergey Haidai told Ukrainian television. Haidai earlier released a morning report to Telegram, writing: Unfortunately, we will have to remove our military from Sievierodonetsk, because staying in broken positions makes no sense - the number of dead is growing.” The governor added that 90% of homes in Sievierodonetsk had been damaged or destroyed. Ukrainian troops have repelled an attack on the southern outskirts of Lysychansk, according to the region’s governor. The city of Lysychansk is the last fully Ukrainian-controlled city in the region of Luhansk and has been a target for Russian forces in recent weeks. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, one of two in the eastern Donbas, took to his Telegram account early this morning, saying: The attack on Lysychansk was repulsed ... the bodies of two victims were found.” Haidai said Lysychansk and the neighbouring village of Borivske were hit by Russian air strikes overnight resulting in multiples houses being destroyed. He added that a Russian offensive in the Borivskyi area was also successfully stopped. Russia had, however, taken control of the village of Mykolaivka, located near a key highway to Lysychansk, which has been the focus of heavy fighting, he added. The battle for two key cities in eastern Ukraine is edging towards “a fearsome climax” as Russian forces attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops defending Lysychansk, officials say. Russia’s efforts to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk – the two remaining cities under Ukrainian control in Luhansk – have turned into a bloody war of attrition, with both sides inflicting heavy casualties. Moscow, over the last two weeks, has managed to make steady gains. “The fighting is entering a sort of fearsome climax”, Oleksiy Arestovych said. Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops defending Lysychansk, senior Ukrainian defence official Oleksiy Gromov said in a briefing on Thursday. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, one of two in the eastern Donbas, added that Russian forces had been successful in their advances. He said that enemy forces had captured Loskutivka, a settlement to the south of Lysychansk, which threatened to isolate Ukrainian troops. The official also said that all Lysychansk was within reach of Russian fire and that Ukrainian troops there might retreat to new positions to avoid being trapped. “In order to avoid encirclement, our command could order that the troops retreat to new positions,” Haidai said in a post on Telegram. The Russian state news agency, Tass, cited Russian-backed separatists saying Lysychansk was surrounded and cut off from supplies after Russia captured a road linking the city to Ukrainian-held territories. Zelenskiy immediately welcomed the move to grant Ukraine EU candidate status, calling it “a unique and historic moment” in relations with the 27-nation bloc. “Ukraine’s future is in the EU,” he tweeted. “It’s a victory,” he later added on Instagram. “We have been waiting for 120 days and 30 years,” he said, referring to the duration of the war and the decades since Ukraine became independent on the breakup of the Soviet Union. “And now we will defeat the enemy.” In a televised address shortly after the announcement from Brussels, Zelenskiy said: I believe this is what will always be the starting point of Europe’s new history. Europe without division. Europe without ‘grey’ zones. Europe that is truly united and that knows how to defend itself, its values, its future. Today you have adopted one of the most important decisions for Ukraine in all 30 years of independence of our state. However, I believe this decision is not only for Ukraine. This is the biggest step towards strengthening Europe that could be taken right now, in our time and in such difficult conditions, when the Russian war is testing our ability to preserve freedom and unity.” European leaders granted Ukraine candidate status late on Thursday, in a historic decision that opens the door to EU membership for the war-torn country and deals a blow to Vladimir Putin. EU leaders meeting in Brussels approved Ukraine’s candidate status nearly four months after the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, launched his country’s bid to join the bloc in the early days of the Russian invasion. Moldova was also given candidate status. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, declared it was “a good day for Europe”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was historic decision that sent “a strong signal towards Russia in the current geopolitical context”. The move from applicant to candidate usually takes years, but the EU has dramatically accelerated the process, amid outrage over the brutality of the unprovoked Russian attack, and to show solidarity with Ukraine’s defenders. “Ukraine is going through hell for a simple reason: its desire to join the EU,” von der Leyen had tweeted on the eve of the summit. The commission last week called on EU leaders to grant Ukraine’s candidate status. Earlier, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said candidate status would “draw a line under decades of ambiguity and set it in stone: Ukraine is Europe, not part of the ‘Russian world’”. Ukraine’s ambassador to the EU, Vsevolod Chentsov, said earlier this week that the EU had moved at “lightning speed” by its standards. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you as we continue to report all the latest news from Ukraine. Here are all the major developments as of 8am in Kyiv. The European Union has approved the application of Ukraine to become a candidate country for admission to the 27-strong bloc in a step Kyiv and Brussels hailed as an “historic moment”. EU leaders meeting in Brussels followed the recommendation of the European Commission, which was made on 17 June. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, immediately welcomed the move, saying: “Ukraine’s future is in the EU.” “It’s a victory … we have been waiting for 120 days and 30 years,” he added, referring to the duration of the war and the decades since Ukraine became independent on the breakup of the Soviet Union. “And now we will defeat the enemy.” The US will send another $450m in military aid to Ukraine, including some additional medium-range rocket systems. The latest package includes four high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and tens of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition as well as patrol boats, Pentagon officials announced on Thursday. With the latest shipments, the US contribution to Ukraine’s military will amount to $6.1bn so far, White House spokesperson, John Kirby, added. Russian forces captured two villages in eastern Ukraine and are fighting for control of a key highway in a campaign to cut supply lines and encircle frontline Ukrainian forces, according to British and Ukrainian military officials. The battle for two key cities in eastern Ukraine is edging towards “a fearsome climax”, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, has said. Russia is now believed to control all of Sievierodonetsk with the exception of the Azot chemical plant. No town is safe for residents in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk as fighting intensifies, local officials claim. “There is no place, no town in Donetsk region where it would be safe,” Pavlo Kyrylenko told Agence France-Presse, citing latest intelligence data. “It is extremely dangerous for residents to stay in any places of the region.” The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Britain was willing to assist with de-mining operations off Ukraine’s southern coast. Asked if Britain was ready to help Ukraine de-mine the area, Johnson said: “Yes, I don’t want to get into the technical or military details, but you can take it from what we have already done in supplying equipment to the Ukrainians to help themselves protect that we are certainly talking to them at a technical level to help de-mine Odesa.” The UK is also offering its expertise to help escort Ukraine’s grain from its ports, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said. Boris Johnson added Britain was considering offering insurance to ships to move millions of tonnes of grain stuck in the country, telling Reuters: “What the UK possibly has to offer, most of all, is expertise when it comes to maritime insurance, and a lot of expertise in moving goods through should we say contested areas of the sea.” More than 150 cultural sites in Ukraine have been partially or totally destroyed, according to a Unesco report. The damage includes 70 religious buildings, 30 historical buildings, 18 cultural centres, 15 monuments, 12 museums and seven libraries. Ukraine is recording 200 to 300 war crimes committed by Russian forces on its territory every day, the prosecutor general has claimed. “War crimes are our trouble. Every day we have 200 to 300 of them … We have a duty: when there is a crime, we have to start an investigation,” Iryna Venediktova told Ukrainian television. Ukraine has held a preliminary hearing in its first trial of a Russian soldier charged with raping a Ukrainian woman during Moscow’s invasion – the first of what could be dozens of such cases. The suspect, Mikhail Romanov, 32, who will be tried in absentia, is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region outside Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while threatening her and her child. The Russian navy has been given orders to lay mines at the ports of Odesa and Ochakiv, and has already mined the Dnieper River, as part of a blockade of Ukrainian grain exports, according to newly declassified US intelligence. The US embassy in Russia has been pressing the Kremlin this week to reveal the whereabouts of two Alabama men captured in Ukraine, according to the mother of one of the taken Americans. Lois “Bunny” Drueke also said that her son, Alexander Drueke, and the other captured US military veteran, Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, were not mercenaries but volunteers, pushing back on statements from a Kremlin spokesperson who said the American pair were facing execution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/14/volodymyr-zelenskiy-us-congress-address-mig-jets","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-14T18:03:00Z","webTitle":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy expected to urge jet transfer in address to US Congress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/volodymyr-zelenskiy-us-congress-address-mig-jets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/14/volodymyr-zelenskiy-us-congress-address-mig-jets","fields":{"headline":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy expected to urge jet transfer in address to US Congress","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, will address Congress on Wednesday in what could prove his most powerful plea yet for the west to take a tougher line against Vladimir Putin. Zelenskiy is expected to use the virtual address to urge members of the House of Representatives and Senate to intensify pressure on Joe Biden to allow the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a joint letter to members: “The Congress, our country and the world are in awe of the people of Ukraine, who have shown extraordinary courage, resilience and determination in the face of Russia’s unprovoked, vicious and illegal war.” They added: “The Congress remains unwavering in our commitment to supporting Ukraine as they face Putin’s cruel and diabolical aggression, and to passing legislation to cripple and isolate the Russian economy as well as deliver humanitarian, security and economic assistance to Ukraine. “We look forward to the privilege of welcoming President Zelenskiy’s address to the House and Senate and to convey our support to the people of Ukraine as they bravely defend democracy.” Zelenskiy, who will speak at 9am Washington time on Wednesday, has been seeking to drum up support with video briefings of foreign audiences. Last week he received a standing ovation from the British parliament and echoed William Shakespeare (“The question for us now is: ‘To be or not to be’”) and Winston Churchill (“We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets”). On Tuesday, the TV actor and comedian turned resistance leader, who has proved adept at communications under siege, is scheduled to address the Canadian parliament in Ottawa. He is also due to speak to Israel’s parliament at some stage. On 5 March, dressed in a military-green T-shirt and seated beside a Ukrainian flag, Zelenskiy spoke to more than 280 members of the House and Senate in a video call. He is said to have made a “desperate plea” for aircraft to fight Russian invaders. Most members of Congress back the White House’s refusal to attempt to impose a “no-fly zone” that could entail US pilots firing on Russians and trigger a wider conflict. Chris Murphy, chairman of the Senate appropriations homeland security subcommittee, told the Hill: “This is the most dangerous moment since the Cuban missile crisis. We have never been this close to direct conflict with Russia. “We made the right decision to openly support the Ukrainians but we just should understand the unprecedented moment that we’re living in today where we’re openly funding war against a nuclear power.” But there is a growing split over Poland’s offer to send Soviet-style MiG-29 fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots are capable of flying, to Ukraine via a US airbase in Germany. The White House and Pentagon have rejected the proposal, wary that an increasingly reckless Putin could perceive it as escalatory and saying it raised “serious concerns” for the entire Nato alliance. Republicans and some Democrats say Zelenskiy’s request should be met. Mitt Romney, a Republican senator from Utah, said last week: “He has asked us for aircraft – specifically MiGs. We need to get him those MiGs. It is a bipartisan message.” Rob Portman, a Republican senator from Ohio visiting the Ukraine-Poland border, told CNN: “What we’ve heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want them badly. They want the ability to have better control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance. I don’t understand why we’re not doing it.” The Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, from Minnesota, was also on the visit. She said she had spoken to Biden “about 10 days ago” about the fighters, adding: “I’d like to see the planes over there.” The Democratic-controlled Congress approved $13.6bn in humanitarian and security aid to Ukraine last Thursday, as part of a $1.5tn spending bill that funds US government operations through 30 September. The US and allies have imposed broad sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Biden has announced a US ban on Russian oil imports, seen as politically risky amid soaring gas prices. Last Friday the president took more steps to punish Russia economically, targeting trade and shutting down development funds while announcing a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds. On Saturday he authorised $200m in additional military equipment for Ukraine. About 59% of Americans believe Biden has been making the right decisions when it comes to the situation in Ukraine, including more than one in three Republicans, according to Navigator Research. However, asked whether they approve of Biden’s handling of the issue, Americans are more polarised, with 49% disapproving and 43% approving. Biden’s predecessor as president, Donald Trump, again refused to condemn Putin at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday. “It happens to be a man that is just driven, he’s driven to put it together,” Trump said, while claiming the war would never have happened if he was still in the White House. On Monday a fourth round of talks between Ukraine and Russia were held via videoconference amid deadly air strikes in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. At the weekend, Russian airstrikes killed 35 people at a military base near Yavoriv, outside Lviv – perilously close to the frontier with Poland, a Nato member. In a video address, Zelenskiy warned: “If you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory, on Nato territory, on the homes of Nato citizens.” He urged Nato to impose a no-fly zone – a request he is likely to repeat to Congress on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/08/putin-ukraine-threats-russia-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-08T12:00:02Z","webTitle":"Putin’s Ukraine threats may backfire on Russia, says energy chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/putin-ukraine-threats-russia-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/08/putin-ukraine-threats-russia-energy","fields":{"headline":"Putin’s Ukraine threats may backfire on Russia, says energy chief","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin’s threats over Ukraine could backfire to damage the Russian economy, the head of the International Energy Agency has warned, as any escalation of the current tension would cause a “seismic” upheaval of the EU energy market that would have “more consequences for Russia” than for Europe. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the global energy watchdog, said that if Russia reduced gas supplies further it would prompt European countries to seek urgently to shift away from Russian gas, which would hurt Putin economically. “If Russia stops the gas supply to Europe, it could have a seismic impact on European energy. [Russia] has to consider the consequences if existing oil and gas supplies to Europe are halted,” Birol told the Guardian. “Failure to maintain [supplies] would shatter Russia’s reputation as a reliable partner and that would be a tectonic shift. Russia would be seen as a threat and that would have far-reaching consequences for European economies, but even more consequences for Russia. Europe would choose a strategy to diverge from Russia,” he predicted. He said the next two months would be “critical” in deciding how the current energy crisis played out. A mild winter would ease the pressure, but if not then Europe would face stark foreign policy choices on how to deal with Russia, he said. Birol has previously said Putin was exacerbating the gas crisis in Europe for political reasons, as Russian gas supplies to the EU had dropped 25% in recent months despite increasing demand. “I hope this was only a coincidence,” he added. The worst outcomes could still be avoided, he said: “Of course, we do not know what will happen if this political tension goes beyond being tension. I hope there will be dialogue, and that there will be no major geopolitical distortions.” Birol, one of the world’s foremost energy economists, also sharply criticised as “irresponsible” those who have claimed the high energy prices in the UK, Europe and the US should be blamed on the shift to low-carbon power. “Claims that the current volatility is owing to renewable energy are misleading to say the least, and are not based in fact,” he said. “This is not a clean energy crisis, or a renewable energy crisis. These claims are irresponsible and are being used to attack public support for the net zero transition.” He added: “Countries should understand that the current situation is not happening because they have a lot of clean energy policies, but because we do not have enough clean energy policies.” Renewable energy helps to reduce the volatility in energy markets, which was being caused by high gas prices and gas supply issues, he said. The impact of the gas price was at least eight times bigger in raising energy prices than the impact of the price that some countries have put on carbon, he added. People making false claims that the shift to net zero was raising energy prices either did not know the facts, or were deliberately attacking clean energy in service of the vested interests of fossil fuel suppliers, Birol said. He urged governments not to give way to those calling for stronger investment in fossil fuels as the remedy for high prices. “That would be myopic, and against the fundamental economic interests of these countries,” he warned. “The cure would be worse than the disease.” Birol was also optimistic that the resurgence of coal use, particularly in China, would prove to be temporary. “The production increases [in coal] are strong, but mainly driven by post-pandemic demand and high gas prices,” he said. He said the economics of renewable energy were still an attractive investment, accounting for more than 90% of the new power capacity installed last year globally. To reduce the pressure of high gas prices, governments should “accelerate efforts on renewable energy and energy efficiency”, he said. The world did not need large amounts of gas power to make up for the intermittency of renewable energy, as some have claimed, he said, as this could be achieved with more investments in the electricity grid to balance supply and demand, and in battery storage, as well as hydroelectricity, nuclear power and using carbon capture and storage technology with any gas-fired power stations that remained. Hydrogen could also replace gas in some applications, he predicted. Despite the current energy price, Birol said he was “more optimistic” about the world’s chances of tackling the climate crisis and moving to net zero emissions since the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, where governments affirmed their commitments to reach net zero emissions and hold global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, though few yet have detailed plans. “Many governments see the current high energy prices as confirmation of their long-term plans to reduce the share of fossil fuels,” he said. “Of course, high energy prices are taken by some to push back on and reduce public support for the net zero transition. But I think this is a temporary thing. The long-term structural trends are in favour of clean energy options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-key-points-jeremy-hunt-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T11:35:14Z","webTitle":"Autumn statement 2022: key points at a glance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-key-points-jeremy-hunt-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-key-points-jeremy-hunt-budget","fields":{"headline":"Autumn statement 2022: key points at a glance","bodyText":"Hunt’s opening remarks Jeremy Hunt says the government will deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild the UK economy. The chancellor says his priorities are stability, growth and public services, and is providing “fair solutions” despite taking “difficult decisions”. Aubrey Allegretti, political correspondent: The chancellor opens his autumn statement, which has been nicknamed the “memorial service for Trussonomics”, by seeking to pin the blame for the cost of living crisis on “unprecedented global headwinds”. In a nod to the market chaos that plagued the last government, Hunt says his statement will deliver stability – but he wants to ensure the Conservatives are not just seen as a party of managed decline, stressing he will also seek to grow the economy. Growth The chancellor says forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility show the economy will grow by 4.2% this year. Hunt says the economy is already in recession, with higher energy prices explaining the majority of the revision in growth forecasts. GDP would then shrink by 1.4% next year, before rising by 1.3% in 2024, 2.6% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026. In March, the OBR had forecast growth of 3.8% for 2022 and 1.8% for 2023. The economy grew by 7.5% in 2021, after a fall of 11% in 2020 – the biggest decline for 300 years – during the first wave of the pandemic. Aubrey Allegretti: Hunt leans on the OBR, saying it has adjudicated that “higher energy prices” explain the majority of lower-than-expected growth forecasts. And to calm jitters among MPs about fears of another recession, he says the International Monetary Fund expects one-third of the world economy to be in recession this year or next. Hunt drops his first mention of “difficult decisions”, laying the ground for the harsh measures and stressing that those who believe they are unnecessary are “not being straight with the British people”. Borrowing Hunt says borrowing in the current financial year, 2022-23, will be 7.1% of GDP. In cash terms, the OBR estimates the budget deficit – the gap between spending and income – is £177bn in 2022-23. In its previous forecasts in March, the OBR had estimated borrowing would be 3.9% of GDP, or £99.1bn in cash terms, in 2022-23. The chancellor says borrowing is “more than halved” by the actions in the autumn statement. Public sector net debt is forecast to peak at 97.6% of GDP in 2025-26, and then to fall gradually to 97.3% of GDP by 2027-28. Hunt announces two new fiscal rules: underlying debt must fall as a percentage of GDP within five years; and public sector borrowing must be below 3% of GDP. Aubrey Allegretti: One of the key audiences Hunt must satisfy are the money markets, which will be hanging on his every word. Hunt’s new fiscal rules on borrowing are designed to be evidence of his claim that the UK “will always pay its way”. Personal taxes The chancellor announces a range of tax threshold freezes, including for income tax and inheritance tax for a further two years, on top of an existing four-year freeze, to April 2028. Dividend allowances will be cut. The annual exempt allowance for capital gains tax will also be cut. Hunt says the changes still leave Britain with more generous allowances than several other leading nations. The threshold for the 45p additional rate of tax will be cut from £150,000 to £125,140. Hunt says electric vehicles will no longer be exempt from vehicle excise duty from 2025. Aubrey Allegretti: Though the news has left the Conservative benches behind him muted and looking glum, Hunt tries to set out the positives so they have reason to leave the Commons chamber with some lines of defence to take with the media and frustrated constituents. He says the changes will still leave the UK with the most generous tax-free allowances of any G7 country, adding that tax take will increase by just 1% over the next five years. Business taxes Windfall taxes will raise £14bn, including a new temporary 45% levy on electricity producers. Hunt says the government will soften a blow for businesses on business rates with an almost £14bn tax cut on business rates, this will benefit about 700,000 businesses. Employment allowance will be retained at a higher level of £5,000. Aubrey Allegretti: Hunt is wary of the Conservatives’ long-cherished mantle as the “party of business”, and stresses that 40% of all firms will continue to pay no national insurance contributions at all. Seeking to head off a possible Labour attack line, he says the government will continue pursuing tax avoidance and evasion. Many of the announcements he is making relate to years long after the next general election – so some of the pain will not be felt for years to come. (Or even ever, if the Conservatives end up being kicked out of government after 2025.) Public spending Hunt says government spending will continue to increase in real terms every year for the next five years but at a slower rate. The chancellor says “public spending discipline” must be shown through a “challenging period”. Existing departmental spending under the 2021 spending round will be kept. Then departmental spending will grow at 1% a year in the three years that follow. He says departments will need to make efficiencies. However, overall spending will “continue to rise in real-terms” for the next five years. Aubrey Allegretti: Voters might wear higher taxes, but they would probably expect better from languishing public services. Hunt nods to that, saying he wants to “protect them as much as we can”. Attempting to dispel any claims his autumn statement offers a return to austerity, Hunt insists public spending will grow – albeit more slowly than the growth in the economy. Foreign aid and climate Hunt says the government will not be able to return foreign aid spending to 0.7% of GDP until the economic conditions allow. It will remain at 0.5% for the remainder of the forecast period. The chancellor says he confirms that, despite economic pressures, the government remains “fully committed” to Cop26, including 68% reduction in UK emissions by 2030. Aubrey Allegretti: Two big concerns about more internationally focused spending have not been completely dampened down by Hunt. He says aid spending will not rise back to 0.7% of GDP target, and says defence spending will stay at at least 2%. Education Hunt says the Treasury will increase the schools budget, with an extra £2.3bn a year. He says in difficult economic circumstances, a Conservative government is investing more in the public service that defines all of our futures. Aubrey Allegretti: Having felt the heat over the weekend from two dozen Tory MPs – including a former education secretary – who demanded Hunt not cut education spending, he puts out that particular fire by saying it will grow by £2.3bn next year and the year after. But how much of that will be left for educating children after pay increases, energy bills and inflation may still worry some. Health and social care The chancellor says social care did an incredible job during the pandemic, but an ageing population is putting massive pressure on their services. Hunt says he wants to free up hospital beds by investing in social care, and will allocate £1bn more next year and £1.7bn a year after, funded by savings from delayed reforms. Patricia Hewitt, the former Labour health secretary, will advise the government on the efficiency of the NHS. Hunt says: “We want Scandinavian quality alongside Singaporean efficiency.” The chancellor says there will be a £3.3bn increase in NHS funding. “That is a Conservative government putting the NHS first,” he says. Aubrey Allegretti: Hunt reminds MPs he is a former health secretary – a role in which he was viewed as unpopular. He seeks to grasp one of the big issues facing the NHS, saying a plan will be drawn up for the number of doctors and nurses needed up to 15 years into the future. In a nod to the frustrations felt by many in the health service given looming strikes, Hunt says he will ensure there is “better retention and productivity improvements”. Delaying the social care cap will disappoint those Tories loyal to Boris Johnson, who promised to “fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared” over three years. Economic growth The chancellor says the government will focus on economic growth, despite having to find budget savings. Energy, infrastructure and innovation will be priorities. “If we want to avoid a doom loop of ever higher taxes and ever lower dynamism, we need economic growth,” he says. Hunt says the government will proceed with a new nuclear power plant at Sizewell C, helping to provide reliable low-carbon power. “It represents the first step on our journey towards energy independence,” he says. The chancellor says he will double investment in energy efficiency of homes and industry by £6bn from 2025. Aubrey Allegretti: “Growth” was Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s watchword – and Hunt is keen to show he has not abandoned that ambition, even if it is being achieved in a manifestly different way. To avoid a “doom loop” of higher taxes and public spending, Hunt says growth remains a priority. The only real loud cheer of the statement comes when the chancellor fires a barb across the dispatch box saying Labour has never been interested in growth. However, his follow-up that “sound money is the rock upon which long-term prosperity rests” sounds more aimed at Truss and Kwarteng. While Hunt stresses the need for more energy resilience, he keeps stumm about the issue dividing many Tory MPs – growing onshore wind. Infrastructure The chancellor says he will not cut capital budgets for the next two years, but then maintain them in cash terms for the next three years. They will not grow as planned but it will still increase. HS2 will be kept, alongside core “northern powerhouse” rail, and new hospitals. Hunt says there will be £600bn of investment over the next five years. He says there will be more devolution deals in England to boost levelling up.. Aubrey Allegretti: Not cutting capital budgets for two years simply takes the government up until the next election – so announcements about them being frozen thereafter essentially shunts the problem until after that point. Off the back of the Tories’ 2019 promise of levelling up, many communities expected infrastructure projects to spring up in their constituencies – so cutting capital budgets would have seriously hampered marginal MPs’ (particularly in the “red wall”) chances of re-election. Innovation Hunt says it would be a “profound mistake” to cut the government’s research and development budget. He says funding will be protected, with an increase to £20bn by 2024-25. The chancellor said he wants to turn Britain into “the world’s next Silicon Valley”. Tariffs will be cut to support business supply chains. Investment zones will be kept, centred on universities in “left behind areas” to help build growth clusters, with further announcements at the spring budget. Hunt says Solvency II reforms, which apply to insurers, will be made to unlock “tens of billions of pounds” in investment. Aubrey Allegretti: Reminding MPs he is a former entrepreneur, Hunt says the government will make the most of “Brexit freedoms” to push ahead with some supply-side reforms by the end of 2023. This again is part of dispelling the doom and gloom around today’s statement – trying to show there is some sunshine despite the “storm” he warns Britain is facing. Cost of living support The chancellor says households and businesses will be provided with support next year. The government’s energy price guarantee will be kept for a further 12 months at an average of £3,000 for a typical household, up from £2,500 at present. The chancellor announces new one-off payments of £900 to households on means-tested benefits, £300 to pensioner households, and £150 for individuals on disability benefit. There will be an additional £1bn funding to enable further extension to household support fund. Hunt says social housing rents will be capped at 7% next year, to avoid rent hikes of up to 11%. The “national living wage” will rise by 9.7% next year to £10.42 an hour. Benefits will rise in line with September’s inflation rate, by 10.1%, costing the government £11bn. The benefit cap will be increased with inflation next year. The pensions triple lock will be kept. Aubrey Allegretti: “Compassion” is the key word Hunt wants his statement to be known for. The September mini-budget disproportionately benefiting the better off went down like a cup of cold sick among some Tory MPs and Truss famously made clear her disdain for “handouts”. But Hunt says energy support payments will be targeted, to help the most vulnerable. One of the biggest sighs of relief on the Tory benches is the chancellor’s promise that benefits will rise in line with inflation – given this had been far from certain. Keeping pensioners happy by ensuring their payments rise at the same level given they cannot work to build their income will also assuage MPs worrying about a high-turnout and Tory-leaning demographic turning away from the party or staying home on election day. Closing comments Aubrey Allegretti: Besides the specific policy measures, there is one final message Hunt is keen to make stick. He wants to avoid the Conservatives being blamed, as happened to Labour during the financial crisis, for the cost of living crisis. “There may be a recession made in Russia but there is a recovery made in Britain,” claims the chancellor, to cries of disbelief from the opposition benches. But as he sits down, the traditional calls for “more” from Tory backbenchers are muted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/31/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-oil-refinery-in-krasnodar-on-fire-belgorod-shelled-says-governor","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-31T16:12:47Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: only 500 of 70,000 residents left in Bakhmut, mayor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/31/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-oil-refinery-in-krasnodar-on-fire-belgorod-shelled-says-governor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/31/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-oil-refinery-in-krasnodar-on-fire-belgorod-shelled-says-governor","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: only 500 of 70,000 residents left in Bakhmut, mayor says","bodyText":"The UN has proposed that Kyiv, Moscow and Ankara start preparatory work for the transit of Russian ammonia through Ukraine as it tries to salvage a deal allowing safe Black Sea grain exports, a source close to the talks has told Reuters. As the preparatory work starts, the UN wants parallel talks to be held on widening the Black Sea deal that was agreed last July to include more Ukrainian ports and other cargoes, said the source. Russia agreed this month to a two-month extension of the deal, but has said the initiative will cease unless an agreement aimed at overcoming obstacles to Russian grain and fertiliser exports is fulfilled. Ukraine and Turkey have agreed to the new proposal, intended to improve operations in the Black Sea grain export corridor, but Russia has not yet responded, the source said. The UN had no immediate comment. The UN and Turkey brokered the Black Sea grain initiative between Russia and Ukraine last July to help tackle a global food crisis aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a leading global grain exporter. Only 500 people are left in Bakhmut, the city in the east of Ukraine which has been subject to heavy fighting in the last year, according to the city’s mayor. The figure from Oleksii Reva, reported by the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN, is startling when compared with its prewar population of 70,000. Both Russia and Ukraine have claimed they are in control of the city in recent weeks. The forces of Wagner group, the Russian paramilitary organisation headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, have been fighting there on Russia’s behalf. Prigozhin has voiced his fury over a lack of supplies. A great piece of analysis here from the Kyiv Post, which has looked in to the cost of the Russian barrage of attacks it has launched on Ukraine in May. Its investigation has found that about 90% of the 500 missiles and drones launched at Ukraine failed, at a cost to the Russians of more than $1.7bn. The news website said that after looking at day-to-day information released by Ukraine’s air force, 563 missiles and Iranian-made Shahed drones were used to attack Ukraine. It said that 533 of them were destroyed by the Ukrainian air force. It includes 401 Shahed-136 drones, which cost about $20,000 each. The bulk of the apparent cost to the Russian government as part of the wider war effort came from the amount spent on missiles. The website admits that it is only data that has been released by Ukraine and has not been independently verified. It adds that “conservative assumptions where it was necessary”. Germany’s government spokesperson has said Ukraine has the right to attack Russian territory as it qualifies as self-defence. In an interview with German newspaper Deutsche Welle, Steffen Hebestreit said: “international law allows Ukraine to carry out strikes on the territory of Russia for the purpose of self-defence”. However Hebestreit said he did not believe German weapons should be used for the attacks. The statement comes a day after a drone attack on Moscow damaged several high-rise buildings. Russia accused Ukraine of orchestrating the attack, but Ukrainian officials have denied responsibility. That morning, Russia launched yet another drone attack against Kyiv, targeting the capital for the 17th time in May. One person was killed, and at least 13 others were injured. A 60-year-old man has been killed in the shelling of Vovchansk in Kharkiv. A statement by the region’s military administration posted on Telegram said: “A 60-year-old man died today in Vovchansk as a result of enemy shelling.” The city is north-east of Kharkiv city and less than 4 miles from the Russian border. The administration also reported that a 52-year-old woman was taken to hospital with shrapnel wounds. More from Emmanuel Macron’s speech to the security forum in Bratislava in Slovakia, as he called on the west to give Ukraine “tangible and credible” security guarantees. Stressing that Ukraine “is today protecting Europe”, Macron said it was in the west’s interest that Kyiv have security assurances from Nato, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. “That is why I’m in favour, and this will be the subject of collective talks in the following weeks … to offer tangible and credible security guarantees to Ukraine,” he added. He said various Nato members could provide these guarantees for the time being as Ukraine waits to join the alliance. “We have to build something between the security provided to Israel and full-fledged membership,” Macron said. The French head of state delivered the speech during a visit to Slovakia. At the Globsec event, focused on regional security issues, comes in the long runup to the Nato summit in Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, on 11 and 12 July. Macron recalled that he once called the western defence alliance “brain dead”, but said Russia’s invasion last year “had jolted Nato awake”. “We need to help Ukraine today with all means to carry out an effective counter-offensive” against Russian forces, Macron said. “It’s what we are currently doing. We have to intensify our efforts because what will happen in the next few months offers a chance even for … a lasting peace.” Macron also called on EU nations to buy European arms and acquire in-depth strike capabilities. “It is up to us Europeans to in the future have our own ability to defend ourselves,” he said. “A Europe of defence, a European pillar within Nato, is indispensable. It’s the only way to be credible … in the long-term,” he said. Macron will next visit Moldova on Thursday where he will meet with fellow European leaders, including from outside the EU. Ukrainian authorities have claimed that 27,000 Ukrainian civilians are being held on Russian territory. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, said during a briefing, reported by the Ukrinform news website: “According to our data, more than 27,000 civilian hostages are being held by the Russian Federation. This is a huge number of our citizens who are actually held captive by the Russians.” Asked whether there had been any progress on the release of UNIAN news agency journalist Dmytro Khilyuk from Russian captivity, the press conference said that there had been no progress. “Unfortunately, he has not returned to Ukraine yet. I will not say that we will return him in the near future. I am used to saying real things,” the ombudsman said. Lubinets said he had repeatedly raised this issue with the Russian side and would continue to raise it. Russia does not plan to declare martial law after Tuesday’s large-scale drone strike on Moscow, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said. His comments came after several leading Russian officials and pro-war figures urged the president, Vladimir Putin, to respond to the attacks by declaring a state of total war. On Tuesday, Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman head of Chechnya whose forces have been fighting in Ukraine, said the Kremlin should declare martial law nationwide and use all its resources in Ukraine “to sweep away that terrorist gang”. The Wagner mercenary group chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, similarly said Moscow had to “mobilise the whole of society right now”. Hardline nationalists have for weeks called on the Kremlin to announce a new round of mobilisation, a widely unpopular move that the Kremlin has so far cavoided. Putin appeared to play down the attack, and Russian state media touted that there was “no panic” in the city after the unprecedented incident. Tuesday’s raids on Moscow were the latest in a series of drone strikes and sabotage operations behind enemy lines that have intensified in recent weeks before a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive. The attacks pale in comparison with Russia’s deadly assaults on Ukrainian cities that have hit large residential buildings or crowded business centres and killed dozens. Read more here: Russia not planning to declare martial law after Moscow drone attacks, says Kremlin Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, has dismissed US statements that it does not want to see the situation in Ukraine escalate, after this week’s drone attack on Moscow. On her Telegram channel, Zakharova said: That’s funny. They broke the house themselves, doused it with gasoline, set fire to it themselves, planted fireworks and firewood themselves, and now they are declaring an ‘unwillingness to escalate’. The ‘war of the west’ in a hybrid format has been going on for a long time. Sweden should become a full member of the Nato military alliance as soon as possible and before the Nato Vilnius summit in July, the Norwegian foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, said on Wednesday. “There is absolutely no reason for holding Sweden back,” Reuters reports she said on the eve of a two-day Nato meeting of foreign ministers in Oslo. A dispatch from Shaun Walker at the Globsec forum in Bratislava, which the French president has addressed this afternoon. It’s the third and final day of the Globsec forum and Emmanuel Macron has given a keynote speech on Ukraine and European security. The speech, as my colleague Patrick Wintour reported this morning, was intended to reassure sceptical central and eastern and European elites that France is not looking to force Ukraine to make concessions at the negotiating table, noting that any peace deal should not involve the acceptance of lost territory. After speaking in French, Macron answered questions from the audience of politicians and diplomats in English. Asked by the Ukrainian MP Maria Mezentseva how the international community should go about ensuring justice is done for Russian war crimes, up to and including the political elite, Macron first said the international community should support attempts to gather evidence, but injected a note of realism when it came to the international criminal court’s arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin. “If in a few months to come we have a window for negotiations … the question will be arbitrage between a trial and a negotiation, and you have to negotiate with the leaders you have de facto, and I think negotiations will be a priority even if you will judge them the next day,” he said. More details here of Ukraine’s shelling of Russia’s Belgorod border region. “In Shebekino, fragments of artillery shells damaged one car and a section of the roadway. There are breakages in the power lines. Operational and emergency services are on the scene,” Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. No casualties have been reported. The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday that it was concerned about reports of shelling in Belgorod, which has repeatedly come under fire from Ukraine’s neighbouring Kharkiv region. The head of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said he has asked prosecutors to investigate “crimes” committed by senior Russian defence officials before and during the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Prigozhin openly feuded with the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and other top officials for month, accusing them of sabotaging Russia’s military by incompetence. “Today I have sent letters to the investigative committee and the prosecutor’s office of the Russian Federation with a request to check on the fact of the commission of a crime during the preparation and during the conduct of the SMO [special military operation] by a host of senior functionaries of the defence ministry,” Reuters quoted Prigozhin as saying. “These letters will not be published due to the fact that the investigative authorities will deal with this.” The defence ministry did not immediately comment. The German government is revoking the licenses of four of the five Russian consulates in the country, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said on Wednesday according to Reuters. The move comes in response to Moscow’s decision to limit the number of German officials in Russia to 350, the spokesperson said, adding that the withdrawal is to be completed by the end of the year. German consulates in Kaliningrad, Ekaterinburg and Novosibirsk will be closed, leaving only the German embassy in Moscow and the consulate in St Petersburg in operation. Ukraine has responded in the latest diplomatic war of words with the EU over the trade bloc’s ban on grain exports. The Ukraine agriculture ministry has said the ban is helping Vladimir Putin. “Continuation of restrictions means putting additional weapons in Putin’s hands against unity in Europe,” it tweeted. “Current restrictions must be cancelled.” Several of Ukraine’s neighbours, including its staunch ally Poland, imposed temporary restrictions on Kyiv’s agricultural products last month. The European agriculture commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, called on Tuesday for restrictions on grain imports imposed by some EU states to be extended at least until the end of October. Hungary has asked them to be extended until 2024. They are scheduled to end on 5 June. Russia has claimed it has destroyed the last major warship of the Ukrainian naval forces, which it said was stationed in the southern port of Odesa. “On 29 May, a high-precision strike by the Russian air force on a ship anchorage site in the port of Odesa destroyed the last warship of the Ukrainian navy, the Yuri Olefirenko,” the Russian army said in its daily briefing. AFP was not able to independently confirm the claim. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian navy declined to comment. The Yuri Olefirenko is a medium-size landing ship for troops and vehicles. Initially named Kirovograd, the ship was renamed in 2016 in honour of a Ukrainian marine killed near Mariupol in 2015. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, decorated its crew in June 2022. Russian politicians have drafted a bill to ban legal or surgical sex changes, as Moscow sharpens its conservative turn during the Ukraine offensive. Russia has for years been an inhospitable environment for anyone whose views differ from the hardline interpretation of “family values” promoted by the Kremlin and the Orthodox church. Pressure had been building on LGBTQ+ activists in recent years but has intensified as troops fight in Ukraine, AFP reports. The conflict is increasingly portrayed in Russia as an existential fight against the “decadent” west. The bill – submitted on Tuesday – would prohibit “medical interventions aimed at changing the sex of a person”, according to the website of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament. This would include “the formation of a person’s primary and (or) secondary sexual characteristics”. Russia has said it will evacuate children from villages near its border with Ukraine, after the region has been shelled for several days. “The situation in (the border village of) Shebekino is worsening,” the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Telegram, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). “We are starting today to evacuate children from the Shebekino and Graivoron districts,” Gladkov said, referring to the most affected border areas. “Today, the first 300 children will be taken to Voronezh” – a city about 155 miles (250km) further into Russia. Shelling overnight in Shebekino injured four people, he said. Russia has already been accused of in effect kidnapping children from the other side of the border, in the east of Ukraine, and rehoming them in Russia. The deportations have been called a war crime by the UN. Drones attacked two oil refineries just 40-50 miles (65-80km) east of Russia’s biggest oil export terminals on Wednesday, sparking a fire at one and causing no damage to the other, according to Russian officials. At around 2am BST a drone struck the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region, causing a fire that was later extinguished, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said. Another drone crashed into the Ilsky refinery, about 40 miles east of Novorossiisk. Five people have been killed and 19 injured in the shelling of a village in Russian-occupied Luhansk region, according to the Telegram channel of Russian-installed officials there. Serhiy Lysak, the governor of Dnipropetrovsk oblast, has reported on Telegram that an eight-year-old child has been injured in the shelling of the village of Mezhyrich near Pavlohrad in his region. The governor of Belgorod, a Russian region that borders Ukraine, has claimed that four people were injured in Ukrainian shelling on a town close to the border. Two people were hospitalised as a result of the artillery strike on Shebekino, Vyacheslav Gladkov said, adding that it was the third time in a week the town had been hit. The Russian security council deputy chair, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Wednesday Britain was Moscow’s “eternal enemy” and that any British officials who facilitated the war in Ukraine could be considered legitimate military targets. Medvedev, the hawkish longtime ally of Vladimir Putin, was responding to the British foreign secretary James Cleverly’s remark that Ukraine had a right to project force beyond its own borders, said Britain’s “goofy officials” should remember that Britain could be “qualified as being at war”. Emmanuel Macron will make a diplomatic push to reassure central and eastern European countries that France understands that the continent’s security environment has been permanently changed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a speech to a security forum in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, on Wednesday, Macron will call for a “strategic awakening” and highlight the work France has done to protect Nato’s eastern flank, including posting 1,250 French troops in Romania and 300 in Estonia. He will also stress the French role in unlocking the supply of battle tanks to Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accused Ukraine on Tuesday of seeking to “frighten” Russians after Moscow was targeted with a large-scale drone attack for the first time in the 15-month war. He said that Ukraine had chosen the path of attempting “to intimidate Russia, Russian citizens [with] attacks on residential buildings” and added that the drone attacks were “clearly a sign of terrorist activity”. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine order by Putin in February 2022, the UN reports that almost 24,000 Ukrainian civilians have died. The Kremlin said on Wednesday President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would hold a meeting in the foreseeable future, although it was not yet agreed when and where the meeting would take place. Putin congratulated his “dear friend” Erdoğan after the latter’s victory in Turkey’s presidential election on Sunday. Reuters notes that Ankara has conducted a diplomatic balancing act since Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February last year, opposing western sanctions on Russia, while retaining close ties with both Moscow and Kyiv, hosting an early attempt at peace talks, and helping to broker the Black Sea grain initiative. Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, reports: Ursula von der Leyen, the EU commission president, speaking at a security conference in Bratislava, suggested Nato members could give Ukraine security guarantees on the way to Nato membership through what she described as member states offering Ukraine deterrence by denial. With a Nato summit in Vilnius in July, debate is intensifying on what form of security guarantees can be provided to Ukraine stopping short of full membership, something that is seen as impossible while Ukraine remains at war with Russia. Ukraine is looking for a clear timetable and milestones but the US is reluctant to make such a commitment. The EU president, without going into details, said examples from history could be used on Ukraine’s future security status, a possible reference to the position of neutrality adopted by Finland after the second world war up until its accession to the EU. She said Nato members could provide a collection of guarantees that together represent deterrence by denial “through military equipment that can fortify Ukraine against future Russian attacks”. What was important, she said, was clarity that “Ukraine’s friends would be there for the long term”. Broadly, deterrence by denial means convincing an adversary that “an attack will not succeed because the defences are strong”, while deterrence by retaliation, Nato’s previous concept, means threatening an adversary to “retaliate for an attack if it is carried out” to force the adversary to refrain from it. The denial strategy was adopted by Nato at its Madrid summit, but the implications for the defence of Ukraine in terms of troop stationing has not been fully spelled out. She once again ruled out a peace plan with Russia based on a frozen conflict, saying the threat of a repeat of Russia’s invasion would cease only when all Russian military and equipment had left Ukrainian soil. She added the EU had realised that it was not enough for the EU simply to tell Ukraine that the door was open for Ukraine’s eventual membership of the EU, but active steps have to be taken by the EU to bring itself closer to applicant states. Here is a recap of what we know about two overnight attacks on oil refineries inside Russia: Drones attacked two oil refineries just 40-50 miles (65-80 km) east of Russia’s biggest oil export terminals on Wednesday, sparking a fire at one and causing no damage to the other, according to Russian officials. At around 2am BST a drone struck the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region, causing a fire which was later extinguished, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said. Reuters reports the Afipsky refinery lies 50 miles east of the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, one of Russia’s most important oil export gateways. Novorossiisk, together with the Caspian pipeline consortium (CPC) terminal, bring about 1.5% of global oil to market. Another drone crashed into the Ilsky refinery, which lies about 40 miles east of Novorossiisk, Russian state-owned news agencies Tass and RIA reported, citing local officials. There was no immediate information on who launched the drone but Russia has accused Ukraine of increased attacks on targets inside the country. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia. If you were looking for something to listen to today, the Today in Focus podcast features my colleague Peter Beaumont discussing the issue of missing children in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials say 16,000 children have been deported from Ukraine to Russia, but some estimates are much higher. In March, the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Russia’s children’s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, alleging they were responsible for the “war crime of unlawful deportation” of children. Peter recounts the story of 15-year-old Alina, who was tricked into fleeing to Russia by her best friend’s mother. He tells Nosheen Iqbal why this system of camps, fostering and adoption is being used as a tactic of war. Save Ukraine is a charity that supports families trying to get their children back. Olga Yerokhina, a spokesperson for the charity, tells Iqbal about the terrible ordeal families go through to be reunited. She says the system of removing children is driven by “the desire to destroy Ukraine, to destroy Ukrainian identity”. You can listen to it here: Tracking down Ukraine’s abducted children Here are some of the latest images of Ukrainian troops near the frontline in Donetsk region that have been sent to us over the news wires: As I mentioned earlier, my colleague Archie Bland has been speaking to our Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth about the drone attack on Moscow for our First Edition daily briefing email. Among other questions he asked Andrew whether Putin was likely to respond – and if so, how? Initially, at least, there has been no visible tactical response to the attacks. Nor did the attack on the Kremlin lead to specific retaliation. “But we do see ‘war hawks’ going after the military leadership,” Andrew said. “These are people who are interested in escalating the war and persuading Putin to listen to them.” The leader of the Wagner Group of mercenaries that has been operating in Bakhmut, Yevgeny Prigozhin, responded to the attack yesterday by saying: “What are regular people meant to do when UAVs with explosives crash into their houses? As a citizen, I’m deeply outraged that these scumbags [in the Ministry of Defence] calmly sit on their fat asses smeared with expensive creams!” Yesterday, Putin said that the people of Ukraine should understand that if Russia retaliated, but that the attack was a “response” because a Ukrainian “headquarters of military intelligence was struck two or three days ago”. “He’s claiming that it was us who moved first,” Andrew said. “Putin doesn’t like being pressured into action: the Russians could still make a decision to escalate, but they’re not telegraphing it here. But it could change in a second. From what we’ve seen before, even if they don’t take a decision immediately, there could still be an incubation period, and then some kind of reaction.” You can read more here: Wednesday briefing – What’s behind the drone attacks on Russia You can sign up for First Edition here. Russian security council deputy chair Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday that Britain was Moscow’s “eternal enemy” and that any British officials who facilitated the war in Ukraine could be considered legitimate military targets. Medvedev, the hawkish long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, was responding to British foreign secretary James Cleverly’s remark that Ukraine had a right to project force beyond its own borders, said Britain’s “goofy officials” should remember that Britain could be “qualified as being at war”. “The UK acts as Ukraine’s ally providing it with military aid in the form of equipment and specialists, ie de facto is leading an undeclared war against Russia,” Reuters reports Medvedev said on Twitter. “That being the case, any of its public officials (either military, or civil, who facilitate the war) can be considered as a legitimate military target.” Medvedev has frequently issued threats to other nation states via social media during the course of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. I mentioned earlier that my colleague Archie Bland has been speaking to our Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth about the drone attack on Moscow for our First Edition daily briefing email. He asked Andrew why he thought Ukraine might have done it – if, indeed, they were responsible. Almost 24,000 Ukrainian civilians have died during the war so far, the UN says, a figure it views as a low estimate. A Russian drone strike on Sunday was the largest on Kyiv yet; there have been 17 such attacks this month. The Kyiv School of Economics estimated that 150,000 residential buildings had been damaged or destroyed across Ukraine as of December. Meanwhile, Moscow has been almost completely unscathed. On Monday, mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said: “If the Russians can make Kyiv a nightmare, why do the people of Moscow rest?” “There may be a desire to make Russians understand that the bombardment can have consequences for them,” Andrew said. “Even if nobody is killed, the sense that Moscow could be vulnerable is important.” There is a more strategic possibility: with Ukraine’s long-trailed counteroffensive expected to start within the next few weeks, there could be merit in forcing Russia to divert air defences away from intended targets. “This could be a ‘shaping’ operation to improve the chances of Ukraine’s operations at the front,” Andrew said. You can read more here: Wednesday briefing – What’s behind the drone attacks on Russia You can sign up for First Edition here. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency reports on its Telegram channel that “an unidentified unmanned aerial vehicle fell on the territory of the Ilsky oil refinery in Kuban. The infrastructure was not damaged, there were no casualties.” The oil refinery is in Krasnodar region, which is to the east of Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. My colleague Archie Bland has been speaking to our Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth about the drone attack on Moscow for our First Edition daily briefing email. He asked him whether the attack showed Moscow is vulnerable? Given the possibility that the drone attack was deliberately restrained in order to avoid alienating western allies, it is difficult to draw hard conclusions about Russian defences from the claim that all of the drones were intercepted. “Ukraine’s air defences have been tested repeatedly, but we know a lot less about the Russian system,” Andrew said. In January, defence hardware including the S-400 surface-to-air system was erected on government buildings in Moscow. While those weapons are sophisticated, there are difficulties with their use in urban areas, where large quantities of satellite data confuse the picture. Russian officials were dismissive of the threat posed by the raid: one politician, Andrey Gurulev, said that civilians in central Moscow were more likely to be hit by an electric scooter than a drone. Even so, any perception of jeopardy among Muscovites could be important on its own. “There was a promise that this wouldn’t happen,” Andrew said. “The area where they came down includes some of the most prestigious postcodes in Moscow, and a lot of members of the government and military live there. Putin’s residence isn’t far away. But it’s another question whether that matters politically. We’ve already passed so many watersheds that it feels as if nothing will shock the Russian populace.” But if yesterday’s attacks are part of a new pattern, it is not impossible that that could change. “We could get closer to the point where the elite population have to actually pay attention to what’s going on and accept they have a stake in it,” Andrew said. You can read more here: Wednesday briefing – What’s behind the drone attacks on Russia You can sign up for First Edition here. Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk oblast, has reported on Telegram that an eight-year-old child has been injured in the shelling of the village of Mezhyrich near Pavlohrad in his region. The claims have not been independently verified. Five people have been killed and 19 injured in the shelling of a village in Russian-occupied Luhansk region, according to the Telegram channel of Russian-installed officials there. According to the claim, four missiles were fired from a Himars unit of the Ukrainian army, striking the village of Karpaty. The claims have not been independently verified. Luhansk is one of four regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. The drone attacks targeting Moscow early on Tuesday, which have been blamed on Kyiv, were by far the largest wave launched against Russia since the start of its war against Ukraine. There has been speculation that at least one of the drones involved was a UJ-22 produced by the Ukrainian Ukrjet company, which Russia claims has been involved in at least one previous attack. Some other experts disagree, suggesting it is another model of drone, citing differences in appearance. Are Ukrainian drone attacks becoming more ambitious? There have been some Ukrainian drone strikes since the beginning of this year both on Russian territory and Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Most drone attacks of this kind have focused on areas relatively close to the border or Russian infrastructure and logistics in occupied areas. However, there has been an apparent pattern of recent efforts by Kyiv to hit targets deep inside Russia with drones. In February, a UJ-22 crashed 100km from Moscow after managing to travel about 460km into Russian territory without being destroyed by air defences. In May, a pair of drones were shot down over the Kremlin. Is it certain Ukraine was behind the attacks? A few weeks after the Kremlin strikes, the New York Times reported that the conclusion of US intelligence agencies was the strikes originated with the Ukrainian intelligence services, although they were less certain that orders for the strikes originated from the top of the Ukrainian government. That in turn was reported to be fuelling disquiet among some officials in Joe Biden’s administration that the war risked escalating beyond Ukraine’s borders. If it is Ukraine, why is it doing this now? While some drone attacks fit the category of so-called shaping operations ahead of a Ukrainian counteroffensive – not least the targeting of infrastructure and logistics – these attacks appear aimed more at delivering a psychological impact. For many – not least among the wealthier Russian elites in cities such as Moscow and St Petersburg – the war has been somewhat remote from people’s experiences with the bulk of recruiting and mobilisation from outlying regions. The attacks seem designed to bring the war home to Russia’s capital, underlying both the fact that Ukraine is capable of skirting Russian air defences repeatedly and that it has the capacity to strike deep inside Russia. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, says he is optimistic that Sweden will be accepted into the alliance in the next few months. Last year, Sweden and Finland reversed decades of hesitation and formally applied to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine. Entry is contingent on unanimous approval from all members and Turkey has blocked Sweden, after allowing Finland to join several months ago. Turkey has accused Sweden of allowing members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) to settle in its country. The group is outlawed in Turkey. Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that it was “within reach” for Sweden to join in time for the Nato summit in July. “There are no guarantees but it’s absolutely possible to reach a solution and enable the decision on full membership for Sweden by then,” Stoltenberg told reporters in Oslo. US secretary of state Antony Blinken, visiting Sweden, said the Swedish government had already addressed Turkish concerns. “There is no reason for any further time. Sweden is ready now,” Blinken said. “We urge both Turkey and Hungary – which also has not yet ratified – to ratify the accession as quickly as possible,” he said. The state department said Blinken had pushed Sweden’s case directly Tuesday in a telephone call with Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. Emmanuel Macron will make a diplomatic push to reassure central and eastern European countries that France understands that the continent’s security environment has been permanently changed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a speech to a security forum in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, on Wednesday, Macron will call for a “strategic awakening” and highlight the work France has done to protect Nato’s eastern flank, including posting 1,250 French troops in Romania and 300 in Estonia. He will also stress the French role in unlocking the supply of battle tanks to Ukraine. At a meeting the following day in Moldova that he has largely engineered with fellow European leaders from inside and outside the EU – including Britain’s Rishi Sunak – he will stress France’s commitment to Ukraine’s victory and say he will not tolerate a frozen conflict. An Élysée official pointed out that Macron had already agreed to an increase of more than a third in France’s planned defence spending for 2024-30 compared with 2019-25. Macron sees the increase as part of a sea change in defence spending under way with no prospect of an end to the new cold war anytime soon. The president will argue that Europe, backed by EU funding, needs to do more to support its own armament production capacity and explore defence partnerships between member states. Ukraine is working with British defence company BAE Systems to set up a Ukrainian base to produce and repair weapons from tanks to artillery, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s comments came after he met with senior officials from BAE, including chief executive Charles Woodburn. “We are working on establishing a suitable base in Ukraine for production and repair. This encompasses a wide range of weaponry, from tanks to artillery,” Zelenskiy said. Restrictions on grain imports from Ukraine into the EU may need to be extended until at least the end of October, the bloc’s agriculture minister has said, despite fierce opposition from Kyiv. The restrictions were implemented after complaints from eastern EU countries that a surplus of Ukrainian grain was driving down local prices and affecting the livelihoods of local farmers. The EU eventually made an agreement with the five states involved – Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania – to allow them to block the import of grain from Ukraine. Russia’s invasion last year severely limited the traditional export channel of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea, leading to the need to export overland via Ukraine’s neighbours. Farmers in some EU countries protested after a slump in prices. European commissioner for agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski, said on Tuesday that that the European Commission had not yet agreed to extend the restrictions, but that he hoped he had “managed to convince the remaining member states that this is only fair.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has already said the export restrictions on his country are “completely unacceptable”. The governor of Belgorod, a Russian region that borders Ukraine, has claimed that four people were injured in Ukrainian shelling on a town close to the border. Two people were hospitalised as a result of the artillery strike on Shebekino, Vyacheslav Gladkov said, adding that it was the third time in a week the town had been hit. On Monday, Gladkov said that two industrial facilities in the town had been hit by strikes. On Saturday, he said he had come under artillery fire when trying to enter the town, which is only about 7 km north of the border with Ukraine. There was no immediate response from Ukraine to the latest shelling, but Kyiv rarely claims responsibility for attacks in Russia. Both Russian and Ukrainian representatives at the United Nations stopped short of fully backing the UN nuclear watchdogs plan to prevent catastrophe at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said Tuesday he was encouraged by the expressions of support from both countries to his “concrete principles.” The safety of Europe’s largest nuclear power facility, located in Ukraine’s southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia, has been a concern since Russian forces seized it over a year ago. It has been subject to frequent shelling and ahead of an expected Ukraine counteroffensive, fears have increased that a nuclear disaster could occur amid increased military activity. Among the IAEA’s stated principles is that there should be no attacks on, or from the plant and that no heavy weapons should be housed there. The Russian and Ukrainian envoys at the UN blamed each other’s countries for the crisis at Zaporizhzhia, although they did not reject outright the principles put forward by the IAEA. “Mr. Grossi’s proposals … are in line with the measures that we’ve already been implementing for a long time,” said Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, without evidence. Ukraine’s ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said: “We take note of the director general’s principles to help ensure nuclear safety and security” at Zaporizhzhia. The White House has said it is still gathering information about Tuesday’s drone strike on Moscow, but could not condone attacks inside Russia. “We do not support attacks inside of Russia. That’s it. Period,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a briefing. Washington is a major supplier of weaponry to Ukraine – on the condition the country uses it to defend itself and to retake Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces. US officials have repeatedly said that Ukraine has agreed not to use any American provided weapons for attacks on Russian soil. On Tuesday, US officials told the AP news agency that a new military aid package for Ukraine is expected to be announced this week and will include additional munitions for drones. There has been no suggestion that US-made drones or munitions were used in the attacks on Moscow. There has been speculation that at least one of the drones involved was a UJ-22 produced by a Ukrainian company. The Kremlin blamed Kyiv for Tuesday’s attack, but Ukrainian officials have denied involvement. A day after Russia accused Ukraine of sending drones to attack buildings in Moscow, the governor of Russia’s Krasnodar region said a drone was the likely cause of a fire that broke out at the Afipsky oil refinery. The fire was soon extinguished and there were no casualties, governor Veniamin Kondratyev said. The Afipsky refinery is not far from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, near another refinery that has been attacked several times this month. Separately, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, to the north of Ukraine, says an artillery strike wounded at least one person in the Russian town of Shebekino. He has blamed Kyiv for the attack. There was no immediate information on who launched the attacks inside Russia, but Moscow has accused Kyiv of a number strikes in recent weeks, while increasing the intensity of its own bombardment on Ukrainian cities. Russian drone attacks killed one person and wounded four in Kyiv on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian officials – but the skies over Ukraine were relatively quiet overnight. Ukraine has denied responsibility for Tuesday’s drone strike on Moscow. Kyiv almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks in Russia. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name’s Jonathan Yerushalmy and I’ll be with you for the next while. Twenty-four hours after the first large scale drone strike on Moscow, Russian officials in two separate southern regions have accused Ukraine of launching attacks. The governor of Russia’s Krasnodar region said that a drone strike was likely the cause of a fire that broke out at the Afipsky oil refinery. Meanwhile, the governor of Belgorod region accused Ukraine of carrying out an artillery strike in the town of Shebekino that left at least one person injured. More on that shortly, in other news today: Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accused Ukraine of seeking to “frighten” Russians after Moscow was targeted with a large-scale drone attack for the first time in the 15-month war. He said that Ukraine had chosen the path of attempting “to intimidate Russia, Russian citizens [with] attacks on residential buildings” and added that the drone attacks were “clearly a sign of terrorist activity.” Ukrainian presidential aide, Mykhailo Podolyak, denied Ukraine was involved. However, he did he predict “an increase in the number of attacks”. One of the drones used in Tuesday morning’s raid on Moscow appears to have been a Ukrainian manufactured UJ 22 drone produced by the Ukrjet company. Alleged footage of the drone, captured in flight during the attack, appears to match released images of the unmanned aerial vehicle which Russia has claimed has been used in other attempted attacks. James Cleverly, the UK’s foreign secretary, told reporters that Ukraine has the “legitimate right” to defend itself and can “project force” beyond its borders. At a news conference in Estonia on Tuesday, Cleverly said: “[Ukraine] has the right to project force beyond its borders to undermine Russia’s ability to project force into Ukraine itself.” The Russian defence ministry said eight drones targeted the city overnight but Russian media close to the security services wrote that the number was many times higher, with more than 30 drones participating in the attack. Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, faced its third air raid in 24 hours on Tuesday morning. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, confirmed that 20 residents were evacuated from a damaged building. One person died and four were injured in the strike. Restrictions on grain imports from Ukraine into the EU would need to be extended, the bloc’s agricultural minister said on Tuesday, despite opposition from Kyiv. The restrictions were implemented after complaints from eastern EU countries that a surplus of Ukrainian grain was driving down local prices and affecting local farmers. Ukraine wants to begin work to make its Danube shipping canal deeper as early as this year, to expand its alternative routes to export grain, deputy minister of renovation and infrastructure, Yuriy Vaskov, said on Tuesday. The push for alternative export routes has taken on urgency during the war, after Russia blocked Ukraine’s traditional export routes via the Black Sea. Sweden’s accession into Nato is “within reach”, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday. Sweden formally applied to join Nato last year, but was blocked by Turkey over claims that Kurdish militants had settled in the country. Stoltenberg said it was “possible to reach a solution and enable the decision on full membership for Sweden by “ the Nato summit in July. Neither Russia nor Ukraine committed to respect the five principles laid out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to try to safeguard Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The principles included that there should be no attacks on, or from the plant and that no heavy weapons should be housed there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/feb/05/electric-monaros-and-hotted-up-skateboards-the-genius-who-wants-to-electrify-our-world","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-04T21:38:51Z","webTitle":"Electric Monaros and hotted-up skateboards : the ‘genius’ who wants to electrify our world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/electric-monaros-and-hotted-up-skateboards-the-genius-who-wants-to-electrify-our-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/electric-monaros-and-hotted-up-skateboards-the-genius-who-wants-to-electrify-our-world","fields":{"headline":"Electric Monaros and hotted-up skateboards : the ‘genius’ who wants to electrify our world","bodyText":"It is late morning at the home of inventor, entrepreneur and CEO, Saul Griffith, in the coastal village of Austinmer, south of Sydney, and the scene is instantly familiar. Beach towels and children’s shoes are strewn by the front door; rogue socks and pieces of Lego line the stairwell; breakfast dishes are stacked on the sink: all signs of a household still in the throes of making the lurching transition from the languor of summer holidays to the routines of school term time – right down to the jar of negative rapid antigen Covid tests on the counter. Griffith and his wife, Arwen, apologise: in the morning hubbub – two children off to school, one starting high school – they momentarily forgot I was coming. The only clue that this is the home of one of this generation’s most brilliant inventors – in 2007 Griffith, who has a masters in engineering from the University of Sydney and a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, known in the Unites States as a “genius grant” – is on the table tennis table, where what looks to be a skateboard hotted-up with an electric motor, sits partially assembled. “I’m messing around, I have voided the warranty on a whole bunch of electronics on that table tennis table,” Griffith confesses. “It won’t be legal anywhere in the world to use that skateboard.” Nowadays, any “physical tinkering” Griffith does is “more for therapy” than anything else. Having founded numerous successful clean-tech companies in the US, where he’s lived for the past two decades, and still supervising his office in San Francisco – overseeing a team of 50 people working on commercialising clean technology products – he’s recently shifted the bulk of his professional life towards advocating another approach to the climate crisis. In 2020, Griffith co-founded a non-profit called Rewiring America, which, supported by extensive modelling and costing, advocates the mass electrification of homes. Petrol cars swapped for electric vehicles (EVs), gas heaters replaced by reverse-cycle air conditioners, gas cooktops replaced by induction – with the electricity that powers these devices coming from either renewable sources or nuclear power. (Griffith doesn’t think Australia needs nuclear power – we have enough renewables.) “The same is true in the US or in Australia, 40 to 42% of all of our emissions in the domestic economy come from decisions that are made around the kitchen table,” says Griffith. “But you never hear that talked about in traditional climate action. You hear about boycotting oil or shutting down the coal station. But we have to decarbonise this demand side at the same rate that we decarbonise the supply side, or it doesn’t add up.” Now he’s back living in Australia – returning primarily for ageing parents and quality of family life – he’s seeing the arguments he started making in America making even more sense. With over three million homes already with rooftop solar, abundant sun and physical space to expand solar farms, he says Australia is uniquely placed to transform into a nation of fully electrified households that will ultimately be cheaper to run. “Australia is the first country in the world where the positive household economics of solving climate change will be realisable by everyday people,” he says. It’s not a question of living with less, though. Rather, “the answer is just to install so much of this shit that life gets better.” Griffith believes a huge part of his task is re-framing the narrative about decarbonisation in Australia, which has typically been discussed in terms of loss: lost jobs, higher prices, poorer standards of living. Referencing comments made during the last election campaign by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that an Opposition proposal to introduce incentives for electric vehicles would “end” the weekend because EVs won’t be able tow a boat or trailer, he says: “Full disclosure. I love muscle cars as much as the next guy. I want my ute to go on weekends too.” One of the final things Griffith did before he left the US was buy a 1961 Lincoln Continental – driving it back to the west coast on one last gas-guzzling road trip before it was electrified. Now, back in Australia, he and a mate have their eye on a GTS Monaro they’re interested in electrifying and taking to next year’s Summernats – the annual festival of rev-heads held in Canberra. “The future can be great. That electric Monaro will be zero emissions, a shit load faster than a petrol Monaro, and guilt free. And you don’t drive your vintage Monaro every day, so it’s going to be a great household back-up battery as well. It’s a grid asset. “The technology has delivered. And there’s no reason not to turn every culture war on its head and just say, ‘No, you’re going to get your electric cake and do burnouts too’”. Griffith grew up in south-western Sydney; his mother an artist, who painted landscapes and flora and fauna, his father a professor of textile engineering who loved fixing machines and building things. On holidays, the family camped in national parks and snorkelled on the Great Barrier Reef. “There wasn’t any religion in the house other than Attenborough documentaries” Griffith has said of his childhood. “The piece of the kid that is in me that is really strong, is really the David Attenborough bit, which is holy shit, we’ve got a lot to lose,” he says now. “We spent a lot of time on the reef and it’s not the same any more. It’s terrible. It’s terrifying. So, I viscerally feel the climate change and I worry a lot about it and I worry hugely about it for our kids.” Sitting in his leafy backyard, with the rainforest of the Illawarra escarpment encroaching and the family blue heeler persistently placing sticks before us, Griffith tells the “funny version” of how he shifted from CEO to advocate. “15 years ago, before I married Arwen, I said, ‘if the world hasn’t done anything sufficiently bold on climate action by 2020, I’m going to become an eco-terrorist, because I have had the perfect training. I know how infrastructure works, I know how to build robots, I know how to wreak havoc … And in 2019 I was like, ‘so Arwen, it’s 2020 next year and the world really has done fuck-all. Can I become an eco-terrorist?’ And she said ‘No, you have two children now, you can’t. But I will allow you to do a year off for advocacy and moving the needle further.” Griffith made some political ground in America. Last year, Rewiring America helped create an electrification caucus in the Senate, started Mayors for Electrification and CEOs for Electrification and worked writing energy policy for president Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan. However, this legislation now appears to have foundered, if not died, and Griffith concedes the US is in a “dark, tough place” politically, with current climate policy “not nearly what is necessary” to prevent catastrophic global warming. Griffith thinks all hope now rests on Australia. “If you’re thinking about how do you make the world move faster, someone needs to go first on showing what’s possible. Because then you’ve got a success story that people can be drawn to.” This month, Griffith’s new book, ‘The Big Switch’ (published by Black Inc.) will be published in Australia, laying out his manifesto for rapidly electrifying Australian households. His modelling shows that if aggressive electrification starts now, then by 2025, “the numbers flip in favour of electrification: electrifying homes becomes the cheaper option and creates yearly savings for the average household of more than $1,000 per year,” he writes. By 2030, the average Australian household is saving over $5,000 a year. Jobs are created installing rooftop solar, heat pumps, batteries, new kitchen appliances and vehicle chargers; export industries benefit from an abundance of cheaper, renewable power. “Around a third of the cost of making steel or aluminium is the energy required to make it. If you have the cheapest energy in the world you can make the metals that the world needs at the lowest price,” Griffith writes. Griffith rates the current federal government policy to reduce greenhouse emissions via “technology not taxes” at “slightly somewhere between zero and one out 10.” “To lean back and say, ‘technology not taxes’ is to say the free market will solve it all,” he says. “The free market demonstrably cannot solve it. And I can illustrate that point very easily. If the machines that exist on the planet today, if all the cars, all the coal plants, all the natural gas plants, all the ovens and stoves and hot water heaters merely live out their natural life and burn fossil fuels while doing it, those emissions alone take us to 1.8 degrees. The only way to hit a 1.5 degree target is to essentially engineer the economy as soon as fucking possible – with incentives, mandates, rebates and subsidies – to replace all of those machines with something that does the same service with zero emissions.” Griffith has already formed allegiances with some state government MPs, including NSW Liberal Treasurer Matt Kean – who has described Griffith as a “sounding board” and a “genius” – and Lily D’Ambrosio, the minister for energy, environment and climate change in the Victorian Labor government. He hopes his ideas will influence policies in the forthcoming federal election. “I don’t really give a rat’s arse about who wins, I just want to help either or both,” he says. “In the perfect version of events, you can imagine Labor promoting how they’re going to make lower income households afford this sooner and you’d imagine the Liberal party promoting how they’ll provide more freedom of choice. That’s be great. Differing about the details of implementation, not about is the right course.” When talking about climate change, Griffith is fond of wartime analogies. To achieve what’s required – a heating target of under two degrees – he says the kind of policy response that’s needed is “essentially a declaration of war”. He asks: if the world can manufacture 90 billion bullets a year, why can’t it make the 60 billion batteries – just larger than an AA battery – required to run one billion EVs? “I always think of Churchill’s ‘Fight them on the beaches’ speech,” he says, the speech given in 1940 by the British prime minister Winston Churchill to the House of Commons, warning that large tracts of Europe would fall to the Nazis. “Which really, paraphrased, was roughly, ‘We’re fucked. Oh my God, we’re fucked. They have all the weapons. But the only way to die with dignity is go down fighting.’ A little bit, that’s where we are with climate. I’m going to go to down fighting. I’d still think we have a tiny, narrow window where we can limit the damage and have a pretty good outcome. But I think we lose that in the next five years. It’s go time right now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/24/net-zero-strategy-year-late-lacking-ambition-and-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-24T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"All hail the net zero strategy: a year late and lacking in both ambition and funding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/24/net-zero-strategy-year-late-lacking-ambition-and-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/24/net-zero-strategy-year-late-lacking-ambition-and-funding","fields":{"headline":"All hail the net zero strategy: a year late and lacking in both ambition and funding","bodyText":"In politics, timing is everything. Last week the government set out its strategy for meeting its net zero carbon targets: this came a year later than expected, and less than a fortnight before the UK finds itself front and centre on the global stage as host of the Cop26 UN climate talks in Glasgow. The long-awaited climate blueprint covered wide-ranging “net zero” ambitions from renewable energy and electric vehicles to carbon capture and electric heat pumps – and yet still offered too little, if not entirely too late. It falls short in two crucial areas: ambition, and government funding. Critics say the carbon savings set out in the paper will not get the UK close to its net zero goal by 2050, and that without the funds might fail to meet even this limited ambition. Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, said the success of the government’s net zero plans would rely on ministers putting in place major and at times expensive policy changes. Timing is crucial in the race to tackle the climate crisis too – but one can’t help wondering whether the countdown to Cop26 meant officials didn’t have the time to put together policies with the depth, detail and Treasury buy-in to meet the deadline, despite a year’s delay. Delays beget further delays, and in the context of the climate crisis, the truism that winning slowly is the same as losing is all too apt. The government hopes that alongside its plan to end the UK’s contribution to global heating it will create up to 440,000 jobs and “unlock” £90bn in private sector investment in the next decade alone. But it could all be at risk if the “how?” at the heart of the UK’s climate plans remain unanswered. If the government hopes to meet its targets, time taken today on the details of tomorrow would be well spent. Take nuclear power: the ambition to bring forward investment in a new generation of nuclear reactors is almost 20 years old and has been wildly delayed. In the latest net zero strategy, the government vowed to secure a final investment for one large-scale nuclear power plant by the end of the parliament, but offered no new way to achieve this challenge. Legislation for a new funding framework to meet the challenge of eye-watering upfront costs for nuclear is expected to emerge “very shortly”, according to one Whitehall source, but did not do so in time for the net zero strategy. For households, the upfront cost of new low-carbon heating and insulation represents a challenge on a far smaller scale than the nuclear dilemma – but one with major cumulative implications for the UK’s climate goals, and in need of a coherent plan. The government’s flagship home insulation scheme, the Green Homes Grant, collapsed earlier this year after failing to deliver the promised energy efficiency boom amid accusations that it was fatally rushed and poorly thought through. This does not bode well for the government’s high-profile promise to make grants of £5,000 available to around 90,000 homes over the next three years for electric heat pumps, a low-carbon technology that can be hugely effective in keeping homes toasty – if the home in question is properly insulated. Perhaps a plan to replace the Green Homes Grant, like the plan to fund new nuclear reactors, just wasn’t quite ready to include in the net zero strategy as part of a comprehensive plan to cut emissions from British homes. Either way it’s high time the government began to set its deadlines by the pressing need for climate action rather than by political optics. Forget Tesla: SpaceX will put a rocket under Musk’s wealth Could Elon Musk become the world’s first trillionaire? Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, reckons so, and not from his hugely successful electric car company Tesla, but from SpaceX: the rocketship company that he – seriously – hopes will allow humans to colonise Mars. It may sound crazy, but Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas explains that SpaceX has the potential to expand from a single company into four whole new industries: space travel, space infrastructure, Earth observation and deep-space exploration. If talks aimed at tackling the climate crisis at Cop26 later this month collapse and temperatures continue to steadily rise, maybe an escape to Mars will be the best option for survival for future generations (if they can afford a ticket). The world’s wealthiest people would be beneficiaries of such a crisis, as Musk, Jeff Bezos (who owns Blue Origin), and Richard Branson (Virgin Galactic) are the sole competitors in the race to commercialise spacecraft. Musk, 50, is in pole position. As Jonas puts it, SpaceX is “challenging any preconceived notion of what was possible and the timeframe possible, in terms of rockets, launch vehicles and supporting infrastructure”. To date, Musk, who is already the world’s richest person, with a $241bn paper fortune, has made most of his fortune from Tesla. The company has a market value of $905bn - that’s more than the next six biggest traditional carmakers combined, despite the company only producing 900,000 cars a year. Toyota produces nine million. Despite Tesla’s success – the shares have risen by 960% since the beginning of the pandemic alone – Jonas says it will be SpaceX that lifts Musk to a 13-figure fortune. He reasons that SpaceX has far greater disrupter potential than the highly disruptive Tesla, and points out that Musk owns about half of privately held SpaceX, compared with about a fifth of the carmaker. Jonas asked his clients which stock they would prefer to bet on from here. About 63% plumped for SpaceX, with one predicting that it “may eventually be the most highly valued company in the world – in any industry”. Red meat of politics leaves little appetite for cutting beef consumption The necessity for reducing meat and dairy consumption is undeniable. But pork barrel politics is about dishing out the cash to try to win elections – it is not about putting taxes on sausages. And so it was that Downing Street once again swiftly denied that it was planning to introduce a meat tax, after a proposal was published and then withdrawn within a few hours last week. Tory MPs were quick to publicise their opposition, giving the impression that it remains anathema to them. “I’m a huge meat eater. I think it is wonderful,” said Conservative MP Tom Hunt. The government’s climate change advisers say meat and dairy consumption must fall by at least 20% per person by the end of the decade to keep the UK on track to meet its net-zero targets. Yet the practicalities of using a tax to achieve that drop remain unclear, especially as the carbon footprint can vary greatly depending on the type of meat, and where and how it is produced. Beef requires significantly more land and water, and produces more climate emissions, than chicken, for example, while cattle raised on deforested land are responsible for many times more greenhouse gas emissions than animals reared on natural pastures. A tax on meat could encourage more people to switch to vegan or vegetarian alternatives, but could also lead to an increase in cheaper meat imports. And there are concerns about potentially restricting access to a source of protein, vitamins and minerals. None of this, however, need prevent politicians from helping to win greater public support for the necessity of cutting meat consumption. Nor is there anything to stop them subsidising alternatives to meat or introducing meat-free days more widely in schools and the public sector. But for now, neither the Tories nor Labour – which is desperately trying to gain rural and farming votes – appear willing to start winning hearts and minds on the imperative of a meat reduction strategy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/12/tories-russian-energy-cheap-green-insulating-homes-wind-solar-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-12T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"While the Tories dawdle over Russian gas, we have a £28bn plan to make energy cheap – and green  | Ed Miliband ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/12/tories-russian-energy-cheap-green-insulating-homes-wind-solar-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/12/tories-russian-energy-cheap-green-insulating-homes-wind-solar-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"While the Tories dawdle over Russian gas, we have a £28bn plan to make energy cheap – and green","bodyText":"At this perilous moment, we are faced with three interlocking energy crises. An energy security crisis, with the invasion of Ukraine demonstrating to Europe that it must wean itself off Russian gas and oil, and quickly. A price crisis of soaring, sky-high bills. And the climate crisis, which the UN warned just last month is even more advanced and dangerous than we thought. Some will say we cannot confront all three together. There are voices on the right of politics already growing louder, saying it’s necessary to sacrifice or slow down our climate ambitions so we can lock in energy security. But they are profoundly wrong. Doubling down on fossil fuels, for example, through a fracking-style dash for gas which some on the Conservative benches are proposing, would be a disastrous response to each of these crises. For starters, what is the quickest way to get us off Russian gas and allow us control over our own energy supply? By pressing ahead with building the 649 onshore wind and solar projects that already have planning permission in the UK. They could come on stream within two years and would fully replace Russian gas imports, but are being held back by the de-facto moratorium imposed by the government in 2015, when it introduced draconian planning restrictions for new windfarms and cut onshore windfarms off from investment in renewables. Fracking would take at least a decade to arrive, as the prime minister was warned this week by his own business secretary, and the average time between new exploration and production in the North Sea is 28 years. It’s the same story on price. The lowest-cost fuels available are now wind and solar. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices spiralling further, generating energy from gas was four times more expensive than new solar or wind. And because we operate in an integrated gas market, we pay the same price for gas from domestic sources as we do for imports. Of course, the North Sea will continue to play a role as we transition to net zero, but whatever the level of our domestic supply, it cannot be immune from international price shocks. Fracking was halted because it was considered too dangerous by Conservative ministers. And on climate, the case the UK made at Cop26 was that the world needed to get off fossil fuels. That is indeed the central challenge of net zero. The idea that reverting to business as usual is somehow consistent with tackling the climate crisis is therefore nonsense. There is only one way to meet all three crises of security, price and climate together: to not slow down on the drive towards zero carbon, but to turn the current saunter into a sprint. It is time to finally take seriously the Cinderella of this government’s energy policy, which is home insulation and energy efficiency – because the best way of reducing our demand for fossil fuels is to reduce energy demand overall. Upgrading the 19m cold, draughty British homes would cut energy bills by an average of £400 every year and our gas imports by 15%. But home insulation rates have plummeted over the past decade, and emissions from buildings are as high now as they were in 2015. We need to push further and faster on every form of renewables. Get rid of the moratorium on onshore wind. Reignite the push towards solar power that I started when I was the energy secretary, but which was stamped out by government policy in 2015. Embrace tidal power and hydrogen. Finally, nuclear power needs to play a supporting role in the energy mix. The independent Climate Change Committee says that new nuclear stations are needed to achieve our net zero targets. During my time as the energy secretary, I identified the potential sites for new nuclear plants, but 12 years on the government has not completed any new nuclear stations. We should set a clear deadline on financial close for Sizewell C. There is no mystery as to why the government has so comprehensively failed on energy efficiency: it is the product of piecemeal, outsourced and underfunded schemes. We simply cannot achieve energy efficiency and the rapid switch to heat pumps, for example, without substantial public investment. That investment – as everyone from the OBR to the IMF will tell you – is the responsible economic choice. It is why Labour has committed £6bn a year to energy efficiency over the next decade as part of our groundbreaking £28bn a year climate investment pledge. We don’t have time for more of the government’s ideologically driven failure, nor their failure to take on the deniers on their backbenches. They play the climate hokey-cokey and we end up with climate delay. Remember the onshore wind ban was put in by David Cameron in response to unhappy backbenchers. They were no doubt inspired by a guy called Boris Johnson, who said in 2013 that wind turbines wouldn’t “pull the skin off a rice pudding” and that fracking was a better answer. The same double-speak cannot be allowed to happen again on the false premise that a new dash for gas through fracking might answer today’s challenges. Fossil fuels are not the answer to a fossil fuel crisis. We need a clean energy sprint to tackle the climate crisis, the cost of living crisis, and our energy security crisis together. This is the route to national energy independence and sovereignty. Business as usual just won’t do. The safest route is to go big, go green, go bold and go fast.

Blink and you would have missed it, but in December 2012, as part of an initiative announced three years earlier by Mark Zuckerberg, the company unveiled new terms and conditions that it wanted to impose on users. They were invited to vote on whether they should be enacted, yes or no. The voters were pretty clear: 88% said no, the new terms weren’t acceptable. It was a triumph of people power. Except that Zuckerberg had imposed a precondition: the decision would only be binding if at least 30% of all users took part. That would have required votes from about 300 million of the roughly 1 billion users the platform then had (it’s since roughly tripled). But just over 650,000 participated. King Zuckerberg declared that the time for democracy was over, and in future, Facebook – which in reality means Zuckerberg, for he owns the majority of the voting shares – would decide what would happen, without reference to user opinion. Since then, the company has been accused of aiding the genocide of the Rohingya in Myanmar, the spreading of misinformation in 2016 in the Philippines and US elections and the Brexit referendum, of bringing together violent rightwing extremists who went on to kill in the US, of failing to douse the QAnon conspiracy theory, and most recently of helping foment the January 2021 US insurrection. Sure, the 2012 terms and conditions probably didn’t lead to those outcomes. Equally, leaving Facebook to its own devices didn’t “help” prevent them. In 2016 an internal memo by one of its executives, Andrew Bosworth, suggested that such collateral damage was tolerable: “We connect people. That can be good if they make it positive. Maybe someone finds love. Maybe it even saves the life of someone on the brink of suicide … That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools … [but] anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good.” “Maybe” someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on your tools, but overall what we do is good? Even if Zuckerberg distanced himself and Facebook from the remarks, it’s not the sort of language you’d expect to hear from, say, an executive of a nuclear power plant. So why should we accept it from senior people in companies with proven adverse track records? No surprise, then, that the clamour is growing for more regulation of big tech companies such as Facebook, Google (particularly YouTube), Twitter, Instagram and the fast-rising TikTok, which already has more than 1 billion users worldwide. Into this tumult comes Jamie Susskind, a British barrister who argues that we need a “digital republic” to protect society from the harms indifferently caused by these companies, and provide a framework – legal, ethical, moral – for how we should oversee them now and in the future. Susskind argues that our present emphasis on “market individualism” – where individuals pick and choose the platforms they interact with, and thus shape which ones succeed or fail – has allowed these companies to create fiefdoms. What we need, he says, is more accountability, which means that we should have more oversight into what the companies do. This would be a proper citizens’ republic; rather than relying on the inchoate mass of individuals, a collective focus on responsibility would force accountability and strip away unearned powers. Big tech seems like a space where it should be easy to find solutions. Do the companies sell data without permission? (The big tech ones don’t, but there’s a thriving advertising ecosystem that does.) Do their algorithms unfairly discriminate on the basis of race, gender, locale? Do they throw people off their platforms without reason? Do they moderate content unfairly? Then we have casus belli to litigate and correct. OK, but how? The problem facing Susskind, and us, is that there are three choices for dealing with these companies. Leave them alone? That hasn’t worked. Pass laws to control them? But our political systems struggle to frame sensible laws in a timely fashion. Create technocratic regulators to oversee them and bring them into line when they stray? But those are liable to “regulatory capture”, where they get too cosy with their charges. None is completely satisfactory. And we are wrestling a hydra; as fast as policy in one area seems to get nailed down (say, vaccine misinformation), two more pop up (say, facial recognition and machine learning). Susskind suggests we instead try “mini-publics” – most often seen in the form of “citizen assemblies”, where you bring a small but representative group of the population together and give them expert briefings about a difficult choice to be made, after which they create policy options. Taiwan and Austria use them, and in Ireland they helped frame the questions in the referendums about same-sex marriage and abortion. What he doesn’t acknowledge is that this just delays the problem. After the mini-publics deliberate, you are back at the original choices: do nothing, legislate or regulate. Deciding between those approaches would require a very detailed examination of how these companies work, and what effects the approaches could have. We don’t get that here. A big surprise about the book is the chapters’ length, or lack of it. There are 41 (including an introduction and conclusion) across 301 pages, and between each of the book’s 10 “parts” is a blank page. Each chapter is thus only a few pages, the literary equivalent of those mini Mars bars infuriatingly described as “fun size”. But a lot of these topics deserve more than a couple of bites; they are far meatier and more complicated. How exactly do you define “bot” accounts, and are they always bad? Should an outside organisation be able to overrule a company’s decision to remove an account for what it sees as undesirable behaviour? If a company relies on an algorithm for its revenues , how far should the state (or republic) be able to interfere in its operation, if it doesn’t break discrimination laws? Bear in mind that Facebook’s algorithms in Myanmar, the Philippines and the US before the 2021 insurrection did nothing illegal. (The Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said recently that only about 200 people in the whole world understand how its News Feed algorithm chooses what to show you.) So what is it we want Facebook to stop, or start, doing? The correct answer, as it happens, is “start moderating content more aggressively”; in each case, too few humans were tasked with preventing inflammatory falsehoods running out of control. Defining how many moderators is the correct number is then a tricky problem in itself. These are all far from fun-sized dilemmas, and even if we had clear answers there would still be structural barriers to implementation – which often means us, the users. “The truth is that individuals still click away too many of their protections,” writes Susskind, noting how easily we dismissively select “I agree”, yielding up our rights. Fine, but what’s the alternative? The EU’s data protection regime means we have to give “informed consent”, and while the ideal would be uninformed dissent (so nobody gets our data), there’s too much money ranged against us to make that the default. So we tick boxes. It would have been good too to hear from experts in the field such as Haugen, or anyone with direct experience who could point towards solutions for some of the problems. (They too tend to struggle to find them, which doesn’t make one hopeful.) Difficult questions are left open; nothing is actually solved. “This is a deliberately broad formulation,” Susskind says of his recommendation for how algorithms should be regulated. One is left with the sneaking suspicion that these problems might just be insoluble. The one option that hasn’t really been tried is the one rejected back in 2012: let users decide. It wouldn’t be hard for sites to make voting compulsory, and allow our decisions to be public. Zuckerberg might not be happy about it. But he’d get a vote: just one, like everyone else. That really might create a digital republic for us all. • Charles Arthur is the author of Social Warming: How Social Media Polarises Us All.

This blog will close now and return early tomorrow/Friday, from our London hub. Here’s where things stand: EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she wants Russian president Vladimir Putin to face the International Criminal Court over war crimes in Ukraine. “That Putin must lose this war and must face up to his actions, that is important to me,” she told the TV channel of German news outlet Bild on Thursday. Pope Francis on Thursday said it was morally legitimate for countries to provide weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian aggression. “This is a political decision which it can be moral, morally acceptable, if it is done under conditions of morality…Self defence is not only licit but also an expression of love for the homeland. Someone who does not defend oneself, who does not defend something, does not love it. Those who defend (something) loves it,” he said. Germany will supply Ukraine with additional armoured vehicles and rocket launch systems but will not provide the battle tanks that Kyiv has long asked for, the German defence minister Christine Lambrecht said on Thursday. She added that Soviet-made BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles would also “very quickly” head to Ukraine from Greece, as a deal with Germany to resupply Athens’ stocks with the more modern Marder armoured vehicles was close. Vladimir Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on Thursday for his “balanced” approach to the Ukraine crisis and blasted Washington’s “ugly” policies, at a meeting that followed a major setback for Moscow on the battlefield. “We understand your questions and your concerns in this regard, and we certainly will offer a detailed explanation of our stand on this issue during today’s meeting, even though we already talked about it earlier,” Putin told his Chinese counterpart. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she wants Russian president Vladimir Putin to face the International Criminal Court over war crimes in Ukraine. “That Putin must lose this war and must face up to his actions, that is important to me,” she told the TV channel of German news outlet Bild on Thursday. “We support the collection of evidence” with a view to possible proceedings at the International Criminal Court, she said, referring to allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine. “That is the basis of our international legal system, that we punish these crimes. And ultimately, Putin is responsible,” she said. Asked whether Putin would one day be brought before the court, she responded: “I believe it is possible.” Pope Francis on Thursday said it was morally legitimate for countries to provide weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian aggression. Speaking to reporters after returning from a three-day trip to Kazakhstan, Francis also urged Kyiv to be open to eventual dialogue, even though it may “smell” because it would be difficult for the Ukrainian side. In response to a reporter’s question on whether it is morally right for countries to send weapons to Ukraine, the pope said: “This is a political decision which it can be moral, morally acceptable, if it is done under conditions of morality…Self defence is not only licit but also an expression of love for the homeland. Someone who does not defend oneself, who does not defend something, does not love it. Those who defend (something) loves it.” Explaining the difference between when it is moral or immoral to supply weapons to another country, Francis said: “It can be immoral if the intention is provoking more war, or to sell arms or dump arms that (a country) no longer needs. The motivation is what in large part qualifies the morality of this action.” The pope was also asked whether Ukraine should negotiate with Russia and if there was a “red line” Ukraine should draw, depending on Russian activities, after which it could refuse to negotiate. “It is always difficult to understand dialogue with countries that have started a war ... it is difficult but it should not be discarded,” he said, adding, “I would not exclude dialogue with any power that is at war, even if it is with the aggressor. ... Sometimes you have to carry out dialogue like this. It smells but it must be done.” Germany will supply Ukraine with additional armoured vehicles and rocket launch systems but will not provide the battle tanks that Kyiv has long asked for, the German defence minister said on Thursday. Germany will supply two Mars II multiple-rocket launch systems, 200 missiles and 50 armoured “Dingo” troop carriers, Christine Lambrecht said, Agence France-Presse reports. She added that Soviet-made BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles would also “very quickly” head to Ukraine from Greece, as a deal with Germany to resupply Athens’ stocks with the more modern Marder armoured vehicles was close. Since the war began, Ukraine has asked multiple times for the German-made Marders as well as Leopard tanks, neither of which have been included by the latest armaments promised by Germany. Berlin has argued that it will not “go it alone” on weapons deliveries, with Lambrecht pointing out that no other ally has transferred western-made battle tanks to Ukraine. On Thursday, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, again defended Germany’s support for Ukraine. “We are helping … because their fight is a fight that we are supporting,” he said in a speech, listing ways that Berlin had aided Ukraine, from supplying armaments to training troops … We have delivered more and more weapons. “Weapons deliveries from us – but also from our allies – have contributed to things turning out differently to how the Russian president planned.” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has criticised Germany’s refusal to provide tanks, saying that there was “not a single rational argument on why these weapons cannot be supplied.” Vladimir Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on Thursday for his “balanced” approach to the Ukraine crisis and blasted Washington’s “ugly” policies, at a meeting that followed a major setback for Moscow on the battlefield. The Associated Press reports: Speaking at the start of talks with Xi in Uzbekistan, Putin said he was ready to discuss unspecified “concerns” by China about Ukraine. “We highly appreciate the well-balanced position of our Chinese friends in connection with the Ukrainian crisis,” Putin said, facing Xi across a long table. “We understand your questions and your concerns in this regard, and we certainly will offer a detailed explanation of our stand on this issue during today’s meeting, even though we already talked about it earlier,” he added. A Chinese government statement issued after the meeting didn’t specifically mention Ukraine, but said Xi promised “strong support” to Russia’s “core interests.” While the statement gave no details, Beijing uses “core interests” to describe issues such as national sovereignty and the ruling Communist Party’s claim to Taiwan, over which it is willing to go to war. Speaking after the meeting, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the assessments of the international situation by Moscow and Beijing “fully coincide. We don’t have any differences.” He added that both countries “will continue coordinating our actions, including at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.” Lavrov described the talks as “excellent,” saying they were “very businesslike and concrete, involving a discussion of tasks for various ministries and agencies.” The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, today in Kyiv. Ukraine has been vying to join the EU since the start of the Russian invasion, and was granted candidate status in June. Von der Leyen said Ukraine’s “ascension process is well on track”. “We support you wherever we can.” Von der Leyen also offered a quiet rebuke of EU member state Germany for its delay in supplying Ukraine with military equipment, noting that “it’s absolutely vital and necessary to support Ukraine with the military equipment they need to defend themselves.” On her visit to Kyiv, Von der Leyen also announced that the European Union has earmarked €150m to aid internally displaced people in Ukraine get shelter through the winter, as well as €100m for reconstruction and repair work for schools that have been damaged in the invasion. Russian forces launched 33 rocket attacks on military and civilian targets in Ukraine today, damaging the infrastructure of more than 20 settlements in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Mykolayiv oblasts, the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces said in its daily briefing. The general staff said it believed that Russian forces were turning their focus to fully occupying the Donetsk oblast, holding captured territories and disrupting the activities of Ukrainian troops in other areas. The US has imposed new sanctions on 22 Russian individuals and two Russian entities. The individuals include Maria Alexeyevna Lvova-Belova, Russia’s presidential commissioner for children’s rights, who has led Russia’s efforts to deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and forced the adoption of Ukrainian children into Russian families. The entities include Task Force Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that has participated in combat alongside Russia’s military in Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors passed on Thursday a resolution demanding that Russia end its occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters is reporting. The resolution is the second on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s board of governors. A Ukrainian volunteer medic captured by Russian forces during their deadly siege of the port city of Mariupol delivered devastating testimony before US lawmakers on Thursday, recounting her experiences of torture, death and terror. Yuliia Paievska, who was detained in Mariupol in March and held by Russian and pro-Russia forces for three months, spoke before the Helsinki Commission, a government agency created in part to promote compliance with human rights internationally. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors passed on Thursday a resolution demanding that Russia end its occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters is reporting. The resolution is the second on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s board of governors. Both resolutions were proposed by Canada and Poland on behalf of Ukraine, which is not on the board, the agency’s policy-making body. The text calls on Russia to “immediately cease all actions against, and at, the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine” and was passed with 26 votes in favour, two against and seven abstentions, diplomats at the closed-door meeting told Reuters. Russia and China were the countries that voted against while Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Burundi, Vietnam, India and Pakistan abstained, the diplomats said. Both Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the plant, the largest in Europe, which could cause catastrophic damage to the region should anything happen. The US has imposed new sanctions 22 Russian individuals and two Russian entities. The individuals include Maria Alexeyevna Lvova-Belova, Russia’s presidential commissioner for children’s rights, who has led Russia’s efforts to deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and forced the adoption of Ukrainian children into Russian families. The entities include Task Force Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that has participated in combat alongside Russia’s military in Ukraine, even though the Kremlin’s main argument for the invasion of Ukraine was to “denazify” the country. Russian forces launched 33 rocket attacks on military and civilian targets in Ukraine today, damaging the infrastructure of more than 20 settlements in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Mykolayiv oblasts, the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces said in its daily briefing. The general staff said it believed that Russian forces were turning their focus to fully occupying the Donetsk oblast, holding captured territories and disrupting the activities of Ukrainian troops in other areas. “There remains the threat of air and missile strikes throughout the territory of Ukraine,” the general staff warned. A Ukrainian volunteer medic captured by Russian forces during their deadly siege of the port city of Mariupol delivered devastating testimony before US lawmakers on Thursday, recounting her experiences of torture, death and terror. Yuliia Paievska, who was detained in Mariupol in March and held by Russian and pro-Russia forces for three months, spoke before the Helsinki Commission, a government agency created in part to promote compliance with human rights internationally. Known by the nickname Taira, Paievska gained global attention after she slipped her bodycam footage to the Associated Press just before they left Mariupol. Her voice choked with emotion, she listed for the commission some of the atrocities she witnessed in Mariupol and in captivity: Pregnant prisoners, their fate unknown to their relatives or to the state. A fighter who was beaten for three hours and then thrown into a basement like a sack. And only a day later, someone came to him. A dead child in a mother’s arm. A seven-year-old boy with bullet wounds dying in my lap because I could not ward off death in this case. Prisoners in their cells screaming for weeks and dying from the torture without any medical help during this internment of hell. The only thing they felt before death was abuse and additional beating. My friend, whose eyes I closed before his body closed down. And another friend. And another, and another. A city of a half a million people dying before my eyes, under air strikes, methodical, planned. Airstrikes on hospitals and residential areas. A hospital full of wounded soldiers and civilians where anaesthetic drugs have run out and antibiotics are about to run out too. Soldiers and entire medical staff sleeping two, three hours daily because surgeries are one right after another. Medivac cars arriving every five, 10 minutes where the wounded and the dead are lying on top of each other, and whose fates are too impossible to understand even if you tried. Burning cars with burning people in them. Police officers taking out of the rubble women and children mutilated beyond recognition. People collecting water from puddles. Looted homes. Dogs who once were pets dragging human limbs around the city. Prisoners who were forced to take off clothes by their killers before they were murdered slowly and slaughtered. Specially prepared torture chambers “Do you know why we do this to you?” Paievska said a Russian soldier asked her as he tortured her. “Because you can,” she responded. Russian troops launched missiles targeting infrastructure facilities in the Kirovohrad oblast in eastern Ukraine today, said Andrii Raikovych, governor of the region. The attack was reported around the Petrove village, Raikovych said. Air defence was able to shoot down one rocket. In a quiet rebuke to Germany, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, addressed European Union member states who were not fulfilling their commitments to equip Ukraine. “To all member states: it’s absolutely vital and necessary to support Ukraine with the military equipment they need to defend themselves. They have proven that they are able to do that if they are well equipped,” she said. “This is the general recommendation to all member states.” When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shocked the world in announcing a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons. He committed to sending missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression – but six months later, many of those much-needed weapons have yet to arrive. In recent days, Ukraine upped its calls for more air defence and overall weapons deliveries, after a dramatically successful counter-offensive that has resulted in the recapturing of the Kharkiv region – but also retaliatory targeted attacks on the country’s infrastructure and repeated Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, ended her remarks in Kyiv by declaring that Ukraine has the European Union as a friend “forever”. “We will never be able to match the sacrifice that the Ukrainians are giving when they lose their homes or they cry for their beloved ones that have gone. We will never be able to compensate what you do with your fight for democracy, for humanity, for the respect of the international rule of law,” Von der Leyen said. “But what we can tell you is that you have your European friends by your side as long as it takes, and we are friends forever.” The European Union has earmarked €150m to aid internally displaced people in Ukraine get shelter through the winter, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said at Thursday’s press conference in Kyiv. The EU has also set aside an additional €100m for reconstruction and repair work for schools that have been damaged in the invasion, with Von der Leyen noting that there are already 70 schools that immediately require work and 70,000 children who need schools to go back to. “It’s the children and the education where the future begins,” she said. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is in Kyiv for the third time since Russian forces invaded the country on 24 February – and since Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has begun more actively vying to join the European Union. In June, Ukraine was granted candidacy status and today, Von der Leyen said the country’s “ascension process is well on track”. “It’s impressive to see the speed, the determination, the preciseness to which you are progressing. We support you wherever we can,” she said in a joint press conference with Zelenskiy. “I cannot say to speed up the process because you are speeding it up. That is very good.” Von der Leyen added that at the same time, “we have agreed that we need to work as much as possible to make sure that Ukraine has more business, more income and that it’s as seamless access to the European single market as possible for Ukraine.” Von der Leyen congratulated Zelenskiy on Ukraine’s recent military success in recapturing large swathes of territory in the Kharkiv region, and noted how impressive it was to see how “life has come back to Kyiv” since her last visit. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is holding a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine has been vying to join the EU since the start of the Russian invasion, and was granted candidate status in June. Authorities continued to work to restore the liberated territories of the Kharkiv region back to their normal state, as the threat of landmines persisted and many areas still lacked access to electricity. A 54-year-old man was injured in a mine explosion in the Kupiansk district, and there have been other cases of detonations of civilians, Oleh Syniehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, said on Telegram. “I once again call on residents not to hurry back to the liberated territories until the demining is completed,” Syniehubov said. Demining is a priority at the moment, and in particular, demining “power lines, roads and life support facilities” so that the state emergency service can quickly work to then restore electricity to the places without it, Syniehubov said. In the meantime, Russian troops continue to launch missiles into the city of Kharkiv and into populated areas of Kharkiv, Syniehubov said. There have been no casualties, but the shelling damaged five buildings in the city of Vovchansk. Two loud explosions have just been reported in the southern part of the Russian-occupied Melitopol, a city in the Zaporizhzhia oblast, Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram. Fedorov did not elaborate on the explosions, but hinted at “losses of the enemy”. Reuters is reporting that Germany has given more details of its intention to supply further equipment to Ukraine. Defence minister Christine Lambrecht said in Berlin that her country will supply two more multiple rocket launchers to Kyiv. “We have decided to deliver two more MARS II multiple rocket launchers including 200 rockets to Ukraine,” she told a Bundeswehr conference, adding the training of the Ukrainian operators was expected to start in September. “On top of this, we will send 50 Dingo armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine,” Lambrecht announced, referring to a type of armoured vehicle. She also said a deal on a circle swap of infantry fighting vehicles with Greece and Ukraine was almost completed, meaning Germany would soon hand over 40 Marder IFVs to Greece while Greece, in turn, would pass on 40 of its Soviet-built BMP-1 IFVs to Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is in Samarkand in Uzbekistan, where he is attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, and has met China’s president, Xi Jinping. The Russian news agency Tass is carrying some quotes from the Russian president. In a pointed rebuke to the US, he told attenders: “Attempts to create a unipolar world have recently taken on an absolutely ugly shape and are absolutely unacceptable for the vast majority of states on the planet.” Tass quotes Xi saying that the world is facing “colossal changes unprecedented in history” and that Russia and the People’s Republic of China would work together to “set an example of a responsible world power and play a leading role in bringing such a rapidly changing world onto a path of sustainable and positive development.” Putin said that trade turnover between China and Russia had increased by 35% last year. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is in Kyiv this morning to meet with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Zelenskiy, in his first in-person appearance after getting in a minor car crash yesterday, presented Von der Leyen with the award of the First Class of the Order of Yaroslav the Wise. Another Russian missile has hit Kryvyi Rih, just barely half a day after eight Russian missiles took out hydraulic structures along the Inhulets River, causing extensive flooding. Today’s missile strike hit an industrial site and “the destruction is serious,” said Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called the attack on the Kryvyi Rih hydraulic structures “a war crime” and “an act of terror”. “Beaten by Ukrainian army on the battlefield, Russian cowards are now at war with our critical infrastructure and civilians,” Kuleba said. “Russia is a terrorist state and must be recognised as such.” Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that Russian gas exports to the European Union would decline by 50bn cubic metres this year – a third of last year’s total Russian gas exports to the EU, Interfax news agency is reporting. Last year, Russia exported about 150bn cubic metres in gas to the EU. Should the US decide to supply Kyiv with longer-range missiles, that would cross a “red line” and the US would then become “a party to the conflict”, Russia’s foreign ministry said Thursday. Ukraine is already using US-made high mobility artillery rocket systems – just not US-made longer-range missiles. Ukraine’s state border guard service rescued five teenagers who had been locked in a basement for seven days by Russian troops in the recently liberated city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region. The teenagers, four girls and a boy aged 15 to 17, are all students of the same educational institute. They said Russian soldiers had locked them in the basement without an explanation. “They are safe now,” the state border guard service said on Telegram. The Russian-occupied Luhansk oblast unfortunately should not expect a swift liberation as seen in the Kharkiv oblast, Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk oblast, said on Thursday. “They are preparing to defend themselves: the Russians are digging in at Svatovo and Troitske,” Haidai wrote on Telegram, referencing two settlements in his oblast. “Heavy fighting continues in many directions, including in Luhansk region. The Kharkiv ‘instant’ scenario will not be repeated.” Haidai said Russian troops were now gathering men in prisons. “We will have to fight hard for our region,” Haidai said. “The Russians are preparing for defence.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home city, Kryvyi Rih, is experiencing excessive flooding after eight Russian missiles struck hydraulic structures along the Inhulets river in a targeted attack that aligns with Ukraine’s concerns that Russia will continue to target Ukraine’s infrastructure in retribution for its success in regaining occupied territory. Footage shared on Telegram and social media shows streets and downstream settlements flooded after the Inhulets river broke its banks. In his nightly video address, the Ukrainian president said, “Everything is being done to eliminate the consequences of yet another vile Russian act.” Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry, said on Thursday that if the US decided to supply Kyiv with longer-range missiles, that would cross a “red line” and the US would then become “a party to the conflict”, Reuters is reporting. Ukraine is already using US-made high mobility artillery rocket systems – just not US-made longer-range missiles. Maria Zakharova added that Russia “reserves the right to defend its territory”. Izium was one of at least 388 settlements liberated by the Ukrainian military in the Kharkiv region since 6 September. Many of the about 150,000 people living here had been under Russian occupation since almost the very start of the invasion – half a year. Guardian correspondents Isabel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo were there yesterday to speak to the residents and understand what those six months were like for them: Read more here: Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that Russian gas exports to the European Union would decline by 50bn cubic metres this year – a third of last year’s total Russian gas exports to the EU, Interfax news agency is reporting. Russia exported about 150bn cubic metres in gas to the EU last year, according to Reuters. Russian energy supplies to Europe have significantly declined this year amid a stand-off and sweeping western sanctions against Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Before the invasion, Russia supplied about 40% of the EU’s gas. That share has now plummeted to 9%, with Moscow cutting supplies to Europe and blaming western sanctions for the dip. Ukraine’s state border guard service rescued five teenagers who had been locked in a basement for seven days by Russian troops in the recently liberated city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region. The teenagers, four girls and a boy aged 15 to 17, are all students of the same educational institute. They said Russian soldiers had locked them in the basement without an explanation. “They are safe now,” the state border guard service said on Telegram. Another Russian missile has hit Kryvyi Rih, just barely half a day after eight Russian missiles took out hydraulic structures along the Inhulets River, causing extensive flooding. The missile struck an industrial site in the city, said Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration. “The destruction is serious,” Vilkul said, but he added that authorities are still working to clarify any losses and further consequences. Kryvyi Rih is the hometown of Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The strike on the hydraulic structures, which resulted in forced evacuations and damaged homes, aligns with Ukraine’s concerns that Russia will continue to target Ukraine’s infrastructure in retribution for its success in regaining occupied territory. The Russian missile strike targeting the Kryvyi Rih hydraulic structures is “a war crime” and an “act of terror”, said Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. The strikes caused extensive flooding in areas of the city after the Inhulets River rose an estimated 2.5 metres, damaging at least 112 homes. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who grew up in Kryvyi Rih, also condemned the strike. “Everything is being done to eliminate the consequences of yet another vile Russian act,” he said in a video address released early Thursday. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is in Kyiv this morning to meet with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Ukraine has been vying to join the European Union since the start of the Russian invasion, and was granted candidate status in June. This is Zelenskiy’s first major in-person appearance after getting in a minor car crash yesterday – a car collided with the president’s cars and escort cars in Kyiv. He was not seriously hurt and appears in good health. The major city of Kryvyi Rih struggled to contain damage to its water system from Russian missile attacks. The largest city in central Ukraine, with an estimated pre-war population of 650,000, was targeted by eight cruise missiles on Wednesday, officials said. The missile strikes hit the Karachunov reservoir dam. “The water pumping station was destroyed. The river broke through the dam and overflowed its banks. Residential buildings are just a few meters away from the river,” Ukrainian legislator Inna Sovsun said. Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the Krivyi Rih military administration, said in a post on Telegram that 112 homes were flooded but that works to repair the dam on the Inhulets river were under way, and that “flooding was receding”. He added that water levels had “dropped considerably” and that there were no casualties. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was involved in a traffic accident in Kyiv last night, but he is not seriously hurt, his spokesperson said in a Facebook post early on Thursday. Serhii Nykyforov, who did not say when the accident occurred, said Zelenskiy’s car had collided with a private vehicle. “The president was examined by a doctor, no serious injuries were found,” he said, adding the accident would be investigated. Medics accompanying Zelenskiy gave the driver of the private car emergency aid and put him in an ambulance, he said. In his nightly televised address, video of which was posted shortly after the accident, Zelenskiy said he had just returned from the area around Kharkiv, adding that “almost the entire region is de-occupied” after a lightning counteroffensive to dislodge Russian troops. “It was an unprecedented movement of our soldiers – the Ukrainians once again managed to do what many thought was impossible,” he said. After visiting the liberated city of Izium, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s troops had recaptured around 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) of territory. Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, has claimed that about 120 Ukrainian soldiers were killed while trying to enter Kherson region in the south of Ukraine via the Kinburn Spit. Rail services will resume between Kharkiv and Balakliia in Kharkiv oblast on Thursday. Workers have already repaired bridges and dozens of damaged tracks after Balakliia was liberated on 8 September. Ukraine has continued to consolidate control of the newly liberated Kharkiv region, the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest briefing. The update said some Russian forces appeared to have fled the Ukrainian troops’ advance “in apparent panic”, leaving behind key equipment. Ukraine’s defence ministry found what its officials believe to be a “torture chamber” used by Russian troops to hold Ukrainian prisoners in the city of Balakliia. While some Balakliia residents told the Guardian that they had little interaction with the Russian forces, who mostly stayed on edges of the town, and did not experience the scenes of torture and execution seen elsewhere in the country, Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv region national police investigation department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. One resident told the BBC that he was held by Russians in the city’s police station for more than 40 days and was tortured with electrocution. Russian president Vladimir Putin, has arrived in Samarkand in Uzbekistan, where he is later expected to meet China’s Xi Jinping. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Kyiv Thursday morning. She has tweeted that she will be meeting Zelenskiy and Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. On Wednesday, addressing the European parliament in Strasbourg, Von der Leyen insisted “Putin will fail and Europe will prevail” and said that the EU would stay the course with its sanctions on Russia. “The sanctions are here to stay,” she said. “This is the time for us to show resolve not appeasement.” Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said on Thursday that according to Kyiv’s own estimates, Ukraine needs €350bn (£300bn / $350bn) for reconstruction. The prospects for peace in Ukraine are currently “minimal”, the UN secretary general said on Wednesday after a phone conversation with Putin. “I have the feeling we are still far away from peace. I would be lying if I would say it could happen soon,” Guterres said, adding: “I have no illusion; at the present moment the chances of a peace deal are minimal.” Even a ceasefire was “not in sight”, he said. Kremlin sources “are now working to clear Putin of any responsibly of the defeat, instead blaming the loss of almost all of occupied Kharkiv oblast on under-informed military advisers”, according to the US-based thinktank Institute of the Study of War. In a statement reported by CNBC, the institute said that “Kremlin officials and state media propagandists are extensively discussing the reasons for the Russian defeat in Kharkiv oblast, a marked change from their previous pattern of reporting on exaggerated or fabricated Russian successes with limited detail”. Putin still believes he was right to launch an invasion of Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Wednesday after a 90-minute telephone call with the Russian president. “Sadly, I cannot tell you that the impression has grown that it was a mistake to begin this war,” Scholz said in a press briefing. Germany has delivered four more Gepard anti-aircraft guns and 65 refrigerators to Ukraine, the German government announced on Wednesday. The four additional units bring the total number of Gepard units provided by Germany to Ukraine to 24. Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency is carrying quotes from Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine. He told RIA that an attempt to enter the region via the Kinburn Spit has been repulsed. RIA quotes him saying “The landing attempt was exclusively on the Kinburn Spit, but everything was repulsed, the Nazis have no chance of entering the Kherson region.” The report goes on to say: According to him, the Ukrainian landing, most likely, set off from Ochakiv. “There are points there, military bases that have remained since the days of the Soviet Union. But everything is controlled, the entire perimeter is visible. The Nazis have absolutely no chance of entering from the sea,” Stremousov stressed. Earlier, he told RIA Novosti that about 120 Ukrainian soldiers were destroyed by the allied forces while trying to land troops. Stremousov also denied reports that Ukrainian troops entered the Kherson region. According to Stremousov, he travels daily to the village of Kiselevka on the border with the Mykolaiv region, which “is seen on the Internet every day.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted a series of images to Telegram of Ukrainian flags flying over settlements that their armed forces have recaptured in Kharkiv in recent days. The Ukrainian president said: The path to the return of all our territories is getting clearer. We see the contours of restoration of our state’s territorial integrity. We know this is a hard path, but it is possible to pass it. And we are doing that. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has arrived in Samarkand in Uzbekistan, where he is later expected to meet China’s Xi Jinping. Putin has posed for some pictures with Kyrgyzstan’s president, Sadyr Japarov. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has posted a status update to Telegram of the overnight situation. He said: Around midnight, the Russians destroyed a high-rise building in Bakhmut. According to preliminary information, four people may be under the rubble. Emergency services are on site. In Toretsk, the Russians targeted a hospital – injured one person, damaged three departments. In Myrnohrad, they hit a mine – one person was injured. Every crime of the Russians is carefully documented. They will be held responsible for everything. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are some images released by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine of repair work being carried out on the water infrastructure at Kryvyi Rih and evacuations taking place. Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said on Thursday that according to Kyiv’s own estimates, Ukraine needs €350bn (£300bn / $350bn) for reconstruction. Reuters reports that Habeck was welcoming G7 trade ministers during a meeting at Neuhardenberg Castle in the state of Brandenburg. Asked about the prospects for the war, Habeck said “You now can see that it could come to an end with victory for freedom and democracy.” Ukraine’s trade minister Yulia Svyrydenko is also attending the event. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has arrived in Kyiv. She has tweeted that she will be meeting President Volodomyr Zelenskiy andUkraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Yesterday, addressing the European parliament in Strasbourg, Von der Leyen insisted “Putin will fail and Europe will prevail” and said that the EU would stay the course with its sanctions on Russia. “The sanctions are here to stay,” she said. “This is the time for us to show resolve not appeasement.” Here is a video clip of her speech yesterday. Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Kharkiv oblast has degraded Russia’s artillery and air defence systems in the region, according to the latest report from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think-tank. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on 14 September that the intensity of Russian artillery attacks on Kharkiv City has decreased significantly, suggesting that Ukraine’s counteroffensive has degraded Russian forces’ ability to conduct routine artillery strikes on the centre of Kharkiv City as Russian forces have been pushed eastward towards the Oskil River and north back into Russia. Following a Russian strike with eight cruise missiles on Wednesday on civilian water infrastructure on the town of Kryvyi Rih there has been flooding. Reuters reports that Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the Krivyi Rih military administration, said in a post on Telegram that 112 homes were flooded but that works to repair the dam on the Inhulets river were under way, and that “flooding was receding”. The BBC quotes Vilkul saying that water levels had “dropped considerably” and that there were no casualties. Rail services will resume between Kharkiv and Balakliia in Kharkiv oblast on Thursday, the Kyiv Independent reports, based on a Telegram post from Ukrainian Railways. Workers have already repaired bridges and dozens of damaged tracks after Balakliia was liberated on 8 September. Ukrainian forces shot down four Russian planes in the past 24 hours, the Kyiv Independent reports, based on an update from the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. The update said three Russian Su-25 and one Su-24m were shot down while operating over Ukrainian territory, while the Russian forces’ primary tactic continued to be the targeting of civilian settlements, 30 of which were fired at with artillery, missiles, or a combination of both. A Russian official who called for Vladimir Putin to resign on Monday is standing by his statements, despite being fined and threatened with jail time, CNN reports. Nikita Yuferev, a deputy in Smolninskoye Municipal District in St Petersburg, reportedly said: “We will continue to insist on his resignation.” Yuferev said he was doing it for his children, saying that he wants them to be able to speak their minds at demonstrations and protests. “I don’t want them to fear retaliation from the police.” Ukraine has continued to consolidate control of the newly liberated Kharkiv region, the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest briefing. The update, posted on Twitter, said some Russian forces appeared to have fled the Ukrainian troops’ advance “in apparent panic”, leaving behind key equipment. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says Ursula von der Leyen will visit Kyiv on Thursday. In his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said the European Commission president would visit as Ukraine continues its bid for full EU membership, and comes a day after a representative from Kyiv attended a full meeting of the European parliament. The rout of the Russian army in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region seems likely to be a turning point in Kyiv’s battle to kick Russian troops out of the country, but it may also cause much broader fallout for Moscow, as other former Soviet countries witness what appears to be the limits of Moscow’s capabilities. The Guardian’s eastern Europe correspondent, Shaun Walker, has analysed what Moscow’s setbacks could mean for the wider region. You can read that report here: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin has arrived in the Uzbek city of Samarkand in preparation for his meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, Reuters reports. Putin and Xi will meet early on Thursday afternoon, a schedule distributed by the Russian delegation to media showed. The two leaders are in Uzbekistan to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a regional security group. They will also hold a three-way meeting with Mongolia’s president, Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, on Thursday. As the leaders prepared to meet, China and Russia have held joint naval exercises in the Pacific. The navies of the two countries conducted tactical manoeuvres and exercises involving artillery and helicopters, Reuters reported. As Moscow’s forces pull back from the Kharkiv region, our Russia correspondent, Andrew Roth, reports that some of its supporters are in shock as the Kremlin reneges on a vow that helped project power into captured towns and villages. Just weeks ago, Irina was working in the Russian occupation administration in Kupiansk, a large town in northern Ukraine that had been captured days after Vladimir Putin launched his war against the country. But then, as Russian troops fled the city and the Ukrainian army retook occupied territories in the country’s north, she and her family fled what they expected would be swift punishment for collaborating with the Russian invasion force. You can read the full story here: The major city of Kryvyi Rih is struggling to contain damage to its water system from Russian missile attacks. The largest city in central Ukraine, with an estimated pre-war population of 650,000, was targeted by eight cruise missiles on Wednesday, officials said. A report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said footage of the aftermath of the attack showed a 2.5 metre rise in the level of the Inhulets River in Kryvyi Rih. “The water pumping station was destroyed. The river broke through the dam and overflowed its banks. Residential buildings are just a few meters away from the river,” Ukrainian legislator Inna Sovsun said on Twitter. The missile strikes hit the Karachunov reservoir dam, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address released early on Thursday. The water system had no military value and hundreds of thousands of civilians depend on it daily, he said. The ISW report said the attacks may have been intended to damage Ukrainian pontoon bridges further downstream as part of efforts to disrupt the Kherson counteroffensive, it said. Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. At 7.30am in Kyiv, these are the latest developments. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was involved in a traffic accident in Kyiv, but he is not seriously hurt, his spokesperson said in a Facebook post early on Thursday. Serhii Nykyforov, who did not say when the accident occurred, said Zelenskiy’s car had collided with a private vehicle. “The president was examined by a doctor, no serious injuries were found,” he said, adding the accident would be investigated. Medics accompanying Zelenskiy gave the driver of the private car emergency aid and put him in an ambulance, he said. Eight Russian missiles that struck Kryvyi Rih on Wednesday were directed at hydraulic structures, causing enough damage that the water level of the Inhulets RInhulets riveriver was rising and posing a serious threat to the city. This aligns with Ukraine’s concerns that Russia will continue to target Ukraine’s infrastructure in retribution for its success in regaining occupied territory. Kryvyi Rih is Zelenskiy’s home town. In his nightly televised address, video of which was posted shortly after the accident, Zelenskiy said he had just returned from the area around Kharkiv, adding that “almost the entire region is de-occupied” after a lightning counteroffensive to dislodge Russian troops. “It was an unprecedented movement of our soldiers – the Ukrainians once again managed to do what many thought was impossible,” he said. After visiting the liberated city of Izium, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s troops had recaptured around 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) of territory. Ukraine’s defence ministry found what its officials believe to be a “torture chamber” used by Russian troops to hold Ukrainian prisoners in the city of Balakliia. While some Balakliia residents told the Guardian that they had little interaction with the Russian forces, who mostly stayed on edges of the town, and did not experience the scenes of torture and execution seen elsewhere in the country, Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv region national police investigation department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. One resident told the BBC that he was held by Russians in the city’s police station for more than 40 days and was tortured with electrocution. Germany has delivered four more Gepard anti-aircraft guns and 65 refrigerators to Ukraine, the German government announced on Wednesday. The four additional units bring the total number of Gepard units provided by Germany to Ukraine to 24. Kremlin sources “are now working to clear [Russia’s President Vladimir] Putin of any responsibly of the defeat, instead blaming the loss of almost all of occupied Kharkiv oblast on under-informed military advisers”, according to the Institute of the Study of War. In a statement reported by CNBC, the institute said that “Kremlin officials and state media propagandists are extensively discussing the reasons for the Russian defeat in Kharkiv oblast, a marked change from their previous pattern of reporting on exaggerated or fabricated Russian successes with limited detail”. The prospects for peace in Ukraine are currently “minimal”, the UN secretary general said on Wednesday after a phone conversation with Vladimir Putin. “I have the feeling we are still far away from peace. I would be lying if I would say it could happen soon,” Guterres said, adding: “I have no illusion; at the present moment the chances of a peace deal are minimal.” Even a ceasefire was “not in sight”, he said. Putin still believes he was right to launch an invasion of Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Wednesday after a 90-minute telephone call with the Russian president. “Sadly, I cannot tell you that the impression has grown that it was a mistake to begin this war,” Scholz said in a press briefing. Russian troops have returned to Kreminna, a city in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region that was “completely empty” yesterday, said Serhiy Hadai, the region’s governor, and tore down the Ukrainian flags that local partisans had raised in celebration. Yesterday, a similar situation happened in Svatove – Russian troops left but returned after some time, Hadai said. Russian troops also left Starobilsk, another city in the Luhansk region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2021/sep/16/prisoners-of-the-ghostland-review-testicle-detonating-nicolas-cage-sci-fi","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-16T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Prisoners of the Ghostland review – testicle-detonating Nicolas Cage sci-fi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/16/prisoners-of-the-ghostland-review-testicle-detonating-nicolas-cage-sci-fi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/sep/16/prisoners-of-the-ghostland-review-testicle-detonating-nicolas-cage-sci-fi","fields":{"headline":"Prisoners of the Ghostland review – testicle-detonating Nicolas Cage sci-fi","bodyText":"Cult Japanese film-maker Sion Sono (Love Exposure, Suicide Club) never shies away from an opportunity to shock and surprise with lashings of gore, weirdness and lurid, louche lunacy. Nicolas Cage, meanwhile (now practically a cult himself), loves to rage, bellow and glower in offbeat low-budget films, apparently the kookier the better. They’ve teamed up for this beyond-bonkers, cross-cultural bricolage of styles and influences, and the result is predictably excessive, noisy and more than a little exhausting. But mostly in a fun way, as long as you’re not bothered by gratuitous violence, incoherence and a deep streak of silly. The setting is some kind of future Earth/parallel universe/post-apocalyptic zona – the why and when is not really important – that’s a mashup of neon-streaked Tokyo fleshpot and Mad Max-style wild west dystopia. A warlord called the Governor (Bill Moseley, hamming it up almost as much as Cage) runs a brothel-prison from which one of his favourite “granddaughters”, Bernice (Sofia Boutella, underused), escapes with three other comfort women. So the Governor hauls our nameless hero (Cage), a former bank robber, out of pokey and sends him off to find Bernice. But first he zips the hero up into a leather jumpsuit rigged with tiny bombs that will blow bits of his anatomy up should he try to hurt her, including explosives attached to each testicle. Off the hero goes into a wasteland populated by demented extras dressed like an am-dram ensemble playing the rats in a Pied Piper production, folks with bits of broken mannequin parts glued to their bodies, and religious zealots who like to give backstory-revealing presentations with cue cards. Is it wrong to find the funniest part of the film is when one of the bombs goes off and blows up Cage’s left nut? It’s a really good bit, as is the scene towards the end where Bernice’s “sister” (Yuzuka Kakaya) mows down half the cast with a Gatling gun. If that’s not your cup of tea, then at least it’s pretty hard not to be entertained by Chieko Matsumoto’s exquisite costumes and Toshihiro Isomi’s Mutoid Waste-style sets, or the antic energy emanating from the extras, itself combustible enough to jumpstart a rusting nuclear power station. • Prisoners of the Ghostland is released on 17 September in cinemas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/16/futaba-last-fukushima-town-to-reopen-welcomes-back-its-first-residents","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-16T14:01:59Z","webTitle":"Last Fukushima town to reopen welcomes back its first residents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/futaba-last-fukushima-town-to-reopen-welcomes-back-its-first-residents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/16/futaba-last-fukushima-town-to-reopen-welcomes-back-its-first-residents","fields":{"headline":"Last Fukushima town to reopen welcomes back its first residents","bodyText":"Late last month, Yoichi Yatsuda slept in his own home for the first time in more than a decade. As a resident of Futaba, a town in the shadow of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, there was a time when simply spending the night in his family home had seemed an impossible dream. The 70-year-old was one of tens of thousands of people who were forced to flee and start a life in nuclear limbo when the plant had a triple meltdown in March 2011. As Japan reeled after the earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people and triggered the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, Yatsuda and his wife, Analisa, and an estimated 160,000 other residents of Fukushima prefecture packed a few belongings and left, believing they would be back within weeks. “If you had told me at the beginning that I would have to wait this long to come home, I would have given up straight away,” said Yatsuda, a retired professional keirin cyclist who has lived in more than 10 places since the disaster. Today, the couple are attempting to rebuild their lives in Futaba, the last of dozens of towns and villages to have ended their status as no-go zones after radiation levels were deemed low enough for people to return. They made periodic visits to repair and refurbish their house, which was once overrun by wild boar, and have been allowed to stay overnight on a trial basis since late January. Local authorities hope more people will follow when the evacuation order is officially lifted in parts of the town later this year. Yatsuda’s homecoming has been bittersweet. Before the disaster, Futaba was home to about 7,000 people. Just 15 residents applied to take part in the trial, and to date only three, including Yasuda and his wife, have moved back permanently. Many of his former neighbours have found jobs and built new lives in other parts of the region and across Japan. In a poll by the reconstruction agency, just 10% of Futaba’s former residents said they would like to return, while 60% had no plans to go back. Those with young children are the most reluctant to contemplate returning to a town that has no schools, shops, restaurants, hospitals or public services. Those with homes that survived the tsunami – which killed 50 people in Futaba – have had them demolished, leaving the town dotted with empty plots of land. Yatsuda’s only neighbour – although he lives a short drive away – is Yasushi Hosozawa, who lives in a tiny room above a parking space and a shed filled with his beloved fishing rods. “I was born here, and I always felt that if I was ever given the chance to return, then I would take it,” said Hosozawa, whose wife and son run a restaurant in another Fukushima town farther inland. “I love fishing and have my own boat moored here … that was a big factor in deciding to come back.” The 78-year-old, a former plumber and cafeteria owner, returned late last month to find that his water supply had yet to be reconnected, meaning he had to drive to the railway station to use the toilet. “There used to be lots of people here,” he said, pointing at patches of grass where his neighbours’ homes once stood. “But look at it now … it’s a wasteland.” Like many Fukushima residents, Yatsuda has little positive to say about Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company that operates the nuclear plant, where decommissioning work is expected to last decades. “I believed Tepco when they said that something like the 2011 disaster could never happen,” he said. “It’s all about trust. When I returned to Fukushima 40 years ago, I was assured that this was a safe place to live.” While no one expects life in Futaba to ever return to its pre-disaster normality, local officials believe more people will resettle. The town has set a target of attracting about 2,000 people, including new residents, over the next five years, and new public housing for 25 households will open in October. “Very few people want to come back, so can you really say that the town has recovered?” said Yatsuda, who will plant flowers in his garden this spring and, he hopes, reopen the gym behind his home where he trained aspiring keirin racers before the disaster. “The problem is people can’t see physical signs of recovery with their own eyes. Unless the authorities do more to create jobs and attract new residents, I can’t see things improving much in the next 10 years.” The stress of life as an evacuee has taken a toll on his mental and physical health, but he has no regrets about returning to a town that, its three current residents aside, still resembles a nuclear ghost town. “This is our house. This is where we played with our children when they were little,” he said. While the couple have no concerns about radiation, they have accepted that, for now, they must travel outside the town to spend time with their eight grandchildren. “We used to enjoy seeing friends and playing with our grandchildren here,” said Analisa. “It would be great if younger families moved here … I desperately want to see and hear children again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/23/could-a-behavioural-change-campaign-save-energy-and-cut-russian-gas-imports","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Could a behavioural change campaign save energy and cut Russian gas imports?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/could-a-behavioural-change-campaign-save-energy-and-cut-russian-gas-imports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/23/could-a-behavioural-change-campaign-save-energy-and-cut-russian-gas-imports","fields":{"headline":"Could a behavioural change campaign save energy and cut Russian gas imports?","bodyText":"There is a second world war poster showing a red-faced couple looking angrily at their daughter as she adds more fuel to their fire. The caption reads: “Save fuel to make munitions for battle.” It was one of a series of public campaigning posters aimed at driving a collective response to the need to save energy for the war effort. The message was clear: stop using so much fuel, because it is needed for the fighting troops. Today, as Europe and the UK try to pivot away from their dependence on Russian fossil fuels, there is as yet no similar call for collective action from the populace. But Russia gets 40% of its revenue from fossil fuel exports, so any reduction in oil and gas demand will hit Vladimir Putin’s finances. Europe imports 40% of its gas from Russia and 25% of its oil, so any drop in consumption could make a significant impact. The UK is less dependent on Russian fossil fuels; less than 4% of total UK gas supply and 8% of UK oil demand in 2021 was from Russia, according to government figures. But in an interconnected energy world, if Europe cuts imports of Russian oil and gas it will need to source it from elsewhere, contributing to a squeeze on global supplies and global price rises in oil and gas. A recent paper by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change says reducing our oil and gas consumption could be an important tool to help Europe through the medium-term challenge of moving away from Russian energy. There is a need to address energy demand now, according to Prof Nick Eyre, director of the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions at Oxford University, both as a result of the Ukraine crisis and to tackle climate change. Reducing demand and decarbonising our energy systems is something we should be doing anyway for climate reasons, said Eyre, in order to meet our targets for net zero. “This energy security and price crisis is another prompt to do this,” he said. “It will be expensive – but a windfall tax on companies who, at best, have had a pretty dubious relationship with Russia, would help pay for it.” Eyre said collective action was needed, driven by government, who should bring forward immediate detailed policies on decarbonising domestic heating in the UK. Domestic heating produces about 14% of UK emissions, and decarbonising the way homes are heated – meaning more efficient homes and the electrification of most heating systems – would cost an estimated £200bn over the next 30 years, according to the Institute for Government. Between now and 2050, emissions from residential buildings need to fall to zero at a rate of 3.4% a year based on current emission levels, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Eyre believes any new energy supply policy – expected to be announced by Boris Johnson in the coming days – will make no sense if it does not include energy reduction measures and the bringing forward of detailed plans to decarbonise our homes. “If it’s all about building nuclear power stations, this would take 10 years, so it’s not a very sensible strategy,” said Eyre. “Energy efficiency and renewable energy can provide what we need more quickly and less dangerously.” Molly Scott Cato, former Green MEP and professor of economics at the University of Roehampton, says the UK government should launch a massive, nationwide, and publicly funded home insulation programme backed up by information campaigns about how to use energy efficiently, including reducing the thermostat settings on central heating systems and introducing a 55mph speed limit on the national road network to cut energy demand. Public information messages could be created as part of this focusing on the dual benefits of helping the war effort against Putin and moving the UK towards meeting its climate targets to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050. Areas focused on could include where individuals can make changes as part of collective action to reduce energy demand and national policy areas. Behavioural changes that could make a difference Turn down the thermostat on your boiler by 1C. If everyone in the UK did this, it would reduce their energy demand by 10%. Energy bills would be cut by £670m, while saving 3.5m tonnes of CO2 a year, according to the Energy Savings Trust. Set your heating to come on only when required. This is estimated to help reduce a household’s electricity use by 2.8% and gas use by 2% (Energy Savings Trust). Set thermostats no higher than 19C and the water temperature in heating systems no higher than 55C, says the Committee on Climate Change. Keep your shower time to four minutes. This could save a typical household 950kWh of energy and 195kg of carbon emissions a year; equivalent to driving 700 miles from Birmingham to Aberdeen and back again (Energy Savings Trust). Turning lights off when leaving a room will save you around 70kWh of energy and 17kg of carbon annually – the equivalent to driving 61 miles from London to Canterbury (Energy Savings Trust). Insulate your home. A fully insulated home is 50% more energy efficient than a property that has no insulation, according to Eyre. Cut domestic energy demand by introducing a four-day week and encouraging more working from home, says the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions. Speed up the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps. After the failure of the Green Homes Grant, the government will launch its replacement on 1 April 2022. The boiler upgrade scheme will offer a £5,000 grant to replace gas boilers with air-sourced heat pumps. Switching from a typical gas heating system to an air-source heat pump could save about 9,200 kWh a year (Energy Savings Trust). Increase the use of renewables, which are now the cheapest form of energy production on the market. 649 solar and windfarms already have planning permission; if they went ahead they would save more gas than currently imported by the UK from Russia, according to Carbon Brief. Replace fossil-fuelled cars with electric ones. A fully electric vehicle could save 2 tonnes of CO2 a year and help end dependence on fossil fuel (CCC)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/03/queensland-lnp-breaks-with-federal-branch-to-oppose-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-02T22:58:29Z","webTitle":"Queensland LNP breaks with federal branch to oppose nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/03/queensland-lnp-breaks-with-federal-branch-to-oppose-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/03/queensland-lnp-breaks-with-federal-branch-to-oppose-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Queensland LNP breaks with federal branch to oppose nuclear power","bodyText":"One of the biggest detractors of the federal Queensland Liberal National party’s push to investigate nuclear energy as a potential power source for Australia has come from within its own house. The state LNP opposition has publicly declared its opposition to making any changes to the current bipartisan ban on nuclear energy generation, declaring the government would be better served in its goals by focusing on renewable energy sources, in a marked split from their federal state colleagues. Australia is once again looking at nuclear energy as a potential solution to its power woes, after a group of Coalition MPs, led by a cohort from Queensland, pushed the federal party room into investigating the prospect, through a parliamentary inquiry. But in a move which has surprised their federal counterparts, the Queensland state LNP spokesman for energy, Michael Hart, made a written submission to the inquiry, announcing his arm of the party’s opposition to any attempt to allow nuclear energy generation, citing the risks to the communities and the environment. Instead, Hart said the Queensland LNP supports “greater focus” on “energy efficiency measures, along with encouraging investment in renewable energy options like wind and solar, in combination with battery storage when it is technologically and economically feasible to do so”. “It is considered that Australia’s rich renewable energy resources are more affordable and bring less risk than the elevated cost and risk associated with nuclear energy,” Hart submitted. “The LNP encourages additional jobs and investment in Queensland’s renewable energy industry, while also supporting resource jobs and exploration which provides baseload power and employment for thousands of Queenslanders. “In addition to the possibility of accidents and operational failure, nuclear facilities can be a potential target for terrorists. Securing insurance around such possibilities would be virtually impossible. “In conclusion, the commercial, as well as the political risks, associated with nuclear energy are substantial. To this end, the LNP is strongly committed to an energy policy that delivers safe, affordable and reliable energy to consumers, while fulfilling Australia’s international emissions reduction obligations. “We believe this can be achieved without lifting the moratorium on nuclear energy generation. Accordingly, we would encourage the committee to ensure an increased emphasis is placed on measures to encourage investment in renewable energy that creates green jobs and lowers electricity bills, for both consumers and industry, which does not (underlined) include nuclear energy”. The state Labor government established a 50% renewable energy target by 2030 upon winning power in 2015. The federal inquiry was established after a group of Coalition MPs, led by Hinkler LNP member Keith Pitt and Queensland LNP senator James McGrath, pushed for an investigation into whether nuclear power should be considered as part of the mix, as the government hunts for a long term solution to Australia’s surging energy prices. Not wanting to reignite the war that led to the downfall of the national energy guarantee, and ultimately, Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership, the government acquiesced to calls for an investigation, which was established after a recommendation from Angus Taylor. The state LNP position stands in stark contrast to their federal colleagues, including conservative senator Amanda Stoker, who said that “Australia must develop a nuclear energy industry”, as well as her Queensland colleague Gerard Rennick. McGrath has publicly pushed for the nuclear discussion in numerous interviews and his own social media, as well as within the party room. Pitt, who describes himself as “technologically agnostic”, said the discussion had to be had. “The first priority for the nations future energy needs will always be reliability and affordability,” he said. “As technology changes I expect our energy mix will also change over a period of time. I am completely technology agnostic in terms of the fuel types that might be utilised. Currently Queensland has the country’s youngest fleet of coal fired generators and I expect they will continue to be a critical part of Queensland’s energy mix into the future.” He demurred from any questions on the split between state and federal lines, saying the state arm could “speak for themselves”, but attacked the state Labor government for its price management of the state owned power assets. But the submission did give Queensland Labor senator, Murray Watt, a late week boost. “This submission shows the LNP’s state MPs have had enough of their federal counterparts’ pointless culture war against renewable power,” he said. “Even the LNP’s state MPs acknowledge that renewables are a cheaper and safer way of meeting our future energy needs. “They have also slammed their federal counterparts’ pursuit of nuclear power as a massive waste of time and resources. “The Queensland LNP’s federal representatives should stop wasting everyone’s time by pursuing their obsession with nuclear power and get behind cheaper and safer means of meeting our energy needs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/mar/04/australias-biggest-superannuation-fund-commits-to-divesting-russian-assets","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"Australia’s biggest superannuation fund commits to divesting Russian assets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/australias-biggest-superannuation-fund-commits-to-divesting-russian-assets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/australias-biggest-superannuation-fund-commits-to-divesting-russian-assets","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s biggest superannuation fund commits to divesting Russian assets","bodyText":"Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $260bn AustralianSuper, has committed to divesting its Russian assets, after the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, called for Australian funds to ditch Russian investments. The fund said that it had already begun selling Russian stocks, and since June last year had reduced its holdings to between $175m and $180m. Aussie previously held at least $305m worth of Russian assets, including shares in the country’s biggest bank, Sberbank, that were worth almost $140m but are now all but worthless due to sanctions introduced following the invasion of Ukraine last week that have destroyed its European business. Another large industry fund, the $76bn Hostplus, said it would also sell its remaining Russian assets, which it said were now just $10m, down from $19m earlier in the week. The moves come after the treasurer and the minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, said on Thursday night that it was their “strong expectation” that Australian super funds would divest from Russia and the prudential regulator indicated it would take no action against funds that did so. Also on Thursday, Russia was kicked out of a key index that fund managers use to guide their investments after index provider MSCI said the country’s market was “uninvestable”. Other large funds including Australia’s second biggest, Australian Retirement Trust, Aware, Rest and Cbus, as well as sovereign wealth fund the Future Fund and the New South Wales government fund, committed to dumping Russian assets earlier in the week. However, selling Russian stocks is much more difficult than usual because the Moscow stock exchange was closed this week and the country’s central bank has banned processing foreign sell orders. In a statement, Aussie Super said it was “deeply concerned about the events unfolding in Ukraine”. “AustralianSuper is in full compliance with all relevant sanctions and, in accordance with our portfolio management approach, has been actively managing our exposure to Russian assets to address changing and emerging risks. “Since June 2021 we have reduced the fund’s exposure to Russian investments by nearly two-thirds from 0.22% to about 0.07% of total assets. “We will continue winding down the remaining exposure to divest our holdings in Russia as markets permit.” The chief executive of Hostplus, David Elias, said the fund was “committed to fully divest our remaining direct holdings in Russia”. “We continue to work with our existing managers across our investment portfolios to achieve this outcome acknowledging that our ability is somewhat hampered by the Russian central bank ordering market brokers to reject foreign clients trying to sell Russian securities,” he said. “We certainly feel for the Ukrainian people and the terrible situation they’re facing and believe this is the right thing to do.” • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Thursday night, Frydenberg and Hume said that even though super funds had little invested in Russia relative to Australia’s $3.5tn retirement savings pile, “it is important that Australia sends a clear and unequivocal signal that we condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine”. “The actions of Australia’s superannuation funds to divest of Russian assets will complement the range of sanctions imposed by the government to exert pressure on Russia, in alignment with our international partners,” the ministers said in a joint statement. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said it noted the government’s position and “will not be taking any action against trustees who seek to divest Russian assets in this context where trustees have considered such divestments in accordance with their duties”. The regulator’s statements came after concerns were raised about how rules around funds’ duties to investors would apply to divestments for political reasons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jul/08/weatherwatch-heatwaves-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-08T20:30:31Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: heatwaves test limits of nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/08/weatherwatch-heatwaves-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jul/08/weatherwatch-heatwaves-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: heatwaves test limits of nuclear power","bodyText":"Enthusiasts describe nuclear power as an essential tool to combat the climate emergency because, unlike renewables, it is a reliable source of base load power. This is a spurious claim because power stations are uniquely vulnerable to global heating. They need large quantities of cooling water to function, however the increasing number of heatwaves are threatening this supply. The French energy company EDF is curbing its output from four reactors in Bugey, on the Rhône River near the Swiss border, because the water is too warm and the flow is low. Some reactors in the US are also frequently affected. This matters in both countries because the increasing use of air conditioning means electricity demand is high during summer heatwaves and intermittent nuclear power is not much help. This does not affect nuclear power stations in the UK because they draw their water supplies from the sea, which stays relatively cool. However, it may affect plans to build small reactors on a lake in Trawsfynydd, Wales. And it may also reduce some of the UK’s power supplies during the summer. As heatwaves intensify, the flow of electricity from French reactors through the growing number of cross-Channel interconnector cables cannot be relied on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/07/ukraine-volodymr-zelenskiy-vows-revenge-russia-forces-fleeing-family-civilians-killed-shelling-irpin-town","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-07T02:16:15Z","webTitle":"Ukraine’s Zelenskiy vows revenge on Russian forces after fleeing family killed in shelling of Irpin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/ukraine-volodymr-zelenskiy-vows-revenge-russia-forces-fleeing-family-civilians-killed-shelling-irpin-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/07/ukraine-volodymr-zelenskiy-vows-revenge-russia-forces-fleeing-family-civilians-killed-shelling-irpin-town","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine’s Zelenskiy vows revenge on Russian forces after fleeing family killed in shelling of Irpin","bodyText":"Volodymr Zelenskiy has vowed to punish “every bastard’” who committed atrocities during the invasion of Ukraine amid outrage at Russia’s shelling of civilians as they tried to flee a town on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing a young family. The president of Ukraine said in a video address on Sunday night: “They were just trying to get out of town. To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war.” To the Russian forces behind the attack, in the town of Irpin on the western edge of the capital, Zelenskiy said: “There will be no quiet place on this earth for you. Except for the grave.” Hundreds of civilians had gathered near the bridge at Irpin on Sunday, seeking to escape the capital, with only a dozen Ukrainian soldiers there, mostly helping them with their luggage, according to the New York Times, whose team were filming at the time of the shelling. The mortar fire from the Russians began some distance away from the bridge, before coming nearer to the street where the civilians were caught out in the open, the Times reported. Eight died in the attack, including a woman, her teenage son and a primary school-age daughter, plus a family friend. Their belongings lay scattered around the street. In footage of the attack a group of fighters could be seen trying to help the family. The mayor of Irpin described seeing the four killed “in front of my eyes” when a shell hit them. “It is impudence, they are monsters. Irpin is at war, Irpin has not surrendered,” Oleksandr Markushyn said on Telegram, adding that part of the city was in Russian hands. Markushyn said another evacuation effort would begin on Monday morning. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday morning it would cease fire to allow civilians in the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Sumy to leave, but only for Russia or Belarus. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the fasting-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war, according to the head of the UN’s refugee agency. Vast numbers of Ukrainian civilians continue to flee cities under bombardment, including the besieged coastal city of Mariupol where Russian forces agreed again to allow a second urgent evacuation that ended in a fresh bombing. “It’s murder, deliberate murder,” Zelensky said in his address as he warned of more shelling to come on Monday. “Instead of humanitarian corridors, they can only ensure bloody ones.” Amid reports of increasingly indiscriminate attacks, the UK’s ministry of defence released its latest intelligence report, speculating that Russian forces had made “minimal ground advances” over the weekend, while a “high level of Russian air and artillery strikes” continued to hit military and civilian sites across the cities of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol. Ukraine will ask the international court of justice, the United Nations’ top court, on Monday to issue an emergency ruling requiring Russia to stop its invasion, arguing that Moscow’s justification for the attack is based on a faulty interpretation of genocide law. The UN security council is also expected to hold an emergency meeting for an update on the humanitarian crisis the war has created. In Russia, Vladimir Putin’s invasion has caused further outcry, with more than 4,300 people arrested after demonstrations in 21 cities. The jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny had called for protest across the country and the world. Oil prices have soared more than 10% and are closing in on their all-time high levels on global markets as the US and Europe considered a ban on Russian crude and the geopolitical impact of the invasion spread. With a humanitarian crisis spiralling inside Ukraine, it had been hoped that 200,000 of the 430,000 residents in Mariupol – where medicines and food are running short and people are living in freezing conditions with no heating – would be able to escape during an agreed nine-hour ceasefire on Sunday, but only a few hundred people are believed to have made it out before shelling resumed. The International Committee of the Red Cross implored the two sides to renegotiate, saying there were “devastating scenes of human suffering in Mariupol”. A third round of Russian-Ukrainian talks aimed at finding a way out of the bloody conflict is set for Monday. During a tense call with Putin in which Macron had also emphasised the need to avoid disaster at Ukraine’s nuclear power sites after the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant by Russian forces last week, France’s president reiterated the west’s demand that civilians be given safe passage. “The [humanitarian] situation is difficult” in Mariupol, a French official said. “Our demands remain the same: we want Russia to respond to these demands … very quickly and clearly.” Very few refugees from the strategic city on the Azov Sea made it out on Saturday, but one family, who did not give their names, arrived in the central city of Dnipro and recounted their harrowing experience. “We stayed in the basement for seven days with no heating, electricity or internet and ran out of food and water,” one of them said. “On the road, we saw there were bodies everywhere, Russians and Ukrainians … We saw that people had been buried in their basements.” The Kremlin said Putin had pinned the blame for the failure of the ceasefire to hold in Mariupol and neighbouring Volnovakha on “Ukrainian nationalists”. Putin “drew attention to the fact that Kyiv still does not fulfil agreements reached on this acute humanitarian issue”, the Kremlin said. “And the pause in hostilities was again used only to build up forces and means in their positions.” Rejecting Moscow’s denials, US secretary of state Antony Blinken told CNN: “We’ve seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would constitute a war crime.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/06/the-conflict-between-a-just-war-and-peace","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T16:45:34Z","webTitle":"The conflict between a just war and peace  | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/the-conflict-between-a-just-war-and-peace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/06/the-conflict-between-a-just-war-and-peace","fields":{"headline":"The conflict between a just war and peace","bodyText":"Andy Beckett (Pacifists are being elbowed out of British politics just when we need them most, 3 March) appears to think that we have the choice either to be pacifists or to have to “accept that the world is divided into two camps” – the liberal west and a totalitarian Russia. This is nonsense. It is possible to recognise that Ukraine requires the imposition of sanctions on Russia by the west and a ready supply of western arms and money to defend itself, without believing that the west has suddenly transmogrified into a sainted power bloc, cleansed of all past sins. To choose pacifism in the current circumstances is to opt for a groundless idealism over realpolitik. Ukrainian self-determination needs guns and money. To stand against the demand to arm Ukraine is to stand for Ukraine’s defeat. If Stop the War believes that there is nothing progressive about Vladimir Putin’s Russia, then it should want his invasion driven back and his regime’s financial lifeline choked off. Laughably, some on the left have even dragged out the old “the main enemy is at home” slogan – as if the UK was actually at war with Russia rather than simply seeking to support Ukraine. Believing that it’s necessary to oppose Putin’s attempt to drown Ukraine’s right to exist doesn’t mean turning a blind eye to Boris Johnson’s venality or to the proto-fascist leanings of Poland and Hungary, or to alibi the US’s own history of bloody anti-democratic interventions. Right now, though, calling for no sanctions against Russia and no arms to Ukraine means calling for Putin’s victory and its devastating consequences. Orwell was right in 1942 and he would say the same now. Faced with the current circumstances: “Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist.” Nick Moss London • Andy Beckett’s argument is full of contradictions. He claims that Stop the War upholds the right of the Ukrainian people to “self-determination” as well as Russia’s security concerns. What planet is he on? Russia has invaded a peaceful sovereign democracy and is bombing indiscriminately, killing civilians as well as attacking a nuclear power station. Keir Starmer was right to threaten to expel the Labour MPs who signed a Stop the War statement. Let’s hope that none of them ever become foreign secretary. We all want a just peace. June Purvis Portsmouth • It was a relief to read Andy Beckett’s warning about attempts to silence voices for peace. Guns and bombs have always been the foundation of UK foreign policy, and since the country’s acquisition of atom bombs, the two main parties have held the line together. It is pitiful therefore that Labour MPs who expressed their views by signing a letter should be threatened with expulsion (Report, 2 March). I long to live in a country that focuses its foreign policy on cooperation to end war and poverty, and to save our species from extinction, whether by nuclear war or climate change. Diana Francis Bath • Andy Beckett’s article has some resonance for me on how we challenge oppression. War is the ultimate oppressive force and those who lead us into it are the ultimate oppressors. Pacifists are activists. We do not stand back in our opposition to oppression, we stand firmly against it. Oppression grows when violence, militarism and war are the mechanisms that we use against it. Stop the War is challenging the oppression of war actively and incisively: it is not sitting on the fence, it is not giving succour to “our enemies”, it is making a stand for human freedom and crying out that another way is possible. Richard Ashwell Wolverhampton • While peace is nearly always preferable to war, sometimes there is a case for a just war, as argued by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas. The best example of this was the second world war to defeat fascism. Arguably, the same applies to efforts to defeat Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. I have supported Stop the War previously, when I marched against the Iraq war. But it is misguided on Nato expansion and arming Ukraine. Nato responded to requests from former Soviet satellites to join because of their fears of Russia. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine shows the wisdom of these requests. By arming Ukraine, Nato can at least give it a fighting chance of defending itself without being drawn into a direct conflict with Russia that would spark a war engulfing the whole of Europe. Dr Michael Herron London • Lindsey German’s article (We at Stop the War condemn the invasion of Ukraine, and warmongers on all sides, 4 March) is full of the misinterpretation of history. She refers to the breakup of the Warsaw pact and says Nato should have also been dissolved. But the pact was never a partnership of equals. It was a Russian empire. Diplomacy down the barrel of a gun. Nato wasn’t formed to defend against the Soviet Union. It was formed to defend against Russia and its vassals. As soon as the countries that had been invaded by Russia saw a chance for freedom they ran to Nato and the EU in the rightful belief that one day Russia would try to re-subjugate them. Stop the War restates Russian claims that Nato is a threat, but it poses no threat to Russia, only to Russian imperialist ambitions. Nobody is a “war enthusiast”. But faced with a bloodthirsty invader, Ukraine has no option other than to defend itself and we have a moral responsibility to assist it. Should we sit back and allow this atrocity? Putin’s stated objectives allow no room for diplomacy. No country can accept an ultimatum to become the vassal of another. Self-defence is no offence.

With the Russian naval assault in the south spreading, a second merchant ship – the Estonian-owned carrier Helt – was hit and sunk after a Bangladeshi-owned cargo ship had been hit by a projectile that killed one of its crew. The ports, spread along hundreds of miles of Ukraine’s coastline, running from the Sea of Azov in the east to the Black Sea, have become an increased focus of attention for Russian forces in recent days – as it has become clear that the latest phase of the Russian invasion plan is seeking to cut off and isolate large sections of the country. Cutting Ukraine’s access to its coast would deal a crippling blow to the country’s economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor stretching from its border, across Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and all the way west to Romania. Another key objective for Russian forces in the south east appeared to be Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine, Europe’s biggest, where Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by local residents and territorial defence forces. The moves in the country’s south have come as Russia forces have attacked the country in three directions, seeking to stretch Ukraine’s armed forces and damage their ability to respond. In the latest threat to Ukraine’s coastline, residents told the Guardian they were stepping up preparations to defend it against a potential Russian marine landing, amid sightings of a convoy of Russian warships, and US warnings that an amphibious assault on Odesa – Ukraine’s biggest port – would be an economic catastrophe for Ukraine. Residents in the city told the Guardian of a marked increase in Russian airstrikes on Wednesday as images emerged of beaches close to the city laid with mines, and other defences being prepared. Concern surrounding a potential amphibious landing targeting Odesa mounted on Thursday following images of a Russian naval convoy showing at least eight ships visible off the coast. The convoy appears to include a number of 4,080 tonne Ropucha-class large landing ships and supporting vessels. The south has seen some of Russia’s biggest military gains during the week-old war so far, with the capture of Kherson, on the Dnieper River, opening the way for the assault on Odesa as well as for Russian forces to push north. Describing the fall of Kherson as representing a major strategic loss for Ukraine’s defenders, Michael Clarke of the Royal United Services Institute said Russian forces were attempting to build “a land bridge” across the southern territory which he suggested they would then ultimately attempt to link to the northern front around the capital Kyiv. “Kherson is very important because it is the city that controls the water supply to the Crimea,” said Clarke in an online briefing. “It’s also the city that’s key to crossing the Dnieper River. And at some point the Russians will want to be on both sides of the river to move up and join up with their northern front. Kherson is a big gain for [the Russians]. It’s taken them a while but they are here now.” Mykolaiv’s regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said that big convoys of Russian troops were advancing on that city, which is another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding centre to the west. In Kherson itself, the regional governor, Hennadiy Lahuta, conceded Russians were in the city but added that his staff had “not given up our duties”. A US defence official said it was too early to say whether Russian forces were in full control of Kherson. Kherson’s mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post early on Thursday that Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by what he called the “armed visitors”. Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city. I just asked [them] not to shoot people.” Reports also emerged from Mariupol that Russian forces were attempting to prevent civilians from evacuating, according to the mayor, Vadym Boichenko. Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of Mariupol, with electricity and phone services largely cut, and homes and shops facing food and water shortages. Boichenko said in a video broadcast: “The invaders are systematically and methodically trying to blockade the city of Mariupol.” While Russia troops were advancing in the south, in the north of the country a war of attrition continued around the capital Kyiv where a massive Russian convoy to the north west, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, appeared stalled. “Kyiv withstood the night and another missile and bomb attack,” said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “Our air defences worked,” he said. “Kherson, Izyum — all the other cities that the occupiers hit from the air did not give up anything.” In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Zelenskiy praised his country’s resistance. “We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,” he said. “They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.” He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who “go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat”. “These are not warriors of a superpower,” he said. “These are confused children who have been used.” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions heard overnight in the Ukrainian capital were Russian missiles being shot down by air defence systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/nov/08/rolls-royce-secures-450m-for-mini-nuclear-reactors-venture","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-08T22:30:41Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce secures £450m for mini nuclear reactors venture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/08/rolls-royce-secures-450m-for-mini-nuclear-reactors-venture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/nov/08/rolls-royce-secures-450m-for-mini-nuclear-reactors-venture","fields":{"headline":"Rolls-Royce secures £450m for mini nuclear reactors venture","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce will move ahead with a multibillion pound plan to roll out a new breed of mini nuclear reactors after securing more than £450m from the government and investors. The engineering firm will set up a venture focused on developing small modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs, in partnership with investors BNF Resources and the US generator Exelon Generation with a joint investment of £195m to fund the plans over the next three years. The government will match the consortium’s investment, which is set to receive a second phase top-up of £50m from Rolls-Royce, with £210m to help roll out the mini nuclear reactors as part of the government’s green 10 point plan to kickstart the green economy over the next decade. Ministers hope that the new generation of SMRs will be quicker and cheaper to roll out than traditional large-scale nuclear reactors – such as the 3,200 megawatt Hinkley Point C project – which face enormous construction risks, and are prone to spiralling costs and delays. Hinkley Point C reactor was initially expected to cost £18bn, but the figure has climbed to about £23bn at the Somerset site as EDF and ministers struggled to agree a new funding framework for a successor project at Sizewell C in Suffolk. Rolls-Royce has promised to “harness decades of British engineering, design and manufacturing knowhow” to roll out the first of its mini reactors which are based on a similar technology used to propel nuclear submarines. Each of the initial run of reactors is expected to have a generation capacity of 470MW, or enough to power the equivalent of 1.3m UK homes, and cost about £2bn on average, well below the price per MW sought by developers of large-scale nuclear reactors. About a fifth of UK electricity is generated by 13 nuclear reactors, but more than half of the country’s 7.8GW of nuclear capacity is due to retire by 2025, leaving a looming gap in the electricity supplies and the risk of a rising reliance on gas power stations. Tom Samson, the chief executive of the Rolls-Royce SMR consortium, said the venture was established to “deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants” to help the UK meet its net zero targets. Samson added that the approach would be based on “predictable factory-built components” and proven technology to create an “investable” nuclear option. Ultimately, the consortium hopes to build on an initial run of five SMRs, the first of which could go on line by 2031, to create a multibillion-pound stable of 16 SMRs around the country. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, described the shift to SMRs as “a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence”. He added that the SMR programme would “offer exciting opportunities to cut costs and build more quickly”, and would help to cut the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels while creating jobs and a new homegrown industry. “Not only can we maximise British content, create new intellectual property and reinvigorate supply chains, but also position our country as a global leader in innovative nuclear technologies we can potentially export elsewhere,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2023/mar/14/global-markets-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-banking-shares-boj-ecb-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T16:54:49Z","webTitle":"US banking sector outlook downgraded, but regional bank shares surge – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/mar/14/global-markets-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-banking-shares-boj-ecb-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/mar/14/global-markets-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-banking-shares-boj-ecb-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US banking sector outlook downgraded, but regional bank shares surge – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up…. Ratings agency Moody’s has cut its view on the US banking system to negative from stable, as the ramifications of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In a note published overnight, it says Although the Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC announced that all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank will be made whole, the rapid and substantial decline in bank depositor and investor confidence precipitating this action starkly highlight risks in US banks’ asset-liability management (ALM) exacerbated by rapidly rising interest rates. Financial stocks have rallied in New York, and also in London, with US regional bank shares surging today, after heavy losses on Monday. There were losses in Asia, though, where Japanese banks fell in overnight trading. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, sums up the situation: ‘’US banking stocks are on a rollercoaster ride, rising sharply following the steep sell offs yesterday as worries seem to be lifting a little about contagion from the SVB collapse. Hope is rebounding that the backstop of deposits of failed banks will stem further withdrawals and that more generous loan terms to struggling banks could help restore confidence. First Republic Bank shares have surged 44% but still haven’t made up the punishing losses of recent days, indicating that uncertainty remains about its robustness. The FTSE 100 has been swept upwards in afternoon trade, helped by the tailwinds from Wall Street. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. SVB Financial Group and two top executives have been sued by shareholders over the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In the UK, MPs on the Treasury Committee are to hold a hearing into the rescue of Silicon Valley Bank UK. German chancellor Olaf Scholz tried to reassure his citizens about the crisis, saying that Germans should not have major concerns about the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. The markets rallied after US inflation fell to 6%, raising hopes that the US Federal Reserve will not feel compelled to implement a large interest rate hike this month. Here are the rest of today’s main stories: With the mood in the City rather brighter today than yesterday, the FTSE 100 index has closed 88.5 points higher tonight. The index of blue-chip shares gained 1.17% to close at 7637, recovering almost half of Monday’s losses. Rolls-Royce (+7%), Ocado (+4.1%) and Hargreaves Lansdown (+4%) led the risers. UK listed banks also rallied, with Barclays up 3.1% and Lloyds Banking Group gaining 2.1%. Charles Archer of IG, warns though, that the Silicon Valley Bank crisis is “far from over”. Archer writes: Across the pond, the Financial Times has reported that larger institutions such as Citi and JPMorgan are being inundated with new depositors fleeing from the thousands of smaller US banks. For context, it’s worth remembering that while US regulators have guaranteed the deposits of funds held at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, this protection has not been extended universally. This leaves depositors elsewhere relying on the FDIC insurance, limited to just $250,000, akin to the £85,000 FSCS limit in the UK. Over 30% of US deposits are held in small banks in the states, and more than 50% of funds are above the FDIC limit. With new CPI figures showing that annual inflation has slowed to 6%, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has an unappetising tightrope to walk this month: pausing or pivoting could see inflation become more entrenched or start to rise just as it looked like it might finally get under control, while continuing to increase rates could well see another unexpected economic ‘break.’ With an hour’s trading to go here in London, the FTSE 100 index is up over 1%. The blue-chip index has gained 89 points, back to 7638, gaining back almost half of Monday’s selloff. Engineering company Rolls-Royce are the top riser, up 7%, followed by bank Barclays (+3.7%). The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. The WSJ says: The separate probes are in their preliminary phases and may not lead to charges or allegations of wrongdoing. Prosecutors and regulators often open investigations after financial institutions or public companies suffer big, unexpected losses. The SEC and a spokesperson for the Justice Department in Washington have declined to comment. This comes day after SVB Financial Group and two top executives were sued by shareholders, who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit susceptible to a bank run. The proposed class action lawsuit against SVB, Chief Executive Greg Becker and Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck was filed in the federal court in San Jose, California. Price rises slowed again in February as the annual rate of inflation eased but the report has been overshadowed by a banking crisis ahead of next week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve. Prices in February were 6% higher than a year ago, down from an annual rate of 6.4% in January and significantly lower than the 9.1% peak of inflation seen in June, my colleague Lauren Aratani reports. Between January and February, prices rose 0.4% as prices increased in sectors including housing and food. While February saw the continuation of a downward trend in the 12-month inflation rate, the core prices – which excludes volatile food and energy prices – increased by 0.5% in February compared with a 0.4% monthly gain in January. More here. Ratings agency Moody’s has changed its outlook on the US banking system to “negative” from “stable” after the collapse of three major banks fueled fears of a contagion. Moody’s Investors Service said it was making the move in light of three key bank failures in recent days that prompted regulators to step in on Sunday with a dramatic rescue plan for depositors and other institutions impacted by the crisis. In a report, Moody’s says that the operating environment for US banks is “rapidly deteriorating”. “We have changed to negative from stable our outlook on the US banking system to reflect the rapid deterioration in the operating environment following deposit runs at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank (SNY) and the failures of SVB and SNY.” As covered this morning, Moody’s also put six US regional banks on watch for a potential downgrade. US president Joe Biden has welcomed the fall in inflation last month, saying: Today’s report shows annual inflation is down by a third from this summer at a time when the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low. That is the slowest annual increase since September 2021. I will continue working to lower costs for hard-working Americans so they have a little more breathing room at the end of the month. Investors are circling Silicon Valley Bank’s assets, after the bank was seized by federal regulators last week. Bloomberg reports that Apollo Global Management Inc., Blackstone Inc. and KKR &amp; Co. have expressed interest in snapping up a book of loans held by SVB. It says: Apollo, Blackstone and KKR, three of the world’s largest alternative asset managers, are among investors looking to buy pieces of Silicon Valley Bank, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The bank had $73.6 billion of loans as of 31 December 2022. The size of the loan book Apollo and Blackstone are interested in couldn’t immediately be determined. Blackstone is also looking at other assets it may purchase from the bank, one of the people said. An index of US regional banks is rallying sharply today. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF is up over 7%, lifted by banks such as First Republic (+53%). Back in the UK, MPs are to hold a hearing on the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank later this month. The Treasury committee will quiz the Bank of England on Tuesday 28 March, and examine ask why SVB UK had to be rescued by HSBC on Monday morning. The committee has also written to the BoE, asking for details about how SVB UK was supervised before its collapse – including the resource allocated to it, the decision to choose HSBC as a purchases, and what lessons can be learned. Harriett Baldwin MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, says: “This deal is the best possible outcome achieved in incredibly challenging circumstances. We thank everyone who worked tirelessly to achieve this deal. “Yet, while it’s reassuring that taxpayer funds were not required in this instance, a number of questions remain around the effectiveness of bank regulation and resolution procedures, especially for smaller banks with a significant presence in strategically-important industries. It is important that we reflect on the lessons from this episode to ensure that the post-financial crisis regime to avoid bailouts remains strong.” Shares in Facebooks owner, Meta, have jumped almost 6% after it announced plans to lay off another 10,000 workers. This is the second round of significant job cuts announced by the tech giant in four months. It is also instituting a further hiring freeze as part of the company’s “Year of Efficiency”. In a Facebook post today, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the job cuts will take place “over the next couple of months.” Zuckerberg wrote: “We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, and then our business groups in late May,” In a “small number of cases”, it may take through the end of the year to complete these changes, Zuckerberg says, adding: “Overall, we expect to reduce our team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven’t yet hired.” Here’s the story: Meta’s shares have jumped 5.5%, or $10, to $191, the highest in over a month. German chancellor Olaf Scholz has said today that Germans should not have major concerns about the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. Scholz said regulators had learned lessons from the global financial crisis in 2008, speaking in Berlin aongside Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan. The tech-focused Nasdaq index has jumped 2% in early trading, as the Wall Street rally gathers pace. The US stock market has jumped at the start of trading, as bank stocks mounted a comeback from Monday’s heavy losses. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 1%, up 314 points at 32,133 in a flurry of buying. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 1.5%, as investors cheer the slowdown in US inflation last month. And after a brutal day yesterday, US regional banks are bouncing back in early trading, as concerns over their financial health ease. San Francisco-based First Republic’s shares have surged 57%, back to $49.28. On Monday it fell 62%, from $81 to $31. Western Alliance Bancorp, of Phoenix, Arizona has gained 52%, while Los Angeles-based PacWest has jumped 55%. Zions, of Salt Lake City, Utah, has gained 22%. However, Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, argues that US interest rates will actually rise higher than forecast: “This is exactly the inflation print the Fed did not want. The elevated core inflation in February adds to the evidence of economic strength from last week’s job numbers, signalling the need for tighter monetary policy. But asset liability management challenges for some banks might limit the latitude to tighten in the near term. Despite banking challenges, persistent inflation means markets are likely wrong to expect rate cuts this year. The economy remains strong, and the Fed will likely need to hike rates further and keep them higher for longer than markets are currently pricing.” Bank shares in London have turned higher too. Barclays are up 4.6% and Lloyds Banking Group have jumped 3%, among the top risers on the FTSE 100 today. European stock markets are now rallying, as investors are cheered by the fall in US inflation last month. The UK’s FTSE 100 index has gained 42 points, or over 0.5%, to 7590 points, having been broadly flat before the inflation report hit the wires. That recovers about a fifth of Monday’s selloff. Germany’s DAX has gained 1.6%, while France’s CAC is 1.4% higher. This suggests that the slowdown in price rises across America last month bolsters expectations of a smaller interest rate rise this month, of 25 basis points. Neal Keane, head of sales trading at the international brokerage ADSS, reckons the US Federal Reserve is still likely to raise interest rates again, despite slowing inflation and the collapse of two banks in recent days. Keane writes: “Headline figures show a notable decrease in annual CPI to reach 6% - but with the core rate falling to only 5.5% and MoM inflation rising 0.4%, this piece of the rate hike puzzle will offer little to convince the Fed to pause rate increases in the near term.” The collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature will “undoubtedly weigh on the Fed’s mind”, with opinion divided on whether it should pause rate hikes immediately, Keane adds: On balance, a hike of 25bps [a quarter of one percent] still looks the more likely scenario, with further hikes still possible while inflation continues running too high at current levels.” Gerrit Smit, manager of the $1.7bn Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas Equity fund, says investors will be cheered that US inflation continues to fall: Smit predicts it will allow the Fed to raise its headline interest rates by another quarter-point next week: “Headline inflation dropped to 6.0% as expected, lower than many fears of very sticky inflation. This is a welcome reprieve, and we can expect the Fed to continue on its +25bps pathway despite the SVB scare.” The US inflation report puts the Federal Reserve in a ‘somewhat tricky position’, says John Leiper, chief investment officer, Titan Asset Management. Although the rate of price increases slowed, the Fed will want to get inflation down towards its 2% target by raising interest rates again. However, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank shows the impact of its previous rate rises, and the risks from tightening policy quickly. Leiper says: “It’s been an eventful week for markets and today’s inflation print doesn’t change that. Headline inflation came in-line with expectations although core inflation picked-up slightly month-on-month. This keeps the Fed in a somewhat tricky position. The Fed cannot fall behind the inflation curve, its credibility is at risk if it does, but equally the lagged impact of prior tightening is now starting to show its face, as evidenced by the recent Silicon Valley Bank failure. This remains a delicate balancing act for Jerome Powell and markets won’t like the ongoing uncertainty.” At 6.0% last month, annual US inflation is the lowest since September 2021. The core inflation rate (which excludes food and energy) was the lowest since December 2021 at 5.5% per year. Energy prices increased 5.2% in the 12 months to February, while the food index increased 9.5% over the last year. Newsflash: US inflation has eased, but still remains sharply above the Federal Reserve’s target. The consumer prices index in America slowed to an annual rate of 6.0% in February, down from 6.4% in January. That matches economists expectations, and means inflation is running three times above the Fed’s target of 2%. Core inflation eased a little, to 5.5% from 5.6%. During February alone, inflation was 0.4%, a slowdown on the 0.5% increase in the CPI in January. The index for shelter was the largest contributor to inflation in February, accounting for over 70% of the monthly increase, with the indexes for food, recreation, and household furnishings and operations also contributing. The food index increased 0.4% over the month with the food at home index rising 0.3%. But energy prices eased by 0.6% during the month, helped by falling prices of natural gas and fuel oil. Economics professor Ricardo Reis has written a very interesting thread about the implications of the SVB collapse for the US Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-hiking cycle. European bank shares have shaken off their earlier losses. The European Stoxx banks index is now up 0.3% today, a small recovery after its biggest falls in a year. Credit Suisse has recovered some ground – its share are now 1.7% today, having dropped over 4% at one stage this morning. Credit Suisse Group chief executive Ulrich Körner told Bloomberg TV this morning that the bank has seen inflows of client funds on Monday, as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank rocked the financial markkets. Körner said: We got inflows yesterday, which is a positive sign I would say. We even saw materially good inflows yesterday.” In the UK supermarket sector, Sainsbury’s is buying back the freehold on 21 of its supermarkets in a £431m deal. Analysts said the deal, which unwinds a sale and leaseback joint venture, gives Sainsbury’s fewer liabilities and more control over its assets as it faces higher costs and tightening consumer spending. Sainsbury’s said it wanted to sell and lease back a further four stores which were part of the joint venture while one vacant store would be sold outright. British banks are not yet seeing a “flight to quality” in deposits among customers nervous about the safety of their money following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week, Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn has said today. Nunn told a Morgan Stanley event today (via Reuters) that: “What’s happened with SVB is relatively idiosyncratic compared to the UK” As covered at 9.03am, major US banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup have seen a wave of customers applying to shift their accounts to larger lenders. Nunn doesn’t see signs that this is happening in the UK, though, saying: “We haven’t seen what we’ve seen in the US, which is the flight to quality. “But let’s see how that plays out and we’ll see how people feel over the next period of time.” The number of company insolvencies in England and Wales has jumped by 17%, in a sign that economic tensions in the UK are increasing. There were 1,783 registered company insolvencies across England and Wales in February, new figures from the Insolvency Service show. That’s up from 1,518 in February 2022, and a third more than before the pandemic – showing the stresses in the UK economy ahead of tomorrow’s budget. Most of the company failures were Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs), where directors decide to liquidate their firms because they are insolvent. Compulsory liquidations more than doubled, to 158. Nigel Fox, a Director in the Restructuring &amp; Recovery team at Evelyn Partners, explains The effect of Covid restrictions will mean that many businesses will have much less cash to weather the storm caused by such factors as the huge hike in energy costs and the 40 year high in inflation, together with rising interest rates. “It is therefore more important than ever for businesses to be vigilant to watch out for the warning signs of potential insolvency and to take appropriate advice as early as possible. Such advice could help directors avoid the personal liability that might arise if they carried on trading when there was no potentially viable plan to successfully ride out the difficult times.” There are indications that overall corporate insolvency numbers might be starting to plateau, perhaps mirroring the fact that inflation might also have peaked, says Inga West, Restructuring and Insolvency Counsel at law firm Ashurst: West adds: Eyes will be on the budget this week to see what recovery measures are being announced to support British Business battle its way through the harsh economic conditions. The stark rise in corporate insolvency figures has been driven almost entirely by near record levels of creditor voluntary liquidations. This is an insolvency process favoured by SMEs. Interestingly, administration numbers remain lower than pre-pandemic - suggesting that larger companies are finding a way to hang on - perhaps hoping for a boon from the Chancellor.” Shares in Credit Suisse have dropped by over 4% this morning, after it reported that ‘material weaknesses’ have been found in its financial reporting controls. Credit Suisse’s shares have dropped as low as 2.12 Swiss francs this morning, close to the record low hit during yesterday’s trading. As reported at 8.41am, Credit Suisse’s bonds have also weakened to record lows this morning, as it released its delayed annual report. In the annual report released today, Credit Suisse said “management did not design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyse the risk of material misstatements in its financial statements”. Credit Suisse was forced to delay the release of its annual report from last week after the Securities and Exchange Commission raised last-minute queries related to cash-flow statements from 2019 and 2020. The banks says those discussions have now been concluded. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says investors are not in a forgiving mood with Credit Suisse: “While the immediate fallout from the SVB collapse may have been contained for now, the edginess around the banking sector isn’t helped by the latest revelations from Credit Suisse as it identified material weaknesses in reporting controls. “It may have been a ‘technical’ issue according to the Swiss bank but in the current environment and given the company’s recent sketchy track record, investors were hardly in a forgiving mood. Last month, Credit Suisse reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 global financial crisis after clients pulled billions from the bank following a series of scandals. Credit Suisse was hard hit by the collapse of U.S. investment firm Archegos in 2021, and the freezing of billions of supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British financier Greensill. A year ago, a massive leak exposed the hidden wealth of Credit Suisse clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes. Oil prices have dropped again today, as the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank rattles markets. With fears of a fresh financial crisis high, Brent crude has dropped by 2% to $79 per barrel, close to its lowest level this year. Oil also weakened yesterday, as the failure of SVB over the weekend stirred fears of a potential recession. The turmoil that has erupted in the financial system has triggered widespread risk aversion, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. If we see markets settle down, that could prevent a break of the lows but oil traders, like those elsewhere, will remain nervous about the prospect of further turbulence. Suddenly, a break below the lows looks a much greater risk which may keep pressure on in the short term. Rating agency Moody’s has placed six US lenders, including First Republic Bank, at risk of a downgrade, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. First Republic, Western Alliance Bancorp, Intrust Financial Corp., UMB Financial Corp., Zions Bancorp. and Comerica are all on review for a downgrade. It’s the latest sign of concern over the health of regional financial firms – whose shares all fell sharply on Monday. Moody’s pointed to concerns over the lenders’ reliance on uninsured deposit funding and unrealized losses in their asset portfolios. In a statement, Moody’s cited the “material” amount of deposits above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threshold of $250,000, saying: “The review for downgrade reflects the extremely volatile funding conditions for some US banks exposed to the risk of uninsured deposit outflows.” Moody’s also downgraded Signature Bank and withdrew its credit rating. That’s not a surprise, though given the lender was shut down over the weekend… In the energy sector, British Gas owner Centrica plans to extend the lives of two nuclear power stations by two years, as part of efforts to strengthen the UK’s energy security. Heysham 1 on the north-west coast of England near Lancaster and the Hartlepool power station in County Durham are now expected to close in March 2026. These extensions are expected to add 6TWh (terawatt hour) to Centrica’s electricity generation volumes between 2024 and 2026. This is equivalent to around 70% of Centrica’s total electricity generated from nuclear power last year. Chris O’Shea, Centrica’s chief executive, said: “I’m delighted we’ve been able to work with EDF to strengthen the UK’s energy security by extending the life of these critical power stations. “This continues our action to bolster security of supply in our core markets which includes reopening the Rough gas storage facility in the UK, sanctioning new gas-fired electricity generation capacity in Ireland, and securing increased volumes of gas and renewable power for our customers. We will continue to focus on supporting energy security in our core markets during these uncertain times.” The news comes after a similar announcement from EDF last week. Certain aspects of the Silicon Valley Bank situation were unique, UBS Wealth Management point out this morning: It had the highest ratio of securities to total assets of any US bank; a far higher-than-average proportion of its depositors were corporate clients in the technology sector; and its uninsured deposit mix was one of the highest in the industry. That made it especially vulnerable both to deposit outflows and to mark-to-market losses when it attempted to meet those outflows. However, to some extent, the fundamental challenge faced by Silicon Valley Bank is also faced by other US banks, UBS say. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, explains: “From here, in order to minimize the risk of deposit outflows, many smaller banks may be forced to further increase deposit rates. As demonstrated by equity market performance on Monday, this is not good for any bank’s profitability, though those banks with higher capital ratios, smaller pools of securities relative to total assets, strong brands, and diversified funding sources should be better able to weather the current market dynamics.” Investors are also on edge today because we get the latest US inflation report at 12.30pm UK time. The annual Consumer Prices Index is expected to drop to 6% in February, down from 6.4% in January. But core inflation is only expected to dip slightly, to 5.5% from 5.6%. In normal times, high inflation would spur the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates to squeeze out price pressures. But having seen Silivon Valley Bank blow up, having been caught out by the rapid rise in borrowing costs which hit the value of its bonds, the Fed may be more reluctant to tighten policy further. But if inflationary pressures remain hot, the Fed will still feel pressure to act…. The Bank of Japan says Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital buffers to absorb losses caused by various external factors, including risks caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. A BOJ official told reporters in Tokyo: “Japanese financial institutions’ direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is small, and thus the impact is likely limited,” The BoJ released an annual report that looks at the strength of Japan’s financial institutions. It found that they have continued to channel funds to borrowers smoothly, despite stress factors such as supply constraints and rising overseas interest rates. But, the report also pointed to challenges facing regional banks, such as analysing the impact of heightened market volatility on their portfolios…. “Some regional financial institutions have suffered a substantial increase in valuation losses” and failed to adequately assess their risk tolerance against profits, it said. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is not expected to affect the euro zone’s banks, Greek central bank chief Yannis Stournaras has said. Stournaras, a member of the ECB’s Governing Council, told Kathimerini newspaper: “We don’t see SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) having an impact on the euro zone’s banks or the Greek ones.” What a difference a decade makes. 10 years ago, Stournaras was Greece’s finance minister, when the eurozone debt crisis threatened to push Greece into bankrupcy. Today, Greece is hoping to secure an investment-grade credit rating. Large US banks are being inundated with requests from customers trying to transfer funds from smaller lenders, the Financial Times is reporting. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America are among the large financial institutions are trying to accommodate customers wanting to move deposits quickly from Silicon Valley Bank and other regional lenders. They are taking extra steps to speed up the normal sign-up or “onboarding” process, according to several people familiar with the matter. The failure of SVB has caused what executives say is the biggest movement of deposits in more than a decade. Wealthier customers, who have more than the $250,000 maximum guaranteed by federal insurance, are among those looking to move balances into larger banks (although all deposits at SVB and Signature Bank are guaranteed by the package announced on Sunday night). One senior banker, referring to Chicago’s busy aviation hub, said: “The calls have been coming in today like airplanes stacked on a snowy day at O’Hare airport.” The European banks index has dipped in early trading, down 0.3%. That indicates some calm in Europe this morning, after banking stocks posted their biggest losses in a year on Monday. London’s stock market is open, and bank shares are continuing to drop – although not as sharply as yesterday. HSBC are down 1.8%, and Standard Chartered has lost 1.6%. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has dipped by 0.3%, or 20 points, to 7528 points, the lowest since 3 January, on top of Monday’s 200-point tumble. Energy stocks are also weaker, as the oil price comes under pressure. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor says: “European markets have opened mixed with the FTSE 100 underperforming. Land Securities, British Land and Rightmove are among the outperformers on the UK index amid hopes of a dovish tilt from the Bank of England. Most European banks continue to face selling pressure with HSBC and Standard Chartered near the bottom of the FTSE 100. Credit Suisse is leading the declines across European financials after the Swiss lender said it found ‘material weakness’ in its internal financial reporting controls, adding to its woes. Markets in Asia fell sharply overnight with the Nikkei, the Kospi and the Hang Seng down more than 2% each. In Japan its biggest banks suffered steep losses with the TOPIX Banks index down by more than 7% as President Biden’s address failed to soothe investors. Elsewhere in banking this morning, Credit Suisse’s bonds are falling after it released its delayed annual report. The annual report, delayed from last week, showed that Credit Suisse has identified “material weaknesses” in its internal controls over financial reporting and said it had not yet stemmed customer outflows. It says: “As of December 31, 2022, the Group’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and for the same reasons, management has reassessed and has reached the same conclusion regarding December 31, 2021.” Credit Suisse said customer “outflows stabilized to much lower levels but had not yet reversed as of the date of this report” Some Credit Suisse bond prices have hit record lows; yesterday, the cost of insuring its debt hit record highs. More investors are expecting America’s central bank to start cutting interest cuts by the end of the year, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The CME FedWatch Tool, which tracks investor expectations for the trajectory of rates, suggests that the Federal Reserve could raise its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, or 25 basis points, to 4.75%-5.00%, at its meeting next week. But by December, the markest suggest rates will have fallen back to around 4%-4.25%, or half a point lower than current levels. There has been a “Titanic repricing” in expectations for US interest rate moves this year, say ING. In the US, markets now see only a 50% chance of a 25bp hike in March, and fully price in 67bp of cuts by year-end. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, says yesterday’s dramatic session was “up there with some of the wilder days I can remember”. I always thought that with inflation where it was, that central banks would keep hiking until they broke something, which was especially likely with the yield curve so inverted. Now they have broken something, is that enough for a pause? Much will depend on whether markets and contagion risk can calm quickly enough. If the FOMC meeting was today I strongly suspect they wouldn’t hike but a week is a long time in these markets. Global financial stocks have lost $465bn in market value in two days as investors cut exposure to lenders from New York to Japan in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, Bloomberg has calculated. They explain: Losses widened today, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Financials Index dropping as much as 2.7% to the lowest since Nov. 29. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. slid as much as 8.3% in Japan, while South Korea’s Hana Financial Group Inc. fell 4.7% and Australia’s ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. lost 2.8%. There are concerns that financial firms could see an impact from their investments in bonds and other instruments on the SVB-induced worry. Treasury yields plunged Monday amid expectations the Federal Reserve will hold off raising rates due to turmoil in the banking system. Volatility is likely to remain the name of the game in the markets today, say ING. US stock futures point at a marginally positive open this morning, but markets are constantly monitoring incoming news on the health of other financial institutions, in particular US regional banks. SVB Financial Group and two top executives have been sued by shareholders over the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, as global stocks continued to suffer on Tuesday despite assurances from US president Joe Biden. The bank’s shareholders accuse SVB Financial Group chief executive Greg Becker and chief financial officer Daniel Beck of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit “particularly susceptible” to a bank run. The proposed class action was filed on Monday in the federal court in San Jose, California. It appeared to be the first of many likely lawsuits over the demise of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which US regulators seized on 10 March after a surge of deposit withdrawals. Good morning. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is gripping the financial markets, as global bank shares slide despite reassurances from President Joe Biden on Monday. There have been fresh losses in Asia-Pacific stock markets today, as bank stocks continues to fall. Japan’s Topix Banks index is on track for its worst day since March 2020, early in the pandemic, currently down 7.4%. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is down 8.66%, with Mizuho Financial Group losing 7.1% This has pulled Japan’s Topix index down by 2.7%. Elsewhere, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has dropped by 2.35%. South Korea’s KOSPI index has lost 2.4%, with its Hana Financial Group down almost 4%. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX is down 1.4%. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, says: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday has brought on the highest volatile market conditions of 2023 so far. Shares in a number of America’s regional banks closed sharply lower on Monday night, hours after president Joe Biden tried to reassure depositors and investors, saying: Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe. Your deposits are safe. On Sunday night, the Federal Reserve and Treasury boosted lenders’ access to quick cash, and guaranteed deposits at Signature Bank (which was closed down on Sunday night) and Silicon Valley Bank. But other regional banks still came under pressure, with San Francisco-based First Republic losing 62% and Arizona-headquartered Western Alliance Bank off 47%. On Monday, there were heavy falls on European stock markets, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index sheddding 200 points, or 2.58%, to end at 7548 points, the lowest since the start of January. Markets are expected to open calmer today, though…. Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse last week was the largest bank failure in over a decade. It came after SVB made a $1.8bn loss on a sale of securities, due to the drop in prices of government bond and mortgage-backed securities as interest rates have risen. That left it struggling to meet withdrawal requests from customers. Expectations of further sharp rises in borrowing costs are being reassessed too, with central banks likely to be warier of breaking another part of the financial system. Yesterday was “a wild session on Wall Street as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank revealed the unintended consequence of the Fed’s tightening cycle”, says IG analyst Tony Sycamore: As noted in recent months and in wider financial circles, the Fed has historically continued tightening until something breaks. While the Fed’s move to backstop uninsured deposits will likely prevent further banking runs, a potential banking crisis threat trumps high inflation any day of the week. Reflecting this, the rates market experienced the most significant 2-day fall in U.S. treasury yields since the 1987 crash (yields are now at 4% from 5.08% last week). After being 70% priced for a 50bp rate hike last week, there is now just 12bps priced for next week’s FOMC meeting.

Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s military claimed on Tuesday that the last 24 hours were the deadliest of the war for Russian troops. It increased its tally of Russian military dead by 1,030 overnight to 133,190, the biggest increase in daily Russian military deaths since the war began last February. Russia has also said it killed large numbers of Ukrainian troops in recent weeks, claiming it had inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January. These figures could not be independently verified, but the assertion that the fighting was the deadliest so far fits descriptions from both sides of an escalating campaign of close-contact trench warfare. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have announced they plan to provide Ukraine with at least 100 refurbished Leopard 1 battle tanks. In a joint statement, the defence ministers of the three countries said the shipment of older Leopard 1 tanks was part of an effort “to support Ukraine in their endeavour to withstand Russian aggression”. The delivery of Leopard 1 tanks will occur “within the coming months” and include logistical support and training, it added. Germany’s defence ministry has said Leopard 2A6 battle tanks will be available in Ukraine by the end of March. Meanwhile, Berlin has reportedly approved the delivery of 178 Leopard 1 battle tanks to Ukraine. The head of the German arms maker Rheinmetall has also said it expects to send 20 to 25 Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine this year. The news comes as Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Tuesday. Ukraine’s top national security official, Oleksiy Danilov, has said he is confident his country will eventually receive US-made F-16 fighter jets. It was “only a matter of time” before Kyiv gets the F-16s, Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, told CNN. He also suggested Ukraine may be capable of striking Russian on its own territory, beyond occupied Ukraine. Ukraine has released extraordinary video footage that appears to show Russian fighters dragging their badly wounded commander away from the battlefield, then beating him violently with what appear to be shovels. A Ukrainian drone captured the incident near the eastern city of Bakhmut, where intense fighting has been raging for months. Russia almost certainly now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives, the UK Ministry of Defence said. Its latest intelligence update stated that Moscow would continue to demand sweeping advances, but it remained unlikely that Russia could build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war in the coming weeks. Ukraine’s parliament has approved the appointment of Ihor Klymenko as the country’s new interior affairs minister and Vasily Malyuk as the new head of the country’s security services, known as the SBU. Klymenko, formerly the national police chief, was serving as acting interior minister after the former minister, Denys Monastyrsky, was killed last month in a helicopter crash on the outskirts of Kyiv. Recriminations have broken out among EU officials after a possible visit to Brussels by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was leaked, raising concerns over his security. Zelenskiy was reported to be planning a trip to Brussels this Thursday to meet EU leaders in person at a summit and address the European parliament in an extraordinary session. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has warned that western arms supplies to Ukraine are effectively “dragging” Nato into the conflict, which could lead to an “unpredictable level of escalation”. In remarks during a conference call with military officials, quoted by state-owned Tass news agency, Shoigu accused the US and its allies of “trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible” by supplying Kyiv with what he described as “heavy offensive weapons”. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has tweeted a photo of him and his brother, Wladimir, meeting the German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, in Ukraine’s capital today. Germany’s defence ministry has said Leopard 2A6 battle tanks will be available in Ukraine by the end of March. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have announced they plan to provide Ukraine with at least 100 refurbished Leopard 1 battle tanks. In a joint statement, the defence ministers of the three countries said the shipment of older Leopard 1 tanks was part of an effort “to support Ukraine in their endeavour to withstand Russian aggression”. The supplies will “significantly enhance Ukraine’s military potential for the restoration of their violated territorial integrity”, the statement continued. The delivery of Leopard 1 tanks will occur “within the coming months” and include logistical support and training, it added. The Kremlin has ordered inspections and repairs on bomb shelters across Russia in a national drive to upgrade the country’s crumbling Soviet-era infrastructure, according to a report. The overhaul of the country’s bomb shelter network comes amid Moscow’s nuclear sabre-rattling and growing militarisation of daily life, the Moscow Times reports. Citing Russian officials, the paper writes that local authorities appear to be spending hundreds of millions of roubles to make Russia’s thousands of bunkers, reinforced cellars and other safe hideouts fit for habitation. One official was quoted as saying: A decision to inspect the network of bomb shelters was made by the government in the spring. The command for a large-scale inspection and to put things right was given by the emergency situations ministry, the defence ministry and [other] civilian ministries. At least five people have died in a gas explosion that ripped through a five-floor building in the town of Yefremov south of Moscow, state-run Ria news agency reported, citing emergency services. Ria quoted emergency services as saying: So far, seven people have been rescued; unfortunately, five people died. On the subject of German-made tanks, it is being reported that Berlin has approved the delivery of 178 Leopard 1 battle tanks to Ukraine. The delivery from industry stocks, reported by Spiegel and Reuters, is considerably more than previously announced. A source told Reuters: The export of 178 Leopard 1s is approved. The news comes as Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, made a surprise visit to Kyiv after Berlin confirmed that it would deliver more modern Leopard 2 battle tanks from army stocks. Earlier, the head of the German arms maker Rheinmetall said it expects to send 20 to 25 Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine this year. CEO Armin Papperger told a conference organised by several newspapers: The rest of the 88 (Leopard 1 tanks) that we have will be delivered next year. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has posted to Twitter that the “first” Leopard 2 battle tank has arrived in Kyiv, alongside a photo of him and his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, with a miniature model of the German-made battle tank. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has claimed that the last 24 hours were the deadliest of the war for Russian troops, increasing its tally of Russian military dead by 1,030 overnight to 133,190. The figure, which could not be independently verified, marks the biggest increase in daily Russian military deaths since the war began last February. Russia has also said it killed large numbers of Ukrainian troops in recent weeks, claiming it had inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January. Tallies of enemy casualties from either side have typically been seen as unreliable, Reuters reports, and Ukraine offered few details of the latest battles. But the assertion that the fighting was the deadliest so far fits descriptions from both sides of an escalating campaign of close-contact trench warfare, as Russia presses on with a winter assault in the east with tens of thousands of freshly mobilised troops. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine has released extraordinary video footage that appears to show Russian fighters dragging their badly wounded commander away from the battlefield, and then beating him violently with what appear to be shovels. A Ukrainian drone captured the incident near the eastern city of Bakhmut, where intense fighting has been raging for months. Recriminations have broken out among EU officials after a possible visit by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Brussels was leaked, raising concerns over his security. Zelenskiy was reported to be planning a trip to Brussels this Thursday to meet EU leaders in person at a summit and address the European parliament in an extraordinary session. Russia almost certainly now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives, the UK Ministry of Defence said. Its latest intelligence update stated that Moscow will continue to demand sweeping advances, but it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war in the coming weeks. Ukraine’s parliament has approved the appointment of Ihor Klymenko as the country’s new interior affairs minister and Vasily Malyuk as the new head of the country’s security services, known as the SBU. Klymenko, formerly Ukraine’s national police chief, was serving as acting interior minister after the former minister, Denis Monastyrsky, was killed last month in a helicopter crash on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said personnel changes on the border and frontline would bolster Ukraine’s military efforts amid uncertainty over the future of his defence minister. “We are bolstering our managerial positions,” Zelenskiy said in his Monday evening address. “In a number of regions, particularly those on the border or on the frontline, we will appoint leaders with military experience. Those who can show themselves to be the most effective in defending against existing threats.” Loud explosions have been reported in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled city’s mayor. “Five loud explosions in a row in the Prymorskyi district of Mariupol. Our people report that they rang out in the sea port area,” he posted to social media. Ukraine’s top national security official, Oleksiy Danilov, has said he is confident his country will eventually receive American-made F-16 fighter jets. It was “only a matter of time” before Kyiv gets the F-16s, Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, told CNN. He also suggested Ukraine may be capable of striking Russian on its own territory, beyond occupied Ukraine. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has warned that western arms supplies to Ukraine are effectively “dragging” Nato into the conflict and that could lead to an “unpredictable level of escalation”. In remarks during a conference call with military officials, quoted by state-owned Tass news agency, Shoigu accused the US and its allies of “trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible” by supplying Kyiv with what he described as “heavy offensive weapons”. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has said Russian athletes should not be allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics as long as the war in Ukraine is ongoing. “It is not conceivable (for Russian athletes) to march as if nothing had happened, to have a delegation come to Paris while the bombs are still raining down on Ukraine,” she said. Her remarks represent a change in position after she said last month that she believed Russian athletes could take part “under a neutral flag” to avoid “depriving athletes of competition”. A plan for Volodymyr Zelenskiy to give a speech via video link during the last night of Italy’s Sanremo song festival has been scrapped due to political controversy over his participation. Italian politicians from across the spectrum said the Ukrainian president’s appearance was inappropriate for the popular annual music competition, which is televised by the state broadcaster Rai. Ukraine had withdrawn from its libraries 19m copies of books by last November that came either from the Soviet era or were in Russian, a senior lawmaker has said. After Russia moved to annex Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014, Kyiv has increasingly restricted the use of Russian books. Hello everyone.

Ukraine’s parliament has approved the appointment of Ihor Klymenko as the country’s new interior affairs minister. Klymenko, formerly Ukraine’s national police chief, was serving as acting interior minister after the former minister, Denys Monastyrskiy, was killed last month in a helicopter crash on the outskirts of Kyiv. Monastyrskiy, his deputy and five other high-ranking officials were killed when their helicopter crashed into a nursery in Brovary, north-east of the capital. Another seven people were also killed, including a child. As we reported earlier, Ukraine’s parliament also approved Vasily Malyuk as the new head of the country’s security services, known as the SBU. Loud explosions have been reported in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled city’s mayor. In a statement on Telegram, Andriushchenko said the explosions were heard in the Prymorskyi district. He wrote: Five loud explosions in a row in the Prymorskyi district of Mariupol. Our people report that they rang out in the sea port area. That’s exactly where the occupiers recently deployed military hardware and anti-aircraft defence systems. Luke Harding reports that over the weekend sources inside Zelenskiy’s own Servant of the People party suggested Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, would be moved out of his job. This followed a corruption scandal which saw the ministry pay two or three times the supermarket price of food to supply frontline troops. On Tuesday it appeared Reznikov was staying put. Ukraine’s national security and defence council, parliamentarians and some western allies argued it was the wrong time to remove him, ahead of an expected Russian counteroffensive. It is uncertain how long he might remain in post. According to Reuters, the confusion followed a crackdown on alleged official wrongdoing as Zelenskiy seeks to show that Kyiv can be a safe steward of billions of dollars of western aid. Reznikov had said earlier that he was “holding the line”, and showed no sign of stepping aside. “Thank you all for your support, as well as constructive criticism. We draw conclusions. We continue the reforms. Even during the war. We are strengthening the defense and working for victory,” he wrote on Twitter. Russia has accused the US embassy in Moscow of spreading “fake news” and threatened to expel US diplomats, state media is reporting. State-run Tass news agency cited a senior Russian foreign ministry source as saying that an official note had been delivered to the US embassy, warning that US diplomats engaged in what it called “subversive activities” would be expelled. Ukraine has released extraordinary video footage that appears to show Russian fighters dragging their badly wounded commander away from the battlefield, and then beating him violently with what appear to be shovels. A Ukrainian drone captured the incident near the eastern city of Bakhmut, where intense fighting has been raging for months. Four soldiers from Russia’s Wagner mercenary group carry their colleague through a landscape of ruined houses, holding his arms and legs. They then dump him next to a barn. A second video appears to show three men then hitting him repeatedly with shovels. The fate of the injured commander is unclear. But the episode tallies with persistent reports of low morale among Russian mercenary units. Ukrainian soldiers fighting in and around Bakhmut have described how Wagner troops attack in waves. They are reportedly threatened with execution if they fail to advance and are mown down in large numbers, their corpses littering the frontlines. A drone unit from the Seneka special platoon shot the footage earlier this week. It was released on Ukrainian social media channels on Monday. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images we have received from the frontline in Ukraine. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has said Russian athletes should not be allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics as long as the war in Ukraine is ongoing. Speaking to France Info radio, she said: As long as Russia continues to wage war on Ukraine, I don’t want there to be a Russian delegation at the Paris 24 Games – I would find that indecent. It is not conceivable (for Russian athletes) to march as if nothing had happened, to have a delegation come to Paris while the bombs are still raining down on Ukraine. Her remarks represent a change in position after she said last month that she believed Russian athletes could take part “under a neutral flag” to avoid “depriving athletes of competition”. Ukraine hopes to secure widespread international support for banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Paris Olympics. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said their presence would normalise Russia’s invasion of his country and make “terror” acceptable. A plan for Volodymyr Zelenskiy to give a speech via video link during the last night of Italy’s Sanremo song festival has been scrapped due to political controversy over his participation. Italian politicians from across the spectrum said the Ukrainian president’s appearance was inappropriate for the popular annual music competition, which is televised by the state broadcaster Rai. Zelenskiy had been due to give his speech on Saturday night but will instead provide a written message that will be read out by the festival’s host, the Italian TV presenter Amadeus. Italy’s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, triggered the controversy, saying Zelenskiy’s participation was “out of place” and that the entertainment event should be “reserved for music”, while Giuseppe Conte, the former prime minister and leader of the Five Star Movement, said he didn’t think it was necessary for Zelenskiy to appear “in such a light-hearted context”. The controversy and decision to scrap Zelenskiy’s video appearance was mocked by Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry, who said on Telegram: “He could have won the contest with a rap.” The Sanremo film festival starts on Tuesday night. The event draws millions of TV viewers and is used to choose the Italian candidate for the Eurovision song contest. Ukraine’s top national security official, Oleksiy Danilov, has said he is confident that his country will eventually receive American-made F-16 fighter jets. It was “only a matter of time” before Kyiv gets the F-16s, Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, told CNN on Monday. He said: They will definitely come. Unfortunately, in the meantime we’re losing our people while fighting for our independence. Joe Biden appeared to rule out supplying F-16 fighter jets last week, although he has emphasised he would remain in discussions with Ukraine about its weapons requests. The UK has also said supplying western jets was not practical. Danilov also suggested Ukraine may be capable of striking Russian on its own territory, beyond occupied Ukraine. He said: Regarding Russian territory, nobody prohibits us to destroy targets with weapons produced in Ukraine. Do we have such weapons? Yes, we do. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has warned that western arms supplies to Ukraine are effectively “dragging” Nato into the conflict and that could lead to an “unpredictable level of escalation”. In remarks during a conference call with military officials, quoted by state-owned Tass news agency, Shoigu accused the US and its allies of “trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible” by supplying Kyiv with what he described as “heavy offensive weapons”. He said: Such moves are actually drawing Nato countries into the conflict and can eventually lead to an unpredictable escalation. During the same call, the Russian defence minister said Moscow’s forces had made progress in the fight for control of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, saying the offensive “is advancing successfully”. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tobi Thomas to bring you the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s parliament has approved Vasily Malyuk as the new head of the country’s security services, known as the SBU, having been the acting head of the service. Malyuk, 39, has worked in the territorial bodies of the SBU since 2001, most recently leading the fight against corruption. Last year, he was also briefly the deputy minister of the ministry of internal affairs. He became acting head of the service in July 2022 after the resignation of his predecessor, Ivan Bakanov. President Zelensky, who nominated Malyuk, noted his role “in counteracting aggression, returning and liberating Ukrainian heroes.” Recriminations have broken out among EU officials after a possible visit by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Brussels was leaked, raising concerns over his security. Zelenskiy was reported to be planning a trip to Brussels this Thursday to meet EU leaders in person at a summit and address the European parliament in an extraordinary session. He is thought to have only left Ukraine once since Russia’s invasion last February: he made a surprise visit to Washington in December, where he addressed a joint session of the US Congress and urged more military support. That trip was planned in top secrecy because of concerns for his safety, although details leaked the day before. You can read more here: Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has issued a statement as uncertainty continues over his leadership. Writing on Twitter, he said: Holding the line. Thank you all for your support, as well as constructive criticism. We draw conclusions. We continue the reforms. Even during the war. We are strengthening the defense and working for victory. Glory to Ukraine! On Sunday night, David Arakhamia, chief of Zelenskiy’s Servant of the People parliamentary bloc, said Reznivok would be reshuffled into another post following the news that he had paid twice or three times the supermarket price of food to supply troops on the frontline. The defence ministry would be led by Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, Arakhamia said. Reznikov, he added, would become minister of strategic industries, tasked with strengthening military-industrial cooperation, after a day of speculation about the defence minister’s future in Kyiv. On Monday, he appeared to row back on the announcement, saying no changes would be made this week. Reznikov has faced a string of questions about corruption in the ministry from Ukrainian journalists, at a time when Zelenskiy has instituted a fresh anti-corruption drive to show the country can be ready for EU membership. Efforts to tackle corruption in his ministry needed to be “fully reloaded”, he admitted. The defence minister said he believed that Ukraine would eventually obtain F-16s or other western fighter jets, but warned against slow decision-making. “Procrastination with aircraft platforms,” Reznikov said, “will cost us more lives and blood of Ukrainians” and would cost the west more in postwar reconstruction. You can read more context surrounding Reznikov’s departure here: Andrei Kostin, the chief executive of VTB, Russia’s second largest bank, has blamed sanctions for its entire 2022 losses, acknowledging how western sanctions have crippled parts of Russia’s financial sector. Reuters reports: “Western countries blocked several major Russian banks’ access to the international Swift payments system soon after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February last year, with dominant lenders Sberbank and VTB forced to shutter operations across much of Europe. The sanctions hammer fell for VTB sooner than most domestic rivals and, being heavily exposed to international markets and with more than 20% of its loan portfolio in foreign currency, the bank was one of more than 100 loss-making lenders as the sector’s profits slumped around 90% in 2022. Kostin, in an interview with state television channel Rossiya 24, said the bank had managed to grow its retail and corporate loan portfolios, but that sanctions accounted for all the lender’s losses. “The main thing on which we incurred losses is that from Feb. 24 to March 10, before decisions were made about restrictions on issuing funds in foreign currency to the population, $26 billion was withdrawn from our accounts,” Kostin said. Capital controls introduced in February and March last year included a ban on buying cash dollars and euros as depositors hurriedly withdrew funds and Moscow sought to wrestle back some control on the FX market.” Margus Laidre, the Estonian ambassador to Russia, left his residence early on Tuesday morning, Russian state agencies have reported, suggesting that diplomatic relations between countries have been reduced to the level of chargé d’affaires. On 11 January, Estonia demanded that Moscow reduce the number of employees of the Russian embassy. The Estonian ministry of foreign affairs stated that in this way parity with the number of employees of the Estonian embassy in Moscow would be ensured. Since the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Estonia has reduced bilateral relations with Moscow to a minimum, closing Russian consulates in both Narva and Tartu and expelling three Russian diplomats. Ukraine had withdrawn from its libraries 19m copies of books by last November that came either from the Soviet era or were in Russian, a senior lawmaker has said. Reuters reports: Yevheniya Kravchuk, deputy head of the Ukrainian parliament’s committee on humanitarian and information policy, said that of the 19m books, 11mwere in Russian. “Some Ukrainian-language books from the Soviet era are also written off,” Kravchuk said according to a statement published on the website of the Verkhovna Rada, the country’s parliament. “There are also recommendations to write off and remove books whose authors supported armed aggression against Ukraine.” It was not immediately clear what happened to the withdrawn books. After Russia moved to annex Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014, Kyiv increasingly restricted the use of Russian books. The process of the so-called “de-russification” sped up when Russia invaded the country nearly a year ago. In mid-2022, Ukraine restricted the distribution of Russian books, seeking to further sever cultural ties between the two neighbours and undo policies that Kyiv authorities say have suppressed Ukrainian identity for centuries. “In general, the ratio of books in Russian and Ukrainian languages in our libraries is just very regretful,” Kravchuk said. “So now we are talking about the fact that it is necessary to renew funds and purchase books in the Ukrainian language as soon as possible.” She added that about 44% of books in Ukraine’s libraries are in Russian, the rest in Ukrainian or languages of the European Union countries. Russia almost certainly now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives, UK Ministry of Defence says. Moscow will continue to demand sweeping advances, but it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war in the coming weeks, according to the UK Ministry of Defence’s latest intelligence update. The update comes as Russia pours reinforcements into eastern Ukraine ahead of a new offensive that could begin next week. The update said: Russian forces have only managed to gain several hundred metres of territory per week. This is almost certainly because Russia now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives. Senior commanders likely make plans requiring undermanned, inexperienced units to achieve unrealistic objectives due to political and profession pressure. The update said it’s highly likely Russia has been attempting to re-start offensive operations in Ukraine since early January this year, and almost certainly with the goal of capturing the remaining Ukrainian-held parts of Donetsk oblast. Here are some of the latest images from the frontline in Ukraine. Labour to pledge rapid action on replenishing UK weapon stocks Labour will seek to shift defence procurement to an “urgent operational footing” to help buy fresh arms for Ukraine and replenish stockpiles depleted by previous gifts of military aid if it wins the next election. The opposition party believes it has taken too long for the Ministry of Defence to buy fresh munitions, citing a near year-long wait to agree a contract to replace the 4,000-plus Nlaw anti-tank bazookas sent to Kyiv before and in the early stages of the war. In a speech on Tuesday, John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, will argue that Britain’s defence purchasing is wasteful and in need of an urgent overhaul to support Ukraine in its war with Russia. More on this story here: Russia says protection structures at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant near completion The construction of protective structures for key facilities at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine is nearing completion, Reuters reports. The report first appeared in Russia’s state TASS news agency reported on Tuesday, citing an adviser to the head of Russia’s nuclear plants operator. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, was captured by Russian troops in March of last year, in the opening days of Moscow’s invasion in Ukraine. It remains close to the frontlines, and has repeatedly come under fire, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. TASS cited Renat Karchaa of Russia’s nuclear plants operator Rosenergoatom as saying: The erection of engineering and construction structures, which are designed to provide additional protection for important infrastructure facilities of the nuclear power plant, including those related to the storage of radioactive materials, is at the completion stage. Outnumbered and Worn Out, Ukrainians in East Brace for Russian Assault: New York Times As Russia pours reinforcements into eastern Ukraine ahead of a new offensive, the New York Times reports how it is being felt in the towns and villages along the hundreds of miles of undulating eastern front. Exhausted Ukrainian troops complain they are already outnumbered and outgunned, even before Russia has committed the bulk of its roughly 200,000 newly mobilized soldiers. And doctors at hospitals speak of mounting losses as they struggle to care for fighters with gruesome injuries. The civilians standing in the way of Russia’s planned advance once again face the agonizing decision of whether to leave or to stay and wait out the coming calamity. When and where the new offensive will begin in earnest is still unclear, but Ukrainian officials are gravely concerned. Ukraine’s military defied dire assessments before the war, thwarting Russia’s early efforts to seize the capital, Kyiv, and eventually driving Russian forces back in the northeast and south. But the Russian military just keeps coming. Right now, the newly mobilized troops are finishing their training and entering the field; the forces include as many soldiers as took part in the initial invasion last year. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Jordyn Beazley and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next hour. Russia has been pouring reinforcements into eastern Ukraine ahead of a new offensive that could begin next week along a front where there have been relentless battles for months, Reuters reports, citing a Ukrainian governor. “We are seeing more and more [Russian] reserves being deployed in our direction, we are seeing more equipment being brought in … ,” said Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of the mainly Russian-occupied province. “They bring ammunition that is used differently than before – it is not round-the-clock shelling anymore. They are slowly starting to save, getting ready for a full-scale offensive,” Haidai told Ukrainian television. “It will most likely take them 10 days to gather reserves. After 15 February we can expect [this offensive] at any time.” Here are some of the other latest developments: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said personnel changes on the border and frontline would bolster Ukraine’s military efforts amid uncertainty over the future of his defence minister. “We are bolstering our managerial positions,” Zelenskiy said in his Monday evening address. “In a number of regions, particularly those on the border or on the frontline, we will appoint leaders with military experience. Those who can show themselves to be the most effective in defending against existing threats.” The EU is preparing for a potential visit by Zelenskiy to Brussels on Thursday to meet the bloc’s leaders and address parliament. The European Council chief, Charles Michel, invited Zelenskiy to take part in a “future summit” of the 27 EU nations, his spokesperson said Monday. Zelenskiy was invited “to participate in person”, the spokesperson said, adding that, for security reasons, “no further information will be provided”. Russia launched five missile and 12 air attacks as well as 36 shelling attacks over a 24-hour period, hitting southern targets such as Kherson, the Ukrainian armed forces said on Monday evening. Ukrainian aircraft also launched nine strikes on a concentration of Russian forces and two anti-aircraft positions. Battleground reports could not be immediately verified. Weeks of intense fighting continued to rage around the city of Bakhmut and the nearby towns of Soledar and Vuhledar, Ukraine’s presidential office said. Ukraine said on Monday evening that Russian forces had used tank, mortar and artillery fire in Bakhmut in the past 24 hours. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was continuing to make small advances in its efforts to encircle Bakhmut. “While multiple alternative cross-country supply routes remain available to Ukrainian forces, Bakhmut is increasingly isolated.” Russian forces are attempting to tie down Ukrainian forces with fighting in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine has said. Moscow is reportedly assembling additional troops there for an expected offensive in the coming weeks, perhaps targeting the Luhansk region. “The battles for the region are heating up,” said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk. In Luhansk, fellow governor Serhiy Haidai said shelling there had subsided because “the Russians have been saving ammunition for a large-scale offensive”. The western area of the Luhansk region is likely to be the focus of any new Russian offensive, Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, who has been tipped to take over the Ministry of Defence, has said. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said that offensive would most likely be launched by “proper mechanised brigades” rather than the ill-trained reservists and Wagner mercenaries who have been suffering heavy casualties in recent battles. Ukraine has faced temperatures as low as -20C this winter, at the same time as dealing with a humanitarian crisis as Russia hits key civilian infrastructure. Areas in Dnipro, Donetsk and Kharkiv are particularly vulnerable, according to research. Some areas are housing tens of thousands of displaced people through the winter, at the same time as crucial infrastructure – including energy and housing – is being targeted by Russian missiles and artillery. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has warned the world is walking into a “wider war” over Ukraine. Addressing the UN general assembly just weeks before the first anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine, Guterres said: “The prospects for peace keep diminishing. The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing.” Germany’s plan to quickly assemble two battalions of Leopard 2 tanks from European allies and send them to Ukraine is progressing more slowly than expected. Several states have yet to decide whether they can spare vehicles. In Europe, other than Berlin, only Poland and Portugal have so far made concrete promises to contribute. Ukrainian soldiers are supposed to start being trained on Leopard 2 tanks in Germany and Poland from this week. “Germany’s commitment stands,” government spokesperson Wolfgang Büchner said on Monday. Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand, shared an image of the first Canadian-donated Leopard tank arriving in Poland. “Alongside our allies, we’ll soon be training the armed forces of Ukraine in the use of this equipment,” she tweeted. Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, has proposed his country should provide 75bn Norwegian kroner (£6.1 bn) in aid to Ukraine over five years. Half of the aid in 2023 would fund Kyiv’s military requirements while the rest would go to humanitarian needs, although this split could change in coming years, he said. The announcement comes after Støre’s government came under pressure to increase support for Ukraine, after earning billions in extra oil and gas revenue from Russia’s war. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, will not be meeting Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow this week, the Kremlin has said. Grossi is expected to meet officials from the Russian state nuclear energy firm Rosatom and the foreign ministry, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, adding that Moscow expected a “substantive dialogue”. Russia’s oil and gas revenues plunged 46% in January, compared with the same month in 2022, under the impact of the price cap on oil exports imposed by western allies over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s finance ministry said budget revenue in January was 35% lower compared with the same month in 2022, the last month before Russia sent troops into Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/nov/09/australia-promises-jobs-to-workers-stranded-by-scrapping-of-french-submarine-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-08T16:30:35Z","webTitle":"Australia promises jobs to workers stranded by scrapping of French submarine deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/09/australia-promises-jobs-to-workers-stranded-by-scrapping-of-french-submarine-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/nov/09/australia-promises-jobs-to-workers-stranded-by-scrapping-of-french-submarine-deal","fields":{"headline":"Australia promises jobs to workers stranded by scrapping of French submarine deal","bodyText":"“Each and every” skilled shipbuilding worker affected by the federal government’s decision to scrap the existing $90bn submarine project and switch to nuclear-powered boats will have a job in the future, defence industry minister Melissa Price says. As ongoing controversies surround the plan, Price will tell a major submarine conference in Adelaide on Tuesday that the submarines will be built in South Australia. As part of the Aukus deal, the government will now buy at least eight nuclear submarines from the United States or the United Kingdom instead of buying 12 diesel-electric submarines from France. The decision has enraged France, which says it was blindsided by the move. It has also sparked fears about nuclear proliferation, a capability gap, and job losses. It is not clear yet what sort of industry Australia will need in order to support the build and maintenance of nuclear-powered boats. Unions wrote to prime minister Scott Morrison in September saying thousands of jobs were at risk. Defence officials told senate estimates in October that the future of up to 600 construction jobs was uncertain after the government scrapped the existing project. Another 560 people are employed directly on the existing project. Many companies had invested in resources to become part of the supply chain for the submarines that were being bought from France’s Naval Group. In a pre-recorded message Price said she understood the uncertainty the decision had created. She said small and medium businesses affected would be supported to compete for future work across defence programs, and that individual workers would find new jobs through a sovereign shipbuilding talent pool. Workers will be redeployed to other projects, such as maintenance of and upgrades to the Collins-class submarines, or placed with overseas shipbuilders or governments. Others will have the opportunity to get new skills, or train in nuclear power. “We have a solid commitment to find a role within that pool for each and every skilled shipbuilding worker affected by this announcement,” Price said. “We will be building nuclear-powered submarines in South Australia.” The federal government has insisted France knew its project was in trouble, but France, outraged, says it was taken by surprise. The diplomatic stoush with France flared up again last week when Australian reporters interviewed Macron at the G20 summit in Rome. Asked if he thought Morrison had lied to him, Macron said: “I don’t think, I know”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In response, someone leaked a text from Macron to Morrison from two days before the Aukus announcement asking whether there was good news or bad news on the way. French ambassador Jean-Pierre Thebault, who was recalled to France amid the dispute but has since returned to Canberra, called that leak a “new low” that threatened trust in the Australian government. In a blistering address to the National Press Club, Thebault said the decision itself was a “stab in the back”. A thousand jobs have been “trashed”, he said. Labor is generally supportive of the Aukus deal but critical of the treatment of France, the potential need for the Collins-class submarines to be used for decades more before new submarines are in the water, and wants a guarantee that no jobs will be lost. The Submarine Institute of Australia is holding its conference on “homegrown undersea technology” until Thursday. The SA premier, Steven Marshall, will tell conference attenders that the state government will help the industry grab available opportunities and “help towards a seamless transition of skilled workers into new jobs”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/dec/04/australia-world-cup-socceroos-albanese-voice-dutton-politics-socceroos-argentina-economy-nsw-queensland-victoria-higgins-lehrmann-act","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-04T06:01:59Z","webTitle":"Bid to make key robodebt documents public blocked – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/dec/04/australia-world-cup-socceroos-albanese-voice-dutton-politics-socceroos-argentina-economy-nsw-queensland-victoria-higgins-lehrmann-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/dec/04/australia-world-cup-socceroos-albanese-voice-dutton-politics-socceroos-argentina-economy-nsw-queensland-victoria-higgins-lehrmann-act","fields":{"headline":"Bid to make key robodebt documents public blocked – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we’ll wrap up our live news coverage of the day.

Quoted by an Iranian news agency, he did not specify what could be modified in the law by the two bodies, which are both largely in the hands of conservatives.

A second-half goal by Craig Goodwin gave supporters some hope but Australia couldn’t recover after a mistake by keeper Mat Ryan helped Argentina to a 2-0 lead.

Federal minister Bill Shorten said all options remained on the table, with the stakes being too high to not reach a decision on action. “This issue is too important not to leave the room without it,” the Labor frontbencher told Sky News on Sunday. “Let’s see what emerges from discussions on Wednesday.” National cabinet will meet this week ahead of finalising its plan for providing energy price relief, but the inclusion of coal has complicated matters, with Queensland and NSW being asked to cooperate with a plan that will temporarily cap the wholesale price of coal.

Minion was found in a critical condition on Saturday morning, but died at the scene of the attack on Ison Rd, Greenbank. Emergency services were called to the fenced property at 10.47am, finding the Marsden man lying unconscious in the front yard with serious injuries from a dog attack. Three dogs were found inside the yard, with the Courier-Mail reporting that a bandog bullmastiff and a rhodesian ridgeback cross were seized by Logan city council animal control officers, while the third dog was not taken away. The property owners were not home at the time of the attack. Read more: Personal conversations not party press conferences will guide regional Australians on an Indigenous voice As the Nationals revealed its opposition to an Indigenous voice to parliament this week, the Victorian Women’s Trust were putting the finishing touches on its model of kitchen table conversations as a national campaign tool ahead of the voice referendum. Mary Crooks, who hails from country Victoria, is the executive director of the Trust and the architect of the Purple Sage project – the original model of “kitchen table conversations” that engaged regional voters and acted as a lightning rod for dissent ahead of Jeff Kennett’s defeat in the 1999 state election. It went on to be used by independent political campaigns, including former Indi independent Cathy McGowan’s 2013 victory as well as metropolitan independents such as Warringah MP Zali Steggall and the current crop of independent MPs elected in the 2022 federal election. “When I first designed Purple Sage project in Victoria, way back in 1990s, the Victorian government at that time was riding roughshod over Victoria, and especially people in regional and rural Victoria,” Crooks says. “That whole position of the National party this week, was redolent of that in my mind: ‘You can stop right now, and pick up a ballot paper and fill it out because we know what’s best for you. And if we’re opposed to the voice, then you should be too.’” Now, the kitchen table model will be used across the nation in a project provisionally known as “Together, Yes”. The concept would allow people to register for a process where they invite small groups into their homes for respectful conversations about the voice.

Under their plan, pokies would disappear from pubs across NSW within the next five years and from clubs over the next decade. Released on Sunday, the so-called “Pull the Pin on Pokies” strategy includes helping venues access alternative revenue streams and redirecting current revenue to support problem gambling services. The party is also backing the introduction of a cashless gaming card, currently being considered by the government to crack down on alleged money laundering. Greens MP Cate Faehrmann described gambling in NSW as “out of control”. Our plan would repair the harm pokies have wrought on our communities and reduce the social costs of gambling by at least $87bn over a decade. We call on both major parties to commit to these urgently needed reforms ahead of the March election. Venues would pay more to the government under the plan, with a pokie “super tax” of 60% across all pubs and clubs, increasing by 5% every year. The change would deliver an additional $3.4bn in revenue over five years, which would be used to fund gambling harm reduction and other community-based services, according to the Greens. A ClubsNSW spokesman responded to plans to tax venues more, saying clubs in NSW alone were already delivering $1.2bn into government coffers every year. While some 92% of people in NSW visit a club at least once per year, only 8% of voters put the Greens first. It seems the public is happy with clubs the way they are and understand a vote for the Greens is a vote for economic ruin. Adding his voice to the release of the Greens’ plan was former head of anti-money laundering at ClubsNSW turned whistleblower, Troy Stolz. Stolz is being sued by ClubsNSW for allegedly leaking internal documents that showed more than 90% of gaming venues were not complying with money laundering regulations. The 53-year-old is due to appear at a federal court hearing on Monday. Money laundering in pubs and clubs across NSW is real and so is gambling harm – it cannot be ignored. The Greens have a plan to address these issues, whereas the Liberal and Labor parties only plan to serve their master, the gambling industry. – AAP One airline passenger’s $3,000 battle to retrieve his lost luggage Marko Bogicevic maintains his ordeal began because he had the gall to share a joke article about yuppies losing bags on flights from Australia to Europe. It was fateful irony, he’s certain, that led to not one but three bags being lost on a short trip abroad, leaving Bogicevic several thousands dollars in debt and tying him into a tortuous long-distance dispute with Air France. “I made fun of them [the yuppies],” he said, “and two weeks later my girlfriend [Dani Meyerowitz] and I were going to Europe and, of course, we lost our bags.” It would be almost four months before one bag was recovered, during which Bogicevic paid to replace many of the items inside it, only to find his claims for compensation frustrated by Air France. The saga began when the couple landed in Nice at the end of a connecting flight from Sydney and watched the baggage carousel slowly spin, to no avail. The airline was not completely unhelpful. For the full story on Bogicevic’s epic journey for justice, read the full report by Caitlin Cassidy: Queensland man dies two weeks after hit and run A Queensland man has died in hospital, two weeks after he was struck in an alleged deliberate hit-run west of Brisbane. Police say the 33-year-old Boronia Heights man was hit along Toowoomba Connection Road shortly after 3pm on November 20. He was airlifted from the scene to the Princess Alexandra Hospital, but he died on Saturday. A 46-year-old Rockville man has already been charged with one count of attempted murder, two counts of endangering safety of a person in a vehicle with intent, and one count of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle. Toowoomba detectives say they are now considering whether alternative charges are necessary. A 2004 white Holden Rodeo ute believed to be involved in the collision remains to be found. Police are appealing for the owner of that vehicle or any other witnesses to come forward. - AAP Rock fisherman dies in Sydney’s north A fisher has died after being pulled from the water on Sydney’s northern beaches. Emergency services were called to Turimetta Headland, Narrabeen, at about 10.45am on Sunday, after reports a rock fisher had fallen into the water. The man was winched from the surf by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter which touched down at the nearby Rat Park in Warriewood. Despite the efforts of paramedics who performed CPR the man died at the scene, police said. It is understood the man, believed to be in his 70s, was wearing a lifejacket when he entered the water. Officers from Northern Beaches Police Area Command will prepare a report for the Coroner. – AAP Extinction Rebellion says the jailing of climate activist Violet Coco is “an outrageous abuse of justice” ahead of a planned rally in Melbourne on Sunday. A rally will be held outside the state library in support of Coco who was given a 15-month jail sentence for blocking traffic on Sydney Harbour Bridge for 25 minutes. Coco was sentenced under New South Wales’ harsh anti-protest laws and the sentence has been criticised by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association Clement Voule. CoCo had previously participated in protests organised by Extinction Rebellion but had recently participated in protests organised by Fireproof Australia. Mark Conroy, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion described the sentence as “an outrageous abuse of justice”. This outrageous abuse of justice is merely the latest in a line of repressive and punitive actions against peaceful climate activism, not to mention the even longer line of repression against any group fighting collectively for a better life in so-called Australia. Climate activists are facing corrupt, captured, governments worldwide, and harassment and repression from police and the ‘justice’ system. We will show the fossil fuel companies and governments that the climate movement will not be cowed by this repression. We have the right to peaceful protest and we will continue to hold the polluters and planet destroyers, and those to abet them, to account. Our governments are failing us, so it is up to citizens to lead the way. We do not feel there is any choice but to work together against state capture and corporate greed. Gold Coast Titans chairman Paul Broughton dies aged 91 Rugby league trailblazer and Gold Coast Titans founding father Paul Broughton has been remembered as one of the sport’s most intelligent and passionate men. The inaugural Titans chairman, whose name is attached to the club’s annual best and fairest medal, has died aged 91. Broughton was a player, coach and administrator, widely viewed as “the godfather of Gold Coast rugby league” and a major player in the creation of the Titans. He made eight first-grade appearances for St George and Balmain in the 1950s and coached Balmain and Newtown in the 1970s. Broughton’s contribution to the code was recognised with an Order of Australia Medal. Several significant figures reacted to news of Broughton’s death, with Phil Gould tweeting a tribute to his former coach. So sad to hear of the passing of my dear old friend. The most intelligent and passionate rugby league man I have ever known. He was 90 and messaged me every day with ideas and support for the great game. So very sad. I miss him already. RIP Coach. Broughton revolutionised coaching with his annual camps alongside Peter Corcoran and employed the first Indigenous NSW Rugby League development officer. NSWRL chief executive David Trodden said his support for Indigenous players set an example for others to follow. There were not many coaches or players of that era who did not have the benefit of advice from Paul and Peter. His impact on the game in our state has been acknowledged by the naming of the educational centre at NSW Rugby League headquarters after Paul. His thinking was always way ahead of its time, not only in Rugby League ways but in socially progressive ways. He was a big supporter of our First Nations people. Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V’landys described Broughton as a “legendary” rugby league figure. His passion for rugby league was clear to all who knew him. His efforts particularly to further the sport on the Gold Coast were tireless and nothing short of extraordinary. He was a leader and a gentleman. He dared to take the game to places many couldn’t imagine and for that we will owe a huge debt. – AAP Coalition MP’s ‘grassroots’ nuclear power survey linked to consulting firm A Coalition frontbencher conducting a “grassroots” survey about nuclear power is using a website registered by a business that helps an American small modular reactor company, records reveal. Ted O’Brien, the shadow minister for climate change and energy, issued a statement on Friday saying he was “launching a grassroots community engagement program” under the banner “Time to Talk Nuclear”. He urged Australians to “join the conversation” by completing a short survey on the website, with the first question being: “What do you think could be the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia?” Guardian Australia can reveal the web domain was registered by Helixos Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based consulting company whose projects include “supporting the commercialisation of new nuclear energy technology”. Helixos lists the US company NuScale Power as one of its clients. For more on this Guardian exclusive read the full story by Daniel Hurst: Messi salutes Socceroos performance after ‘tough’ match Lionel Messi does not find much complicated on a football pitch. But he did against the Socceroos. Messi’s mercurial abilities loomed large in Argentina’s 2-1 win which knocked the Australians out of the World Cup in Qatar. The Argentine captain scored a glorious goal and was acclaimed as player of the match. But after his team went 2-0 up, the gallant Socceroos made a late charge. “Things got complicated in the end with their goal,” Messi said. “But it’s a World Cup. And it’s never easy.” Socceroos substitute Craig Goodwin fired an audacious long-range attempt in the 77th minute which deflected into the net from Argentina’s Enzo Fernandez. The own goal sparked the Australians, who had two more golden chances, with Aziz Behich and Garang Kuol coming close to equalisers in a frantic finale. Messi was not surprised. It was a very difficult match, we knew it was going to be this way. We knew it was going to be a very physical match and they were very strong. We had the game under control and could have scored another one - we were almost punished for it in the last minute. There were a few scary moments ... it was a tough game, a tough day. We’re through, that’s the important thing. Argentina next meet the Netherlands in next Friday’s quarter-final (0600 Saturday AEDT) as Messi seeks to capture the World Cup at his fifth attempt. – AAP Minor flood warnings have been issued across parts of Victoria. Here is the full statement from Justin Warren on the AAT decision refusing the release of robodebt documents: The unlawful and underhanded Robodebt regime stole money from hundreds of thousands of Australians. We deserve to know everything about how this happened so we can ensure that it never, ever happens again. Until we know the truth, the whole truth, of how this abhorrent scheme was proposed, built, and sanctioned—and by whom—we have to assume the government intends to do it again. I also note that the AAT took nearly a year to make its decision, which is longer than the entire period allocated for the Royal Commission into robodebt. The Royal Commission has already demonstrated its ability to work quickly and efficiently, and it has a solid understanding of where the public interest lies. It is also able to explain its decisions clearly and succinctly. The contrast is fairly stark, so there is obviously merit in having actual courts deal with the legal issues here. My legal team and I are considering our options for an appeal. Meanwhile, I look forward to following the Royal Commission and its pro-transparency approach. As always, the purpose of a system is what it does. Documents that may have revealed what former ministers knew about the failed robodebt scheme will not be released, a tribunal has ruled. Advocate Justin Warren first requested access to the 12 documents in 2017 under freedom of information laws but the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on Sunday decided to only release one. The requested documents include early business plans produced by the Department of Human Services, now known as Services Australia, to justify the robodebt scheme. Warren believes the full set of documents could reveal what former prime minister Scott Morrison and senior ministers including Christian Porter and Alan Tudge knew about the scheme. We deserve to know everything about how this happened so we can ensure that it never ever happens again. Until we know the truth, the whole truth, of how this abhorrent scheme was proposed, built and sanctioned – and by whom – we have to assume the government intends to do it again. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, which is running the case as part of the Grata FOI Project, will consider options to appeal the tribunal’s decision. The robodebt scheme, initiated under the former Coalition government in 2015, sought to recover $1.2bn over four years from more than 860,000 welfare recipients. But more than $750m was wrongfully recovered from 381,000 people. A royal commission into robodebt is now under way with public hearings continuing in Brisbane on Monday. Morrison is expected to front the commission on 14 December. – AAP Here are a few reactions from Australia’s political leadership on the Socceroos’ loss. Reserve Bank to make final interest rate decision of 2022 The Reserve Bank is gearing up for its final cash rate decision for 2022, with at least one more hike broadly expected. Another 25 basis point increase will take the rate to 3.1% and cause more pain for mortgage holders with variable loans. The central bank board will convene to make its decision for December on Tuesday. A Finder survey of 40 experts and economists found almost 90% expect a 0.25 percentage point lift but opinions vary on the bank’s monetary policy trajectory in the new year. HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said the last month revealed a job market that was still too tight and inflation that was still too high, despite the national statistics bureau’s monthly inflation gauge easing slightly. He said this was enough to deliver one more hike for the year but suspects it could be the last one, with rate hikes already weighing on the property market and probably spending, as retail figures reveal signs of a consumer slowdown. Scant evidence of a wage-price spiral should also support the case for a pause in February when the board will meet next. Our expectation is that local growth will slow further over coming months, pressure in the jobs market will start to ease, the global growth backdrop will worsen, and global disinflation will become clearer. – AAP Australia maintains AAA credit rating The treasurer has seized on Australia maintaining its top credit rating as a stamp of approval for the government’s economic policy. Fitch Ratings reaffirmed the AAA rating, saying Labor’s first budget showed “restraint”. It noted the budget didn’t provide any cost-of-living offsets in a deliberate move by the government to contain spending and avoid exacerbating inflation. The finance and insurance company also predicted slowing GDP growth, tipping a 1.5% rise in 2023 compared with 3.9% this year, mainly due to high inflation and rising interest rates. The treasurer Jim Chalmers said the affirmation is “a strong endorsement of the government’s economic management”. It shows that our budget was defined by the times and designed for the times, and we got the fiscal settings right. Chalmers said rising inflation was the main challenge facing the economy. That’s why our economic plan is carefully designed to avoid putting upward pressure on prices and making the job of the Reserve Bank harder. – AAP Arnold: ‘We need a home’ for Australian soccer Graham Arnold is appealing for government funding and a revamp of Australian football’s landscape as he contemplates his future as Socceroos coach. Arnold’s contract expired when his Socceroos ended their World Cup campaign with a 2-1 loss to heavyweights Argentina in a knockout bout in Qatar. I just want to go away, have a good holiday, have a break and see what happens. I have worked extremely hard this campaign to get to where we have got. I haven’t even thought about it [my future]. I need a rest and no doubt I will have good discussions then with the organisation. But Arnold is adamant: despite the success of emulating the fabled 2006 Socceroos in reaching the round of 16 at a World Cup, the structure of football in Australia must change. For starters, he wants more government money, chiefly for junior development, and more games and more clubs in the domestic A-League competition. We need to spend money and get help from the government to put some money into the game to help develop kids. One thing I would really love to see before I finish up completely in football is [for the government [to] build us a house. We don’t have a home. We have been homeless since I have been involved for 37 years in the national teams. We need a home, a facility like ... the AIS [Australian Institute of Sport], something that the government can help fund for the development of the national teams but also for the good of Australian football. Arnold, who was almost sacked last March as Australia’s qualifying campaign wobbled, has now overseen the nation’s most successful World Cup. For the first time, the Socceroos won two games at a single edition of the tournament and kept consecutive clean sheets. And his world No 38 outfit gave Argentina, the world No 3 boasting all-time great Lionel Messi, a serious scare in their knockout fixture. It’s probably me, it’s the way I am. Even though we have ... been successful, I feel like we’ve failed tonight. I just wanted to win so badly for the nation and for the fans and for the game of football in Australia. Making the last 16 for me wasn’t enough. I wanted more, but that’s just me. I know a lot of other people might be happy with it but that’s just the way I am. – AAP A heatwave is building across northern Australia that will become severe next week with fire warnings issued for Western Australia. The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, says the actions of a former minister he alleges intimidated public servants were foolish. Shorten said Liberal MP Stuart Robert had “inappropriately” made requests to high level public servants after media allegations surrounding his dealings with a consulting firm. He said any requests from an opposition should go through the relevant ministerial office. Nine newspapers reported consulting company Synergy 360, owned by a friend of Robert, claimed in leaked documents the minister met the firm about government contracts. Parliament was told investigations had shown one of Synergy’s clients Infosys had been awarded four contracts totalling $274m to upgrade payment software within the Department of Human Services. Shorten told Sky News’ Sunday Agenda program, “the emails are sufficiently detailed as to warrant an investigation”. We don’t have anything definitive but there’s been plenty of smoke, so for the sake of the reputation of the Commonwealth we need to satisfy ourselves ... if there’s anymore to it. Shorten said Mr Robert’s contact with public servants after the allegations surfaced was “definitely foolish”. “It seemed to me he was trying to extricate himself, which is understandable,” he added. But Shorten said departmental staff weren’t at the beck and call of former ministers and that requests for documents or information should go through the proper channels. “Do things right, the best process is always the best protection,” he said. Shorten was asked if the allegations were enough to warrant a referral to the national anti-corruption commission once it’s up and running. “Let’s just get to the bottom of it,” he said. Robert rejected the “implied imputation” of the media reports “in the strongest possible language”. I reiterate that all departmental procurements were run with the highest levels of probity,” he said on Thursday. I had zero involvement with this procurement or any other procurements and reject completely these accusations. – AAP Former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins has commented on the impact the legal system has on people who come forward with sexual assault allegations. The prosecution of a man alleged to have raped Higgins in Parliament House in 2019 was dropped this week due to concerns about her mental wellbeing. The initial trial was aborted due to juror misconduct. Bruce Lehrmann has always maintained his innocence, denying there was any sexual contact between the pair. In her first public comments since the prosecution was dropped, Higgins said she never understood how asymmetrical the criminal justice system was until she spoke up. In an Instagram post on Sunday morning Higgins said she had felt like the person on trial after having her private life, messages and data publicly exposed and scrutinised. This is the reality of how complainants in sexual assault cases are treated. Their lives are torn apart, their families and friends called to the witness stand and the accused has the legal right to say absolutely nothing. Higgins said the criminal justice system failed to deliver outcomes for victims of sexual assault, citing that in the ACT during 2020, only 16% of sexual offences reported to police resulted in a charge. Only half of those resulted in a conviction. That is to our national shame. I want to thank the other women who came forward and shared their own experiences. I believe you. You were with me every day I walked into that court room and faced him. It should be noted that this is the exact same statement Higgins gave when the trial was aborted though it is the first time she has shared the text through social media. – AAP Price cap mooted to keep gas cheap One senior minister is hopeful the commonwealth and states and territories can come up with a solution to quell swelling energy prices when they meet this week. Bill Shorten told Sky News on Sunday that all options remain on the table with the stakes being too high to not reach a decision on how to act. “This issue is too important not to leave the room without it,” he said. “Let’s see what emerges from discussions on Wednesday.” NSW treasurer Matt Kean said the state government would support price caps implemented by the commonwealth. He said while he had spoken to the prime minister about implementing a coal price cap, no dollar figure had been mentioned. The commonwealth and some state governments are in discussions over how a gas or coal price cap would be implemented. The federal government has raised concerns about potential legal consequences if it were to cap prices instead of states, but speaking to Sky News Kean said the commonwealth had the power to do so. Our legal advice says they do have the power to cap coal prices if they do go down that path, and we will support them. This is a national problem that requires a national solution. Kean said he shared concerns that acting too late would mean the measures wouldn’t bring down energy prices over the next 12 months. “We need to move and we need to move very quickly,” he said. The NSW treasurer said a gas price cap would need to be considered alongside coal. He said a ceiling price for one would not be enough to bring down prices with black coal setting the wholesale electricity price in NSW and Queensland more than half the time. While all options remain on the table, the federal government has been reluctant to spruik rebates, pointing to the inflationary pressure of handouts. Kean said the flow-on effect of increased energy prices being the biggest driver of inflation also needed to be considered. “If it’s temporary and targeted to people who can least afford it, then it won’t have the inflationary effect people are worried about,” he said of the rebates. – AAP Fourth man charged following Melbourne shooting A fourth person has been charged with murder following the death of a man in Melbourne’s south-east. The 36-year-old man died in the early hours of 11 July after being shot at a Noble Park unit. Police on Sunday charged a 35-year-old Doveton man with murder, affray and intentionally causing injury. He was remanded to appear at the Melbourne magistrates court in April next year. The Doveton man is the fourth person to be charged over the incident, with two men from Springvale and a 25-year-old man from Blackburn North charged since 23 November. All four men are facing a single count of murder. Investigators say they are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident. – AAP Matt Kean wants more women in NSW Liberals NSW treasurer Matt Kean has doubled down on his drive to correct what he says is the Liberal party’s poor record on gender diversity. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, Kean said he’ll be making a push at preselection to enlist more women to the party. I’d like to see our party more representative of the community and that’s something I’ll continue to push for. That’s why I want to see more strong female candidates being selected in preselections. Between now and Christmas, when our preselections will come to an end, I’ll be doing everything I can to see women selected in every seat at every opportunity. The vow follows the outspoken MP’s criticism of the party’s processes in the wake of a failed attempt by roads minister Natalie Ward to win preselection for the northern Sydney seat of Davidson against former premier Mike Baird’s ex-staffer Matt Cross. “I’m devastated about the results ... I thought that a smart, talented senior female minister would trump a former junior staffer every day of the week,” Kean said last week. The treasurer said he was in favour of gender quotas and had always been an advocate for a greater diversity of candidates. Ward’s defeat is being seen as another blow to the Liberal party’s attempt to increase the number of women in the state’s lower house from seven of its 33 members ahead of the March election. Kean dubbed the Davidson result “bitterly disappointing” and evidence that the party’s branch membership is not reflective of the community. Natalie’s a great candidate, she’s a great minister and she’s a great role model to Liberal women. Of course, I supported her. He said he was also behind former Warringah Chamber of Commerce president Wendy Finianos to be preselected over another Liberal staffer, Toby Williams, in the Sydney seat of Wakehurst. - AAP Government claims ‘early win’ for people with disability Hundreds of people with a disability who had been forced to sit in hospital despite being ready for discharge have been able to leave. NDIS minister Bill Shorten says an average of 1,400 hospital beds across Australia every night contain people with a disability who are medically fit but unable to leave while waiting for their support package. Shorten said 350 people have been able to get their NDIS packages sorted and discharged, saving taxpayers about $1m a day, with a night in hospital racking up an average of $2,500. “It’s a slow-moving thing, the river of reform, when you’re talking about the NDIS, but we’ve had some early wins,” Shorten told Sky News on Sunday. The number of NDIS participants fighting for legal recourse has also been significantly reduced. The backlog of cases in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been cut down from 4,500 to 2,000 since Labor took power in May. “Another 2,500 this Christmas not stuck in the AAT,” the minister said. Shorten flagged that conversations needed to be had with state counterparts about supports outside the NDIS to avoid it becoming overwhelmed with demand. One of the challenges is the NDIS was never intended to be the only lifeboat in the ocean. The mix of federal state funding has been drifting towards the commonwealth picking up 63%, so we’re going to have to have some fair dinkum conversations about what are the other supports were providing people with disability outside the NDIS so everyone doesn’t flock to that. – AAP Fans frustrated at last-minute World Cup arrangements As fans and supporters made their way out of the Darling Harbour viewing site for the Socceroos’ round of 16 loss to Argentina, many expressed their frustration at the hastily organised event. Crowds were expected to stay at 6,000, but the heaving masses at Tumbalong Park far exceeded that number, with police closing the viewing site before it was full for “safety reasons”. That left many fans locked out, with supporters piling on to staircases and benches to get a view of the screens and of the match. Stuart Farrell said it had been difficult to get into the site and added he was disappointed more people weren’t allowed in. Lots of us got locked outside. It would have been good if they let some more people in. There were so many up there on stairs, it could’ve been more dangerous if they jumped around too much. Six thousand people for a major sporting event is just not good enough. It looks like triple that number have turned up. It feels like they underestimated the number of people who would turn up today. There should have been more screens, more viewing sites, more chances for us to come together to watch the Socceroos here. Why wasn’t it here the whole time, the way Melbourne had it? Burney: the voice is about constitutional recognition Burney won’t be drawn on when the full details for the proposal will be made public, saying she is “not going to get ahead and the government will not get ahead of the working group”. On whether this detail will be provided before the referendum, Burney says Australians “will be well informed and they will understand the reason for the voice”. The voice – the notion is not just about Aboriginal people, it’s about us as a nation finally having constitutional recognition. Burney is asked about the attacks on her by Senator Jacinta Price. She says there is “so much support” for the voice out in the community. What’s important to me is that this voice is about representing First Nations people to the parliament, to the executive government, for better outcomes and bringing this country together in an extraordinary moment of truth telling. Burney says she is confident that when a referendum comes to a vote in a year the answer will be “yes”: I am confident in the Australian people and I believe if the Australian people fully understand the need for this voice, the powerlessness, as described in the Uluru statement of First Nations people, and an enormous sense of fairness, I believe the vote will be ‘yes’. Burney: voice will have no power to veto parliament Burney is asked whether the voice will issue a statement on all bills that come before parliament explaining whether it was consulted and what advice was provided in how it was drafted. Burney stresses that the body will have no power to veto the actions of parliament and its role will be advisory. It will also not have a program delivery function. I think those things are really important to make sure the voice is available to the parliament and to the executive government for advice, and that advice can be sought and given. Speers presses Burney on whether the body will be consulted on each individual bill and how it will work. Burney says her view is that it will be consulted on any issues that affect First Nations people and will give effect to basic principles of self determination. There is no question, David, that what we have been doing is not working. There is still overcrowding, there is still communities in this country that don’t have clean water. […] Let’s take, for example, the fact that there is going to be a standalone First Nations domestic violence plan. It would be important to me that the voice is very much involved in advising, working alongside the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander advisory committee on that, to make sure that what is in the plan reflects what First Nations people are saying about the issue of domestic violence, for example. Let’s think about the fact that we are going to be moving towards a standalone First Nations, or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage plan. Fundamental issues of that would be advised by the voice, alongside with the alliance of First Nations people and cultural heritage. There is no doubt that what happened at Juukan Gorge cannot happen again. ‘Enormous amounts of work’ at state and territory levels Speers is trying to tease out more details of the voice, but Burney is being careful not to reveal too much. Asked about whether there will be local voices, Burney says consultation is still under way. There is enormous amounts of work going on at state and territory levels which has to be part of where we head nationally. I see what’s going on in, for example, legislation about to go into the South Australian parliament to create a voice there. There is a First Nations assembly in Victoria. Those things will inform, and I think, enhance a national voice. What this national voice is about is very straightforward. It is about improving the lives and the outcomes which are completely unacceptable at the moment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but it will also be about telling the truth in our nation’s birth certificate and recognising that this country has the extraordinary gift of 65,000 years. Burney is asked whether “there are any matters that don’t relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people”? This voice is about improving the life outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It doesn’t matter what you choose, whether it’s housing, whether it’s incarceration, whether it’s educational outcomes, whether it’s domestic violence rates – all of those things will be informed by this voice, including importantly cultural issues, the fact that there is going to be a move towards a standalone cultural heritage act, things like a standalone domestic violence strategy for Aboriginal people – these are the things that the Voice will absolutely inform. Burney ‘won’t get ahead’ of voice working group Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney says she “won’t get ahead” of the efforts of a working group working on a proposed model for an Indigenous voice to parliament. Burney says those working on its design are “being very deliberate and being very careful” about the proposal being developed. This is not something that has come out of nowhere. This has been talked about for generations with First Nations people. Burney says the government and the parliament will decide what the final design will be. There is some very well ventilated principles that have been agreed to that will inform the design of the voice. Things like it will be representative, things like it will be accountable and transparent. It will have gender parity, it will represent Torres Strait Islanders, it will have young people and, most importantly, it will be a representative body chosen by Aboriginal communities and not usurp existing organisations. Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney is speaking to David Speers on Insiders this morning. We will bring you the latest as it happens. ‘We did everything we could’ A tearful Socceroos midfielder Jackson Irvine said he was proud of the team despite its loss to world No 3 Argentina. We did everything we could to give ourselves a chance in the game. When Argentina are celebrating like this, victory against Australia, it shows what kind of opposition we gave them. A story in three tweets Supporters packed into the park, forcing police to close off access and saying it was “full” but the mood turned sombre as Argentina scored their second in the second half. A story in three tweets: Disappointment and pride Disappointment weighed heavy on crowds at the Socceroos viewing party in Darling Harbour this morning, after the team lost 2-1 to Argentina. It was Australia’s first knockout match since 2006, and Sydney marked it with a huge turnout at the hastily organised public viewing sites. Flares were sparked soon into the second half, thrown around the crowd, as they cheered and jeered to every tackle, and with Australia’s goal celebrated ecstatically. Joshua Ciscato said it was “pure ecstasy” when the Socceroos scored, and that he was ultimately proud of their performance. “It was a solid performance, they did us proud, but we were ecstatic when we scored. I couldn’t even see the screen, it was just limbs everywhere. “The atmosphere here has been beautiful, and the setup here is pretty good, I’m just not sure why they didn’t have this for the group stage matches as well.” And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. Massive crowds gathered at Federation Square and in Darling Harbour have been devastated as the Socceroos crashed out of their most successful World Cup run since 2006. Australia lost 2-1 to Argentina in a dramatic game that saw the Socceroos stage a last-ditch comeback. Thousands of fans gathered in Federation Square in Melbourne during the early hours of Sunday morning where they let off flares in anticipation while Sydney Opera House lit up its sails in green and gold. Australia’s win over Denmark marked its second-ever appearance in the round of 16, forcing cities across the country to make bigger public spaces available for crowds looking to watch the game. But hopes of a win against Argentina dimmed when Lionel Messi and Julián Álvarez scored two goals in the first half. Australia didn’t give in, fight back in a dramatic second half Craig Goodwin scoring his second goal of the World Cup in the final 10 minutes. Darling Harbour and Fed Square erupted into chaos as fans held out hope for a comeback but it was not to be. I’m Royce Kurmelovs, taking the blog through the morning. With so much going on out there, it’s easy to miss stuff, so if you spot something happening in Australia and think it should be on the blog, you can find me on Twitter at @RoyceRk2 where my DMs are open.

In the overheated atmosphere today we are accused of apologising for Putin’s brutal invasion and of being “fifth columnists” and “traitors”. In 2003 we were “friends of the Taliban” or “allies of Saddam”. It wasn’t true then and it’s not true now. What is true is that there seems to be a permanent glitch in the matrix of the minds of war enthusiasts that prevents them from understanding that it is possible to oppose the policy of your own government and still oppose the actions of other governments. Our critics want to make it either/or. But it’s not. Unlike many of our detractors, we are consistent in opposing the misery, death, displacement and disruption that affects any country consumed by war. We feel horror and sickness when we see Putin’s invasion, his attacks on civilian populations and the shelling of a nuclear power station. We have welcomed, supported and publicised the actions of anti-war protesters in Russia. We wish our critics were as consistent, but we wait without expectation for the praise showered on anti-war protesters to come our way. We want to welcome the refugees queueing at the Polish borders and think that our government should do much more to let them into one of the richest countries in the world. And again we hope our critics will be as welcoming to refugees fleeing western wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and Libya. The hypocrisies of the war supporters are only possible if we forget the context and history of modern wars. Ukraine did not come out of a clear blue sky. We cannot accept a narrative that ignores context and history and simply puts this invasion down to Putin’s designation as the latest “new Hitler” or to his mental state. To wilfully ignore the past, including the recent past, is a disservice to all those who want to end this war. The roots of this conflict lie in what has happened since the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved, whereas its western opposite, Nato, was not. Despite assurances to the contrary, Nato expanded ever closer towards the Russian border, incorporating 14 new member states, mainly in eastern Europe. It has also expanded into “out of area operations”, including central involvement in Afghanistan and Libya. It now plans further expansion into the Indo-Pacific as part of an increased military presence against China. It is not repeating Kremlin propaganda to point out these facts. And the anti-war movement is far from alone in doing this. George Kennan, the doyen of US foreign policy, has said the same. So did William Burns in 2008. He is now head of the CIA. This is not the first war in Europe since 1945. That was in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, culminating with the Nato bombing of Serbia in 1999. This marked a key turning point in relations with Russia. The next Nato operation was Afghanistan in 2001, initially supported by Russia, as was the bombing of Libya in 2011. These, plus the war in Iraq in 2003, have shaped the present. The features now so widely and correctly condemned in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – from cluster bombs to targeting of civilians to besieging cities – have all been part of western wars, but with very little comment or opposition from the British political class. There was no referral to the international criminal court for the US following its use of depleted uranium in the Iraqi city of Falluja; no sanctions when Trump ordered the dropping the “mother of all bombs” on Afghanistan; no outcry at Britain’s continuing support for Saudi Arabia’s brutal bombing of Yemen. The anti-war movement has a better record of consistency in opposing wars than those who applaud and justify our own government’s wars while decrying the same behaviour by Putin. If the first casualty of war is truth, then the second must be the increasingly intolerant, repressive and anti-Russian sentiments across sections of British society. Keir Starmer’s threat to remove the whip from 11 MPs if they criticised Nato is an astonishing piece of thought policing, and something that even Tony Blair never attempted to do over Afghanistan or Iraq. Are we seriously saying that there can be no criticism of our government’s foreign policy or of its dreadful record of wars over the past 20 years, culminating in the defeat last year in Afghanistan? In some ways even more chilling are the reports of Russian films being removed from festivals, of Russian cats being banned from shows, and of the proposed removal of the statue in Manchester of Friedrich Engels (a German), who always opposed Russia as a Tsarist autocracy and whose political beliefs are roundly denounced by Putin. Talk of no-fly zones has so far been rejected, but we should be aware that any such move would be a declaration of war on Russia by Nato, with terrible consequences. I have no problem with condemning imperialism of any sort. I regard Russia as an imperialist power, although considerably lesser economically and militarily than its opponents. The system of imperialism leads to economic rivalry, which turns into military competition. We have seen a huge increase in military spending throughout the world in the past decades. This war is leading to calls for even more: Germany announced this week it will double its spending, and there is a growing militarisation across Europe. The attacks on the anti-war movement will continue. We will continue to campaign against this war in Ukraine – but we will take no lessons from the warmongers on any side.

Its wheels turn intermittently, deliberately, helping drag a city’s lifeblood closer to the fresh air. Down by the gates an elderly man materialises from a side path at the first sign of visitors, hawking a plastic bag half-full of cherries. They are in season, glistening and juicy; there will be plenty more where those came from, should the volume of sales match his optimism. Inside, Yuriy Vernydub has work of his own. He jokes that the last year of his life would make a film script but the immediate reality is, true to his oeuvre, about the next game. There is a competitive match to prepare for: Kryvbas will face Kolos Kovalivka near Kyiv on Tuesday, the first day of the 2022-23 Ukrainian Premier League season. Soon the heavens will open. While thunder and lightning compete for attention overhead his players will be sent out of their indoor dome and on to the grass pitch so they can perfect their off-the-ball shape. They are 40km from the Russian frontline; overnight there have been barrel bombings to the south, and these weather conditions are water off a footballer’s back. “Of course I have some fears about starting the league now, any smart person would,” Vernydub says. “It’s probably the first time in history that a championship will be played during the middle of a war. But I’ve seen real shelling with my own eyes, so I’m less scared.” This is Kryvyi Rih: the sprawling, snaking city that dominates central Ukraine’s industrial heartland. Its people are tough, plain-speaking, more than half of them working in the metallurgy industry whose edifices dominate every stretch of the landscape. Kryvbas are accordingly belligerent: they will not relocate to Kyiv, as others have done, even if areas on the city’s periphery are frequently being shelled and the troubling spectre of the Enerhodar nuclear power station looms 60 miles to the south-east. The city is protected by four lines of defence and cannot be entered without passing a series of army checkpoints. In June, the club told its rivals to forget any idea of playing league games abroad, saying there is “no other option, neither from a moral point of view nor from sporting principle” than to compete domestically. The same month, Vernydub became manager. “It has to happen here, in our land,” he says. “It’s very important to our soldiers, our warriors, that we do it.” Vernydub knows why. Last September, his Sheriff Tiraspol team caused astonishment by winning at Real Madrid in the Champions League. But he watched the Spanish side beat Liverpool in the final via a patchy television feed with his artillery unit, not far from Kryvyi Rih. On the day Russia invaded Ukraine he was coaching Sheriff in a Europa League tie against Braga; within hours he was on the way back home to Zaporizhzhia and, at 56, volunteering for the army draft. “I paid virtually no attention to football,” he says, explaining how returning fire towards the invaders became his daily focus. “I think every man would do the same.” When it was time to come back, the offer from Kryvbas’ president, Kostyantyn Karamanits, suited him. Karamanits had donated help to Vernydub’s army division so the favour was returned. “Presidents of other clubs talk a lot about their assistance but this one helps a lot without talking too much,” he says. “This is a truly patriotic, real Ukrainian club.” *** Viacheslav Riabov is a veteran midfielder, Kryvyi Rih born and bred, who speaks an essential truth: “The soul of this city is underground.” A portion of it plunges 160m below sea level and, remarkably, is hewn only a mile from the centre. Pivdennyi quarry is a cavernous, disorientating moonscape operated by Rudomain, the club’s sponsor. There are more than 50 mines, quarries and plants in the area and this is by no means the biggest. Trucks haul iron ore from top to bottom, the round trip of about an hour taking place up to 10 times a day, but in wartime the facility has operated at around 20% capacity with transportation options restricted. “I’m amazed every day I come to work,” says Oleg Podkopaiev, the quarry’s deputy director and a Kryvbas fan. He worries that, within three decades, the ore may have been exhausted and that his home city may come to resemble Detroit. Everything in Kryvyi Rih is built around this blue mineral and its football club would not exist without it. “Kryvbas is at the heart of our city and community,” Podkopaiev, a jovial 40-year-old, says. “It’s absolutely necessary for morale here that the club starts playing again. We have to go on living.” Kryvbas and their supporters have tried to help their compatriots do exactly that. Pavlo Petrechenko, a matchgoer since 1997, is a member of the Old School fan sector and recounts how they set up a joint bank account with the club to collect donations for medical supplies, pickup trucks, drones and other equipment to help the military. Many of the group went to fight at the front; four have already died in places such as Mariupol and Kharkiv oblast. “We know it may end up being more,” he says. “When we play our first game back in Kryvyi Rih, we will do something to honour them. This city is strong; the orcs got a bit close but we withstood, because our people have iron strength.” When he was younger, Petrechenko shared a stage with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Kryvyi Rih’s most famous son and a driving force of Kryvbas’ recent revival. The pair were comedians: Zelenskiy’s group, Kvartal 95, would face the Punks troupe featuring Petrechenko in local talent shows during the 1990s. Artem Gagarin, the vice-president of Kryvbas, was a few years their junior and considered one of the president’s comic proteges. Petrechenko shakes his head and laughs when asked if he sensed his contemporary was set for a career in high office. “But he’s proved everyone wrong,” he says. “He got lots of criticism before the war and has shown the true Kryvyi Rih character.” It helped him to the top and may ensure Ukraine prevails, too. Riabov knows what the miners and their peers have wrought. “There has always been a winners’ spirit here,” he says. *** It is a bright Saturday morning. The previous day’s downpour is a distant memory but some things remain constant. A couple of hours ago, four Kalibr cruise missiles were shot down above Dnipro, 85 miles north-east, and the awful wail of air raid sirens echoed around Kryvyi Rih. Most of the public continue as if impervious: the unique underground trams on the metro keep shuddering along; a couple walk along the pavement sharing the weight of a huge, vibrant basket of flowers. At the Kryvbas training ground, Volodymyr Baienko is carrying on too. He has just travelled overnight from western Ukraine, where he was negotiating with potential new signings. Putting a squad together has been no mean feat. “On 7 April we only had five players here,” he says. The first team had been on a training camp in Turkey when the war began and within a fortnight Baienko knew he would have to allow many of the squad, Riabov included, to continue their careers abroad on loan. Others would depart permanently. For a 32-year-old whose playing career ended in June 2021 before he moved to an upstairs role at Kryvbas, this year has presented the steepest of learning curves. “Look around, look at everyone working,” he motions, wearing a sharp white shirt and looking every inch the urbane young executive. Tractors carry gravel to one of several areas of the complex that are being renovated; young players train on a faraway pitch; administrative staff in red shirts scurry around. “When people are working they are reassured that all will be well. “Some people say that because of war you can’t work or plan. But my opinion is that, despite its horrors, the war can be viewed as a chance. While others have hesitated we’re moving forward, because we’ve got ambitious targets. And when Ukraine has won the war, we will be ahead of everyone.” Kryvbas are, to all intents and purposes, a successor to the old Kryvbas club that went bankrupt in 2013 and twice played in the Uefa Cup. They always played to big, baying crowds, by the standard of Ukraine’s regions. In 2020, they were renamed from Hirnik Kryvyi Rih, a short-lived successor, upon an instruction personally made by Zelenskiy. When they played FC Cherkaschnya in their first game under the old name a year ago, Zelenskiy was there to kick the first ball; the club were promoted to the top flight and feel slick, driven, purposeful. The coup of Vernydub’s arrival demonstrates that and so does the fact players such as the Croatian defender Dragan Lovric have been happy to return for the new campaign. Lovric, injured while his teammates were in Turkey, saw bombs fall near Kryvyi Rih in February and had to spend 50 hours driving back home to Split, but knew he would be back at the first opportunity. “Some others from my country have offers from this club but they don’t believe me, they think I’m a little crazy and can’t believe it is virtually normal life here,” he says. “I tell them to come; I think it’s safe, even though nobody knows what’s coming next. “I think people here were surprised to see me return, but we see hope here. Nobody believed we could be in a footballing situation so soon but we want to show the world we are not afraid.” Lovric hopes Kryvbas will be allowed to play home games in Kryvyi Rih; it could happen soon, perhaps as early as next month. Iron will pays no deference to danger, on the football field or elsewhere. “From the very first days of war I knew Ukraine will not lose,” Baienko says. “I witnessed the war in Donetsk when it began in 2014, and I know the Ukrainians are unbreakable people. We are building our mentality, building our history.” High above him, those steel pully wheels keep inching round and round. Life moves on; the mines keep working; against the odds, football is returning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2021/oct/10/kwasi-kwarteng-accused-of-misleading-claims-over-power-cable-project","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-10T17:52:42Z","webTitle":"Kwasi Kwarteng accused of misleading claims over power cable project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/10/kwasi-kwarteng-accused-of-misleading-claims-over-power-cable-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/oct/10/kwasi-kwarteng-accused-of-misleading-claims-over-power-cable-project","fields":{"headline":"Kwasi Kwarteng accused of misleading claims over power cable project","bodyText":"A cabinet minister has been accused of making misleading claims about a £1.2bn cable project linked to a Conservative donor. Almost one in 10 Conservative MPs had taken money from firms linked to Viktor Fedotov, revealed in the Pandora papers to have secretly co-owned a company once accused of participating in a massive corruption scheme. One of those firms included Aquind. Labour highlighted that the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, had said he was supportive of the project in a 2019 letter released under freedom of information, despite Kwarteng saying on Sunday he had never voiced support. A source at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the letter was part of a proposal for cross-border infrastructure schemes to the “EU projects of common interest” (PCI) register, which included Aquind as one of four interconnector projects. The source said the planning decision was separate and quasi-judicial and proposing the project to the PCI did not mean it would be approved. Kwarteng is due to decide whether to approve the project this week. Aquind and other businesses owned by Fedotov have given £700,000 to the Conservatives. Another donor, Alexander Temerko, who is the public face of Aquind, has also publicly donated over £700,000 to the Conservatives. Kwarteng told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that he had “never commented on this specific project” and said he would rely on official advice from civil servants as to whether to approve or reject the application. “I am very much in favour of more interconnectors because they can actually get electricity, sources of power, cheaply from the continent, and in many cases it helps with our decarbonisation because certainly in France a lot of that power is generated through nuclear power,” he said. “So broadly, I’m in favour of interconnectors, I haven’t said anything about this particular project.” In a letter to Temerko in October 2019, Kwarteng, then the minister of state for business, energy and clean growth, said: “We have written to the commission to reiterate our support for a number of projects including, of course, the Aquind project.” Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “Britain cannot afford this chaos and incompetence,” he said. “Kwasi Kwarteng is in a vital position at this moment, safeguarding our energy supplies. He must be straight with people. He must now correct the record and recuse himself from making the decision on [the] project.” Lawyers for Fedotov and Aquind have strongly denied all accusations of fraud and said accusations of corruption aimed at his Russian firm were “completely false”. They said Fedotov did not personally donate to the Tories. There is no suggestion Temerko had any knowledge of the possible origins of Fedotov’s wealth. Three Conservative ministers have already had to recuse themselves from the decision-making process over the Aquind undersea cable because of their links to the company. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has been approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T06:56:45Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Why the nuclear fusion breakthrough doesn’t mean we’re in energy utopia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Why the nuclear fusion breakthrough doesn’t mean we’re in energy utopia","bodyText":"Good morning. You may know nuclear fusion as the power source for Iron Man’s suit, or the basis of the Mr Fusion Home Energy Reactor that powers the, er, flux capacitor in Back to the Future. (If so, please stop reading, this is not a newsletter for nerds.) Yesterday, after the news was initially reported by the Financial Times, Joe Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, confirmed a scientific breakthrough at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that’s a very long way from a superhero exoskeleton or a souped-up DeLorean: for the first time, a fusion reaction has produced more energy than it takes in. Which sounds miles better than a time machine, to be honest. Granholm called it “one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century”. In theory, nuclear fusion reactors could one day be a plentiful source of power without any associated carbon emissions or radioactive waste. Climate crisis solved, and we can all get back to obsessing over Harry and Meghan on Netflix instead. Disappointingly, though, it isn’t anything like that simple. Today’s Grinch-like (but also very interesting!) newsletter, with Dr Michael Bluck, director of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College London, is about the long distance from a remarkable breakthrough to an energy utopia – and why fusion won’t help us get to net zero. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Asylum | Rishi Sunak has insisted he can clear a backlog of nearly 100,000 asylum claims by the end of next year as part of a five-point plan that includes changes to the law that will criminalise and then remove tens of thousands of people who claimed asylum after travelling to the UK by small boats. Strikes | The standoff between UK ministers, bosses and unions over pay showed no sign of reaching resolution on the first day of four weeks of planned industrial action. Rishi Sunak said that the government would not shift its position on pay ahead of another day of disrupted trains on Wednesday. Strep A | The cost of antibiotics used to strep A have risen more than tenfold in the UK in recent weeks, pharmacists have said, with many facing continued difficulties in sourcing supplies. Since mid-September there had been 60 deaths from invasive strep A infections in England, including 13 children. Plastics | Single-use plastic items including cutlery, plates and polystyrene cups are reportedly to be banned in England by the UK government after a consultation. Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, is poised to unveil plans to phase out the items and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. Media | Harry &amp; Meghan, Netflix’s documentary series about Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, racked up more viewing time on the streaming service than any other documentary during its first week, the company said. More than 28m households watched at least part of the series. In depth: ‘Predicting the future is difficult – there are huge hurdles to overcome’ Before we get into the reservations, Dr Michael Bluck wants to be clear about something: the success of the US government’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California in producing a net energy gain from a fusion reaction for the first time is remarkable. “This is a very impressive scientific achievement – it’s a really, really hard thing to do,” he said. Ever since the 1950s, scientists have sought to realise the theoretical promise of the same reaction that occurs in the core of the sun. But the old joke about fusion suggests how difficult that has been: it is always, always 30 years away. “These are very bright people doing amazing things,” Bluck said. “It is a sort of holy grail.” *** What is nuclear fusion? Whereas nuclear fission – the process at work in conventional nuclear power plants – generates energy by splitting heavy atoms like uranium, fusion works the other way round. A thermonuclear reaction fuses light elements like hydrogen into heavier ones like helium, thereby generating more energy than it takes to produce. (Nicola Davis explains this in more detail.) That process is known as “ignition”. Beyond the obvious virtue of a net energy yield, “It’s low carbon, it offers baseload [that is, consistent] energy unlike renewables at the moment, and you don’t have to worry about it melting down or producing nuclear waste to the same extent,” Bluck said. “It’s a great vision.” *** What does this announcement mean? There are two approaches to nuclear fusion: call them doughnuts v lasers. Magnetic confinement is the more common and longstanding method: picture, if you can, a doughnut-shaped machine, with nuclear fuel inside it kept afloat by magnetic fields and heated to incredible temperatures while the reaction takes place. The NIF is one of a smaller number of facilities trying something different: inertial confinement. In the pithy summary of White House science chief, Arati Prabhakar, yesterday: “They shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel [hydrogen plasma] and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers.” The pellet, encased in diamond, sits in a tiny gold cylinder. By hitting it with 192 giant lasers for less than 100 trillionths of a second at more than 3 million celsius, scientists at NIF succeeded in producing 3 megajoules of energy from the 2.05 megajoules it took to make the reaction happen. But as good as that sounds, there are very significant barriers to further progress. “It’s important to say that this is not trying to be a fusion reactor, it’s simply trying to make fusion happen,” said Bluck. “But it lacks almost everything that you need to make a viable reactor. “So, OK, the energy put in has resulted in a larger amount of energy coming out – but the big caveat is that it depends where you draw your perimeter: powering the lasers themselves required way more energy. You have to draw a slightly artificial dotted line around the vessel to say there’s been a gain.” The lasers may emit 2.05 megajoules, but they took about 500 megajoules of energy to power, though defenders of the experiment say that they are not optimally efficient and can be significantly improved. “There’s also the fact that you would need the reaction to happen much more often,” he went on. At the moment, the NIF manages it about ten times a week. “You need it many times a second.” As well as all that, the energy produced in the NIF experiment is in the form of “high speed neutrons, X-rays, gamma rays, radiant heating – none of that is any use to us in and of itself. We’ve got to convert it to stuff that can do work.” That’s very difficult to do without overheating the lasers that make the reaction happen in the first place. “And that programme of work has not even been thought about yet.” Magnetic confinement – the doughnut option – may not have reached the more-out-than-in milestone yet. “But they have been thinking about the real world stuff for many years. They’ve sort of” – you can hear the pain of this simplification in Bluck’s voice as he speaks – “solved the physics issues, and now they’re looking squarely at the engineering issues.” *** So does this news mean nuclear fusion plants are closer? Again, sort of: something with a proven concept is closer than something without one. (Arthur Turrell argues for the importance of that step.) Yesterday, Jennifer Granholm said that Joe Biden had set a target of “a commercial fusion reactor within 10 years”. What’s possible? “Predicting the future is difficult,” allowed Bluck. “But I think I’m being optimistic in saying 50 years for inertial confinement being in practical use – it’s between 50 years and never. There are huge hurdles to overcome.” Kim Budil of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said yesterday that “a few decades of research on the underlying technologies could put us in a position to build a power plant”. Could magnetic confinement work sooner? “I think that’s ambitious, too,” said Bluck. “A demonstrator by 2050 – OK, that could be possible. But that doesn’t mean it’s cost effective to scale up.” *** But can it help reach net zero? Some advocates of fusion would say that Bluck is being too pessimistic – but even in best case scenarios, it is hard to see fusion as a useful part of the changes needed to make net zero a reality. It is cumulative emissions that matter to avoiding the worst impact of the climate crisis, and so even if fusion plants are online at scale by 2050, that is too late. Nonetheless, investors in fusion – like Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel – are persuaded of its revolutionary potential. “There is a degree of utopian zeal,” said Bluck. “You’re not a billionaire worthy of the name unless you’re investing in ambitious devices. What it will mean for getting to net zero by 2050 is realistically nothing. I do worry sometimes that it can suck the air out of other more viable solutions.” *** So is there any point in pursuing fusion power? Absolutely! For one thing, Bluck might be wrong: “There might be that significant step forwards that changes things suddenly. But we should be careful not to overestimate that possibility.” Still, nuclear fusion doesn’t have to be about solving the climate crisis to be worthwhile. The more realistic role for fusion, Thomas Nicholas writes in this 2019 piece for the Conversation, is “as an energy source in a post carbon society”. And so long as it doesn’t become an excuse for ignoring the urgency of the only realistic solution to the climate crisis, a rapid transition to renewables, it’s not like it presents much competition for funding: the total investment in private companies working on fusion ever is about $4.8bn, the Fusion Industry Association says. In comparison, clean energy investment in 2022 totalled $1.4tn, of which $472bn went on renewable power. “None of this means fusion doesn’t have potential,” Bluck said. “But you have to be able to say what you’re going to do in between.” Pondering the holy grail, he added: “I don’t think they ever found it, did they?” What else we’ve been reading Andrew Gregory and Denis Campbell spent 33 hours in an NHS hospital, and their findings unveiled just how deep the crisis in the health service has gotten.

The initiative, called Aukus, was announced jointly by US president Joe Biden and prime ministers Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison, joined virtually by videoconference. They presented it as the next critical step in an old alliance. Morrison said teams from the three countries would draw up a joint plan over the coming 18 months for assembling the new Australian nuclear-powered submarine fleet, which will be built in Adelaide. The project will make Australia only the seventh country in the world to have submarines propelled by nuclear reactors. “This will include an intense examination of what we need to do to exercise our nuclear stewardship responsibilities here in Australia,” the Australian prime minister said, referring to the international treaty obligations on handling nuclear fuel. Morrison added: “But let me be clear. Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability.” None of the three leaders mentioned China, but there was no doubt that the initiative was a response to China’s expansionist drive in the South China Sea and increasing belligerence towards Taiwan. “We need to be able to address both the current strategic environment in the region, and how it may evolve, because the future of each of our nations and indeed the world, depends on a free and open Indo-Pacific enduring and flourishing in the decades ahead,” Biden said. Speaking from London, Johnson said the three countries were “natural allies” even though “we may be separated geographically” and said the alliance would create “a new defence partnership and driving jobs and prosperity”. Turning to the Australian submarine-building plan, Johnson said: “This will be one of the most complex and technically demanding projects in the world, lasting decades and requiring the most advanced technology. A senior US official described the agreement as “a fundamental decision, that binds decisively Australia to the United States and Great Britain for generations”. The agreement spells the end for a $90bn contract Australia signed with the French company Naval Group in 2016. That deal had become bogged down in cost over-runs, delays and design changes. It marks a setback for President Emmanuel Macron. “The world is a jungle,” the former French ambassador to Washington, Gérard Araud, observed on Twitter. “France has just been reminded this bitter truth by the way the US and the UK have stabbed her in the back in Australia. C’est la vie.” Naval Group, which had been contracted to build 12 state-of-the-art attack class submarines, said the new agreement was a “great disappointment”. Australia insists that it has no intention of pursuing nuclear weapons and will abide by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), but critics said the decision could still indirectly spur the proliferation of weapons. Any new nuclear-powered submarines, which are powered with the help of enriched uranium, will take years – possibly over a decade – to develop. But once at sea, the aim is to put Australia’s currently diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China’s navy, the world largest. As well as cooperation on naval technology, the partnership will involve closer alignment of regional policies and actions, and greater integration of the militaries and the defence industries of the three allies. The three also intend to work together on cyberwarfare and on artificial intelligence capabilities. British officials said they hoped the UK would benefit from defence companies supplying technology to Australia. Derby-based Rolls-Royce supplies reactors for Royal Navy submarines, which are eventually decommissioned in the UK when spent. But it is not yet clear how the Australian reactors will be supplied or decommissioned. The formation of Aukus comes at a time of rising tensions, especially over the South China Sea and Taiwan. A new book about the last weeks of the Donald Trump administration said that in late 2020 the US became concerned that China was increasingly convinced it would be the target of a pre-emptive attack. According to Peril, by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley called his Chinese counterpart, Gen Li Zuocheng, twice to reassure him that no attack would happen, and that Milley would personally give a warning if Trump issued such an order. In July, the UK’s new aircraft carrier, the Queen Elizabeth, arrived in the South China Sea, the focal point of US-Chinese tensions, triggering denunciations from Beijing. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, welcomed the deployment at the time but wondered “are there areas that the UK can be more helpful in other parts of the world”. A senior US official suggested that the UK government had pushed for a heightened role in the region. “Great Britain is very focused on the concept of global Britain, and their tilt is about engaging much more deeply with the Indo-Pacific and this is a down payment on that effort,” the official said. Before now, the US has only shared its nuclear propulsion technology with the UK, in an arrangement dating back to 1958, but a senior US official said “This is a unique set of circumstances.” Nuclear power will allow Australian attack submarines to remain at sea for as long as five months and operate more quietly than the country’s existing Collins class diesel powered vessels, allowing them to better evade enemy detection. Some critics of the agreement warn that it sets a dangerous precedent for countries to exploit a loophole in the NPT. The treaty allows non nuclear weapon countries to build nuclear-powered submarines, and to remove the fissile material they need for the submarine reactors from the stockpile monitored by the global watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, opening up the possibility it could be diverted to making weapons. Australia would be the first country to make use of the loophole. “My concern is not that Australia would misuse the nuclear material we give them and use the loophole to build nuclear weapons,” James Acton, co-chair of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. “My concern is it sets a terrible precedent that other countries could abuse. “Iran is the obvious example here. We would go batshit if Iran removed nuclear material from safeguards.” David Cullen of the Nuclear Information Service, said: “This has only happened once before in history, when the US helped the UK develop its first nuclear-powered submarines. “What’s interesting is that the US appears to have thrown the UK a bone by allowing Britain to help design and build the new Australian submarines,” Cullen said. “The question will be how will the Australians be supplied and whether they want to develop their own nuclear capability to enrich uranium fuel.” British sources said the conversations about the nuclear power deal were initiated by the Australians in March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/sep/16/environmental-groups-warn-against-push-for-nuclear-power-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-15T18:00:39Z","webTitle":"Environmental groups warn against push for nuclear power in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/16/environmental-groups-warn-against-push-for-nuclear-power-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/sep/16/environmental-groups-warn-against-push-for-nuclear-power-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Environmental groups warn against push for nuclear power in Australia","bodyText":"Environmental and civil society groups have warned the government nuclear power has “no role” in Australia as crossbench independents urge it to recognise climate change as a health issue. On Monday submissions to the inquiry on nuclear power will close. A diverse group of stakeholders has called on the government to rule out changing the law to allow nuclear energy in Australia. Signatories to the statement include union peak bodies, the Public Health Association of Australia, Uniting and Catholic church organisations, the Smart Energy Council, the Aboriginal-led Australian Nuclear Free Alliance, climate action groups, Greenpeace Australia Pacific and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The anti-nuclear group warned it is “a dangerous distraction from real movement on the pressing energy decisions and climate actions we need”. “If Australia’s energy future was solely a choice between coal and nuclear then a nuclear debate would be needed. But it is not,” they said in a statement. “Our nation has extensive renewable energy options and resources and Australians have shown clear support for increased use of renewable and genuinely clean energy sources.” The energy minister Angus Taylor has so far refused to rule out nuclear energy, leading to a fierce backlash from Labor, which has called on the government to name proposed sites for reactors. Ziggy Switkowski, who headed a 2006 review of nuclear power for the Howard government, has told the inquiry that the technology had no chance of being introduced unless Australia had a coherent energy policy but nevertheless agreed the prohibition should be lifted. Climate crisis confronts Morrison When parliament resumes on Monday Scott Morrison will play host to Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama. Defence, labour mobility, trade, investment, illegal fishing and climate change are all on the agenda for the bilateral meeting. Bainimarama was heavily critical of Morrison at the Pacific Islands forum, saying the Australian PM had insulted and alienated Pacific leaders over his failure to back stronger emissions targets. The climate crisis will also be forced back onto the agenda by the member for Warringah, Zali Steggall, who will bring a motion, seconded by independent MP Helen Haines, calling on the government to decarbonise the economy by 2050 to reduce the health impact and linking it to extreme weather events. Earlier in September the Australian Medical Association formally declared climate change a health emergency; Steggall’s call will be backed by peak health bodies pointing to heat related illnesses, respiratory diseases and hypoallergenic conditions caused by global heating. Australia is in the grip of early-spring fires in New South Wales and Queensland and a drought that could see parts of NSW run out of water as early as November. Steggall said the “unprecedented fires” and the “shocking drought” are “events causing terrible health impacts which are going to get more severe as the world continues to warm”. Labor to push for answers on Liu Labor will continue pursuing the government over its refusal to answer why Liberal MP Gladys Liu failed to declare her affiliation with Chinese government linked associations and whether the prime minister received a security briefing before Liu was preselected. On Sunday Anthony Albanese said Labor expects Liu to make “a statement to the parliament about the contradictions in the statements that she has made”. On Monday Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick will renew his push for a parliamentary inquiry into Australia’s economic and security relationship with China, which was first defeated last Monday by the Coalition and Labor. Patrick told Guardian Australia the controversy over Liu strengthens the case for an inquiry because China is “popping up in the news every day”, with each individual event and flashpoint in the relationship “adding to calls” for a broader inquiry. However, the Centre Alliance senator said Liu is “not directly relevant” to its terms. Patrick is also waiting on advice from the clerk and the president of the Senate, after he referred comments by embattled construction unionist John Setka warning of “consequences” if the Senate passes the Coalition’s union deregistration bill to determine if they could amount to interference with senators’ duties. “I don’t think any member or senator should be threatened in respect of the choice of how they vote – you can criticise, yes, you can argue the merits [of decisions] – but not threaten,” he said. “The Senate should have zero tolerance for it.” Patrick is mulling a range of further improvements to the Ensuring Integrity bill to ensure it only captures the most serious breaches of law rather than triggering deregistration of unions and disqualification of officials for misdemeanours. However, the bill will not be voted on until the October sitting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2021/aug/02/true-stories-spaces-review-short-docs-from-folk-horror-to-a-lebanese-marvel","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-08T12:54:09Z","webTitle":"True Stories: Spaces review – impressive short docs from folk horror to a Lebanese marvel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/02/true-stories-spaces-review-short-docs-from-folk-horror-to-a-lebanese-marvel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/aug/02/true-stories-spaces-review-short-docs-from-folk-horror-to-a-lebanese-marvel","fields":{"headline":"True Stories: Spaces review – impressive short docs from folk horror to a Lebanese marvel","bodyText":"Deeply psychogeographical, this collection of documentary shorts from the streaming platform True Story roams among spaces old and new, and across continents. Personal and public memories are intertwined, creating portraits of how human beings interact with their environments, and vice versa. Paul Heintz’s nocturnal Shānzhài Screens is a meditative study of liminal urban spaces, shot in a Chinese district that specialises in fine-art reproductions. Rectangular frames populate the screen, from flickering apartment windows, hurried video calls, to endless replicas of Van Gogh’s Sunflowers. Authenticity is elusive, and loneliness reigns. Equally intriguing, though somewhat slighter, are Juan Camilo Olmos Feris’s Burning Land and Natalie Cubides-Brady’s Beyond the North Winds: A Post Nuclear Reverie. Shot in northern Colombia, the former is arrestingly cyclic: it begins with the quiet washing of the prize bulls, then plunges straight into the manic energy of their fights, only to end with a stunned silence. Blood is shed, but the violence also binds the community together. In contrast, Cubides-Brady’s short has the feel of a folk horror. After the disappearance of a fictional researcher, the film explores the facts and lore surrounding the Dounreay nuclear power station in Scotland. While the fictional elements prove to be a crutch, the 16mm short is visually mesmerising, viewing the station as a thing of terror and beauty. Nick Jordan’s Concrete Forms of Resistance is the most compelling work in this selection. Centring on Oscar Niemeyer’s abandoned, dilapidated International Fair project in Tripoli, Lebanon, this architectural marvel takes up 8% of the city’s area, and is beautiful yet ominous; its walls bear the bullet marks where Syrian firing squads carried out executions during the country’s decades-long civil conflict.

Representatives of Rosatom, the Russian state corporation involved with both the military and civil use of nuclear energy, have approached the leaders of dozens of African countries in the past two years. The company, which is building a $29bn plant for Egypt, has worked within the framework of agreements made by the Russian government with Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, South Africa and others. Nigeria has a deal with Rosatom for the construction of a nuclear reactor, and less ambitious agreements of cooperation have been signed with Sudan, Ethiopia and the Republic of the Congo. Russia has also set up an offices to promote nuclear energy in Zambia, with well-funded outreach campaigns designed to drum up enthusiasm. Winners of an Africa-wide competition were rewarded with an “educational” trip to Russia that included visits to a nuclear power plant and the “science city” of Obninsk. A typical package offered to a nation interested in nuclear power includes generous loans and long-term supply contracts. Russia has lent Egypt 85% of the construction cost for its nuclear reactor. Rosatom trains local specialists in nuclear physics and energy in several African nations, and runs a scholarship programme in Kenya. Rosatom is among international groups that are exporting light-water technology, which is generally considered among the safest, and is building a $13bn light-water- reactor plant in Bangladesh. But such reactors typically generate more than 1,000 megawatts and very few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the capacity to distribute that amount of power. Rosatom said its reactors for export were not limited to those over 1,000 megawatts capacity. It is a rule of thumb in the industry is that no single facility should provide more than 10% of the total of a country’s power. Only Nigeria and South Africa comply with this recommendation. Nuclear power’s supporters argue that the lengthy construction times of nuclear reactors allow poorer countries to build up their infrastructure. But Névine Schepers, a nuclear expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, said third generation light-water technology was not suited to many African countries. “In terms of economic sense smaller countries that have a long way to go to develop their grids would be better off aiming for something like smaller modular reactors,” she said. Technology for reactors that would require smaller initial capital investment and produce about 300MW is being developed in Russia, China and the US. Rosatom said its RITM-200 series reactor, a small modular reactor, was already installed on Russian ice-breakers. The first land-based nuclear plants with RITM reactors were expected in Russia in 2027, about the same time nuclear infrastructure, such as a regulatory framework, for sub-Saharan African countries could be expected. “Despite the shortcomings of the grid infrastructure in Africa, the latest generation of tried and tested ‘large’ [reactors] are still the clear winners in most regions in terms of the cost of electricity,” Rosatom said in a statement. It added that it sought to provide a “customised solution” for each country. Another concern is that the expensive projects favoured by Rosatom would not benefit Africa’s poorest people. In most countries energy is generated in large, centralised plants and distributed over a national grid – a model that would be reinforced in Africa by nuclear power. “Access to energy is a basic human right and necessary for a dignified life. The majority of those denied this right live in Africa,” said Friends of the Earth. “However, the expansion of profit-driven nuclear energy in Africa would only exacerbate the problem.” The environmental NGO said the answer to Africa’s energy needs lay in “efficient technology that meets the daily needs of people, in the hands of communities and municipalities, and controlled democratically”. Only small-scale and interconnected grids that were democratically managed could deliver energy sovereignty to African people, it added. Rosatom has accused Friends of the Earth and other NGOs of “hardline anti-nuclear activism … based on a position well known for being completely biased and riddled with factual errors”. It said its priority was “sustainable development” and that nuclear energy was “intrinsically immune to any form of political manipulation”. Rosatom said economic benefits of nuclear power amounted to four times the upfront construction costs of plants. Nuclear power brought high-skilled jobs and enabled benefits such as desalination, nuclear medicine and improved agriculture. Experts pointed out that no nuclear projects have been finished and only two contracts – in Egypt and Nigeria – are in place. “These projects are far into the future, but Russia and Rosatom have been actively wooing African states,” said Schepers. “It is very profitable for them [because it] creates jobs at home and a decades-long relationships.” Selling nuclear technology is part of an effort by Russia to build influence, power and trade across Africa, with growing involvement in nations across the continent. The involvement of Russian mercenaries in the Central African Republic and Sudan has attracted significant attention, as has an apparent effort to influence elections in South Africa in May. Many of the African countries that have signed commercial agreements of the kind being pursued by Rosatom are run by movements or individuals who have long-standing relationships with Russia or – more often – the USSR. In early April João Lourenço, the president of Angola, visited Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin and top officials, to discuss arms sales, diamond mining, and gas and oil production. Russia delivered six Su-30K fighter jets to Angola this year and two more are expected in the second part of a billion-dollar deal. Lourenç, who fought in Angola’s war of independence against Portugal, studied in Moscow from 1978 to 1982. Angola was a cold-war battleground and the USSR backed the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, still the ruling party. Rosatom said it had signed no contracts with Angola and it had no presence there. Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, said “reactivating old Soviet networks” had been a clear strategy in Moscow for a couple of years. “The old history can play very positively in some places.” Patrick Smith, editor of Africa Confidential, an investigative newsletter, said: “Russians can’t write big cheques but have mastered the art of making themselves really popular, albeit with some of the worst leaders in Africa. They want the ties too. The more powers they can play off against each other, the better.” The campaign has had setbacks. A deal in South Africa went wrong when Jacob Zuma was removed from power amid corruption allegations last year. A furore surrounding a $75bn contract to build power stations with a combined 9.6 gigawatt output badly damaged the image of Russia. “South Africa was a very good example of where [the Russians] overplayed their hand and misread local sentiments. It has set them back there by years,” said Nataliya Bugayova from the Institute for the Study of War in Washington DC. “Part of their pitch is that they can support a regime with relatively few strings attached. I don’t think the overall wellbeing of the African states is driving the Russian campaign, whether nuclear or anything else.” • This article was amended on 6 and 12 September 2019 to clarify some technical references and add further responses by Rosatom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/feb/18/nationals-nuclear-push-shows-coalition-energy-policy-chaos-labor-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-18T01:47:53Z","webTitle":"Nationals' nuclear push shows Coalition energy policy 'chaos', Labor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/18/nationals-nuclear-push-shows-coalition-energy-policy-chaos-labor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/feb/18/nationals-nuclear-push-shows-coalition-energy-policy-chaos-labor-says","fields":{"headline":"Nationals' nuclear push shows Coalition energy policy 'chaos', Labor says","bodyText":"Anthony Albanese has accused the Coalition of “more chaos” in energy policy, after the Nationals in the Senate announced new amendments to a government bill in favour of nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage. On Thursday the entire Nationals Senate team led by Bridget McKenzie and Matt Canavan announced they would seek amendments to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation bill to allow it to invest in the two technologies. It follows an amendment put forward by former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, attempting to allow the CEFC’s grid reliability fund to invest in new coal-fired power plants, which has already been rejected by the deputy Liberal leader, Josh Frydenberg. Guardian Australia understands the CEFC amendments put forward by Joyce and the Senate Nationals did not go through their party room. By front-running the debate the Nationals backbench could further destabilise the leadership of Michael McCormack, who Joyce has said must sharpen policy differences with the Liberals to ensure electoral success. On Thursday McCormack attempted to ride out the division by offering qualified support for the backbenchers’ ideas. A spokesperson for McCormack said: “It is important that consideration is given to the amendments that have been put forward. “We have always said a diverse energy mix is needed to ensure the lowest possible power prices for Australian families and businesses.” Frydenberg said that McCormack had proven a “very resilient” Nationals leader and the Liberals and Nationals had worked “very effectively” as a coalition. Frydenberg said energy policy was a “complex area” and he had “scars” from his time in the portfolio, in reference to Liberals threatening to cross the floor over Malcolm Turnbull’s national energy guarantee. “There are lots of different views,” he told reporters. “And the great thing about being a member of parliament is you have an opportunity to air your views.” The energy minister, Angus Taylor, is yet to say how he will handle the revolt. Although the Liberals are generally opposed to new coal power plants, the nuclear amendment will likely prove more tricky given many Liberal backbenchers have expressed they want the separate ban on nuclear power in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to be lifted. A survey conducted by the Australian found support for this from 48 Coalition backbenchers, including Liberal MPs Andrew Laming, John Alexander and Gerard Rennick. McKenzie told reporters in Canberra the Senate team want to be “positive contributors” by putting forward the ideas, and pointed to federal and state conference motions in favour of nuclear power and local branch support when asked if they were official policy. McKenzie said the deputy prime minister was “well aware” they would present the amendments, and confirmed they’ve also had discussions with Taylor. McKenzie said “the Nationals party room are – generally – I’m sure if you rung them all [you’d find] they’re very, very keen to make a positive, progressive contribution to the energy and emissions debate”. The Joyce amendment has received support from some Nationals MPs including Llew O’Brien and George Christensen. Albanese said that he is “not a supporter of nuclear energy in Australia because it doesn’t stack up. “There have been numerous reports, occasionally you’ll get opinion pieces … suggesting this, and no serious propositions have ever come forward on it,” he told reporters in Canberra. “What we’re witnessing here is just a part of the chaos that is the Coalition when it comes to energy policy with their 22 energy policies.” He noted the CEFC debate had been adjourned, suggesting the government “can’t debate its own legislation because it can’t agree with itself on what should happen”. “It’s more chaos.” Liberals including Trent Zimmerman, Ted O’Brien and Rowan Ramsey told the Australian although they support lifting the ban on nuclear power they believe the government should not legalise the energy source without bipartisan support. Canavan told reporters it was important “not to prejudge the views of Australians on these issues”. The former resources minister noted that residents of Kimba in South Australia had voted 60% in favour of a nuclear waste dump in a plebiscite. “If we can get to that level of support for a waste facility, I don’t think it’s beyond us to – in other communities … find support.” Canavan said that the population of Gladstone and its local member, Ken O’Dowd, were in favour of nuclear power as a means to sustain local manufacturing. “I know some Australians won’t support it – and that’s fine too.” The Australian Conservation Foundation warned parliament against changing the investment rules of the CEFC ACF campaigner, Dave Sweeney, said “talking up nuclear and new coal-fired power plants is a dangerous distraction from facing up to Australia’s very real energy challenges and choices”. “There is nothing clean about the fuel behind the Fukushima and Chernobyl disasters, which produces waste that remains radioactive for tens of thousands of years,” he said. “There is no such thing as clean coal and the CEFC wouldn’t be considered a trusted investment partner if it was expected to invest in this outdated, dirty technology.” “No country in the world is choosing to set up a nuclear industry from scratch. When it comes to climate action, nuclear power is a dead end.” Experts including Ziggy Switkowski have warned nuclear power is not realistic in Australia for at least a decade, and that neither large scale nor small modular reactors are likely to deliver a commercial return."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/mar/21/universities-must-reject-fossil-fuel-cash-for-climate-research-say-academics","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-21T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"Universities must reject fossil fuel cash for climate research, say academics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/21/universities-must-reject-fossil-fuel-cash-for-climate-research-say-academics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/mar/21/universities-must-reject-fossil-fuel-cash-for-climate-research-say-academics","fields":{"headline":"Universities must reject fossil fuel cash for climate research, say academics","bodyText":"Universities must stop accepting funding from fossil fuel companies to conduct climate research, even if the research is aimed at developing green and low-carbon technology, an influential group of distinguished academics has said. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, the Nasa data scientist Peter Kalmus, and prominent US climate scientist Michael Mann are among close to 500 academics from the US and the UK who have written an open letter addressed to all university leaders in the two countries, calling on them to reject all funding from fossil fuel companies. Accepting money from fossil fuel companies represented “an inherent conflict of interest” and could “taint” essential research and “compromise” academic freedom, they wrote. For the companies, it was a chance to “greenwash” their reputations and skew the findings of research in a way favourable to them. The letter draws a comparison to the tobacco industry and its disinformation campaigns, noting that numerous public heath and research institutions reject tobacco funding for these reasons and calling on fossil fuel cash to be treated similarly. “Universities and the research they produce are vital to delivering a rapid, just transition away from fossil fuels. However, such efforts are undermined by fossil fuel industry funding. Academics should not be forced to choose between researching climate solutions and inadvertently aiding corporate greenwashing,” the signatories wrote. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, told the Guardian: “This sort of funding has been used to compromise leading academic institutions. It’s a two-for for polluters: they purchase the imprimatur of these institutions and their presumed authority and objectivity, while funding research that often translates into advocacy for false solutions and ‘kick the can down the road’ prescriptions like massive carbon capture, which is unproven at scale, and geoengineering, which is downright dangerous. That is entirely the wrong path forward.” Genevieve Guenther, founder and director of the End Climate Silence campaign, and an affiliate at the New School university in New York, said: “Funding research enables oil and gas companies to ground their promotional statements in enough truth to give substance to the green shadows in which they hide their most polluting and deadly activities. We must remove fossil-energy interests from our institutions so that our children can have a chance at a liveable future.” Universities have been under pressure from their students and some academics for several years to divest their investments, such as pension funds and endowments, away from fossil fuels, and many have done so. However, this is the first major call from senior academics for them to go further and cut all research ties with fossil fuel companies. There is no clear estimate for how much money universities accept from fossil fuel companies, as most do not publish their sources. An investigation for the Observer last year found UK universities alone had taken at least £89m from oil companies in the previous four years. Some scientists disagree with the letter. James Hansen, former chief scientist at Nasa and one of the first scientists to warn governments of the impending climate crisis, told the Guardian: “It’s the wrong focus, causing young people to waste their energy on unproductive activities, while they actually have the potential to lead a solution.” Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said it was reasonable for universities to accept funding from fossil fuel companies if those businesses showed genuine commitment to transforming themselves. “Fossil fuel companies that are genuinely committed to the transition [to a low-carbon economy], including net zero emissions, can and should receive help from university researchers, particularly with the development of technologies for carbon capture and storage, renewables and emissions reductions. However, universities should be careful about accepting funding directly or indirectly from oil, gas and coal companies that are not genuinely committed to the clean energy transition and which are attempting to greenwash their reputations.” A spokesperson for Imperial College London, which the Observer found last year had accepted £54m from oil companies since 2017, said: “Decarbonisation is our top priority when working with energy companies. This goal requires a radical shift in industrial systems, technologies and business models in the energy sector. We are using our influence and expertise to accelerate this transition and actively engage with energy companies to push them to meet the Paris Agreement targets. We will monitor progress and only continue to work with companies who demonstrate commitment and credible action to achieving these targets.” Some academics argue that fossil fuel funding is needed to develop the technologies necessary for a low-carbon economy, and that if western universities reject such funding it will be accepted in other countries around the world. Guenther disagreed: “It’s a myth that fossil-energy companies are spending large sums to aid the green transition. According to the IEA’s 2021 World Energy Investment report, a mere 1% of fossil-energy companies’ capital expenditure is devoted to research, development or deployment of technologies that either abate or do not produce greenhouse gas emissions.” At the end of this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish the third part of its comprehensive review of climate science, examining the potential ways of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This will include technology such as renewable energy and nuclear power, and novel ideas such as sucking carbon dioxide out of the air. The report will throw the spotlight on the potential technological solutions to the climate crisis, which will require tens or hundreds of billions of pounds in funding to be brought to market and deployed widely around the world. Jason Hickel, an economic anthropologist who is signatory to the letter, said the funding should come from governments. “The US and UK are among the richest countries on Earth, and their governments enjoy total monetary sovereignty. They have the capacity to finance the necessary research many times over, at the touch of a button. Most of the major innovations and public projects that have changed history over the past century have relied on public funding for research,” said Hickel, who is professor of environmental science at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a fellow of the LSE. The letter did not specify whether companies with interests in fossil fuels amid a broader portfolio should be included in the ban. Ilana Cohen, a Harvard student who led the organisation of the letter, said it was directed at the top 200 fossil fuel companies. Cohen said the organisers had confined the call to US and UK universities for now as these are where many fossil fuel companies are concentrating their funding, but that it could be widened in future to a global effort."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/mar/04/20-of-the-best-films-to-help-understand-whats-happening-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T16:19:37Z","webTitle":"20 of the best films to help understand what’s happening in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/04/20-of-the-best-films-to-help-understand-whats-happening-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/mar/04/20-of-the-best-films-to-help-understand-whats-happening-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"20 of the best films to help understand what’s happening in Ukraine","bodyText":"1. Oxygen Starvation (1992) One of the first non-state funded films of an independent Ukraine, this study of a Ukrainian soldier dealing with the traditional abuse handed out to new recruits in the Soviet army is based on the real-life experiences of director Andrii Donchyk and writer Yurii Andrukhovych. 2. Chernobyl: Chronicles of the Difficult Weeks (1987) A documentary that started shooting only days after the catastrophic nuclear power plant explosion. Director Volodymyr Shevchenko died of radiation poisoning a month after its release. 3. Tomorrow Is a Holiday (1987) Shot at the start of the “perestroika” era, this exposed the difficulties of everyday life at a poultry processing factory. Very different from the then standard propaganda film, this depicted a deep social crisis in Soviet society. 4. The Wall (1988) Documentary about the destruction of the Wall of Memory, the monumental avant-garde reliefs at Kyiv crematorium that artists Ada Rybachuk and Volodymyr Melnychenko had been working on since 1968, after local authorities concreted them over in 1982. Restoration of the artwork finally began in August 2021. 5. Levels of Democracy (1992) A montage of rough video telling the story of the mass demonstrations that took place in Kyiv during the last years of perestroika and the first year of independence in 1991 – in particular, the congress of the People’s Movement of Ukraine. 6. Varta1, Lviv, Ukraine (2015) Documentary exploring the activities of the Automaidan movement, a group of activist drivers who used the digital radio channel Varta 1 to briefly patrol the streets of Lviv after the police withdrew in response to the angry protests of February 2014. 7. Maidan (2014) Sergei Loznitsa’s study of the Revolution of Dignity in Kyiv in 2013 and 2014 that recorded various stages of the protest on a fixed camera. The wide international reach of Loznitsa’s unbiased view of chaotic historical events meant it became one of Euromaidan’s most important documents. 8. The Black Book of Maidan (2014) A formidable piece of collaborative documentary film-making by a group of second-year students recreating the taut emotional challenges of the experience of directly participating in a revolution. 9. Euromaidan: The Rough Cut (2014) Produced by the artistic collective #BABYLON’13, a collection of footage from the best Ukrainian directors of the new generation asking the audience – in the makers’ words – to “live through three months of protest” together with them. 10. All Things Ablaze (2014) A ground-level study of the revolutionary events of Maidan co-directed by Oleksandr Techinskyi, Aleksey Solodunov and Dmitry Stoykov showing the multi-faceted nature of the revolution, and of Ukrainian society itself. 11. Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom (2015) Probably the best known of all Maidan documentaries, an Oscar-nominated film directed by Israeli-American Evgeny Afineevsky that presents a clear narrative of a complex chain of events. It’s been on Netflix since 2015 and has become one of the most widely watched accounts of recent Ukrainian history. 12. The Earth Is Blue as an Orange (2020) Successful documentary about a Donbas family – single mother Hanna and her four children – who hide their war-zone fear behind their passion for playing music and making movies about themselves. A quote from a poem by Paul Éluard forms the film’s title, a perfect metaphor for the surreal world between war and peace. 13. War Note (2020) A diary film of personal videos of Ukrainian soldiers who have been defending Donbas since 2014 shows the war in unprecedented close-up. The captions indicate that some of the diarists did not survive the conflict. 14. The Cacophony of Donbas (2018) With a title referring to Dziga Vertov’s 1931 Soviet-worker propaganda film Enthusiasm: The Symphony of Donbas, this archive-montage film by Ihor Minaiev traces the industrial myth of the Donbas from Soviet times through the chaotic 1990s and beyond. Helpful for understanding the background of the occupation of the Donetsk region in 2014 by the Putin regime. 15. Stronger Than Arms (2019) Another resistance-cinema product of the #BABYLON’13 collective about the Ukrainian revolution and subsequent war in eastern Ukraine. The title is derived from a phrase one of the film-makers heard: “Your cameras are stronger than arms.” 16. No Obvious Signs (2018) The title alludes to a phrase doctors use to describe soldiers who need help with mental traumas. A film about a female military officer who is undergoing a long rehabilitation as she tries to come to terms with the horrors of war, this is an expansion of the human rights project Invisible Battalion, which campaigns for gender equality in the Ukrainian military. 17. Atlantis (2019) Acclaimed film set in 2025 – a year after Ukraine’s “victory” in the war with Russia – about a former army scout who is part of a humanitarian mission that looks for and exhumes the bodies of dead soldiers. 18. Donbas (2018) From prominent director Sergei Loznitsa, a kaleidoscope of stories about the conflict in Donbas: a producer for a propaganda TV channel, militiamen searching checkpoints, field commanders posing for journalists, a bandit wedding. Inspired by YouTube videos from Donetsk and Luhansk, this is a study of war and post-truth. 19. Cyborgs: Heroes Never Die (2017) One of Ukraine’s highest grossing films tells the story of a Ukrainian battalion’s two-week mission at Donetsk airport in 2014 while it was under attack from pro-Russian militants. Along with the fighting, the soldiers try to comprehend numerous philosophical questions about the nature of war, the enemy and their own identity as Ukrainians. 20. Homeward (2019) Beautifully resonant drama that reflects on the relations between Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians. One of Mustafa’s son dies in the war in eastern Ukraine and, together with his other son, takes the body to Crimea for burial. It is about the alienation felt when people are excluded from society, from each other and from a whole nation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/19/minister-hints-gas-boilers-ban-market-should-drive-change-england-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-19T08:38:41Z","webTitle":"Minister hints at gas boilers ban but says market should drive change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/minister-hints-gas-boilers-ban-market-should-drive-change-england-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/19/minister-hints-gas-boilers-ban-market-should-drive-change-england-wales","fields":{"headline":"Minister hints at gas boilers ban but says market should drive change","bodyText":"Gas boilers could be banned in future but the government believes the market should drive changes to home heating systems, the cabinet minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan has said, amid criticism of the limited grants system for heat pumps. Ministers had been under pressure to set a date to ban the installation of new gas boilers in existing homes, but on Tuesday announced the installation of low-carbon heat pumps would be encouraged with a grant system of £5,000 for up to 90,000 homes in England and Wales. The grant would make the installation a similar cost to a new gas boiler, but green campaigners have said the move would expand the greener system to a minuscule proportion of homes and does not set a date for a full ban. Speaking on Tuesday as the government launched its heat and buildings strategy, one of a number of announcements made ahead of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, Trevelyan hinted the installation of new gas boilers would be banned in the future. “In the short term, yes, of course this is a voluntary scheme … There will be a point at which that changes but, yes, for now that’s the case,” she told Sky News. The international trade secretary said she believed the market would eventually change to make the greener switch more affordable. “At the moment we’re encouraging the market to drive those changes,” she told the BBC. “What we’re seeing already is energy companies already moving into, not only providing us with energy, but encouraging their customers to shift to heat pumps and looking to find ways to help do that – your energy provider will be part of that solution. “In 10 years’ time, we want to look back and think we’ve actually made a difference as individuals, because that’s as important as the big chunky things like offshore wind turbines and nuclear power stations.” The full strategy is expected to be published on Tuesday and will include measures totalling £3.9bn to decarbonise buildings and how they are heated, with a confirmed 2035 target for all new heating systems in UK homes to be energy efficient. Caroline Jones of Greenpeace UK said efforts to decarbonise housing were being hampered by unambitious policies and inadequate funding. She said: “More money must be provided to rapidly increase the number of homeowners switching to heat pumps over the next few years, with full costs covered for families on low incomes. “A clearer signal would have been a phase-out of new boilers before 2035. And all of this must be delivered with a fully funded, nationwide programme to insulate our homes at a scale and speed that the government hasn’t fully grasped.” Under the plans, which the minister said would support up to 240,000 jobs by 2035, the £5,000 grants will be available from April next year, and should eliminate any price differential for heat pumps or similar systems. The plan suggests as the market expands, the price for such systems should drop by between a quarter and a half by 2025. The wider £3.9bn of funding for greening homes will be targeted through a series of existing schemes, with others aimed at public buildings. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said it was a “meagre, unambitious and wholly inadequate response”. He added: “Families up and down the country desperately needed Labour’s 10-year plan investing £6bn a year for home insulation and zero carbon heating to cut bills by £400 per year, improve our energy security, create jobs and reduce carbon emissions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/20/ukraine-crisis-claims-mariupol-women-and-children-forcibly-sent-to-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-20T05:36:23Z","webTitle":"Ukraine crisis: claims Mariupol women and children forcibly sent to Russia ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/ukraine-crisis-claims-mariupol-women-and-children-forcibly-sent-to-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/20/ukraine-crisis-claims-mariupol-women-and-children-forcibly-sent-to-russia","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine crisis: claims Mariupol women and children forcibly sent to Russia ","bodyText":"Authorities in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol have said Russian troops have forcibly deported several thousand residents to Russia, as reports emerged that Russian forces bombed an art school in the city where 400 people were taking shelter. “Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents were deported on to the Russian territory,” the city council said in a statement on its Telegram channel late on Saturday. “The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhniy district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing.” The claims have not been independently verified, but the council’s statement is one of several reports about Mariupol residents being taken to Russia, where authorities have referred to “refugees” arriving from the strategic port. In a statement posted Sunday on the Telegram channels of Mariupol council and the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada, the council said women, children and elderly people were inside and “are still under the rubble” of the destroyed G12 art school in Mariupol’s Left Bank district. The number of casualties was unclear. The Guardian has not independently verified the claim of the bombing. The message accused the Russians of committing war crimes, echoing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s earlier video address, in which he said of the attacks on Mariupol: “To do this to a peaceful city ... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come.” Intense street fighting in the city has hampered attempts to free hundreds of survivors trapped for days inside a bombed theatre as Ukrainian forces held out against a larger Russian force inside the strategically important southern port city. Jakob Kern, the World Food Programme’s emergency coordinator, described Russia’s tactic of preventing emergency food supplies to Mariupol as “unacceptable in the 21st century”. Ukrainian MP Dmytro Gurin described conditions in the city as “medieval”. Across Ukraine, evacuations from cities continued on Saturday along eight of 10 humanitarian corridors, said the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. A total of 6,623 people were evacuated, including 4,128 from Mariupol, the scene of some of the war’s worst suffering. Meanwhile, China has responded angrily to mounting western pressure to condemn the invasion, saying it stands on the right side of history over the crisis and is in line with the stances of most countries. “China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicious against China,” the foreign minister, Wang Yi, said on Saturday evening. China has refused to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine or call it an invasion, although it has expressed concern about the crisis. Beijing has also opposed economic sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, describing them as unilateral and not authorised by the UN security council. Wang’s comments came after the US president, Joe Biden, warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday of “consequences” if Beijing gave material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We have always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war,” Wang said, reiterating that China will make independent judgments. “China’s position is objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China’s claims are on the right side of history.” An official in Mariupol accused Russian forces of taking thousands of Ukrainians across the border into Russia, adding he feared they could be used as forced labour, the New York Times reported. Pyotr Andryushchenko, an assistant to the city’s mayor, said Russian forces had taken “between 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents forcibly across the border to Taganrog” – a city in south-western Russia – the newspaper said. The residents had been taken without their passports, Andryushchenko said. A Ukrainian police officer in Mariupol warned that it had been “wiped off the face of the earth”, and pleaded with the US and France to supply the country with a modern air defence system. In a video appeal from a street strewn with rubble, Michail Vershnin publicly reminded Biden and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that they had promised assistance “but what we have received is not quite it”, and urged them to save the civilian population. “Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it has been wiped off the face of the earth,” Vershnin said, speaking in Russian in the video filmed on Friday that has been authenticated by the Associated Press. He then appealed directly to the US and French leaders. “You have promised that there will be help, give us that help. Biden, Macron, you are great leaders. Be them to the end.” Pressure on China to abandon its neutral stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine increased after the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, urged leaders in Beijing to get off the fence and join global condemnation of the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin. “As time goes on and as the number of Russian atrocities mounts up, I think it becomes steadily more difficult and politically embarrassing for people either actively or passively to condone Putin’s invasion,” Johnson said. “There are considerable dilemmas now for people who thought they could sit this one out, who thought they could sit on the fence. And, yes, I think that in Beijing you are starting to see some second thoughts.” China, however, has shown no sign of altering its stance. On Saturday its vice foreign minister, Le Yucheng, described western sanctions against Russia as increasingly “outrageous”. Le also acknowledged Moscow’s position on Nato, saying the alliance should not further expand eastwards and force a nuclear power like Russia “into a corner”. “The sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous,” Le said at security forum in Beijing, adding that Russian citizens were being deprived of overseas assets “for no reason”. “History has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems. Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system ... and worsen the global economy.” The fall of Mariupol, a key connection to the Black Sea, would mark a major advance for the Russians, who are largely bogged down outside major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since the second world war. Russian media have offered a very different explanation for the reported removal of Mariupol residents. The Tass news agency reported on Saturday that 13 buses were moving to Russia, carrying more than 350 people, about 50 of whom were to be sent by rail to the Yaroslavl region and the rest to temporary transition centres in Taganrog, a port city in Russia’s Rostov region. RIA Novosti agency, citing emergency services, reported last week that nearly 300,000 people, including some 60,000 children, had arrived in Russia from the Luhansk and Donbas regions, including from Mariupol, in recent weeks. Russia’s defence ministry said this month that more than 2.6 million people in Ukraine have asked to be evacuated – a claim that has not been independently verified."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jan/23/eu-official-vows-rapid-sanctions-if-russia-launches-ukraine-military-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-23T19:24:03Z","webTitle":"Blinken says Nato united on Ukraine as EU ministers prepare to meet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/eu-official-vows-rapid-sanctions-if-russia-launches-ukraine-military-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/23/eu-official-vows-rapid-sanctions-if-russia-launches-ukraine-military-attack","fields":{"headline":"Blinken says Nato united on Ukraine as EU ministers prepare to meet","bodyText":"The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said he has no doubts Germany is maintaining a united front with Nato on the Ukraine crisis, on the eve of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels where they are expected to issue a further warning to Moscow over its buildup of 100,000 troops and heavy weapons along the Ukrainian border. There were alarm bells in Kyiv over the weekend after Germany’s navy chief, Kay-Achim Schönbach, said Vladimir Putin deserved respect and also suggested it was “nonsense” to think Russia was ready to pour troops into Ukraine. Schönbach resigned on Saturday but his remarks rattled Nato, and Blinken did a round of talkshow appearances in an attempt to dampen concerns. “I can tell you that the Germans very much share our concerns and are resolute and being determined to respond – and to respond swiftly, effectively and in a united way,” Blinken told NBC. I have no doubts about that.” Blinken will brief the EU ministers by video link on Monday on his talks last week with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva. EU sources are pessimistic about the Kremlin climbing down from maximalist demands that would in effect give Russia a sphere of influence in eastern Europe. The ministers meeting on Monday, however, will not discuss specific sanctions. Instead they are expected to echo earlier EU warnings of “massive consequences” without going into specifics. “If such a very serious development [Russian troops crossing the border] happens, the reaction will be very quick, the reaction will be extremely clear. And again it will be a question of days … not a question of weeks,” a senior EU official said. The official predicted there would be an “even more remarkable” unity among the bloc’s 27 countries than in 2014 when sweeping economic sanctions against Russia were adopted. “Yes, there are different sensitivities, but all member states have an acute sense of what is the European Union interest, which is at the end of the day a version of their national interest,” the official said. Behind the repeated assertions of unity, it is no secret that western allies are divided. Joe Biden’s comments that Nato allies would be “having to fight about what to do and not do” in the event of a “minor incursion” of Ukraine – comments that the White House subsequently rowed back on – were seen in Brussels as undiplomatic rather than untrue. In the EU, where sanctions have to be agreed by unanimity, differences are emerging. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has expressed doubts about cutting off Russian banks from the Swift global payments system, one option under discussion. Poland and the Baltic states, however, think it is a mistake to take anything off the table. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused Germany over the weekend of not showing enough support for his country. Writing on Twitter, he expressed disappointment about Germany’s apparent hesitations on Swift, its refusal to supply offensive weapons, as well as the comments from Schönbach. Writing before Schönbach’s resignation was reported, Kuleba said: “German partners must stop such words and actions to undermine unity and encourage Vladimir Putin to a new attack on Ukraine.” Kuleba’s criticism of Germany’s coalition government is shared by many in the European parliament, where a large majority last month called for sanctions against Russia to encompass exclusion from Swift, which is used in more than 200 countries and territories. “We should not be limiting the scope of various actions and thereby making it easier for Putin to have options for the violent alternative,” said Michael Gahler, a German MEP from the centre-right Christian Democratic Union party, which is not in power. Gahler, the parliament’s standing rapporteur on Ukraine, said it was “unfortunate” that Germany was not delivering offensive weapons to Ukraine. Germany’s coalition government refuses to export weapons to conflict zones, in line with longstanding policy rooted in the country’s history. In the event of war, Gahler also said the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to Germany should not come into operation. The MEP is urging EU officials to look into boosting gas supplies from southern pipelines and liquefied natural gas from the US. But it is not just Germany that has raised questions about EU unity. Alarm bells were set off when it was announced last week that Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orbán, would meet Putin on 1 February to discuss a planned Russian-built nuclear power station in Hungary, the Sputnik vaccine and Hungary’s gas supply contracts. While potential sanctions against Russia are a closely guarded secret, it is clear there is a sliding scale of options, with the harshest measures being considered for a full-scale attack. Diplomats say a large-scale invasion is likely to make an EU decision simpler, as it would bring the bloc together in a large-scale response, just as the downing of flight MH17 in July 2014 bolstered unity on sweeping economic sanctions. The EU would face a more complex choice if Russian pursues other forms of aggression. Countries will also weigh how sanctions would affect their economic interests. “Individual member states are more generous with the sanctions that hurt them less than others,” a senior diplomat said. “That is the name of the game a little bit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jan/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-no-rational-reason-west-hasnt-sent-tanks-says-zelenskiy-as-allies-offer-armoured-vehicles-instead","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T21:07:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin’s ceasefire proposal shows he is ‘trying to find oxygen’, says Biden – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-no-rational-reason-west-hasnt-sent-tanks-says-zelenskiy-as-allies-offer-armoured-vehicles-instead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jan/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-no-rational-reason-west-hasnt-sent-tanks-says-zelenskiy-as-allies-offer-armoured-vehicles-instead","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin’s ceasefire proposal shows he is ‘trying to find oxygen’, says Biden – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it for Thursday’s Ukraine blog. Here is what happened today: Germany will join the US in supplying an additional Patriot air defence battery to Ukraine, the White House has announced, after the German chancellor Olaf Scholz and US president Joe Biden spoke by phone. The German and US leaders “expressed their common determination to continue to provide the necessary financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine for as long as needed”, the White House said in a statement. German economy minister Robert Habeck commented on Germany providing weapons to Ukraine, calling the aid a “good decision” during a Thursday briefing. Habeck’s department has to greenlight weapons exports. The US state department expressed skepticism over Putin’s announced ceasefire, describing it as “cynical” given Moscow’s New Year’s Day attack on Ukraine and adding that the US has “little faith” in the announcement’s intentions. Vladimir Putin has instructed his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a 36-hour ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine from Friday noon to midnight 7 January, the Kremlin said. Russian troops must hold fire for 36 hours in order to allow people “in the areas of hostilities” to mark Orthodox Christmas, the Russian leader said. Putin’s announcement came hours after the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, called for a ceasefire and a Christmas truce in Ukraine. In a statement, Kirill said he appealed to “all parties involved in the internecine conflict” for the ceasefire, so that “Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of the Nativity of Christ”. Thank you for reading! More coverage on the Russia-Ukraine war coming tomorrow. The German economy minister commented on Germany providing weapons to Ukraine, calling the aid a “good decision”. “This is a good decision”, said Robert Habeck, whose department has to greenlight weapons exports, during a briefing. “Since the start of the war we have continuously expanded our support in coordination with our partners. It is only logical that we also take this step. Ukraine has the right to defend itself against the Russian attack, and we have the duty to help her”. The UN Secretary-General disbanded a fact-finding mission into a July attack in the Ukrainian city of Olenivka, reported Reuters. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres disbanded the mission into the attack that killed prisoners being held captive by Moscow-backed separatists as the UN mission cannot deploy to the site, announced a UN spokesman on Thursday. Russia and Ukraine both requested an investigation into the attack, which Guterres had announced in August. The US state department has commented on Putin’s announced ceasefire, describing it as “cynical” and adding that the US has “little faith” in the announcement’s intentions. During a press briefing on Thursday, US state department spokesperson Ned Price spoke about the 36-hour ceasefire Russia announced in light of Orthodox Christmas. Price called the ceasefire cynical given Moscow’s recent attacks on Ukraine on New Year’s Day. Price added that a temporary pause of fighting from Moscow could be used to “refit, to regroup, and ultimately to re-attack.” From Washington Post reporter John Hudson: Two US officials provided details on Thursday as to what will be included in a US weapons package for Ukraine, reported Reuters. According to the unnamed officials, the weapons package will include 50 Bradley fighting vehicles, with the package expected to be worth approximately $2.8b. On Thursday, Biden and German chancellor Scholz announced that the US and Germany will provide Ukraine with Bradley fighting vehicles, in addition to other weaponry. Ukraine’s foreign minister of affairs posted on Twitter that Russia’s ceasefire agreement “can not and should not be taken seriously.” Shortly following an announcement from Putin that Russia would be entering into a 36-hour ceasefire agreement along the entire line of contact in Ukraine to mark Orthodox Christmas, foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned the announcement as skeptical. From Kuleba’s twitter: Germany will join the US in supplying an additional Patriot air defence battery to Ukraine, the White House has announced, after the German chancellor Olaf Scholz and US president Joe Biden spoke by phone. The German and US leaders “expressed their common determination to continue to provide the necessary financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine for as long as needed”, the White House said in a statement. The statement goes on to say: The United States intends to supply Ukraine with Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, and Germany intends to provide Ukraine with Marder Infantry Fighting Vehicles. Both countries plan to train Ukrainian forces on the respective systems. President Biden and Chancellor Scholz also discussed further supporting Ukraine’s “urgent requirement for air defence capabilities”, it said. In late December, the United States announced its donation of a Patriot air defence missile battery to Ukraine. Germany will join the United States in supplying an additional Patriot air defence battery to Ukraine. It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has instructed his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a 36-hour ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine from Friday noon to midnight 7 January, the Kremlin said. Russian troops must hold fire for 36 hours in order to allow people “in the areas of hostilities” to mark Orthodox Christmas, the Russian leader said. Putin’s announcement came hours after the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, called for a ceasefire and a Christmas truce in Ukraine. In a statement, Kirill said he appealed to “all parties involved in the internecine conflict” for the ceasefire, so that “Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of the Nativity of Christ”. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to Ukraine’s president, has dismissed Vladimir Putin’s calls for a temporary ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas. He said a “temporary truce” would be possible only when Russia leaves territory it is occupying in Ukraine. Other Ukrainian politicians also pointed out that Russia’s offer for a ceasefire came just days after it launched a wave of strikes on the country, including the capital Kyiv, as Ukrainians celebrated the new year. President Joe Biden has said Vladimir Putin is “trying to find some oxygen” by floating a 36-hour ceasefire from tomorrow noon to mark Orthodox Christmas. “I’m reluctant to respond (to) anything Putin says,” Biden told reporters. “I found it interesting. He was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches on the 25th and New Year. Prior to the ceasefire announcement, Putin told his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, that Russia was open to dialogue over Ukraine but that Kyiv would have to accept the “new territorial realities”, according to a readout of the call between the two leaders by the Kremlin. Putin also “acknowledged the destructive role of the West, pumping weapons into Kyiv, providing information and guidance,” the Kremlin said. The pair also discussed a number of energy issues, including the creation of a gas hub in Turkey and the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, it added. Erdoğan told Putin during the call on Thursday that peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a “vision for a fair solution”, the Turkish presidency said in its readout of the call. The two leaders discussed energy and the Black Sea grain corridor, and that Erdoğan told Putin concrete steps needed to be taken to clear Kurdish militants from the Syrian border region, it added. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also spoke with Turkey’s leader about “security cooperation” as well as the exchange of prisoners of war and the Black Sea Grain initiative, Zelenskiy said. He added that he was “glad to hear that Turkey is ready to participate in the implementation” of his “peace formula”, which he first proposed in November. A couple and their 12-year-old son were killed today when a Russian shell hit a residential building in the town of Beryslav in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, a Ukrainian official has said. The family was preparing to celebrate the Orthodox Christian Christmas when the attack took place, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an aide to the Ukrainian president. Ukraine’s gross domestic product fell by 30.4% in 2022 – the largest annual fall in over 30 years – because of the war with Russia, the economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. Svyrydenko said in a statement that Ukraine’s economy had suffered its largest losses since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 although the fall was less than initially expected. Ukraine’s GDP had grown by 3.4% in 2021. The provision of tanks may well be part of “the next phase” of weapons transfers to Ukraine, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said following a meeting with Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, on Thursday. Speaking at a joint press conference with Baerbock, Cleverly said tanks may well be part of the next phase of weapons transfers, saying the position is kept under constant review. Germany will always adjust its arms deliveries to Ukraine based on “the needs on the battlefield”, vice-chancellor Robert Habeck said. Habeck’s remarks came after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told Volodymyr Zelenskiy his government would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help its war effort, a French official said on Wednesday after a phone call between them. The US is looking at ways to target Iranian drone production through sanctions and export controls, the White House said. Washington previously imposed sanctions on companies and people it accused of producing or transferring Iranian drones that Russia has used against Ukraine. The first inmates recruited by the private military group Wagner have received their promised pardons after fighting for six months in Ukraine, Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin told journalists on Thursday. Addressing the former prisoners, Prigozhin instructed them not to end up back in jail. “The police will treat you with respect now… Don’t drink a lot, don’t use drugs, and don’t rape women, only [have sex] for love or money,” he said, a statement which was met with laughter. A wide-ranging public discussion is taking place in Ukraine over what to do with seven street murals painted in November by the British artist Banksy on a series of destroyed buildings in and around Kyiv. The conversation has grown urgent after thieves last month made off with one artwork from the town of Hostomel, about 15 miles (25km) outside the capital. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, would welcome any ceasefire in Ukraine during Orthodox Christmas, a spokesperson for the organisation said. The UN spokesperson acknowledged that any temporary truce would not replace a just peace in line with the UN Charter and international law. President Joe Biden has said Vladimir Putin is “trying to find some oxygen” by floating a 36-hour ceasefire from tomorrow noon to mark Orthodox Christmas. Asked about the Russian president’s order, Biden told reporters: I’m reluctant to respond (to) anything Putin says. I found it interesting. He was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches on the 25th and New Year. He added: I think he’s trying to find some oxygen. The provision of tanks may well be part of “the next phase” of weapons transfers to Ukraine, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said following a meeting with Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, on Thursday. Baerbock insisted Germany was willing to provide heavy weapons that Ukraine needs to liberate its occupied territories, and will work in conjunction with Nato partners to achieve this. She was speaking after France and the US said they are willing to provide forms of tank weapons to Ukraine, placing pressure on the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to abandon his months-long reluctance to provide either Leopard tanks or Marder light infantry. Speaking at a joint press conference with Baerbock, Cleverly said tanks may well be part of the next phase of weapons transfers, saying the position is kept under constant review. In Germany, politicians from the FDP and the Greens were quick to welcome the French president Emmanuel Macron’s announcement that he would deliver AMX-10RC armed reconnaissance tanks to Ukraine. Baerbock, a private advocate of Germany providing more heavy weaponry, did not seek an open clash with the chancellor at her joint press conference with Cleverly, but made her feelings clear saying “if Putin believes he has the longest staying power and Ukraine will run out of weapons soon he is wrong”. Accusing Putin of a deliberate attack on humanity she said: If we wish to see Ukraine live in freedom it means we think of offensive weapons, but it also means providing the weapons Ukraine needs to free occupied territories. She said it was important that Vladimir Putin “does not need to be deluded to cherishing the hope that the policy of annexing land is successful”. I have pointed out time and time again we work with our partners to see what kind of military support is required by Ukraine. Her emphasis on working in partnership with allies, the importance of Ukraine’s own assessment of its needs, and the requirement for Putin to be under no illusion that he must give back annexed lands, conveyed an overall impression that she is confident Germany is about to shift its position. Cleverly praised Baerbock saying she had shown huge political courage in standing by Ukraine, adding the west will continue to have conversations with the Ukrainians about the weapons they need. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he spoke with Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, about “security cooperation” as well as the exchange of prisoners of war and the Black Sea Grain initiative. Zelenskiy added that he was “glad to hear that Turkey is ready to participate in the implementation” of his “peace formula”, which he first proposed in November. The Turkish president also spoke with Vladimir Putin in a phone call earlier today. Erdoğan told the Russian leader that peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a “vision for a fair solution”, according to his office. Here’s some more Ukrainian reaction to Vladimir Putin’s order for a 36-hour ceasefire over Orthodox Christmas, which presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak earlier dismissed as “hypocrisy”. Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun points out that Russia’s offer for a ceasefire comes just days after Russia launched a wave of strikes on the country, including the capital Kyiv, as Ukrainians celebrated the new year. Iuliia Mendel, a Ukrainian former presidential spokesperson, accuses Russia of “killing and torturing people in my country, destroying infrastructure and human lives” while wanting a ceasefire “to celebrate Christmas”. Euan MacDonald of the New Voice of Ukraine, who is based in Kyiv, warns that the Kremlin’s offer “is not a goodwill gesture” and that it will use the chance to cast Ukraine as an aggressor if it does not agree to the temporary truce. Vladimir Putin has gambled away his gas leverage over Europe, Germany’s vice-chancellor has claimed as he sounded a note of cautious optimism over his country’s energy supplies during a visit to Norway. Russia’s war in Ukraine had caught Berlin at a vulnerable moment since it was over-reliant on natural gas deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and had failed to build up infrastructure for alternative supply channels, said Robert Habeck, the German deputy head of government and economic minister. “The German problem, or the central European problem, was that half of our eggs were in the basket of Putin,” the Green politician said at a joint press conference with the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, in Oslo. “And he destroyed them.” At the start of 2023, however, Germany was “one-third done” being able to replace ceased Russian deliveries of gas, oil and coal through other channels, such as speedily built liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and an increase of imports from Norway, now Europe’s largest supplier of gas. Norway’s energy minister, Terje Aasland, announced on Thursday that Oslo would again be able to deliver 122bn cubic metres of natural gas to Europe this year, up 8% from deliveries in 2021. While emphasising that Germany’s energy situation remained “very very tight and complicated”, Habeck sounded a note of optimism. “Right now, I can say the storages in Germany are full, around 90%, we will withstand this winter, and the prices are going down.” With central Europe enjoying a relatively mild winter so far, he said, there was a “fair chance” its storage tanks would not be completely empty at the end of the cold season. Read the full story here: Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to Ukraine’s president, has dismissed Vladimir Putin’s calls for a temporary ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas. The Kremlin earlier said Putin ordered his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a 36-hour ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine from noon tomorrow to midnight 7 January. Ukraine “doesn’t attack foreign territory and doesn’t kill civilians” and “destroys only members of the occupation army on its territory”, Podolyak wrote on Twitter. He said a “temporary truce” would be possible only when Russia leaves territory it is occupying in Ukraine. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has instructed his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a 36-hour ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine from Friday noon to midnight 7 January, the Kremlin said.

Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here with all the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Here’s the statement from President Vladimir Putin ordering a ceasefire in Ukraine over Orthodox Christmas from noon tomorrow until midnight 6 January. Putin said: Taking into account the appeal of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill, I instruct the minister of defense of the Russian Federation to introduce a ceasefire regime along the entire line of contact of the parties in Ukraine from 12.00 on 6 January 2023 to 24.00 on 7 January 2023. Proceeding from the fact that a large number of citizens professing Orthodoxy live in the areas of hostilities, we call on the Ukrainian side to declare a ceasefire and allow them to attend services on Christmas Eve, as well as on Christmas Day. Vladimir Putin has instructed his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a 36-hour ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine from noon tomorrow to midnight 7 January, the Kremlin said. Russian troops must hold fire for 36 hours in order to mark Orthodox Christmas, it said. The Kremlin’s announcement comes after the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, earlier today called for a ceasefire and a Christmas truce in Ukraine. Ihor Terekhov, mayor of Kharkiv, has posted to Telegram to warn residents of an impeding drop in temperatures. Ukraine has been experiencing unseasonably warm weather for the last few days, but that is expect to change for Orthodox Christmas at the weekend. In his message, he reminded residents of the facilities provided by the city, saying: All city life support services of Kharkiv have been put on high alert and 24/7 emergency response. I remind you that there are “Points of Unbreakability” in the city, where you can warm up and charge mobile phones if necessary. In addition to the “Points of Unbreakability”, there are heating points in Kharkiv. If necessary, the subway will also operate in the mode of heating points. Hot food distribution points will work as usual from Monday to Saturday inclusive. I am sure that together we will overcome this challenge. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of president of Ukraine, has posted to Telegram to report that the Zakarpattia oblast is working with Ukraine’s ice hockey federation to provide three new rinks, in response to the one destroyed in Druzhkivka in Donetsk on Monday. Tymoshenko writes: In the communities where they will operate, they will create a youth centre with ice hockey departments. They will provide recruitment and a professional training process. Local children will train here, as well as children who were forced to move from their hometowns and towns due to the war. We will not give the enemy a chance to take the future away from our children. We fight and fight precisely for them. Instead of one destroyed arena, there will be three! Tass is reporting that the mayor of Horlivka, one of the Russian-occupied cities in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, has said that the armed forces of Ukraine fired at the city, and hits were recorded on the buildings of a hostel and a medical unit. Earlier today, Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk oblast – one of the regions which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed – reported two people killed in the direction of Horlivka by Russian fire. Neither sets of claims have been independently verified. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said he spoke with the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, about “further coordination in the matter of guaranteeing Ukrainian energy security”. In a tweet, Yermak said he thanked Sullivan for Washington’s support for Kyiv in its “struggle for independence, freedom, and democratic values”. A couple and their 12-year-old son were killed today when a Russian shell hit a residential building in the town of Beryslav in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, a Ukrainian official has said. The family was preparing to celebrate the Orthodox Christian Christmas when the attack took place, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an aide to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on his Telegram account. Tymoshenko said: People were preparing to celebrate Christmas together, but a cynical blow by the Russians killed them in their own home. It has not been possible to independently verify this report. Here’s more on the head of the private Russian military group Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who today bade farewell to former convicts who had served out their contracts in Ukraine, as my colleague Pjotr Sauer reported earlier. The Wall Street Journal’s Yaroslav Trofimov writes that Russian commentators are beginning to joke that Prigozhin is the country’s real leader. The Wagner founder has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published at the end of December and purportedly filmed near the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Germany will always adjust its arms deliveries to Ukraine based on “the needs on the battlefield”, vice-chancellor Robert Habeck said. Habeck said: We will not stop to deliver weapons to Ukraine ... We will always adjust our deliveries to the need of the battlefield. His remarks came a day after France’s Emmanuel Macron told President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that his government would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help in the war against Russia. In a phone call between the two leaders, Zelenskiy thanked Macron for the announcement and said it showed the need for others to provide heavier weapons, according to a French official. Vladimir Putin told his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, that Russia was open to dialogue over Ukraine but that Kyiv would have to accept the “new territorial realities”, according to a readout of the call by the Kremlin. In a statement, it said: Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Russia’s openness to a serious dialogue, provided that the [Kyiv] authorities fulfil the well-known and repeatedly voiced requirements and take into account the new territorial realities. Russia’s president annexed Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in September after Kremlin-orchestrated fake referendums in the regions. The Kremlin has previously insisted that any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of those four Ukrainian regions having joined Russia. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions. Putin also “acknowledged the destructive role of the West, pumping weapons into Kyiv, providing information and guidance,” the Kremlin said. The pair also discussed a number of energy issues, including the creation of a gas hub in Turkey and the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, it added. The first inmates recruited by the private military group Wagner have received their promised pardons after fighting for six months in Ukraine, Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin told journalists on Thursday. “They worked off their contract. They worked with honour, with dignity. They were the first ones. Nobody else in this world works as hard as they did,” Prigozhin told Russian news agency RIA-Novosti, standing alongside a number of former convicts. Addressing the former prisoners, Prigozhin instructed them not to end up back in jail. “The police will treat you with respect now… Don’t drink a lot, don’t use drugs, and don’t rape women, only [have sex] for love or money,” he said, a statement which was met with laughter. “Don’t steal, you have enough money for now,” Prigozhin added. Since last summer Prigozhin, known as “Putin’s chef” because his catering business hosted dinners attended by the Russian president, has recruited tens of thousands of prisoners to compensate for acute shortages of personnel on the battlefield. Each convict reportedly received up to £3,000 a month for fighting in Wagner. In one leaked video, Prigozhin is seen visiting one of the prisons, telling inmates they would be freed if they served six months with his group. According to Olga Romanova, the head of Russia Behind Bars, a prisoners’ rights NGO, around 40,000 convicts have so far been recruited from Russian prisons across the country to fight in Ukraine. She said many of them have perished fighting as part of Russia’s attempt to capture the Donbas city of Bakhmut. Prigozhin’s practice of recruiting and pardoning prisoners has been described as “completely illegal and unconstitutional” by Romanova and other human rights workers. There have also been reports of Wagner prisoners executed by their commanders for desertion. In November, Prigozhin welcomed the brutal murder of Yevgeny Nuzhin, a convicted murderer recruited by Wagner who surrendered to Ukrainian forces but was later allegedly handed over to Russia. Prigozhin issued a statement saying the clip showing Nuzhin executed by a sledgehammer blow to the head should be called “a dog receives a dog’s death”. A wide-ranging public discussion is taking place in Ukraine over what to do with seven street murals painted in November by the British artist Banksy on a series of destroyed buildings in and around Kyiv. The conversation has grown urgent after thieves last month made off with one artwork from the town of Hostomel, about 15 miles (25km) outside the capital. It shows a woman in a gas mask and dressing gown holding a red fire extinguisher. She is standing next to a real flame-blackened window. Banksy painted the image and six others during an unpublicised trip to Ukraine. He later acknowledged in a video that they were his work, done “in solidarity” with the Ukrainian people. The Instagram post showed the artist at work – his identity obscured – as well as interviews with local people walking amid ruins. On 2 December, a group of men chiselled the dressing gown woman from the side of a scorched wall. When challenged by a local person, they claimed to be representatives of Neo-Eco, a French charity which is reconstructing the wrecked Hostomel housing estate using recycled materials. Suspicious, the person rang the police. Officers arrived at the scene and arrested eight men. The mural was recovered in good condition and is now being kept under guard at Hostomel’s police station. An investigation into the crime has been opened. Read the full story here: Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has called for a ceasefire and a Christmas truce in Ukraine. In a statement posted to the church’s website, Kirill said he appealed to “all parties involved in the internecine conflict” for the ceasefire, so that “Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of the Nativity of Christ”. The patriarch has faced stern external criticism for his support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s gross domestic product fell by 30.4% in 2022 – the largest annual fall in over 30 years – because of the war with Russia, the economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko said this morning. Svyrydenko said in a statement that Ukraine’s economy had suffered its largest losses since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 although the fall was less than initially expected. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told Vladimir Putin in a phone call that peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a “vision for a fair solution”, the Turkish presidency said on Thursday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk oblast – one of the regions which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed – has posted a status update in which he says two people have been killed by Russian fire in the last 24 hours. Overnight, Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), has said that service personnel injured in the attack on the barracks in occupied Makiivka have been mostly transferred to hospitals within Russia. The US is looking at ways to target Iranian drone production through sanctions and export controls, the White House said. Washington previously imposed sanctions on companies and people it accused of producing or transferring Iranian drones that Russia has used against Ukraine. The United States is not “hand-wringing” over the mass casualties of Russian soldiers in a Ukrainian attack reportedly using US-supplied artillery, a senior White House official said Wednesday. After criticism in Russia over the use of US-delivered weaponry by Ukrainian defenders, including in the Makiivka strike, the national security council spokesperson John Kirby said Russia is to blame. Heavy fighting around the largely ruined, Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut is likely to persist for the foreseeable future, with the outcome uncertain as Russians have made incremental progress, according to a senior US administration official. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister said significant Russian losses meant Moscow would probably have to announce a second partial mobilisation in the first quarter of the year. Ukraine’s efforts to increase exports under the Black Sea grain deal with Russia are focused on securing faster inspections of ships rather than including more ports in the initiative, a senior Ukrainian official said on Wednesday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours. The Ukrainian president has called on western allies to supply Ukraine with tanks. In a video address, during which he thanked France for providing them, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “This is what gives a clear signal to all our other partners. There is no rational reason why western-style tanks have not yet been supplied to Ukraine.” Here is the video clip. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has told Zelenskiy his government would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help its war effort. By the way, as I suspect it is going to become a point of contention among military analysts and commentators on Ukraine, if you want to know the difference between a tank and an armoured vehicle, my colleague Helen Sullivan had these quotes earlier from the British Forces Broadcasting Service, saying: “The main difference between a tank and an armoured vehicle is their role on the battlefield. A tank is an armoured vehicle that is specifically used to break enemy lines.” Tanks “do not typically carry infantry, and are actually designed to fight in direct combat with enemy forces”, using armour to protect themselves, “and their main gun as their offence”, according to the BFBS. Here is a photograph taken in Dnipro yesterday of the removal of a monument to Soviet soldier Alexander Matrosov as it was dismantled as part of the “decommunisation” process in eastern Ukraine. Matrosov, who was born in Dnipro, was posthumously awarded the title of hero of the Soviet Union in 1943 after he single-handedly tackled a German machine gun position at the cost of his own life. The Kyiv Post today carries its own analysis of the reaction in Russia to the strike on troops stationed in occupied Makiivka. It writes: Russia’s top brass on Wednesday tried to shift the blame onto the dead soldiers themselves, accusing them of the banned use of personal mobile phones which were then tracked and located by Ukrainian forces. It’s feasible that this occurred – since the early days of the war, the lax use of mobile phones by troops has allowed both sides to pinpoint the location of the enemy, but it still doesn’t account for the decision to house the troops in an unprotected building packed with explosive material. Given the strike has also led to rare public displays of grief, including in Russia’s Samara region on the Volga River, home to some of the victims, it’s not yet clear how far up the chain of command the blame will have to lie in order to assuage public anger. In a sign of just how seriously the criticism is being taken by the Kremlin, Margarita Simonyan, the influential head of RT, Russia’s state-controlled international TV channel, welcomed the army’s promise that officials “will be held accountable.” “I hope that the names of these persons will be announced,” she said. “It is time to understand that impunity does not lead to social harmony. Impunity leads to new crimes. And, as a result, to public dissent.” Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that Patriarch Kirill has called for a ceasefire and a Christmas truce in Ukraine. In a statement posted to the church’s website, Kirill said: I, Kirill, Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus, appeal to all parties involved in the internecine conflict with an appeal to cease fire and establish a Christmas truce from noon on 6 January to midnight on 7 January, so that Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of the Nativity of Christ. The patriarch has faced stern external criticism for his support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told Vladimir Putin in a phone call that peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a “vision for a fair solution”, the Turkish presidency said on Thursday. Reuters reports it said in a statement the two leaders discussed energy and the Black Sea grain corridor, and that Erdoğan told Putin concrete steps needed to be taken to clear Kurdish militants from the Syrian border region. Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was typically blunt yesterday in a response to a question from the media about the stated willingness of Italy to act as a peace guarantor in any eventual settlement between Russia and Ukraine. Zakharova’s response was published in full by the Russian foreign ministry late yesterday, and she said: Many countries declare their interest in being part of a settlement … and some even directly offer us their mediation services. Pope Francis, President of France Emmanuel Macron, President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and other heads of state and government, politicians and public figures have talked about this. Some are sincere, others are pursuing their own selfish goals, trying to wedge into the talk process in order to get foreign policy dividends. However, it is strange to hear offers of mediation from countries that took an unequivocal and very aggressive anti-Russia position from the very beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine, and not only supported the bloody Kiev regime, but also provide it with significant military and military-technical assistance. It is known that Italy, along with an extensive range of weapons and military equipment, is supplying Kiev with anti-personnel mines. These irresponsible actions not only multiply the number of victims, including Donbas civilians, and delay the end of the conflict, but could also draw Nato countries into a direct military confrontation with Russia. However, Kiev’s western sponsors, among which, unfortunately, Italy is one, are not even thinking about stopping; on the contrary, they are building up their supplies. Obviously, given Italy’s biased position, we cannot regard them as either an honest mediator or a possible guarantor in a peace process. Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Ukraine’s Chernihiv region, has posted to Telegram to say that the area has received a donation of 75 boilers from the International Organization for Migration in Ukraine. Chaus said: This is the first batch of equipment. The second is expected before the end of the month. Everything will be distributed among educational establishments of the residential type and secondary schools in communities according to needs. Ukraine’s gross domestic product fell by 30.4% in 2022 – the largest annual fall in over 30 years – because of the war with Russia, the economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko said this morning. Reuters reports that Svyrydenko said in a statement that Ukraine’s economy had suffered its largest losses since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 although the fall was less than initially expected. “The successes of Ukraine’s defence forces on the frontlines, the coordinated work of the government and businesses, the unbreakable spirit of the population and the speed of rebuilding damaged critical infrastructure units and also systemic financial support from international donors have allowed us to keep up the economic front and continue our movement towards victory,” Svyrydenko said. The economy ministry said Russian missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure continued to put pressure on business activity and sentiment. Ukraine’s GDP had grown by 3.4% in 2021. Overnight, Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), has said that service personnel injured in the attack on the barracks in occupied Makiivka have been mostly transferred to hospitals within Russia. Donetsk is one of the Ukrainian regions which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. He posted to his Telegram channel: The doctors said that the wounded began to arrive very quickly after the incident, thanks to which they were able to provide emergency medical care in a timely manner. Almost all of them have already been transferred to other regions of Russia. Both the fighters and the commanders behaved heroically, they saved many of their colleagues. And what is important - they have a fighting mood. All as one are eager to avenge their comrades. Prior to the declaration of annexation, only three UN member states – Russia, Syria and North Korea – recognised the DPR as any kind of legitimate authority. It was established in 2014. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk oblast – one of the regions which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed – has posted a status update in which he says two people have been killed by Russian fire in the last 24 hours. He writes on Telegram: On the Donetsk side, Kurakhove was the most affected – the city was hit by several shellings. Six private houses, two shops and equipment at an infrastructure facility were damaged. Marinka was subjected to intense shelling, and in the morning isolated airstrikes were recorded in the old part of Avdiivka – without casualties. Two people died in the Horlivka direction and one person was injured in Bakhmut. In Chasiv Yar, a high-rise building was destroyed, four more houses and a hospital building were damaged. In Soledar, a five-story building was damaged – no one was injured. The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has posted a picture from Cornwall of people celebrating Christmas with Ukrainian flags, commenting: “Pretty amazing to see how strong support for Ukraine remains in the UK after nearly a year of the Russian invasion.” Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy oblast, has said on Telegram that the night passed without incident in his region, which borders Russia. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has posted his daily update on events in the region. He states that in the past 24 hours there has been one air alert – on Wednesday morning – but no attack materialised. He said that in the last 24 hours, 60 internally displaced people arrived in Lviv by train, and 58 by bus. They were travelling from what he described as “the epicentres of hostilities”. On the power situation, he writes: As of this moment, there are no power outages in our region. Ukrenergo provide consumption limits. If they are exceeded, the schedule of hourly outages will be applied. The New York Times has led its international morning briefing with the reaction to the devastating attack on Makiivka. Natasha Frost writes: Russian soldiers’ use of open cellphone lines in Ukraine has been a known vulnerability for its military, often revealing forces’ positions. Intercepted calls have revealed the disarray and discontent in Russia’s ranks. Some Russian lawmakers and military bloggers pushed back against the blame, calling it an attempt by the military to avoid faulting commanders. Kyiv says its forces have killed or wounded more than 1,000 Russian soldiers in a series of pinpoint attacks. Russia has confirmed only one of three waves of strikes. The United States is not “hand-wringing” over the mass casualties of Russian soldiers in a Ukrainian attack reportedly using US-supplied artillery, a senior White House official said Wednesday. After criticism in Russia over the use of US-delivered weaponry by Ukrainian defenders, including in the Makiivka strike, the national security council spokesperson John Kirby said Russia is to blame. There is no “hand-wringing by the administration at all. This is a war. They have been invaded and they (Ukrainians) are striking back and defending themselves,” Kirby said. “Russian soldiers in their territory are legitimate targets for Ukrainian military action, period.” Kirby would not give a US estimate of the casualties in an attack that all sides agree was unusually fatal, even by the bloody standards of the now more than 10-month-old Russian invasion. “I’m not going to get into the casualty count. It is war. And it is in a vicious area of fighting right now. And war is a bloody affair,” he said. A senior US administration official has given a sobering assessment of fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, Reuters reports, especially around the largely ruined, Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut. Fierce combat is likely to persist for the foreseeable future, although Russian forces have made incremental progress, the official said. “The fighting is still quite hot … I think what we’re seeing in Bakhmut we should expect to see elsewhere along the front that there will be continued fighting in the coming months.” In his video address, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian troops outside Bakhmut were inflicting numerous losses on the Russians and said Moscow was building up its forces in the region. After France said it would supply Ukraine with AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles, Zelenskiy said that while he was grateful for the help, Ukraine needed heavier vehicles – or tanks. So what is the difference? According to the British Forces Broadcasting Service, “The main difference between a tank and an armoured vehicle is their role on the battlefield. A tank is an armoured vehicle that is specifically used to break enemy lines.” A tank is a particularly powerful or heavy armoured vehicle. Ukraine has asked for US tanks, called Abrams tanks, and the German Leopard tanks. Tanks “do not typically carry infantry, and are actually designed to fight in direct combat with enemy forces”, using armour to protect themselves, “and their main gun as their offence”, according to the BFBS. The US president, Joe Biden, said later on Wednesday that Washington was considering sending Bradley fighting vehicles to Ukraine. The Bradley fighting vehicle, which has a powerful gun, has been a US army staple to carry troops around battlefields since the mid-1980s. The US army has thousands of Bradleys, and they would give Ukraine more firepower on the battlefield and strengthen its ability in trench warfare. Biden’s move, however, would fall short of sending the Abrams tanks that Ukraine has sought. Kyiv has repeatedly asked western allies for heavier fighting vehicles such as the Abrams and German-made Leopard tanks. Western allies are poised to supply Ukraine with armoured battle vehicles but not the heavier tanks it has requested to fight Russia, Reuters reports. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy his government would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help its war effort, a French official said on Wednesday after a phone call between them. While the official said these would be the first western armoured vehicles delivered to Ukraine, Australia said in October that it had given Kyiv 90 of its Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles, an armoured unit that is hardened against landmines, small arms fire and other threats. In an evening video address, Zelenskiy thanked Macron for the announcement and said it showed the need for other allies to provide heavier weapons. “This is something that sends a clear signal to all our partners. There is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with western tanks,” he said. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments. Our top story this morning is that western allies are considering supplying armoured battle vehicles to Ukraine but not the heavier tanks it has requested. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, his government would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help its war effort, a French official said on Wednesday after a phone call between the two leaders. The US president, Joe Biden, meanwhile, said that Washington was considering sending Bradley fighting vehicles to Ukraine. In an evening video address, Zelenskiy thanked Macron for the announcement and said it showed the need for other allies to provide heavier weapons. “This is something that sends a clear signal to all our partners. There is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with western tanks,” he said. Here are the other key recent developments: The US is looking at ways to target Iranian drone production through sanctions and export controls, the White House said. Washington previously imposed sanctions on companies and people it accused of producing or transferring Iranian drones that Russia has used against Ukraine. Heavy fighting around the largely ruined, Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut is likely to persist for the foreseeable future, with the outcome uncertain as Russians have made incremental progress, according to a senior US administration official. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister said significant Russian losses meant Moscow would probably have to announce a second partial mobilisation in the first quarter of the year. Further strikes deep in Russian territory should be expected, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, has told the US TV network ABC. He added that the attacks would come “deeper and deeper” inside Russia, without specifically saying whether Ukraine would be behind them. Ukraine’s military general staff said Russia had launched seven missile strikes, 18 airstrikes and more than 85 attacks from multiple-launch rocket systems in the past 24 hours on civilian infrastructure in three cities – Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. “There are casualties among the civilian population,” it said. The reports have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s efforts to increase exports under the Black Sea grain deal with Russia are focused on securing faster inspections of ships rather than including more ports in the initiative, a senior Ukrainian official said on Wednesday. Ukraine’s navy has claimed Russia has three combat-ready ships in action in the Black Sea and that it continues to “violate the international convention for the protection of human life at sea 1974 (Solas), disabling auto identification systems on civilian vessels in the Azov Sea”, it said in a post on Facebook. Vladimir Putin took part in a ceremony by video link while the Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov went into combat service equipped with the Zircon hypersonic missile systems. The Russian president said: “I am sure that such powerful weapons will reliably protect Russia from potential external threats and will help ensure the national interests of our country”. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the Gorshkov would sail to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and to the Mediterranean Sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/apr/07/uk-politics-live-tories-energy-strategy-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T16:06:58Z","webTitle":"UK politics: Sunak should explain wife’s non-domicile tax decision, says Labour – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/apr/07/uk-politics-live-tories-energy-strategy-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/apr/07/uk-politics-live-tories-energy-strategy-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak","fields":{"headline":"UK politics: Sunak should explain wife’s non-domicile tax decision, says Labour – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day: Rishi Sunak’s multi-millionaire wife claims non-domicile status, it has emerged, which allows her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Akshata Murty, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status, a scheme that allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings. Several leading international tax experts have disputed Akshata Murty’s claim that must be treated as a non-dom for UK tax because she is an Indian citizen, saying tax domicile status is a choice and not connected with a person’s nationality. Those resident in the UK do not have to have a British passport in order to pay British taxes, meaning Murty could have paid UK tax at any time. Labour has called for clarity and “complete transparency” over why Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, uses non-domicile status. Keir Starmer, asked about Rishi Sunak’s wife holding non-domiciled status, said: “If it now transpires that his wife has been using schemes to reduce her own tax then I’m afraid that is breathtaking hypocrisy.” Rishi Sunak’s wife pays £30,000 a year to secure her non-domiciled tax status, her spokesperson has confirmed and accepted it was possible that Akshata Murty uses the status to take advantage of tax havens for income earned outside the UK. As political pressure increased on the chancellor and his spouse, the spokesperson said Murty had no plans to say where she pays tax on overseas income as that information was not “relevant”. The business secretary has admitted that the government’s energy security strategy will do little to help alleviate soaring fuel bills now. Kwasi Kwarteng said that it’s “more of a medium three, four, five year answer” ahead of its reveal later today. Keir Starmer said the government’s energy strategy “won’t help those who only last week saw their energy bills go up by hundreds of pounds”. What people wanted from the government was a response that met that challenge, he said. Boris Johnson said “nuclear is coming home” as a result of the government’s energy strategy. In a social media video to promote the plan, which was finally released today after repeated delays and cabinet wrangling, the prime minister said: “We’ve got the ambition, we’ve got the plan and we are going to bring clean, affordable secure power to the people for generations to come.” Rishi Sunak vetoed plans to ease the cost of living crisis for millions of households after proposals to more than double the energy bill rebate scheme were rejected, according to a document leaked to the i paper. The UK government has confirmed that no new nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland, as the Holyrood government – which is opposed to nuclear energy – dismissed new plans to install eight reactors at existing sites as “risky and expensive”. Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed there were “no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland” in future. Ed Miliband said the government should ban transgender conversion therapy. He said: “Trans people face incredible barriers and stigma in our society” and that the debate on trans issues was “really awful” for many trans people. That’s it from me today. Thanks for joining me. For the latest news on Ukraine, follow our dedicated live blog: Rishi Sunak’s wife pays £30,000 a year to secure her non-domiciled tax status, her spokesperson has confirmed and accepted it was possible that Akshata Murty uses the status to take advantage of tax havens for income earned outside the UK. As political pressure increased on the chancellor and his spouse, the spokesperson said Murty had no plans to say where she pays tax on overseas income as that information was not “relevant”. The spokesperson declined to elaborate on the initial explanation for Murty’s non-dom tax status – the fact she has Indian citizenship – when this would still mean such a tax arrangement was a choice. They accepted it was possible that Murty’s arrangements meant she minimised her tax using tax havens. They said no further details would be given, other than to say that Murty abided by all necessary rules. Labour called for clarity over her tax arrangements, while Keir Starmer said it would be “breathtaking hypocrisy” if she had been reducing her liabilities while the chancellor was raising taxes on others. There was also concern from some Conservative MPs, with one former minister saying the revelation was particularly unfortunate on the day the national insurance rise came into force. The perception is, what is the problem? Here is someone worth £3bn who has a different tax arrangement. I’m sure everything is above board but that’s not the point. Murty receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from a stake in her family’s IT business empire, Infosys, which is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. Under UK tax laws, Murty’s status as a non-dom means she does not have to pay tax on dividend payments from overseas companies. UK resident taxpayers currently pay up to 39.35% tax on foreign dividend payouts. It is not known where she pays tax on this overseas income. It previously emerged that Murty is a shareholder in a restaurant business that funnelled investments through the tax haven of Mauritius. Asked where Murty paid tax on her overseas income, a spokesperson said Murty had no plans to comment on this because it “doesn’t seem relevant”. Read more from my colleagues Peter Walker, Jessica Elgot, Aubrey Allegretti and Rupert Neate here: This is the government form that the chancellor’s wife Akshata Murty will have filled in to apply for non-domiciled status in order to avoid paying UK tax on tens of millions in dividends collected from her family’s Indian IT business empire. When it was revealed on Wednesday that Murty was a non-dom, and therebynot required to pay UK tax on about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in Infosys, her spokeswoman said Murty “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes” suggesting that she had no control over her UK tax status. However, all UK residents must actively apply for non-dom status by filing in government tax form SA109 to claim the tax relief. Murty’s spokeswoman suggested that because Murty was an Indian citizen she cannot also hold UK citizenship and therefore must be treated as a non-dom for UK tax. Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents’ home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income. However, several leading international tax experts have disputed this and said tax domicile status is not connected with a person’s nationality. Those resident in the UK do not have to have a British passport in order to pay British taxes, meaning Murty could have paid UK tax at any time. Richard Murphy, a professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and tax justice campaigner, said: Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. Nor does it have anything to do with not being able to have a British passport because a person holds citizenship from another country. And non-domiciled status is certainly never given for that reason. Murphy said non-dom status is only given to people who applied for it. In that case the implication in Ms Murty’s statement that she has to be treated as non-domiciled is simply wrong. She is only non-domiciled because she asked to be so. She can also give up the claim to be non-domiciled at any time,Just because she was non-domiciled when she arrived in the UK as a newly married person does not mean she has to keep the status now. So the fact she’s still non-dom is also a choice. Arun Advani, assistant professor at the University of Warwick’s economics department and an expert on non-dom tax law, said: “Citizenship has nothing to do with whether you choose to/not to claim remittance basis in the UK.” Read the full story here: Rishi Sunak vetoed plans to ease the cost of living crisis for millions of households after proposals to more than double the energy bill rebate scheme were rejected, according to a document leaked to Richard Vaughan and Paul Waugh at the i paper. The i reports: An earlier draft of the energy security strategy drawn up by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng’s department and obtained by i included measures to increase the £200 energy rebate to “£500 or more” for either all households or just “fuel poor” homes. But the policy recommendation was rejected by the Treasury, despite growing fears within government over damage soaring energy bills would have on household budgets. An alternative suggestion was to delay the repayment of the energy rebate or to extend the repayment period for either all households or the poorest was also dismissed. So too was a policy proposal to exempt the poorest homes from having to repay the rebate. Read the full story here. Boris Johnson’s new energy strategy could take up to five years to start shaving money off people’s bills, the business secretary has admitted, as the prime minister announced a drastic expansion of nuclear reactors. Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan for cutting reliance on imported energy in response to soaring prices caused in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was more of a medium-term way to increase homegrown energy production. Johnson declared that the long-delayed energy security strategy meant “nuclear is coming home” – but the review declined to set targets for onshore wind and committed to continuing the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. Days after 22 million people were hit by the energy price cap rising by 54%, Kwarteng suggested it would be years until the benefits of the strategy would be felt by consumers. The business secretary told Sky News: The strategy is more of a medium-term three, four, five-year answer. I think it’s really important that we get an energy strategy that means we can have more security and independence in the years ahead. We want to have security of supply, we want to live in a world where we’re not dependent on what Russian policy is, but we have more control over energy sources here in Britain. The cost of offshore wind had decreased enormously in the past 10 years, Kwarteng said, adding: Some of these benefits can happen quite quickly. But we need to start the planning process and the strategy now. And that’s what this security strategy is all about. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, attempted to intervene in the cost of living crisis at the end of March, but was accused of not doing enough to help struggling households expected to face the biggest fall in living standards since modern records began in the 1950s. Read the full story here: The “cold hand of the chancellor” should not prevent the government from investing more in insulating homes in the UK, ministers have been told. The crossbench peer Lady Hayman questioned whether reluctance from the Treasury was responsible for the lack of action on insulating homes in early information from the government’s energy strategy. The strategy was published today as western countries wrestle with high prices and how to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas, and in the face of calls to end the fossil fuel era to tackle dangerous climate change. In the Lords, Hayman – a former minister – criticised early information from the strategy, released yesterday. She said: What has been published is in the week of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s most frightening warnings yet on global warming and when customers and consumers face horrifying energy bills. It is deeply dispiriting to see a set of policies outlined that concentrate on the expensive and the long-term and fail to support what would work immediately and help both consumers and the climate. Why are there no extra measures to support consumers in insulating their homes? We have some of the worst housing stock in the world and it is an absolute no-brainer to reduce demand and to support. Is that the result of the cold hand of the chancellor? The business minister Lord Callanan said the government was “already spending a lot of money on energy efficiency programmes”. He also said: We are rolling out the development and the formation of low carbon sources of power, be it nuclear, be it offshore wind and we are going to go further on onshore wind. I know it is a subject she feels passionately about. We must do so in full recognition of the concerns of many local communities so we want to take people with us – when we do that we will be seeking a number of pilots to take those policies forward. Labour has called for clarity over why Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, uses non-domicile status, as Keir Starmer said it would be “breathtaking hypocrisy” if she had been reducing her tax liabilities while the chancellor was raising taxes on others. Murty receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from a stake in her family’s IT business empire, Infosys. Under UK tax laws, Murty’s status as a non-dom means she would not have to pay tax on dividend payments from overseas companies. Infosys is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. UK resident taxpayers pay a 38.1% tax on dividend payouts. After her status was revealed by the Independent a spokesperson for Murty said that because she was a citizen of India, which does not allow Indians to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously, she “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”. They added: “She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.” However, tax experts have said non-dom status is not automatic but a choice. Prof Richard Murphy, a Sheffield University academic who co-founded the Tax Justice Network, said: Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. In other words, the claims made in the statement issued by Ms Murty are wrong, and as evidence, just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK. The Labour MP Chris Bryant said the statement needed to be clarified: This is just wrong. Non-dom status is not automatic and the Treasury needs to urgently clarify this inaccurate statement. After shutting down legitimate questions about Infosys and its operations in Russia last week, it’s time for Rishi Sunak to come clean. Starmer said Sunak “has very, very serious questions to answer”. Read more from my colleagues Peter Walker and Aubrey Allegretti here: Keir Starmer, asked about Rishi Sunak’s wife holding non-domiciled status, told broadcasters: A chancellor who says to the British public that he will tax them – he’s introduced 15 tax rises, and he says all of this is necessary, there’s no option – if it now transpires that his wife has been using schemes to reduce her own tax then I’m afraid that is breathtaking hypocrisy, and it shows yet again that we have got a chancellor who is completely out of touch with the struggles that so many people in this country are going through at the moment with this cost-of-living crisis. Asked if Akshata Murty should change her tax status, Starmer added: We need complete transparency on this so that we can all understand what schemes she may have been using to reduce her own tax. But to use a scheme when the Chancellor is out there day after day saying we need tax rises on millions of people in this country who are really, really struggling is breathtaking hypocrisy. More than one in 10 residents of some of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods have claimed “non-dom” status at some point, meaning they paid no tax on their offshore income. UK-based people who have benefited from this special tax status by claiming another country as their legal “domicile” made up more than 12% of residents in two parliamentary constituencies in 2018 – Kensington, and the Cities of London and Westminster, according to an analysis of HM Revenue and Customs data. In five of the most affluent council wards they accounted for more than a quarter of residents. The study by the London School of Economics and the University of Warwick found that the number of people who had ever claimed non-dom status in the UK rose from 162,000 in 2001 to 238,000 in 2018. The findings were published after it emerged that Akshata Murty, the wife of Rishi Sunak, claims non-dom status, which would allow her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. The study found that more than 93% of non-doms were born abroad, coming mainly from the US, India – of which Murty is a citizen – and western Europe, especially France, Germany and Italy, the study found. The number of Indian non-doms has risen most rapidly, from about 4% of the total in 2001 (3,200) to almost 14% in 2018 (22,700). Read the full story here: The UK government has confirmed that no new nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland, as the Holyrood government – which is opposed to nuclear energy – dismissed new plans to install eight reactors at existing sites as “risky and expensive”. The Scottish government’s energy secretary Michael Matheson told BBC Radio Scotland this morning: Not only is there environmental risk associated with that, there is also the issue that this is likely to drive up the cost of household bills - whereas renewables such as wind and marine tidal in the future would actually reduce the cost of electricity. I think the UK government might have allowed themselves to be wrapped up in the nuclear lobby here. His UK counterpart Kwasi Kwarteng said there were “no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland” in future. The UK government plans also proposed a new licensing round for oil and gas projects in the North Sea – but Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously said that ramping up North Sea oil and gas is not a short-term solution to Europe’s reliance on Russian supplies. Keir Starmer said the government’s energy strategy “won’t help those who only last week saw their energy bills go up by hundreds of pounds”. What they want from the government is a response that meets that challenge, he said. The Labour leader told broadcasters that “because of political squabbling it leaves out of account really important initiatives like keeping homes warm, insulating homes, which I’ve seen for myself can make a huge difference and reduce bills by up to 400, that’s the sort of real action we were looking for today”. Asked if the strategy will help the UK achieve energy security, he said: Anything that makes us less reliant on importing our energy is a good thing, which is why I didn’t think the prime minister was doing the right thing by saying we’re going to stop our reliance on Russia, but then go to Saudi Arabia. But anything that keeps our supply in Britain is a good thing because we do need a secure energy supply. Speaking about what Labour would do, Starmer said: What we’ve been calling for a number of years now is turbo-charging on renewables, including onshore wind turbines, fast-forwarding nuclear, that should have happened over the last decade and it hasn’t happened, there’s been a real failure there, developing on hydrogen, but also very importantly insulating our homes so that we reduce our energy intake and reduce bills for people. Because at the moment I think the thing that most people are worried about is how on earth they are going to pay their energy bills, and we need real answers to that question right now. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the energy strategy was “not enough” and “too little, it’s too late” to help families with rising costs. Asked if the measures will be enough to help those struggling, Starmer told broadcasters: No, these measures are not enough. Only last week we saw energy bills going up in the middle of a very real cost-of-living crisis which is causing people real hardship. All we’ve got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn’t even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save 400 on everybody’s bill. So it isn’t enough, it’s too little, it’s too late. The Liberal Democrats said plans to build new nuclear reactors could add £96 a year to household energy bills and would be an “energy betrayal”. The added cost would come about if each household paid an additional £12 a year for eight new reactors, the party said. The party’s leader Ed Davey said: People are facing eye-watering hikes to energy bills and are looking to the government for urgent help now. But instead of rapidly reducing energy costs by expanding onshore wind and insulating homes, the government’s nuclear plans will add almost 100 to annual household bills. This is an energy betrayal that will add to the pain facing households on the brink. Instead of offering the help families need, the Conservatives seem happy for people’s record energy bills to get even higher. The UK Green Building Council (UKGBC), the progressive voice of over 650 organisations working together for a more sustainable built environment, has criticised the government’s lack of new energy efficiency measures in the energy security strategy, saying it was a missed opportunity. UKGBC’s director of communications, policy and places, Simon McWhirter said: Today was a chance to insulate the nation’s homes, protect us against future price hikes and tackle the painful effects of rising energy costs to households across the UK. This should have been the moment to show leadership and set out a comprehensive strategy to reduce energy demand. But despite the building industry standing ready to rise to the challenge, the Government has woefully missed its opportunity. He added: In the week the world’s climate scientists name energy efficiency as one of the most significant lower-cost solutions to address the climate crisis, the prime minister hasn’t even got a plan to stop heat leaking out of the windows, walls and roofs of the UK’s 29 million homes. Boris Johnson said measures to help people with bills in the short term will come from other government policies, rather than the newly unveiled energy strategy. The strategy has been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing energy demand through measures such as insulating homes. Speaking during a visit to the Hinkley Point C power plant, the prime minister said: This is a long-term energy security strategy, this is about supply, this is about undoing the mistakes of the past and taking the big decisions now. What we are also doing is looking after people who need to retrofit their homes, who need to put in lagging, who need to insulate their boilers - there is a 6 billion energy efficiency fund that we are already using to deliver very substantial savings to people. There is a 5,000 grant you can get if you want to change your boiler, we are also looking to see what we can do to champion heat pumps so they are made in this country rather than elsewhere, and we are setting up a 30 million ‘accelerator fund’ to do that. UK businesses are growing increasingly worried about rising energy and commodity prices. The latest analysis of the UK economy, from the Office for National Statistics, shows that rising input costs, and soaring energy bills, are the top two main concerns reported by businesses The ONS says businesses in the food and accommodation sector are particularly anxious about the jump in energy prices: Among specific concerns reported for the next month, energy prices saw the largest percentage point increase between February and March 2022, increasing from 15% in late February 2022 to 20% in late March 2022. The accommodation and food service activities industry reported the largest proportion of businesses noting rising energy prices as their main concern, at 35%. Other main concerns reported by businesses were: input price inflation (inflation of goods and services prices) at 23%, up from 21% in late February 2022 supply chain disruption at 6%, unchanged from late February 2022 taxation at 6%, up from 5% in late February 2022 For more business stories, you can follow our business liveblog here: The chairman of the commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee said the strategy was a “missed opportunity” to help households struggling with their bills. Labour MP Darren Jones said: For families and businesses across the country energy security means being able to turn the heating or electricity on knowing you can afford to pay the bill. Ministers continue to ignore the reality faced by of millions of people with yet another missed opportunity to help bill payers and a failure to announce funding for the home insulation works required to reduce the amount of heating needed in the first place. Replacing gas power with more nuclear power is lower carbon, but nuclear isn’t renewable and it isn’t cheap. It’s disappointing that the government has failed to seize the full opportunity of onshore wind and solar once again with no explanation other than disagreements within the Conservative party. Speaking at Hinkley Point C, Boris Johnson denied that the government was doing nothing to help families in the short-term, saying: We are really doing a huge amount for the immediate cost of living. This (energy strategy) is about tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future and we are never again subject to the vagaries of the global oil and gas prices and we can’t be subject to blackmail, as it were, from people such as Vladimir Putin, we have energy security here in the UK. It is a massive strategy for delivering 50GW – almost half the total energy capacity of this country – from offshore wind by 2030, totally reviving the nuclear industry which, I am afraid, has been more or less moribund in this country. This is the home of nuclear energy - we first split the atom in the UK, we had the first civilian nuclear power plant, we are bringing nuclear home. A former minister should be suspended from the Lords for a week for bullying a parliamentary security officer, a standards watchdog has recommended. The Lords conduct committee recommended that Labour’s Lord Pendry should receive the punishment following an incident in July 2021, PA News reports. The peer confronted a security guard who had found one of his guests walking unescorted near the Lords chamber in the Palace of Westminster. A report by Lords standards commissioner Akbar Khan found that Lord Pendry was “verbally aggressive” to the security guard and showed “intimidating behaviour”. Lord Pendry denied a claim he grabbed the guard’s radio, but the guard and a witness both described physical contact “in an inappropriate, unwarranted and non-socially distanced manner”. The House of Lords will be asked to agree the report and punishment early in the new session. Almost 3,000 Covid-19 deaths have been added to the UK’s official figures after the discovery of a data error. The cumulative number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus rose by an extra 2,714 on Wednesday, in addition to 233 newly reported deaths. It means the total number of deaths in the UK within 28 days of a positive test is 169,095. The UK Health Security Agency said: Due to a data processing error, a number of people who died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were not reported in a timely manner. The 2,714 deaths, all of which occurred in England this year, were added retrospectively to the government’s coronavirus dashboard on Wednesday evening. The revision to the figures narrows the gap slightly between the government’s preferred death toll, based only on people who have died within 28 days of testing positive, and the number of people who have had Covid-19 recorded on their death certificate, which is published by the Office for National Statistics and stands at just over 190,000. Both measures of Covid-19 mortality have shown a slight increase in recent weeks in the number of deaths occurring each day in the UK, reflecting the impact of the surge of infections driven by the Omicron variant. The daily death toll remains well below levels reached during the first and second waves of the virus. Boris Johnson said energy bills had been going up around the world and “absolutely soared” after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “We just can’t carry on like this,” the prime minister said in a social media video promoting his new energy strategy. The plan has been criticised for not saying enough about tackling high bills now, instead focusing on longer-term shifts in energy generation. Johnson said the plan would make British energy “cleaner, more affordable and more secure”. As well as the already announced £9bn package to help with rising costs, the government would “bring those bills downs” by “upgrading homes so they use less energy”. Ending dependence on foreign oil and gas would make supply more secure, he said, with a shift to British fossil fuels during the transition to cleaner forms of energy. That would involve “capturing their emissions and storing them safely under the sea”, he said – but carbon capture projects have been promised by successive governments without any real progress. Ed Miliband said the government should ban transgender conversion therapy. Speaking to Sky News, he said: I think there are strong views on lots of sides here but I’ll give you my perspective on this. I think that trans people face incredible barriers and stigma in our society. I was talking to a trans person the other day about this. I think the way this debate has been conducted – these anatomical debates – I think it is really awful for so many trans people in our country. Asked if transgender conversion therapy should be banned, he said “Yes”. He also spoke about transgender women taking part in female sport, saying there needs to be “fairness” and not a blanket ban. He said: I think that is a decision for the sporting bodies though ... I think it’s different in different sports. I think the principle here is that we need fairness in sport. Kwasi Kwarteng insisted chancellor Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, has not been “sheltering” herself from paying UK tax. He told BBC Breakfast: I was very interested in the transparency, it was very clear to me what’s happened. I think the chancellor has been very honest, very clear, and she’s after all a private citizen, she’s not a politician, and I think her affairs were completely transparent, and there’s no hint of any wrongdoing at all. So, I think everything is in order in that way. Asked if she was sheltering herself from tax, Kwarteng said: I don’t think that’s true at all, sheltering sounds as if you’re evading things. I think she’s been very clear, she’s been very transparent, the chancellor’s been very transparent, and this non-dom status has been part of the UK tax system for more than 200 years. Ed Miliband said Rishi Sunak’s wife claiming non-dom status is “legal, but is it right?” Speaking to Sky News, the shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, said: Non-dom status is legal but I think we should be clear that non-dom status is used to... pay less tax than you otherwise would. You don’t have to be a non-dom. You choose to do it... I think there are legitimate questions that need to be asked of Rishi Sunak about this. Asked if the move is above board, he said: I think it’s legal, but is it right? He also added that the Chancellor should issue an “explanation” about his wife’s decision. He is the UK chancellor asking people to pay more in taxes. Is it right that his immediate family is sheltering from UK taxes? I think Rishi Sunak and his family should reflect on that. Rishi Sunak’s multi-millionaire wife claims non-domicile status, it has emerged, which allows her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Akshata Murthy, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status, a scheme that allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings. Murthy, the daughter of Infosys’s billionaire founder, owns a 0.93% stake in the tech firm worth approximately £690m. The company’s most recent accounts suggest that Murthy’s stake would have yielded her £11.6m in dividend payments in the last tax year. Under UK tax laws, Murthy’s status as a non-dom would mean she would not have had to pay tax on the dividend payment from overseas companies. Infosys is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchange. By contrast, UK resident taxpayers pay a 38.1% tax on dividend payouts. A spokeswoman for Murthy said: Akshata Murthy is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents’ home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murthy is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income. The Treasury declined to comment. It comes a day after it was revealed that Sunak and Murthy donated more than £100,000 to the chancellor’s old private school, Winchester College. It is understood that Sunak, the chancellor, declared his wife’s tax status to the Cabinet Office when he became a minister in 2018, and he had also made the Treasury “aware, so as to manage any potential conflicts”. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow economic secretary to the treasury, said: The chancellor has imposed tax hike after tax hike on the British people. It is staggering that – at the same time – his family may have been benefiting from tax reduction schemes. This is yet another example of the Tories thinking it is one rule for them, another for everyone else. Rishi Sunak must now urgently explain how much he and his family have saved on their own tax bill at the same time he was putting taxes up for millions of working families and choosing to leave them £2,620 a year worse off. Read more here: Boris Johnson said “nuclear is coming home” as a result of the government’s energy strategy. In a social media video to promote the plan, which is finally being released on Thursday after repeated delays and cabinet wrangling, the prime minister said: In the country that was the first to split the atom, the first truly to harness its power to light our homes and drive our factories, we will once again lead the way. Nuclear is coming home. So instead of a new reactor every decade we will have a new reactor every year. For years, governments have dodged the big decisions on energy, but not this one. We’ve got the ambition, we’ve got the plan and we are going to bring clean, affordable secure power to the people for generations to come. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said it was “completely unfair” to scrutinise the tax affairs of the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s non-domiciled wife, Akshata Murty. He told Sky News: It’s completely unfair to be bringing someone who is not a politician and essentially attacking them in a way that’s happening. She made it very clear that as an Indian national she can’t have dual citizenship and she’s got non-dom status here in the UK. Now, after 15 years staying here she will be domiciled, but for the moment she pays tax on UK income, as I understand, and on foreign income she pays tax outside the UK – that’s what non-domiciled status means. But I’m not here to comment on her tax affairs. He added: I’m totally comfortable with people having businesses, people operating what they do as private citizens, I’m completely comfortable about that. I’m not an expert on her financial arrangements but I think absolutely people have a right to pursue their own business arrangements. I’ve just come here to say very clearly that I think her tax affairs are a matter for her. A former chief executive of Ofgem said the government’s energy security strategy does little to solve the cost-of-living crisis now and fails to improve the efficiency of homes. Dermot Nolan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Frankly it’s not something that’s that radically new and different. The disturbing thing to say at a time of rising energy prices is that there’s very little that can be done in the short run. Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels and the prices that consumers are going to pay will still depend on the price of gas. One failure, that could’ve helped in the short to medium run, is a lack of focus on energy efficiency, on insulation, on improving the quality of people’s homes – I think that is an opportunity missed. Ed Miliband has said that a few Tory backbenchers have been “holding the government’s energy policy to ransom”. Speaking to the BBC, Labour’s shadow climate change and net zero secretary said: Onshore wind is the cheapest, quickest form of energy we can get. It’s been blocked since 2015 because of government rules, not because of the views of the population ... but because a few Tory backbenchers are holding the government’s energy policy to ransom ... and people are paying higher bills as a result. Ministers have promised cleaner and more affordable energy to be made in the UK, aiming to make 95% of electricity low carbon by 2030. Miliband added: The government wanted to have a target to double onshore wind ... that is the equivalent of building five new nuclear power stations between now and 2030. I’m in favour of new nuclear but stations that the government is talking about today won’t be built for at least a decade. That’s why this strategy is so deeply flawed. The business secretary has admitted that the government’s energy security strategy will do little to help alleviate soaring fuel bills now, adding that it’s “more of a medium three, four, five year answer” ahead of its reveal later today. Pressed on the impact it will have on energy bills now, Kwasi Kwarteng told Sky News: You are right to say that the strategy is more of a medium term, three, four or five-year answer, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t address this. It’s really important that we get an energy strategy, an energy policy, that means we can have more security and independence in the year ahead. Kwarteng was asked if his department are deprioritising targets to reduce the climate crisis, which he dismissed: I think that the net zero legislation is, after all, in law, we’re focused on that. But, of course, given what’s happening around the world, given the pressure on energy prices, we’re also doing lots of other things to make sure we get energy independence back into the UK.

Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy claims Russia has launched 8,000 air strikes and fired 4,500 missiles throughout the war. He vows the attacks will not break Ukraine’s spirits as “to hear the enemy’s anthem on our land is scarier than the enemy’s rockets in our sky”. At least four people have been killed and 10 wounded in the latest attack from Russian troops, Ukraine has said. Several towns neighbouring the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant across the Dnieper River were hit by shelling, a statement from the presidential office said. Ukraine has shot down more than 300 Iranian Shahed-136 ‘kamikaze’ drones so far, an air force spokesperson, Yuriy Ihnat, told a briefing on Friday. The drones have become a key weapon in Russia’s arsenal during its war in Ukraine and have often been used in the past month to target crucial energy infrastructure. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has said that the “partial mobilisation” Russia announced in September was complete. Speaking at a meeting with president, Vladimir Putin, broadcast on state television, Shoigu said that 82,000 mobilised recruits were in the conflict zone, with a further 218,000 in training. The United States will provide $275 million in additional military assistance to Ukraine, including arms, munitions and equipment from US Department of Defense inventories, secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. “We are also working to provide Ukraine with the air defense capabilities it needs with the two initial US-provided Nasams ready for delivery to Ukraine next month and we are working with allies and partners to enable delivery of their own air defense systems to Ukraine,” Blinken said. Assets belonging to Russian and Belarusian individuals seized by Ukraine could be used for the country’s massive post-war reconstruction effort, finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, was quoted as saying. The government has frozen Russian and Belarusian assets in Ukraine worth some 44 billion hryvnias ($1.21 bn) since the start of Moscow’s invasion, according to the Economic Security Bureau, a state agency. The US and its allies condemned Russia for wasting the time of the UN security council and spreading conspiracies by again raising its accusation that the US has ‘military biological programmes’ in Ukraine. “How much more of this nonsense do we have to endure?” the UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, asked the council. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he had received a phone call from his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Friday and that he had demanded Tehran stop sending weapons to Russia. Ukraine and its western allies have accused Iran of sending ‘kamikaze’ drones to Russia which have then been used to devastating effect by Russian forces in strikes targeting Ukrainian infrastructure. Iran denies the charge. Russia has bolstered its troops with “mobilised reservists” west of the Dnieper River, the UK’s MoD says. Over the past six weeks, its ground forces have transitioned to a “defensive posture” on the frontline, likely due to being “severely undermanned” and “poorly trained”. The EU appoints Polish general Piotr Trytek to lead a new training operation with Ukrainian troops. Trytek, 51, was chosen by the bloc as part of its pledge to step up military support for Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin’s first deputy chief of staff visits the Russian-held Ukrainian city of Kherson. Sergei Kiriyenko stopped at the ferry port where hundreds of people were being removed after a warning from authorities. A Russian official’s threat to “strike” western satellites aiding Ukraine has raised concerns among space lawyers and industry executives about the safety of objects in orbit. No country has carried out a missile strike against an enemy’s satellite. The UN nuclear inspectors are expected to reach conclusion on “dirty bomb”. Investigators are being sent to two locations in Ukraine where Russia alleged the activities were taking place, and are expected to reach a conclusion “in days very fast”. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. The United States will provide $275 million in additional military assistance to Ukraine, including arms, munitions and equipment from US Department of Defense inventories, secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Friday. “We are also working to provide Ukraine with the air defense capabilities it needs with the two initial US-provided Nasams ready for delivery to Ukraine next month and we are working with allies and partners to enable delivery of their own air defense systems to Ukraine,” Blinken said. An apartment block lies in ruins after being hit by a Russian missile in Zaporizhzhia oblast. Assets belonging to Russian and Belarusian individuals seized by Ukraine could be used for the country’s massive post-war reconstruction effort, finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, was quoted as saying. The government has frozen Russian and Belarusian assets in Ukraine worth some 44 billion hryvnias ($1.21 bn) since the start of Moscow’s invasion, according to the Economic Security Bureau, a state agency. “We are currently looking for the resources necessary for [our] critical recovery,” Marchenko told Ukraine’s Suspilne public broadcaster, mooting the creation of a special liquidation fund as one budgetary source for the reconstruction. “Money seized on the territory of Ukraine from Russian and Belarusian citizens can be involved in this fund,” he added, without elaborating. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he had received a phone call from his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Friday and that he had demanded Tehran stop sending weapons to Russia. Ukraine and its western allies have accused Iran of sending ‘kamikaze’ drones to Russia which have then been used to devastating effect by Russian forces in strikes targeting Ukrainian infrastructure. Iran denies the charge. “I demanded Iran to immediately cease the flow of weapons to Russia used to kill civilians and destroy critical infrastructure in Ukraine,” Kuleba said in a tweet. Canada will sell a government-backed, five-year bond to raise money for Ukraine and it will impose new sanctions on 35 Russian individuals, including Gazprom executives, prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said. “Canadians will now be able to go to major banks to purchase their sovereignty bonds which will mature after five years with interest,” Trudeau told an annual meeting of the Congress of Ukrainian Canadians in Winnipeg. “These funds will go to support the government of Ukraine so they can continue to support the Ukrainian people,” he said. Canada has one of the world’s biggest Ukrainian diasporas outside of countries that border Ukraine, and the community has lobbied Ottawa to impose increasingly strict sanctions against Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February, Reuters reported. Trudeau did not say when the bonds would go on sale. The proceeds will “help the [Ukrainian] government continue operations, including providing essential services to Ukrainians, like pensions, and purchasing fuel before winter,” a statement said. The equivalent of the income raised will be channelled “directly to Ukraine” through an International Monetary Fund administered account, the statement said. Trudeau also announced new sanctions on 35 senior officials of energy sector entities, including Gazprom “and its subsidiaries,” according to a statement, plus six other “energy sector entities”. “We will continue to tighten the screws on anyone abetting this illegal invasion,” Trudeau said. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has said that the “partial mobilisation” Russia announced in September was complete. Speaking at a meeting with president, Vladimir Putin, broadcast on state television, Shoigu said that 82,000 mobilised recruits were in the conflict zone, with a further 218,000 in training. Dozens of Iranians have gathered in Kyiv in protest of Iran’s government allegedly delivering drones to Russia. The demonstrators gathered in the city’s Maidan Square holding signs reading “the Iranian people stand with Ukraine”, and waving both countries’ national flags. Ukraine and the west have accused Iran of supplying Russia with military equipment to use in attacks against citizens – claims which Iran has rejected. A former Russian president has told Elon Musk to pull his internet service Starlink in Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, was congratulating the businessman on his recent takeover of Twitter when he made the request. “Good luck in overcoming political bias and ideological dictatorship on Twitter. And quit that Starlink in Ukraine business,” he said. Starlink has proved vital for Ukraine’s communications with officials praising the program, which Musk previously said costs $20m per month. Musk and Medvedev last month shared an exchange in which the billionaire asked the Russian official how things were going in Bakhmut – a strategic town in the east Donbas region – to which he replied: “See you in Moscow on Victory Day!” At least four people have been killed and 10 wounded in the latest attack from Russian troops, Ukraine has said. Several towns neighbouring the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant across the Dnieper River were hit by shelling, a statement from the presidential office said. Dozens of residential buildings were damaged and power lines cut leaving thousands without a supply. Damaged flats at a residential building are seen in Nikopol, Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has plunged Europe into an era of insecurity, Germany said, a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, predicted a “dangerous” decade ahead. The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is from a wing of Germany’s Social Democrats that long argued for closer economic ties to Moscow, said the invasion had ruptured those hopes. “When we look at the Russia of today, there is no room for old dreams,” he said, referring to the former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev’s dream of a “common European home”. “It has also plunged us in Germany into another time, into an insecurity we thought we had overcome: a time marked by war, violence and flight, by concerns about the expansion of war into a wildfire in Europe,” he said. “Harder years, rough years are coming.” Germany, which has joined European sanctions against Russia and weapons deliveries to Ukraine, has recorded the arrival of more than a million Ukrainian refugees and warned of possible energy shortages this winter after cuts in Russian gas supplies, Reuters reported. In a war, there are many fronts and many forms of resistance. Ievgen Klopotenko, a Ukrainian chef, is fighting his war with soup. In defiance of the Russian cruise missile and drone attacks that have hit Kyiv recently, Klopotenko was last week presiding over his bustling city centre restaurant. On the menu were dishes such as beetroot and herring salad with smoked pear from the Odesa region, venison from the Carpathians, and a dessert named “Kherson is Ukraine”. Alongside a citrus semifreddo, the pudding included watermelon that he had bought last season in Kherson and fermented. The region, which Vladimir Putin claimed to have annexed last month but is now the site of fierce fighting, is famous for the fruit. And, of course, Klopotenko was serving borscht. In this case, with a touch of plum jam to balance out the sourness of the beetroot. For a hint of smokiness, it had been cooked slow and low in a wood-fired oven, as if “under a duvet”. Ukraine has shot down more than 300 Iranian Shahed-136 ‘kamikaze’ drones so far, an air force spokesperson, Yuriy Ihnat, told a briefing on Friday. The drones have become a key weapon in Russia’s arsenal during its war in Ukraine and have often been used in the past month to target crucial energy infrastructure. Iran has denied Ukrainian and western accusations that it is supplying drones to Russia. Standing in the dark beside the wreckage of a downed drone, Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed that widespread Russian attacks on power plants would not break Ukrainian spirits. The Ukrainian president made his daily address outside after Russia aimed missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles at Ukraine’s electricity generating network over the last two weeks, causing major damage and triggering blackouts. “Shelling will not break us – to hear the enemy’s anthem on our land is scarier than the enemy’s rockets in our sky. We are not afraid of the dark,” Zelenskiy said. The US and its allies condemned Russia for wasting the time of the UN security council and spreading conspiracies by again raising its accusation that the US has ‘military biological programmes’ in Ukraine. “How much more of this nonsense do we have to endure?” the UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, asked the council. Russia has previously raised at least twice at the security council the issue of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine – while Washington and Kyiv say they do not exist. Russia is pushing for a formal inquiry. It’s 1pm in Kyiv – here are the day’s events so far. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy claims Russia has launched 8,000 air strikes and fired 4,500 missiles throughout the war. He vows the attacks will not break Ukraine’s spirits as “to hear the enemy’s anthem on our land is scarier than the enemy’s rockets in our sky”. The US dismisses Russian accusations it is helping Ukraine engage with banned biological weapons. It claims Russia is attempting to “distract from the atrocities” being carried out in Ukraine, calling the allegations “pure fabrications brought forth without a shred of evidence”. Russia has bolstered its troops with “mobilised reservists” west of the Dnieper River, the UK’s MoD says. Over the past six weeks, its ground forces have transitioned to a “defensive posture” on the frontline, likely due to being “severely undermanned” and “poorly trained”. The EU appoints Polish general Piotr Trytek to lead a new training operation with Ukrainian troops. Trytek, 51, was chosen by the bloc as part of its pledge to step up military support for Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin’s first deputy chief of staff visits the Russian-held Ukrainian city of Kherson. Sergei Kiriyenko stopped at the ferry port where hundreds of people were being removed after a warning from authorities. A Russian official’s threat to “strike” western satellites aiding Ukraine has raised concerns among space lawyers and industry executives about the safety of objects in orbit. No country has carried out a missile strike against an enemy’s satellite. The UN nuclear inspectors are expected to reach conclusion on “dirty bomb”. Investigators are being sent to two locations in Ukraine where Russia alleged the activities were taking place, and are expected to reach a conclusion “in days very fast”. Russia claims only 3% of food exported under the UN-brokered Black Sea export deal has gone to the poorest countries. Several tonnes of grain have left blockaded Ukrainian ports since the contract was signed, however, Russia says Ukraine has failed to deliver humanitarian food assistance. The US is sceptical of Putin’s claim to have no intention of using nuclear weapons. Putin had played down a nuclear standoff insisting Russia had not threatened to use nuclear weapons, and had only responded to nuclear “blackmail” from western leaders. That’s all from me, Zaina Alibhai, today. My colleague Tom Ambrose will continue to bring you the latest from Ukraine. Only 3% of food exported under a UN-brokered deal has gone to the poorest countries, Russia has claimed. Since the Black Sea grain export contract was signed in July, several tonnes of corn, wheat, sunflower products, barley, rapeseed. and soya have left the blockaded Ukrainian ports. However, Russia has accused Ukraine of failing to deliver humanitarian food assistance. “The geography of the recipients of these cargoes has turned out to be completely inconsistent with the initially declared humanitarian objectives,” a statement read. “Needy states such as Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan, (and) Afghanistan have received just 3% of food, mostly from the World Food Programme.” Russia has previously complained of problems with the export deal raising fears it could pull out altogether unless its demands are met. The war in Ukraine has seen Russia launch more than 8,000 air strikes and fire 4,500 missiles, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed. Standing beside the wreckage of a downed Iranian drone, he vowed that Putin’s attacks on power plants would not break Ukrainian spirits. Russia had aimed dozens of missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles at Ukraine’s electricity network causing widespread power cuts over the last two weeks, with Ukraine shooting down 23 drones in the last two days alone. “Shelling will not break us – to hear the enemy’s anthem on our land is scarier than the enemy’s rockets in our sky. We are not afraid of the dark,” Zelenskiy said. The US has dismissed accusations from Russia that its defence department was helping Ukraine engage with banned biological weapons. Calling the allegations “pure fabrications brought forth without a shred of evidence”, the US claimed Russia was attempting to “distract from the atrocities” being carried out in Ukraine. “Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program. The United States does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States,” the US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. Russia’s United Nations ambassador said the country would pursue an investigation that both the US and Ukraine violated the convention prohibiting use. Russia has probably bolstered its troops with “mobilised reservists” west of the Dnieper River, the UK’s ministry of defence has said. The region encompasses most of Kherson, a strategically important Russian-held city braced for a counter-offensive from Ukrainian troops. Over the past six weeks, Russian ground forces have transitioned to a “defensive posture” on the frontline, probably due to being “severely undermanned” and “poorly trained”, the MoD’s daily intelligence update stated. It added that even if Russia were to consolidate its defensive lines across Ukraine, its operations would still remain vulnerable. The European Union has appointed a Polish general to lead a new training operation with Ukrainian troops. Piotr Trytek, commander of Poland’s 11th armoured cavalry division who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was chosen by the bloc as it sought to step up military support for Ukraine. “It is a huge responsibility but also recognition of Poland’s position in the international arena,” the country’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said. The announcement follows the launch of the EU’s military assistance mission which will be headquartered in Belgium, with command centres in Poland and Germany. President Vladimir Putin’s first deputy chief of staff has visited the Russian-held Ukrainian city of Kherson. Sergei Kiriyenko, the former head of the nuclear power company Rosatom, stopped at the ferry port from where hundreds of people were being evacuated, the governor of Crimea said. “The work on organising the departure of residents has been completed,” Sergei Aksyonov added. Russia is braced for a Ukrainian offensive in Kherson and urged residents to evacuate. Men who remain in the city have been invited to join a local militia. Kiriyenko, one of the most powerful officials in the Kremlin, also met with staff at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. My colleagues in the UK will be taking you through the latest for the next while. Here is a summary of recent developments: Japan is expected to announce a huge stimulus package to cushion the economy from the impact of a weak yen and inflation, though the central bank refused to budge from the ultra-loose policy that has hammered the currency, AFP reports. The spending package is expected to include measures to encourage wage growth and support households with energy bills, which have spiked since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ahead of cabinet approval for the relief measures, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the government would “seek swift approval” of an extra budget worth ¥29.1tn (around $200bn). Prices are rising in Japan at their fastest rate in eight years, although the 3% inflation rate remains well below the sky-high levels seen in the United States and elsewhere. The yen has also lost more than a fifth of its value against the dollar this year, prompting authorities to intervene to prop up the currency. A Norway-style windfall tax on energy companies could raise £33.3bn extra by 2027, plugging a hole in government finances and helping keep energy bills low, analysis has found. The new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is looking at extending the “sunset clause” in the energy profits levy by two years beyond 2025 as a result of the booming profits fossil fuel companies have been recording owing to the war in Ukraine. But the environmental thinktank Green Alliance says he could go one step further and increase the levy by 13 percentage points, to 78%, which would match Norway’s tax rate on North Sea oil and gas firms. Currently, the UK government has put an extra levy of 25% on the firms, on top of the existing 40% tax, bringing the total tax to 65%. Increasing it further to match Norway would raise an additional £6.6bn a year until 2027, the thinktank says, making up 17% of the £40bn-a-year fiscal hole, or equivalent to annual spending on policing and fire services: A Russian official’s threat this week to “strike” western satellites aiding Ukraine highlights an untested area of international law, raising concerns among space lawyers and industry executives about the safety of objects in orbit, Reuters reports. “Quasi-civilian infrastructure may be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike,” a senior foreign ministry official Konstantin Vorontsov told the United Nations, reiterating Moscow’s position that western civilian and commercial satellites helping Ukraine’s war effort was “an extremely dangerous trend”. No country has carried out a missile strike against an enemy’s satellite. Such an act during the war in Ukraine could sharply escalate tensions between Russia and the United States. “This threat has brought us to a brink that we’ve never been to before,” said Michelle Hanlon, co-director of the University of Mississippi School of Law’s Air and Space Law program. “There’s always been a sense that this could happen, but never has somebody actually said that they might do that out loud.” Ukraine’s military relies heavily on Elon Musk’s SpaceX for broadband internet beamed from its low-Earth orbiting Starlink satellite network. US firms like Maxar are capturing images of the war from satellites in orbit. And tens of thousands of communications devices in Ukraine rely on the US satellite communications giant Iridium’s satellite network. Under the laws of armed conflict, a Russian strike on a private US company’s satellite could be seen as an act of war to which the US could respond, Hanlon said. White House spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday that any attack on US infrastructure would be met with a response but he did not go into detail. “The legal aspects of all this are really murky at the moment,” said Brian Weeden, a space policy analyst at the Secure World Foundation. “We don’t have any examples of wartime uses of force against satellites.” The UN nuclear chief said Thursday he is sending inspectors to two locations in Ukraine where Russia alleged that activities related to the possible production of “dirty bombs” was taking place and expects them to reach a conclusion “in days very fast.” Rafael Grossi said inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency would be traveling this week to the two sites, which are under IAEA safeguards, following a written request from the Ukrainian government. Russia’s UN ambassador alleged in a letter to Security Council members this week that Ukraine’s Institute for Nuclear Research of the National Academy of Sciences in Kyiv and Vostochniy Mining and Processing Plant “have received direct orders from Zelenskyy’s regime to develop such a dirty bomb.” The envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said that information was from Russia’s Ministry of Defense. He said the ministry reported that work on a dirty bomb, which uses explosives to scatter radioactive waste in an effort to sow terror, is “at their concluding stage.” Grossi said: “The purpose of this week’s safeguards visits is to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and materials related to the development of ‘dirty bombs.”’ US President Joe Biden expressed scepticism on Thursday about Russian President Vladimir Putin‘s comment that he had no intention of using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Putin, in a speech earlier in the day, played down a nuclear standoff with the West, insisting Russia had not threatened to use nuclear weapons and had only responded to nuclear “blackmail” from Western leaders. “If he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it? Why is he talking about the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon?” Biden said in an interview with NewsNation. “He’s been very dangerous in how he’s approached this,” Biden said. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly said in recent weeks that Russia could use nuclear weapons to protect its territorial integrity, remarks interpreted in the West as implicit threats to use them to defend parts of Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. In an interview earlier on CNN, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said it was possible Russia was considering the use of a so-called dirty bomb and was setting up a pretext to blame Ukraine. But he said the United States still had not seen any signs that was necessarily the case. “They often blame others for that which they are doing themselves or about to do. So that’s why we have to take that seriously,” Kirby said of Putin‘s allegations. “I’ll also tell you that we’re not seeing any signs, even today, that the Russians are planning to use a dirty bomb or to even make preparations for that.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest for the next few hours. US President Joe Biden expressed scepticism about Putin’s comment that he had no intention of using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. “If he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it?,” Biden said in an interview with NewsNation. And the UN nuclear chief said Thursday he is sending inspectors to two locations in Ukraine where Russia alleged that activities related to the possible production of “dirty bombs” was taking place and expects them to reach a conclusion “in days very fast.” Rafael Grossi said inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency would be traveling this week to the two sites, which are under IAEA safeguards, following a written request from the Ukrainian government. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime here are the other key recent developments: Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the war in Ukraine is part of Russia’s wider struggle against western domination. “We are standing at a historical frontier: Ahead is probably the most dangerous, unpredictable and, at the same time, important decade since the end of World War Two,” he said. Putin said he ordered his defence minister to call top Nato commanders this week over the potential detonation of a “dirty bomb” in Ukraine. Putin claimed that Russia knew “about an incident with a so-called ‘dirty bomb’ being prepared”, and that Russia knew “where, generally, it was being prepared” in a speech near Moscow on Thursday. He gave no evidence of the alleged plot. Fighting on the ground appears to have slowed in recent days, with Ukrainian officials saying tough terrain and bad weather had held up their main advance in the southern Kherson province. On Thursday a close ally of Putin, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, said 23 of his soldiers had been killed and 58 others wounded in a Ukrainian artillery attack this week in Kherson region. After the attack, Chechen forces carried out a revenge attack and killed about 70 Ukrainians, he claimed. Ukrainians living in and around Kyiv have been told of a “sharp deterioration” in the region’s electricity supply after a fresh wave of Russian strikes aimed at sapping public morale as the country’s cold winter approaches. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s occupied region of Zaporizhzhia ordered phone checks on local residents on Thursday, announcing the implementation of military censorship under Putin’s martial law decree. Moscow has said that provisions of the Black Sea grain deal to ease Russian agricultural and fertiliser exports were not being met, and that it was yet to make a decision on whether the agreement should be extended. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told reporters that the west had not taken sufficient steps to ease sanctions on Russia’s logistics, payments and insurance industries to facilitate Russia’s exports. The United States has not seen anything to indicate that Russia’s ongoing annual ‘Grom’ exercises of its nuclear forces may be a cover for a real deployment, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said on Thursday. “We haven’t seen anything to cause us to believe, at this point, that is some kind of cover activity,” Austin told reporters. An oil depot in the Russian-occupied city of Shakhtarsk, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk, was engulfed in flames overnight on Wednesday. The city’s Russian-installed mayor, Alexander Shatov, claimed the fire was caused by Ukrainian shelling of the railway station. The US is sending Ukraine a new $275m package of weapons and other aid, in a move to bolster the effort to drive Russian forces out of key areas in the south as the winter closes in, US officials said on Thursday. Ukrainian authorities say they will launch a criminal case against Russia’s children’s rights commissioner, accusing her of enabling the abduction and forced adoption of thousands of vulnerable Ukrainian children. Russian journalist and Putin’s rumoured goddaughter has fled to Lithuania, intelligence services in Vilnius said, after police in Moscow raided one of her homes. Ksenia Sobchak is the daughter of the former mayor of St Petersburg Anatoly Sobchak, whom Putin has previously described as his mentor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/feb/25/scott-morrison-denounces-china-for-offering-russia-trade-lifeline","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-25T03:40:39Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison denounces China for offering Russia trade ‘lifeline’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/scott-morrison-denounces-china-for-offering-russia-trade-lifeline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/scott-morrison-denounces-china-for-offering-russia-trade-lifeline","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison denounces China for offering Russia trade ‘lifeline’","bodyText":"Australia has vowed to provide nonlethal military equipment and medical supplies to Ukraine, as the prime minister accused China of offering Russia a trade “lifeline” after Thursday’s invasion. The Ukrainian government is pleading for international support and tougher sanctions as it reports at least 137 people have died so far in the fighting, while the UN refugee agency estimates 100,000 have already fled their homes. The US has warned that Russia appears intent to “encircle and threaten” the capital Kyiv, where explosions were heard in the early hours of Friday. Russian forces are said to have captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Scott Morrison said on Friday the Australian government was “extremely concerned at the terrible violence that we have seen inflicted on the people of Ukraine by Russia” in its “unwarranted, unprovoked” invasion. “I want to confirm that we have been working with Nato to ensure that we can provide nonlethal military equipment and medical supplies to support the people of Ukraine,” the prime minister told reporters in Adelaide. He said Australia was “a long way from Ukraine” and the most effective way to provide that support was “through that Nato channel”. Morrison said he could not go into much detail about the support but “you can rest assured that we are working very closely with those partners and allies to support them in their time of need”. He said the Australian government would continue to work with its close allies and partners to impose “a rolling wave of sanctions”, including on oligarchs whose economic weight was of strategic significance to Moscow. The Australian sanctions would also be extended to cover “key Belarusian individuals and entities complicit in the aggression”. Morrison said the coordinated action was intended to “demonstrate very forcefully that we are all working together to shut Russia out as a result of their violence and their unlawful actions”. But Morrison said he was “particularly concerned” by the lack of a strong response from China. He cited a report that China was fully opening up to Russian wheat exports, which had previously been subject to health-related restrictions. The South China Morning Post reported that the announcement was made public hours after the Russian invasion began on Thursday, but was the result of a package of deals made when Vladimir Putin visited Beijing at the beginning of February. Morrison said it was “inexplicable” and “completely unacceptable” for the Chinese government to ease trade restrictions on Russia at a time when other countries were ratcheting up sanctions for the invasion. “You don’t go and throw a lifeline to Russia in the middle of a period when they’re invading another country,” he said. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, also criticised China for lifting the trade restrictions with Russia. “It’s doing the opposite of what it should be doing,” Albanese told reporters in Tasmania. “This is a unilateral decision by Vladimir Putin to be the aggressor against a sovereign state with tragic consequences – and that’s why all countries should condemn it.” Comment has been sought from the Chinese embassy, but China’s longstanding and repeated position is that “all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected”. It cites that position to urge other countries not to speak up about Taiwan, which is a self-governed democracy of 24 million people but which Beijing regards as its breakaway territory that will one day be “reunited” with the mainland. At a daily press conference in Beijing on Thursday, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, declined to use the word “invasion” in relation to Russia’s actions. Hua said the situation in Ukraine had “a complicated historical background and context” and urged “all sides to exercise restraint and prevent the situation from getting out of control”. “The current state of affairs is not what we would hope to see,” she said. Hua said it was “quite offensive” to ask whether China’s Xi Jinping had given Putin his blessing to attack Ukraine, insisting that Russia “makes its foreign policy decisions independently” and China was not a direct party to the conflict. Putin and Xi agreed to formalise closer ties between Russia and China at the beginning of the Beijing Winter Olympics three weeks ago, described it at the time as a “no limits” friendship. The Putin-Xi agreement did not mention “Ukraine” – but it included a passage of support for Putin’s position against the enlargement of Nato. China also said at the time it was “sympathetic to and supports the proposals put forward by the Russian Federation to create long-term legally binding security guarantees in Europe”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, speculated that Beijing was “probably watching to see what the world reaction is so that they can make their own calculations down the track in relation to Taiwan”. The Russian embassy in Canberra defended the “special military operation”, which it said was intended to “demilitarise” Ukraine by targeting military infrastructure, air defence facilities and military airfields. “There is no objective to occupy Ukraine,” the embassy said in a statement on Friday. “The decision to conduct the operation is not to hurt the interests of Ukraine or the Ukrainian people, but rather to defend our country from those who have taken Ukraine hostage and have been trying to use it against Russia and our people.” Amid ongoing diplomatic tensions between China and Australia, Morrison played down the significance of a gesture from the new Chinese ambassador, Xiao Qian, who said on Thursday the two countries should “meet each other halfway” and “look into the future”. Morrison said diplomatic channels were not fully open because China had blocked meetings with Australian ministers and political leaders. The prime minister said while he would be happy to talk, the 14 points on the list of grievances issued by the Chinese embassy in 2020 were “not for negotiating”. “In terms of meeting halfway, there are 14 points. I don’t agree with changing any of them,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2021/dec/30/people-seem-to-be-looking-for-another-way-of-living-how-taunton-became-property-hotspot","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-30T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘People seem to be looking for another way of living’: how Taunton became property hotspot ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/30/people-seem-to-be-looking-for-another-way-of-living-how-taunton-became-property-hotspot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2021/dec/30/people-seem-to-be-looking-for-another-way-of-living-how-taunton-became-property-hotspot","fields":{"headline":"‘People seem to be looking for another way of living’: how Taunton became property hotspot ","bodyText":"When Covid first hit, Jack Battersby, residential sales manager at Taunton’s Wilkie May &amp; Tuckwood estate agents, set up in his spare room and fretted that lean times were ahead. “It didn’t turn out like that. Business has been great,” said Batttersby as his desk phone rang constantly and messages pinged on his mobile. “We’re getting customers from all over – people from London and the south-east who since Covid are working from home so they might as well be here, but also people moving from places like Bristol and Exeter because they get more for their money.” Battersby was not surprised to see Somerset’s county town topping the Halifax’s UK house price growth table, with a 21.8% increase to £315,759. “There’s brilliant countryside all around but we’re also well connected.” Taunton is surrounded by high ground – Exmoor, the Quantock Hills, the Blackdown Hills – and the surfing beaches of north Devon and Cornwall are easy to reach. But the town is also just an hour’s drive from Bristol and by rail London Paddington is less than two hours away. Hannah Thomas, a negotiator at another estate agency, Greenslade Taylor Hunt, said properties were snapped up within days. “It’s been a mad year in a good way,” she said. Thomas said families were keen to move into neighbourhoods on the edge of town in good catchment areas such as Trull, where an end-of-terrace Victorian cottage is on the market for £350,000. “We’re also getting larger families moving in, for example three generations living together in a larger house. People seem to be looking for different ways of living.” Another reason for the property boom, according to Thomas, is the new nuclear power station Hinkley Point C, which is being built on the Somerset coast 17 miles north of Taunton. Some employees who will be there for a while are buying homes, while investors are hunting houses to rent out rooms to temporary workers. Taunton is also attracting retirees. Quantock House, for example, has apartments for the over-55s who can enjoy an in-house bistro, treatment rooms and balconies with views to the hills. Hundreds more homes are being built as developers try to meet the demand. But this is causing disruption, puncturing the quiet that incomers crave. “The constant building and shutting down roads for the construction traffic is a pain,” said Nicky Heal, who owns Nicky’s Flower Studio. Chris Birch, who runs the upmarket ready meals shop, Cook, said he had moved from Surrey for the quiet life but warned Taunton was not perfect, reeling off the shops that have shut recently, including a large Debenhams department store. There has not yet been a boom in businesses such as trendy coffee bars that incoming Londoners might like. “Who would invest at the moment?” said Birch. And anyone hoping for a cutting edge arts scene might find Taunton wanting. The town has a theatre and arts complex, Taunton Brewhouse, but few would claim hipness for the town. The tourist information centre flags up its flower show (est 1831) before its nightlife. Taunton has no top flight football or rugby club, though the town’s skyline is dominated by the floodlights of the country cricket ground. There are also losers from the booming property market. Charities who work with the homeless have reported a very busy Christmas getting emergency supplies out to the most vulnerable and the rising property prices are making it harder for younger people and those in poorer-paid employment to get on the property ladder. Concerns are growing that local people could be pushed out by the rising prices – as they have been in places like Bristol and further west like St Mawes in Cornwall. Gross weekly pay in Somerset is £567 compared with £577 in the south-west as a whole and £613 in Great Britain. Figures released by the government in the summer revealed that more than 20,000 families in the south-west were made homeless or threatened with losing their homes during the first phase of the pandemic. Somerset West and Taunton council acknowledges that lack of affordable housing is an issue in the area and is aiming to build 1,000 new council homes in the next 30 years . It has also drawn up a plan to end rough sleeping by 2027 and has taken steps to try to tackle the problem such as leasing out affordable accommodation to medical students at a new development called Coal Orchard in the town. Property hunting in Taunton on Wednesday were the Procter family from Berkshire. Dad Peter said he, his wife and two young children were looking for a change of scene. “It feels too busy where we live,” said Procter. “I could work from home and could get into the office in London once or twice a week if we lived here. It will be a bit of extra effort for me but it will mean we all have much fresher air, a slower way of life, which I think most people need just now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2022/mar/08/joe-biden-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-09T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Biden’s impossible bind: how should the US tackle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/joe-biden-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/joe-biden-ukraine-russia","fields":{"headline":"Biden’s impossible bind: how should the US tackle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?","bodyText":"It is an impossible bind. Joe Biden faces demands for America to do more as Ukrainian civilians are terrorized and killed by Russia. But he is also determined to avoid going down in history as the US president who started a third world war. Russia has pummeled Ukraine with more than 625 missiles so far, according to the Pentagon, causing untold death and destruction and prompting an exodus of 2m refugees. Vladimir Putin is now reportedly recruiting Syrian mercenaries and preparing to level cities in a bid to break Ukrainians’ will in the face of his invasion. In response, the US president has imposed unprecedented sanctions and joined allies in turning Russia into a global pariah. Last month he authorised $350m in military aid to Ukraine and he has given officials the go ahead to share intelligence with Kyiv at a “frenetic” pace. But none of this has prevented a humanitarian catastrophe that generates traumatic images on TVs and newspaper front pages. For many in America there is a sense of anger, frustration and impotence: why can the world’s biggest military superpower not intervene? A vocal minority contends that Biden can and should. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican congressman and veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, has urged Nato to declare a “no-fly zone” to disrupt Russian air operations and “give the heroic Ukrainians a fair fight”. The call has been echoed by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Nato of “weakness” and “disunity” after the alliance ruled it out. But the Biden administration has firmly rejected the idea, wary that it might require US forces to shoot down Russian aircraft and so draw the two nuclear-armed nations into confrontation. Its caution-first approach posits a three-dimensional chess game in which one bad move could herald disaster. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday: “For everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the president also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war, with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe. That’s clearly not our interest. What we’re trying to do is end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one.” Most members of Congress appear to be on the same page. Both Democrats and Republicans have warned that, with his back against the wall and his state of mind in question, Putin could lash out in unpredictable ways. Republican Marco Rubio, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos: “A no-fly zone has become a catchphrase. I’m not sure a lot of people fully understand what that means. That means flying Awacs [airborne warning and control system] 24 hours a day. That means the willingness to shoot down and engage Russian airplanes in the sky. “That means, frankly, you can’t put those planes up there unless you’re willing to knock out the anti-aircraft systems that the Russians have deployed, and not just in Ukraine, but in Russia and also in Belarus … It means starting world war III.” Biden is keenly aware how the law of unintended consequences has haunted past US presidents during military misadventures in Vietnam and Iraq. Neo-conservative nation-building has fallen into disrepute. Last year Biden ended the country’s longest war, in Afghanistan, so he has little appetite for starting a new one. But non-intervention also carries a moral price. In 2011, when Biden was vice-president, Barack Obama declared that the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad should step aside, but he resisted calls to send in US troops even as the regime killed, jailed, tortured and unleashed chemical weapons on its own people. Hawks in Washington are urging Biden to avoid a similar scenario. John Bolton, a member of Republican administrations since Ronald Reagan was president, said: “If you believe that you put Nato’s planes in the sky over Ukraine and there’s an engagement between a Nato plane and a Russian plane, and from that one single engagement in an instant you’re at world war III, then you have given Russia incredible leverage over us. “They’re now deterring us and that really is the argument: ‘No-fly zone will lead to world war III.’ That’s not true.” Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator, went even further by suggesting in a tweet that Putin should be assassinated – a comment that illustrated how quickly hostile rhetoric could spiral out of control. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, responded flatly: “That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you’d hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration.” Short of a no-fly zone, Zelenskiy has asked for Soviet-era MiG-29 jets, which Ukrainian pilots are capable of operating. On Tuesday Poland agreed to send all its MiG-29s “immediately and free of charge” to an American air base in Germany so they can be delivered to Ukraine. But the timing remains uncertain. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, said: “The clock is ticking and Russia is attacking Ukraine’s airfields. President Biden needs to get this MiG transfer done and he needs to get it done today. Ukraine doesn’t have time for paperwork. Load these MiGs up and get them to Ukrainian pilots who can still make a difference. Don’t slow walk this.” But the Pentagon then appeared to scupper – or at least delay – the plan, saying it was not “tenable”. In a statement, the Pentagon said the prospect of the jets departing from a US airbase “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance”. In the meantime Biden has banned all imports of Russian oil and gas, “targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy” despite domestic political risks, and raised the level of US troops in Europe to about 100,000. He is locked in the most dangerous showdown with a Russian leader since John F Kennedy went head to head with Nikita Khrushchev in the Cuban missile crisis 60 years ago. Lawrence Haas, a former communications director for Vice-President Al Gore and author of the book The Kennedys in the World, said: “Biden needs to calibrate his response to reduce the chances that this crisis will escalate out of control. He has made clear that we’re not going to send US troops and Nato’s not going to send troops and I think that’s reasonable. “But I do believe that he could ramp up the sanctions to the maximum extent possible and also provide more weaponry to Ukraine to fight its own battle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/may/30/conservatives-denial-party-difficulties-tobias-ellwood-boris-johnson-partygate-uk-politics-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-30T16:37:14Z","webTitle":"Tory MP tells Boris Johnson to have vote of confidence to ‘end speculation’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/may/30/conservatives-denial-party-difficulties-tobias-ellwood-boris-johnson-partygate-uk-politics-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/may/30/conservatives-denial-party-difficulties-tobias-ellwood-boris-johnson-partygate-uk-politics-latest","fields":{"headline":"Tory MP tells Boris Johnson to have vote of confidence to ‘end speculation’ – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of the key development from the day: Boris Johnson is facing continued pressure from within his own party as the fallout from Partygate rumbles on and more MPs call for him to resign as prime minister. Former Tory minister Tobias Ellwood said the Conservative party stills seemed to be “in denial”. Jeremy Wright, a former culture secretary and attorney general, has become the latest Tory MP to call for Boris Johnson to resign – although his statement saying this disappeared from his website, before reappearing. In the statement, the Kenilworth and Southam MP said the saga had done “real and lasting damage to the reputation not just of this government but to the institutions and authority of government more generally”. The Conservative MP Elliot Colburn has submitted a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, Boris Johnson. In an email to a constituent, Colburn reportedly said: “I am especially appalled at the revelations of the poor treatment of security and cleaning staff … so my letter remains submitted.” Nickie Aiken has called on Boris Johnson to submit himself to a vote of confidence to “end speculation”, Tom Larkin of Sky News is reporting. The Tory MP told constituents that “events in Downing St during the pandemic has damaged the govt and Conservative Party”. Downing Street has refused to deny that a social event took place in Boris Johnson’s flat during lockdown that was not considered by the Sue Gray inquiry, but officials insisted there is no need to reopen any investigations and that the matter is closed. A culture minister has said it is not “immediately obvious” that there should be an investigation into an alleged second event at No 10 hosted by the prime minister’s wife. Chris Philp was asked on Sky News about reports emerging at the weekend that Carrie Johnson had organised a couple of parties in the Downing Street flat. “Well, I think we have had an unbelievably comprehensive set of investigations going on now for a period of nearly six months,” he said. Boris Johnson is “abusing the ministerial code” by redrafting it to reduce the potential sanctions for ministers who break rules, a former member of the government’s ethical standards watchdog has said, urging Conservative MPs to challenge this. Jane Martin, who served on the committee on standards in public life for five years until December 2021, said Johnson had wrongly used a report by her committee as a spur to weaken the code. Half of Britons believe the wrong people will be held accountable for Partygate, a survey has found. The Ipsos poll, conducted after the release of Sue Gray’s report into lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street, found only 41% of people were confident the report would lead to the right people being held accountable while 50% said they were not confident. Yesterday, the Observer reported Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s former principal private secretary, who quit in February following outrage about Partygate, could be the next UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia but Paul Waugh of the i paper has now heard he instead might be lined up for a senior international trade post. This is perhaps due to the reaction people had to the idea of the man mentioned 24 times in the Sue Gray report representing the Queen as the ambassador in Riyadh. Labour has said that the take-up of the government’s flagship tutoring programme is so slow that all current secondary pupils in England will have left school by the time the Conservatives finally deliver on their education catch-up promises. At the rate of delivery for this academic year, Labour says that figure will not be reached for at least five and a half years, by which time all pupils currently in secondary school will have completed year 11 and moved on. Stormont parties have urged the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to back the election of a new speaker as the assembly was recalled on Monday. The Sinn Féin vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, told MLAs that people in Northern Ireland wanted action, not protest. Thanks so much for joining me today. I’ll be back again tomorrow. You can follow our Russia-Ukraine war liveblog here: Nickie Aiken has called on Boris Johnson to submit himself to a vote of confidence to “end speculation”, Tom Larkin of Sky News is reporting. The Tory MP told constituents that “events in Downing St during the pandemic has damaged the govt and Conservative Party”. Paul Waugh, the i paper’s chief political commentator, has this on Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s former principal private secretary, who quit in February following outrage about Partygate. Yesterday, the Observer reported “Party Marty” could be the next UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia but Waugh has now heard he instead might be lined up for a senior international trade post. This is perhaps due to the reaction people had to the idea of the man mentioned 24 times in the Sue Gray report representing the Queen as the ambassador in Riyadh. Waugh writes in his latest column: The man who was dubbed “Party Marty” for his “bring your own booze” invitation to a No 10 garden party saw his reputation further trashed after Gray’s final report revealed he had messaged that Downing Street had “got away with” one particular drinks event. Reynolds went back to the Foreign Office in February and has since been touted as the next UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia, so has he “got away with” Partygate more broadly? Well, I’m told that he is in fact being lined up by Johnson for a senior international trade post. If the ambassador role is seen as too embarrassing a reward for failure, the alternative trade job would suggest Johnson really does want to ease the pain for at least some of those who supported him. One source claimed that International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan opposed the proposed appointment and was overruled by No 10, but I understand the minister was not upset at all. If Reynolds does indeed get a new job, it appears he’ll have the full support of the Government. Johnson certainly has a history of trying to help out those who remain loyal to him. Despite Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly (both former deputies of his at City Hall) initially deciding to stand for Tory leadership against him in 2019, they soon joined his campaign team. Both now have key ministerial posts. The recruitment for a new director general of the National Crime Agency has been re-opened, with former Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe apparently the Prime Minister’s favourite. Today, No 10 failed to deny Johnson had intervened, saying only “the Prime Minister has no formal role in this process… a fair and open recruitment campaign is underway.” With a reshuffle pencilled into many Whitehall diaries for the end of June, after the expected double loss of the Tiverton and Wakefield by-elections, Johnson is expected once more to show what MPs call “misplaced loyalty” by sacking-not-sacking some key figures (moving Priti Patel from Home Office to party chair would surprise few). Labour has said that the take-up of the government’s flagship tutoring programme is so slow that all current secondary pupils in England will have left school by the time the Conservatives finally deliver on their education catch-up promises. The analysis follows the prime minister’s pledge from last summer that there would be 100m hours of small-group tutoring over a three-year period to help pupils in England who have fallen behind in their learning due to the disruption caused by the pandemic. However, according to analysis by Labour the figure would not be reached for at least five years, by which time all pupils currently in secondary school will have completed year 11 and moved on. You can read Sally Weale’s full report here: The conservative MP Elliot Colburn has submitted a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, Boris Johnson. 26 MPs have now called for the PM to stand down. In an email to a constituent, Colburn reportedly said: “I am especially appalled at the revelations of the poor treatment of security and cleaning staff … so my letter remains submitted.” You can read the full story here: The Welsh government has said is to press ahead with plans to increase the number of Senedd members, despite opposition from senior Conservatives. PA reports: The reforms, proposed by Labour and Plaid Cymru as part of a cooperation agreement, would see the number of members increase from 60 to 96. Currently the Senedd remains smaller than its other devolved counterparts, with the Scottish parliament having 129 members and the Northern Ireland assembly having 90. A Senedd committee has backed the changes, saying a strengthened parliament would result in more powerful scrutiny of government and better representation of people in Wales. Welsh Tories have called for the expansion plan to be put to a referendum, with party leader Andrew RT Davies calling it a “waste of both time and money”. Stormont parties have urged the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to back the election of a new speaker as the assembly was recalled on Monday. The Sinn Féin vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, told MLAs that people in Northern Ireland wanted action, not protest. But the DUP MLA Paul Givan said the recall by Sinn Féin of the Stormont assembly was not a serious attempt to restore power sharing, telling MLAs: Today’s recall is another attempt at majority rule and has no credibility when it comes forward from the party that kept these institutions down for three years. Sinn Féin proposed a recall last week, supported by Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP). But a new speaker and the first and deputy first ministers cannot be installed without the DUP’s support. It has said it wants “action” first on the Northern Ireland protocol and has dismissed Sinn Fein’s move as a “stunt”. Two MLAs, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist party and Patsy McGlone of the SDLP, were nominated for the role of speaker. Under assembly rules, no business can take place after an election until a new speaker is elected. An attempt to do so on 13 May failed because it requires cross-community support from a majority of unionist and nationalist MLAs. O’Neill told the chamber: The people have spoken and they want action, not protest. They want the parties and every single MLA elected to this democratic institution to get their sleeves rolled up and to get down to business. The DUP’s standoff is with the public and not with the European Union. As I stand here today I am ready to work with others. Givan told the MLAs: The public will see the hypocrisy for what it is from Sinn Féin. This isn’t a serious attempt to restore the principles of power sharing and these institutions. It is a stunt. Read more here: Jeremy Wright, a former culture secretary and attorney general, has become the latest Tory MP to call for Boris Johnson to resign – although his statement saying this disappeared from his website before reappearing. In the statement, the Kenilworth and Southam MP said that while he could not be sure if Johnson knowingly misled MPs in denying that lockdown-breaking parties had taken place inside Downing Street, the saga had done “real and lasting damage to the reputation not just of this government but to the institutions and authority of government more generally”. He wrote: That matters because it is sadly likely that a government will again need to ask the citizens of this country to follow rules it will be difficult to comply with and to make sacrifices which will be hard to bear, in order to serve or preserve the greater good. The collective consequences of those citizens declining to do so may again be severe. Wright ended: It now seems to me that the prime minister remaining in office will hinder those crucial objectives. I have therefore, with regret, concluded that, for the good of this and future governments, the prime minister should resign. The statement did not say whether Wright had formally submitted a letter to the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs seeking a confidence vote in Johnson, which will happen when 15% of their number do so, totalling 54. Currently, somewhere near 20 are confirmed to have done so, although others may also have. He was contacted for comment. Conservative MP Anthony Browne has confirmed he is not among those calling for the prime minister to resign. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme, Browne was asked about Conservative former minister Jeremy Wright, who, in a statement on his website, called for Boris Johnson to quit. The statement returned to his official website after disappearing. It was replaced with a “page not found” message for several minutes. The statement, which said Boris Johnson should resign because of the real and lasting damage of Partygate, later reappeared. Browne said: Well, I came on to talk about economic growth. I mean, clearly, the whole parties in Number 10 has been a very painful episode. I’ve been very disappointed by it, as many other people but the government, the prime minister has got the big measures right in terms of the pandemic and in terms of the war in Ukraine, which is obviously a huge international crisis that is ongoing at the moment. On whether he is therefore not going to be among those calling for the prime minister to resign, the MP for South Cambridgeshire said: “No, but I am happy to answer questions about growth.” Downing Street has refused to deny that a further party took place in the Downing Street flat after Boris Johnson’s birthday gathering in the Cabinet Room. The Sunday Times reported at the weekend that the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, hosted a further event in the flat where she lives with her husband later that day on 19 June 2020. Asked about the report, a No 10 spokesman said Sue Gray had made clear in her terms of reference that she would look at other allegations where there were “credible” claims rules had been breached. I have seen the same reporting that you have but I think this is covered in the terms of reference in Sue Gray’s report where she clearly said that any other gatherings ... where she received credible allegations, would be looked into. Downing Street staff were given clear guidance to retain any relevant information and cooperate fully with the investigation. The government does not expect the UK to experience power cuts this winter, or the need for energy rationing, a No 10 spokesperson has said. He said: I think you would expect government to look at a range of scenarios to ensure plans are robust, no matter how unlikely they are to pass. Neither the government or National Grid expect power cuts this winter. You will know that we are in a fortunate position, we are not dependent on Russian energy imports and have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems. Asked about energy rationing, he added: We don’t expect energy rationing this winter. Again, we are in a different position to other countries in that we are not as dependent on Russian energy as some. You will know that we have access to our own North Sea gas reserves and imports from other reliable partners. But again, I think you would expect us to plan for all scenarios. Every secondary school pupil will have left by the time the Tories deliver the post-Covid tuition they promised, Labour has said today. Last summer Boris Johnson pledged to deliver 100m hours of post-coronavirus tutoring – designed to make up for lost hours in the pandemic – in three years for England. But last year just 1.2 million pupils out of more than 8 million started their 15-hour tuition blocks, the Sun is reporting. Based on that rate, Johnson’s target would not be reached for at least five-and-a-half years by which time all secondary school pupils will have already left, said Stephen Morgan. The shadow education minister told the Sun: This government’s farcical failure to help children recover lost learning threatens to limit their opportunities for decades to come. Millions of children will have left school before the government delivers the support it promised. Half of Britons believe the wrong people will be held accountable for Partygate, a survey has found. The Ipsos poll, conducted after the release of Sue Gray’s report into lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street, found most people thought the civil servant’s investigation had been both thorough and independent, PA News reports. But only 41% of people told the pollster they were confident the report would lead to the right people being held accountable for breaking coronavirus lockdown rules while 50% said they were not confident. So far there have been no resignations as a result of Gray’s inquiry and the independence of her report has been questioned, with claims that she was lobbied not to name officials who attended events while England was in lockdown. The polling company found much lower levels of confidence in the Metropolitan police’s investigation into Partygate, which led to 126 fixed-penalty notices being issued, including one to Boris Johnson. Only 46% of people thought the police investigation had been thorough and independent, and just 41% thought it had led to the right people being held accountable. About 51% said they were not confident that the right people had been held to account by the police. Stephen House, acting head of the Met, defended the force’s investigation last week, telling members of the Greater London assembly that it had been conducted “without fear or favour”. Ipsos also found that the publication of Gray’s report had not diminished public support for the prime minister’s resignation. The pollster found a slight increase in the number of people saying Boris Johnson should go, from 54% at the start of May to 58% following the release of Gray’s report. The same proportion supported his resignation in late January, at the height of the Partygate allegations and includes 42% of those who voted Conservative in 2019. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is considering extending the life of the Hinkley Point B plant but only if the nuclear power station complies with safety certification, a culture minister has suggested. Appearing on Times Radio, Chris Philp was asked about reports that ministers had been warned of potential power cuts to as many as 6 million households this winter, with the government drawing up plans for rationed electricity if supply issues deteriorate. Last month, Kwarteng wrote to the owners of the UK’s remaining coal-fired power stations to ask them to stay open longer than planned, and Hinkley Point B, a nuclear power station in Somerset, could also be given an extension, PA News reports. Philp described the business secretary’s actions as “sensible” and “precautionary” and when asked about the risks of keeping Hinkley Point B open, the culture minister stressed that for the government “safety is paramount”. He said no extension to the life of any power station in the UK would take place “unless the safety certification had been done in a very thorough way”. It was announced that Hinkley Point B power station was to move into decommissioning within the next two years in November 2020. EDF said Hinkley Point B power station in Somerset would have been moved into the defueling phase no later than July 2022. Philp told Times Radio: I think what the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, did last week was take some sensible precautionary measures to guard against a potential worst-case scenario. He asked, I think, the three remaining coal-fired power station operators to just keep their power stations available beyond the point of which they were due to be switched off, and I think he is considering whether Hinkley B, the large nuclear power station, might continue beyond its planned end of life as well. That’s a sensible precautionary measure, given that gas supply coming out of Russia and Ukraine is, for obvious reasons, so heavily disrupted and we do, of course, use quite a lot of gas to generate electricity. Only a very small proportion of that, of course, comes from Russia. A lot of ours comes from Norway and in the form of liquefied natural gas but, of course, disruption to the global gas market will have a knock-on effect that may affect the gas that we consumed domestically in the United Kingdom. So, I think these are just sensible precautionary measures, just to guard against a potential worst-case scenario. Rising costs have creating a “ticking timebomb” for UK small business owners, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses has said, with almost half a million firms at risk of going bust within weeks without a wave of government support. While the FSB chairman, Martin McTague, applaudedthe chancellor Rishi Sunak’s latest support for consumers through the £15bn cost of living package announced last week, he said some of those recipients could lose their jobs unless the government rolled out targeted measures for their employers. McTague told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We don’t have any problem with the way the chancellor dealt with consumer needs. But there is still a massive problem with small businesses. They are facing something like twice the rate of inflation for their production prices, and it’s a ticking timebomb. They have got literally weeks left before they run out of cash and that will mean hundreds of thousands of businesses, and lots of people losing their jobs. McTague pointed to figures from the Office for National Statistics, which showed that 40% - or 2m - of the UK’s small businesses had less than three months’ worth of cash left to support their operations. Of those 2m, the FSB chairman said about 10% – or 200,000 – were in “serious trouble”, and that another 300,000 “have only got weeks left”. He said: It is a very real possibility because … they don’t have the cash reserves. They don’t have any way they can tackle this problem. Read the full story here: Boris Johnson is “abusing the ministerial code” by redrafting it to reduce the potential sanctions for ministers who break rules, a former member of the government’s ethical standards watchdog has said, urging Conservative MPs to challenge this. Jane Martin, formerly the local government ombudsman who served on the committee on standards in public life for five years until December 2021, said Johnson had wrongly used a report by her committee as a spur to weaken the code. The prime minister was widely criticised on Friday after announcing a revision to the ministerial code to formally set out that ministers who breached the code would not be automatically expected to resign but could apologise or forfeit some pay instead. In changes made before an inquiry by MPs into illicit lockdown parties inside Downing Street, Johnson blocked his independent ethics chief, Christopher Geidt, from gaining the power to launch his own investigations. He also rewrote the foreword to the code, removing references to honesty, integrity, transparency and accountability. In a letter to the Times, Martin said Johnson had used “shamelessly manipulative tactics” and ignored the committee’s report used as the basis for the code’s rewrite. She wrote: Its recommendations were absolutely not designed to water down standards, but intended to develop a balanced approach to accountability with appropriate sanctions – including retaining resignation for the most serious breaches, such as misleading parliament. This prime minister is abusing the ministerial code, which is (and should be) owned by him. His redrafting demotes the seven principles of public life, indicating a choice to ignore the fundamentals of parliamentary accountability, which he of course understands. I conclude that he is avoiding accountability through all conventional channels. Surely Conservative MPs cannot ignore this any longer.

Asked by LBC’s Nick Ferrari if he is going to follow Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s lead, Philp said: I hadn’t thought about that until you asked, Nick, but I think that’s a good idea. Yes, I’m going to give it to a local charity in Croydon. A culture minister has said it is not “immediately obvious” that there should be an investigation into an alleged second event at Number 10 hosted by the prime minister’s wife. Chris Philp was asked on Sky News about reports emerging at the weekend that Carrie Johnson had organised a couple of parties in the Downing Street flat. On whether he thought the alleged gatherings should be investigated, Philp said: Well, I think we have had an unbelievably comprehensive set of investigations going on now for a period of nearly six months. We have had obviously the Sue Gray investigation published last week. And she interviewed, goodness knows, dozens or possibly even hundreds of people in the course of her investigation, looked at emails, messages, and everything else. And we have had the Metropolitan police investigation, which again, has gone over and gone on over a number of months. And they conducted that with full police powers. So, having had two separate investigations, including by the police over many months, it is not immediately obvious to me that we need any more investigations when this has probably been the most... rightly been, the most thoroughly investigated set of incidents in recent times. For a recap on the story of the party in question, here’s the full story: The UK’s foreign policy in Ukraine will not change based on whether Boris Johnson is prime minister, Tobias Ellwood has said. The Conservative former minister told Sky News: Don’t assume that, just because Boris Johnson may or may not be replaced, that our foreign policy will change in Ukraine. We have been providing weapons systems and support since 2014. As I’ve just been illustrating, there is a vacuum of leadership in Europe at the moment. That’s where I would like to see Britain step forward in consolidating a coalition if Nato isn’t going to do it. That’s what I’d like to see Britain do. So, let’s not use Ukraine as a fig leaf to deny the fact that we have a serious issue in our party that needs to be addressed. There’s now been talk of a reshuffle to remove any further questioning voices, you know, that might criticise what the prime minister does in private. This is exactly the wrong way we should be going. It is the absence of these inquisitive minds being heard that actually allowed legislation to support Owen Paterson, for example, to go unscrutinised. On whether he would be waiting for a call if there was a reshuffle, Ellwood said: “I wouldn’t. I’m not sure that I would answer that.” Boris Johnson is facing continued pressure from within his own party as the fallout from Partygate rumbles on and more MPs call for him to resign as prime minister. Former Tory minister Tobias Ellwood said the Conservative party stills seemed to be “in denial”. The prominent critic of the prime minister told Sky News the party was “increasingly in a difficult place”. He said: This is going to be a testing summer. Polling is now saying we could lose 90 seats. And we still seem to be in denial. It’s time to shake off this partisan Stockholm syndrome, I believe. Our party brand is suffering. We will lose the next election on current trajectory as reflected in recent elections by local elections. And when you get the church elders in the party, such as Lord Hague, now expressing huge concern, you know, we need to listen.” When asked on Sky News if he has received more public support for his view of the prime minister, Ellwood said he’d been receiving a lot of private support from people who agree with him but were not ready to state it publicly. He said the concerns within the party were not just about Partygate. He says bringing back imperial measurements is not “one-nation Conservative thinking”, for example, and the way the government seems to keep leaking announcements ahead of time is also sowing discontent. He said: There is not only just a concern on the conduct of behaviour in Number 10 because that has breached the trust with the British people, it is now concerns about Number 10 thinking, what our policies are. What we are now seeing is an approach to shore up and chase a slice off the electorate with policies such as bringing back imperial measurements. There will be some people in our party which will like this nostalgic policy in the hope that it’s enough to win the next election. But this is not the case. This is not one-nation Conservative thinking that is required to appeal beyond our base. It’s far from the inspirational, visionary progressive thinking that we require. And it fits into a pattern I am afraid of micro-announcements that are increasingly thrown out there, which actually is sowing further discontent with with more MPs. Welcome to today’s liveblog.

But in enabling Putin’s war on Ukraine, the Belarus dictator has in effect ceded control of his country to the Kremlin, the exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya believes. Lukashenko denies that his armed forces are operating in Ukraine or that he plans to enter the war on Russia’s side. But Belarus’s military is now indirectly under Kremlin control, Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with the Guardian. “It seems to us that Lukashenko is not controlling our military any more, the only thing he is controlling is repression against the Belarusian people,” she said. “We see signs of the military occupation of Belarus.” A US defence briefing last week raised fears that the deployment of Belarusian troops inside Ukraine could be imminent – which would represent a major escalation of the war. Images indicating a build-up of Belarusian forces near the Ukrainian border have also appeared on social media. Tsikhanouskaya said Putin’s aim is “to put blood on the hands of Belarus soldiers, to connect Lukashenko’s regime to this war, to make it an accomplice”. She has started appealing to Belarus troops to either refuse to fight in Ukraine or to desert and switch sides once there, rather than obey “criminal orders”. Belarusian soldiers, many conscripted, are ill-prepared, demoralised and frightened, she said. “We are trying to persuade Belarusian troops not to participate. We are communicating with mothers of soldiers, trying to persuade them not to let their children go to this war.” Belarus became a launchpad for Russian ballistic missile strikes on Ukraine and for invading Russian ground troops on 24 February. Moscow moved an estimated 30,000 of its troops into Belarus in the weeks preceding the assault, officially for “military training”. Four days after the invasion began, Lukashenko revoked his country’s post-cold war constitutional neutrality after a staged referendum gave him clearance to host not just Russian forces permanently but Russian nuclear weapons, removed from the country after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The new Belarus military doctrine appears to remove any remaining facade of independence in Minsk. Moreover, the move to abandon its nuclear-free status and allow Russia to place nuclear weapons on Belarus soil raises an immediate strategic alarm for the west. It also coincided with Putin’s 28 February announcement that he was putting Russia’s nuclear force on alert. “If Putin wants to take control of the entire territory of Belarus tomorrow he could do it,” Tsikhanouskaya said. The Minsk regime’s suppression of any civic or political activity allows Russian troops to use the territory of Belarus as Putin wants, to the point of intervening in its political life “at any moment”, she said. “Lukashenko is a puppet. Putin controls the country through him.” Tsikhanouskaya and her fellow campaigners, many of whom have been jailed or silenced, now have a twin mission: oppose the regime in Minsk and mobilise Belarusians to oppose, and even sabotage, the Ukraine war via a campaign of civil disobedience. “Our fight has doubled – we have two fronts, against the regime and to prove that we are not on the side of war,” she said. Protests, now rare in Belarus, flared in Minsk against the war last week, leading to hundreds of arrests. Tsikhanouskaya has no doubt however there will be a groundswell against the invasion. “A Belarusian war resistance movement has begun in the country, and it will grow,” she said. Tsikhanouskaya wants western governments urgently to see Ukraine and Belarus as strategically linked: thwarting Putin’s assault on Ukraine also requires going after his accomplice in Minsk. In video messages of support for Ukraine, she wears a T-shirt bearing the slogan “Glory to Ukraine, long live Belarus”. Ukraine and Belarus are together integral to Putin’s imperial vision, she said, their fates now interdependent. “The Kremlin’s intention is to return our past Soviet Union countries to be one huge empire again.” Forced to seek refuge in Lithuania after standing against Lukashenko in presidential elections in August 2020, which were rigged in his favour, Tsikhanouskaya, a former teacher, now calls herself the legitimate leader of Belarus. European governments have refused to recognise Lukashenko as president since 2020. She previously avoided framing Belarus’s democracy struggle in geopolitical terms; its focus was Minsk not Moscow. Since 24 February that has dramatically changed. “Lukashenko dragged us into this conflict and this war. We have to be on the side of people fighting for their independence.” Lukashenko’s collaboration with the war has complicated life for many who fled Belarus after 2020 and find themselves cast as “enemies” in some parts of eastern Europe. Yet Belarusian volunteers are already fighting in Ukraine to support the resistance, Tsikhanouskaya said. “We are starting the formation of Belarusian forces that will fight together with Ukraine against two dictators: Putin and Lukashenko.” Some analysts believe Lukashenko’s support of the war in Ukraine will expedite his fall. But Tsikhanouskaya is also aware of the immediate peril for Belarusians if Putin prevails in Ukraine and manages to survive an international economic blockade. “We don’t know what kind of deal Lukashenko has with the Kremlin. But it will be a different reality for Belarus. I don’t want to even imagine the outcome if Ukraine falls, it will be a disaster not only for Ukraine and for Belarus but for the democratic world. It will untie the hands of the Kremlin in the future.” But she sees a shift in the popular mood within Russia. “The Kremlin is experiencing huge pressure from inside Russia. People in Russia are not going to be happy about the situation. Russia and the Kremlin are not the same thing.” The EU last week imposed sweeping new sanctions against individuals with links to the Belarus regime, as well as banning most industrial exports, including potash and fertiliser. But Tsikhanouskaya said remaining loopholes must be filled, even if that causes pain for ordinary Belarus citizens. She wants to see Belarus judges who have incarcerated political prisoners for draconian jail terms targeted. “These people do horrible things and have complete impunity inside Belarus.” In December her human rights campaigner husband Syarhei, detained since 2020, was given an 18-year sentence for challenging Lukashenko and inciting the biggest demonstrations in Belarus’s history. News of the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant evoked disturbing personal memories for Tsikhanouskaya. She grew up in a region of Belarus that suffered radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. “It is horrifying for me personally. When I heard this news I was just praying. We still remember Chernobyl. It can’t be repeated in our region, but it seems [that] in its striving for power the Kremlin doesn’t pay attention to people’s suffering. “Look around at what is happening, we don’t know where their red lines are, or even if they have any red lines.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/mar/06/joe-biden-ukraine-autocracy-democracy-approval","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T07:00:46Z","webTitle":"Biden rises to the moment as Ukraine makes battle against autocracy real","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/joe-biden-ukraine-autocracy-democracy-approval","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/joe-biden-ukraine-autocracy-democracy-approval","fields":{"headline":"Biden rises to the moment as Ukraine makes battle against autocracy real","bodyText":"When Joe Biden made the struggle between democracy and autocracy the lodestar of his presidency, it was widely assumed that his principal antagonists would be China’s Xi Jinping abroad and America’s own Donald Trump at home. But it is Vladimir Putin of Russia who has made the contest more immediate and literal than anyone expected, launching a bloody invasion of Ukraine that threatens to bring down a new iron curtain in Europe. Biden, who made no mention of Putin, Russia or nuclear weapons in his inaugural address, is discovering a truism of US history: American presidencies are often defined by crises that no one saw coming. “I am old enough to remember [British prime minister] Harold Macmillan who, when asked what was driving his actions, replied, ‘Events, dear boy, events’,” said Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. “I’m sure when Joe Biden was running for president, the last thing on his mind was a revival of the cold war. “He was already focused, and has been for years, on the conflict between democracy and autocracy but that was more of a frame for looking at the world than it was an operational manual. Now here we are. It’s truly extraordinary when you think about it.” Just as Biden’s empathy was seen as ideal for meeting the moment of the coronavirus pandemic, and just as his record of bipartisanship was thought to be well suited to healing America’s divisions, so his storied foreign policy experience and faith in multinational institutions appear to bode well for this test. That is certainly the view of Democrats who believe that Biden, who at 79 lived every moment of the cold war, including its gnawing dread of nuclear annihilation, has risen to the occasion. Last month he authorised $350m of military equipment – the biggest such package in US history – to bolster Ukraine’s courageous fighters who have exceeded all expectations. He led an unprecedented declassification of intelligence about Russia’s intentions to invade and to justify its actions, weakening Moscow’s arguments on the world stage. Biden and his team held countless meetings and phone calls to rally western allies, helping imbue Nato with a sense of unity and purpose that many feared it had lost forever. The resulting sanctions imposed have gone further than many expected in scope and scale and could collapse the Russian economy. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, commented: “The Ukraine crisis has been the Biden administration’s finest hour. The president and his senior officials have been skillful and tireless in trying to coordinate a united response. The results speak for themselves. The sanctions are extraordinary and even more extraordinary has been the turnaround in European thinking and policy. It’s been breathtakingly fast.” But all this represents a hollow victory, critics say, because the harsh reality is that it did not prevent Putin making his move and inflicting horrific civilian casualties in Ukraine. Biden’s radical transparency included stating early and forcefully that no American troops would set foot in the country. John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, said: “It depends on what your definition of success is. The supporters of Biden say Nato’s united and I think that’s true. And Ukraine is in ashes.” He added: “I don’t think collectively the west did what was necessary here and you can measure failure pretty clearly by the Russian army being in Ukraine. I don’t think we view our current position with equanimity.” The US and Nato have rejected appeals to impose a “no-fly” zone, which might require their forces to shoot down Russian aircraft and draw them directly into a war with a nuclear power led by a dangerously unstable tyrant. This earned a rebuke from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, who said on Friday that Nato “gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages”. Bolton, a former interim US ambassador to the UN, believes the opportunity for such a measure has been lost. “It’s not practical because we’ve waited this long and Biden and the UK and all of Nato have basically said, we’re not going to do it.” “But everybody in Europe better get used to the fact that we’re going to watch something on the continent that we said in 1945 we’d never let happen again. And it’s going to happen, I think, right in front of us.” The war in Ukraine has given an unexpected boost to Biden’s efforts to revive bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans have been broadly supportive and gave him several standing ovations when he discussed the conflict at the start of his State of the Union address last week. But the truce only goes so far. Some Republicans argue that Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan betrayed weakness and encouraged Putin and that the invasion would not have happened if Trump was still in the White House. They say the sanctions have been too slow and incremental. And they are joining Democrats in pushing the president to ban Russian oil imports while calling for American energy independence. Biden, however, has been reluctant to call out his Republican critics so far, and his approval rating has begun to climb since the crisis began, according to a PBSNewsHour/NPR/Marist poll. About half of the American public – 52% – said this week they support how the president is handling the situation in Ukraine. This was up from two weeks ago when about a third said they approved. Leon Panetta, a former defense secretary and CIA director, said: “Forty years of foreign affairs experience by President Biden is paying off. We weren’t sure with Afghanistan but it clearly is paying off now in the way he’s been able to establish a unified approach between the US and our Nato allies. The bottom line is that we could not have made Putin pay a price were it not for that unity.” There appears to have been determination not repeat the blunders of Afghanistan, when allies felt blindsided as the Taliban rapidly took over and the US and western governments fled. Panetta, co-founder of the Panetta Institute for Public Policy, added: “Presidents are always tested by crisis but presidents have to learn from their mistakes and I think President Biden knows what he did wrong and knows now what he has to do to provide that leadership. “In some ways I thought Afghanistan was kind of his Bay of Pigs but John Kennedy was able to come back and really establish a strong foreign policy and I’m hoping that Joe Biden can do the same. He will be tested but, having put together this unified approach, I feel confident that he will now see it see it through. You have to remain strong. You can’t blink when it comes to dealing with Putin.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/02/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-zelenskiy-aid-reveals-up-to-13000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-russian-missiles-hit-zaporizhzhia-mayor-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-02T18:54:43Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Moscow demands west recognises annexations before peace talks – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/02/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-zelenskiy-aid-reveals-up-to-13000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-russian-missiles-hit-zaporizhzhia-mayor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/02/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-zelenskiy-aid-reveals-up-to-13000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-russian-missiles-hit-zaporizhzhia-mayor-says","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Moscow demands west recognises annexations before peace talks – as it happened","bodyText":"We are now closing the blog. Here is a summary of today’s events: Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. He said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, would make the total public “when the right moment comes”. Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said. Vladimir Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to Putin if the Kremlin chief was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. European Union member states have agreed to put a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian oil after Poland, which was holding out, gave the green light to the deal. In an effort to reduce the Kremlin’s income from fossil fuels, the EU has agreed to limit the amount that can be paid for seaborne oil to diminish Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. The Finish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help it is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times, Reuters reported. The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Russia’s withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River last month has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with opportunities to strike additional Russian logistics nodes and lines of communication, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has suggested. This threat is likely to have prompted Russian logisticians to relocate supply nodes, including rail transfer points, further south and east, the latest British intelligence report states. Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said today. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details. The chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a £580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country. The Archbishop of Canterbury has said there must be “no way we force peace” in Ukraine. Justin Welby added that the need for support is going to be “very long term”, the Press Association reported. US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. “I’m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he’s looking for a way to end the war. He hasn’t done that yet,” Biden told a news conference at the White House with Macron on Thursday. Biden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for “widely documented atrocities and war crimes” in Ukraine. Biden said their support would continue in the face of Russian aggression. In a joint statement, the leaders said: “Intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.” Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June this year, the Scottish Government has confirmed. Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June this year, the Scottish Government has confirmed. MS Victoria, which is docked in Leith, Edinburgh, will continue to provide “safe accommodation for displaced people” until June 2023 with the option to extend. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, however, accused the Scottish Government of “quietly” extending the contract, according to reports by LBC on Friday. On Friday evening, Mr Cole-Hamilton told the PA news agency: This isn’t a new life, it’s a new limbo. Ukrainian refugees deserve a long-term solution. I spoke to aid workers, working in Lviv, connecting Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Scotland with homes and routes out of Ukraine, who have described the Scottish Government as being humiliatingly underprepared. They wanted the kudos of throwing open their doors but they did none of the groundwork. I don’t think when these Ukrainians are fleeing unimaginable atrocities at the hands of the Russians, I don’t think they dreamed about a very crowded passenger ship.” Appropriate long-term accommodation is yet to be identified. Minister with Special Responsibility for Refugees from Ukraine Neil Gray said: We do not want people to spend any longer than is absolutely necessary in temporary welcome accommodation, however, we know from speaking to those on board the MS Victoria that it is a safe environment that has built a powerful sense of community. We’ve extended the contract with the MS Victoria to continue to safely accommodate arrivals from Ukraine. Work continues to match people in temporary accommodation with hosts and matching teams are operating on board both ships.” European Union member states have agreed to put a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian oil after Poland, which was holding out, gave the green light to the deal. In an effort to reduce the Kremlin’s income from fossil fuels, the EU has agreed to limit the amount that can be paid for seaborne oil to diminish Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The price cap also aims to avert a surge in global oil prices after the EU’s embargo on Russian crude takes effect on 5 December. Warsaw had held out on approving the deal in order to examine an adjustment mechanism to keep the cap below the market price – having pushed in negotiations for the cap to be as low as possible. Poland’s ambassador to the EU, Andrzej Sadoś, said on Friday that the mechanism in the final deal would keep the price cap at least 5% below the market rate. However, security experts from the CSIS thinktank have suggested a cap at $60 is toothless since it is above the price of existing Russian oil prices of about $52 a barrel. It has been estimated that Russian oil is sold at a profit from $40-45 a barrel, but Russia’s true extraction costs are hard to estimate. The cap is expected to be formally announced on Sunday, and oil embargoes in the EU and G7 will begin next week. Read the full report here. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The report stated: Culture is not collateral damage in the war against Ukraine; it’s a target, a central pillar of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s justification for the war. Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukrainian culture and language simply don’t exist. By targeting art museums, music halls, libraries, theaters and historical sites, he attempts to make it so.” PEN cited Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture as saying that 529 “cultural heritage and cultural institutions” have been destroyed or damaged since the war started. The figure includes both sites of national importance and cultural venues in towns and villages, the report said. The list includes the bombing in March of a theatre in Mariupol, where hundreds of people were sheltering. Around 600 people died in the attack, according to an Associated Press investigation. The PEN report said Russian soldiers have also seized and destroyed Ukrainian literature and Ukrainian-language books from public libraries in occupied regions. However, it acknowledged “it is not always possible to determine if the bombings of cultural sites are deliberate or the result of Russia’s indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas.” PEN Ukraine said it has documented 31 civilian writers, artists and other cultural workers killed in Russian attacks this year, and that some other cultural figures have died while fighting with Ukrainian forces. American author and publisher Dave Eggers, part of the PEN delegation that presented the report, said: The irony of Putin’s attempts to erase the culture and heritage of Ukraine [is it] has only enriched their culture and made the world pay attention and be far more interested in Ukrainian writers and traditions.” The Kremlin thought it would sweep across Ukraine and take Kyiv in a matter of days. Now, more than nine months into its disastrous war with Ukraine, the new Russian strategy of targeting the infrastructure that brings light, heat and water into millions of Ukrainian homes has revealed Russia’s own weakness and its desperation in the face of a defiant Ukrainian resistance. Russia’s impotence – and the scale of the destruction wrought by Moscow against territory it considers its own – has leaked back into official statements, even as the Kremlin seeks to leave Ukraine in a dire state on the cusp of a bitter winter. At moments, Russian officials have compared the destruction in Ukrainian cities and its strategy to that of the second world war, nearly portraying the strategy as one of scorched earth. At a press conference on Thursday, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was given a tough question about Russia’s shelling of Kherson, a city it claimed to annex in September and then fled from in November, and now regularly shells from across the banks of the Dnipro River. “How can you justify missile attacks on the civilian population, infrastructure, depriving people of access to water and electricity, including in the area of Kherson, which Russia considers its territory?” he was asked. “The city of Stalingrad was our territory,” replied Lavrov, referring to the modern city of Volgograd that was stage to the deadliest battle of the second world war. “We hit the Germans such that they ran away from there.” Moscow’s current strategy stands in stark contrast to Russia’s initial plan: a shock-and-awe strike on Kyiv and other cities that would let them take over the country and its key infrastructure within weeks. Read the full analysis here. Russian oil output could fall by 500,000 to 1m barrels per day early in 2023 after the European Union imposes a ban on seaborne imports from Monday, two sources at major Russian producers have told the Reuters news agency. The estimate is at the lower end of market analysts’ forecasts of the combined impact of the ban and a proposed price cap on Russian oil, although the sources said the true level would depend on several factors yet to be settled. They requested anonymity to discuss sensitive market dynamics connected with the conflict in Ukraine that Russia calls a “special military operation”, Reuters said. Alexei Kokin of Otkritie brokerage broadly agreed with their assessment of the likely impact of Western measures on Russian output. It’s roughly the same as the volume of seaborne supplies to the EU in recent weeks. I don’t think they (Russian producers) will be able to divert that elsewhere. The west wants to squeeze Russia’s finances to reduce its ability to fund the conflict. Exports of crude, gas and oil products account for the majority of Russia’s revenues, which have stayed high as disruption to production and sales following western sanctions has been more than offset by high prices on international markets. Russia’s budget revenues from oil and gas jumped by over a third in the first 10 months of the year. Before the Ukraine conflict began on 24 February, Russia exported around 8m bpd of oil and oil products. Turkey expects a “clear picture” on the war by next spring, its foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said, as fighting continued and Putin indicated he was open to negotiations. According to Reuters, he said: Now Ukraine is advancing on the ground, retaking some of their occupied territories. But Russia in return is deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure. So life is getting difficult for Ukrainians particularly, and for all of us. I think before the spring time we will have clear picture about ceasefire or truce or negotiation table. But we will not give up. As Turkey we will continue our efforts. Russia’s war against Ukraine became more complicated with the fighting on the ground getting heavier, Cavusoglu said, adding that some Western countries should do more to get two sides to the negotiation table. Olena Zelenska, the wife of the Ukrainian president, has urged the UK and other western nations not to allow themselves to become accustomed to her country’s plight. Speaking to the Times, she has said: It is quite understandable that the west is tired. However, this phrase, I hear it quite a lot — war fatigue — is quite a dangerous phrase for us because that is exactly what our adversary wants. They expect people to forget and the world to get tired of the sad news and for Ukraine to disappear from the front pages. They would then feel they had the permission to do what they want. As winter draws in, she accused the Russians of trying to terrorise Ukrainians into believing they will not be able to survive. It would be wrong to say these things don’t scare us, they do, but we know we must endure this. The winter is treacherous and that is what they are counting on, it’s not the first time they are using the force of nature against the civilian population. She also detailed how she has cut off all contact with any Russian relative or acquaintance, telling the paper: Of course, Putin is to blame but without the support of the Russian people he couldn’t have done it on such a scale … I have relatives [in Russia], but we don’t communicate. Those relationships have ended completely … There will be no point in returning to those dialogues, when your own life and children’s and your family’s is in great danger and people don’t even ask if you are still alive, I think such relationships are over. UN-appointed investigators are looking into whether Russia’s attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine amount to war crimes, one of the inspection team said on Friday. Russia has been pounding Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure since early October, causing blackouts and leaving millions without heating as temperatures plummet, Reuters reported. Russia says the assaults do not target civilians and are meant to reduce Ukraine’s ability to fight and push it to negotiate – though Kyiv says such attacks are a war crime. “Part of the analysis that we are engaged in at present … is whether the attacks constitute war crimes,” Pablo de Greiff told a news conference, speaking from Kyiv. If they do, the team would work out what it “can do in order to make a contribution to the accountability for such crimes,” he added. The three-member commission of inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council in March has already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in areas it occupied in Ukraine. Moscow regularly dismisses such accusations as a smear campaign. When Alina Trebushnikova woke up on Thursday morning, the light was on and she knew the day had already got off to a bad start. The electricity in her neighbourhood of Novomoskovsk had returned in the middle of the night and that meant it would not be on for much longer. As a result, the little house would be colder and darker for much of the day. It gets dark by 4pm in Ukraine now and temperatures hover just below zero after nightfall. Next week a deep frost is expected and the days will grow even shorter, as Ukrainians approach their hardest winter since the second world war. Alina’s husband, Oleksii, was away at his construction job and would only return long after dark. Their two boys, nine-year-old Ilia and Yakov, three years younger, were at the home of Alina’s parents, who have a wood stove, independent of the vagaries of the grid. Alina is 31 and has lived in Novomoskovsk since she was seven, when her parents moved out of a block of flats in nearby Dnipro to live closer to the earth, as they put it. She now spends most of her days alone with Polina, born three months ago, while making food for the family, juggling with limited light, heat and ingredients. Spanish police have cordoned off the area surrounding the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid after it received a “bloody package” similar to the ones sent to other embassies abroad, Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. This comes after a spate of six letter bombs targeted high-profile targets in Spain related to the war in Ukraine, including the United States’ embassy, prime minister Pedro Sánchez, the defence minister, an arms manufacturer, an airbase and a European satellite centre. On Friday, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said several of the country’s embassies abroad have received “bloody packages” containing animal eyes. Companies who break EU sanctions against Russia face fines of at least 5% of their worldwide turnover, under proposals put forward by the European commission. The plan, which needs approval from the European parliament and the EU’s 27 member states before it can take effect, also said individuals breaking EU sanctions would face potential jail terms of at least five years, Reuters reports. Breaking sanctions on Russia is already a criminal offence in some EU countries, but in others it is treated as an administrative offence and penalties vary across the bloc. The Justice commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed rules would bring clarity, adding: Too many gaps still remain between member states when it comes to the punishment of violation of EU sanctions. Several Ukrainian embassies abroad have received “bloody packages” containing animal eyes, Ukraine’s foreign ministry has said, after a series of letter bombs were sent to sites in Spain including Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid. The packages, soaked in a liquid with a distinctive colour and smell, were sent to Kyiv’s embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Krakow, and the consulate in Brno, spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook. The Ukrainian government will draw up a law banning churches affiliated with Russia, under moves described by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as necessary to prevent Moscow being able to “weaken Ukraine from within”, Reuters reports. The National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, which groups top security, military and political figures, told the government to draft the law following a series of raids on parishes that Kyiv says could be taking orders from Moscow. The security council also ordered investigations into suspected “subversive activities of Russian special services in the religious environment of Ukraine” and called for sanctions against unspecified individuals. Further searches of church premises were taking place on Friday. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) it said was searching at least five parishes belonging to a branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church which until May was subordinated to the Russian Orthodox Church. The agency also announced on Friday that it had served a notice of suspicion to a former diocese head in central Ukraine for allegedly coordinating a pro-Moscow information campaign with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. The branch has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but many Ukrainians fear it could be a source of Russian influence in the country. We have to create conditions where no actors dependent on the aggressor state (Russia) will have an opportunity to manipulate Ukrainians and weaken Ukraine from within. We will never allow anyone to build an empire inside the Ukrainian soul,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address to the nation on Thursday. A spokesman for the church, Metropolitan Kliment, told Reuters his organisation “has always acted within the framework of Ukrainian law”. Therefore, the state of Ukraine does not have any legal grounds to put pressure on or repress our believers. The German chancellor Olaf Scholz has urged the Russian president Vladimir Putin to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict as soon as possible, “including a withdrawal of Russian troops”, when the two leaders spoke recently. According to the Reuters news agency, Scholz’s spokesperson said: The chancellor condemned in particular the Russian airstrikes against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and stressed Germany’s determination to support Ukraine in ensuring its defence capability against Russian aggression. The Kremlin said Putin told Scholz the German and western line on Ukraine was “destructive” and urged Berlin to rethink its approach. Its readout of the call served to highlight the gulf between Russia and western governments over Ukraine, even though Moscow and Washington have both said in the past 24 hours they are open in principle to talks, Reuters reports. The Kremlin said: Attention was drawn to the destructive line of Western states, including Germany, which are pumping the Kyiv regime with weapons and training the Ukrainian military. All this, as well as comprehensive political and financial support for Ukraine, leads to the fact that Kyiv completely rejects the idea of any negotiations. Kyiv has said peace talks are possible only if Russia stops attacking Ukrainian territory and withdraws its troops from Ukrainian soil. The Kremlin has indicated it wants a diplomatic solution and claimed Putin had always been open to talks, but said this was complicated by Washington’s refusal to recognise “the new territories” as Russian was hindering a search for any potential compromise. Separately, a German government spokesperson confirmed Berlin is not in talks with Ukraine about the transfer or deployment of Patriot air defence systems there. Reuters reports that Germany offered Poland the Patriot system last month to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people. The Polish defence minister Mariusz Błaszczak later asked Germany to send the fire units to Ukraine instead. The Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić has said he will not allow his country to become a tool for those who want to circumvent EU sanctions on Russia. After meeting the EU enlargement commissioner Olivér Várhelyi, he said: We have reacted in cases of re-export of certain goods and our state bodies have detained people from companies that were involved in bypassing sanctions against the Russian Federation. Serbia, which aims to join the EU, has been criticised by foreign diplomats for not formally introducing sanctions against Russia, with which it has strong historical ties. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories so far: Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. He said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, would make the total public “when the right moment comes”. Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said. Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Russian troops had bombarded the city of Kherson and other parts of the region 42 times in the same period. Vladimir Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to Putin if the Kremlin chief was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. The seven tanks, which are now being repaired by Munich-based arms manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), are meant to help Ukraine in protecting its cities and infrastructure against Russian shelling, reported Der Spiegel. The Finish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help it is not resilient enough. “We should make sure that we are stronger,” Marin said in Sydney on Friday. “And I’ll be brutally honest with you, Europe isn’t strong enough. We would be in trouble without the United States.” The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times, Reuters reported. The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Russia’s withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River last month has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with opportunities to strike additional Russian logistics nodes and lines of communication, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has suggested. This threat has highly likely prompted Russian logisticians to relocate supply nodes, including rail transfer points, further south and east, the latest British intelligence report reads. Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said today. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details. The chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a £580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country. The archbishop of Canterbury has said there must be “no way we force peace” in Ukraine. Justin Welby added that the need for support is going to be “very long term”, the Press Association reported. US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. “I’m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he’s looking for a way to end the war. He hasn’t done that yet,” Biden told a news conference at the White House with Macron on Thursday. Biden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for “widely documented atrocities and war crimes” in Ukraine. Biden said their support would continue in the face of Russian aggression, which he added has been “incredibly brutal”. In a joint statement with Macron, the leaders said: “Intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.” That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to Putin if the Kremlin chief was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. “The president of the Russian Federation has always been, is and remains open to negotiations in order to ensure our interests,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about Biden’s remarks. “The most preferable way to achieve our interests is through peaceful, diplomatic means,” Peskov said. “Putin was, is and remains open to contacts and negotiations.” Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said. Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on Telegram that Russian troops had bombarded the city of Kherson and other parts of the region 42 times in the same period. The city of Kherson was liberated by Ukrainian forces in mid-November after months of Russian occupation, but has been under fire since then from Russian troops who retreated to the opposite side of the River Dnipro. The city has also suffered problems with its power supply, Reuters reported. Yanushevych said yesterday that power had been lost again after recently being restored. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times, Reuters reported. Repeated shelling around the Russian-held plant has raised concern about the potential for a grave accident just 300 miles from the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chornobyl disaster. “My commitment is to reach a solution as soon as possible. I hope by the end of the year,” Rafael Grossi told Italian newspaper la Repubblica in an interview published on Friday. Grossi did not rule out meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin, as well as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “Our goal is to avoid a nuclear accident, not to create a military situation that would favour either one party or the other”, Grossi said. Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. The seven tanks, which are now being repaired by Munich-based arms manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), are meant to help Ukraine in protecting its cities and infrastructure against Russian shelling, reported Der Spiegel. The German government also aims to send more ammunition for the Gepards along with the additional tanks, it reported. Supply of ammunition for the Gepard has proven problematic as Switzerland, which has stocks of ammunition, refuses to supply it, citing its neutral status, Reuters reported. The archbishop of Canterbury has said there must be “no way we force peace” in Ukraine. Justin Welby added that the need for support is going to be “very long term”, the Press Association reported. Asked what he learned from his visit to the war-torn country, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: First of all, the need for solidarity and support for Ukraine. And secondly, that there must be no way in which we force peace on Ukraine or they’re put under pressure. Third, that the need for support is going to be very long term. Pressed on whether he meant, in some cases, war is the right course, he said: Peace is always better than war. But there are times when justice demands that there is the defeat of what we call, the archbishop of York and I called when it started, an evil invasion. And I don’t regret saying that. Ukraine is the victim here, we can’t slip back to a 1938 Czechoslovakia, sort of people far away of whom we know little situation. There has to be real resilience. Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said today. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details. The Belarusian media outlet Nexta has published a series of images purportedly showing the aftermath of Russian strikes on the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia early this morning. The city’s mayor, Anatoly Kurtev, earlier announced the attack on Telegram, saying Russia intended to destroy the industrial and energy infrastructure of the city. Russia’s withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River last month has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with opportunities to strike additional Russian logistics nodes and lines of communication, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has suggested. This threat has highly likely prompted Russian logisticians to relocate supply nodes, including rail transfer points, further south and east, the latest British intelligence report reads. “Russian logistics units will need to conduct extra labour-intensive loading and unloading from rail to road transport. Road moves will subsequently still be vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery as they move on to supply Russian forward defensive positions,” the report adds. “Russia’s shortage of munitions (exacerbated by these logistics challenges) is likely one of the main factors currently limiting Russia’s potential to restart effective, large scale offensive ground operations.” The chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a £580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country. BP has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets. The FTSE 100 company vowed to end its shareholding in late February after Russia invaded Ukraine. BP took a £18.7bn hit by writing off the shareholding from its books, but still owns the stock. Last month Rosneft’s boss, Igor Sechin, said the British company should reconsider that position and that it had put aside a dividend, in a Russian account, for BP. In a letter to Looney, seen by the Guardian, Ustenko wrote: “BP was among the first of the oil majors to announce its intention to exit Russia by selling its stake in Rosneft, the Kremlin’s oil company. “Yet after nine months of Russian aggression, war crimes and the bombardment of civilian infrastructure, all funded and fuelled by Russian oil, gas and coal, BP remains a shareholder in Rosneft.” Ustenko cited Global Witness analysis that showed the dividend for the first nine months of 2022 was worth an estimated £580m, or the equivalent of a third of the UK’s direct aid to Ukraine this year. “No accounting mechanisms or statements from BP will change this fact. This is blood money, pure and simple,” he said. The Finish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help it is not resilient enough. “We should make sure that we are stronger,” Marin said in Sydney on Friday. “And I’ll be brutally honest with you, Europe isn’t strong enough. We would be in trouble without the United States.” Marin insisted Ukraine must be given “whatever it takes” to win the war, adding that the United States had been pivotal in supplying Kyiv with the weapons, finance and humanitarian aid necessary to blunt Russia’s advance. “We have to make sure that we are also building those capabilities when it comes to European defence, the European defence industry, and making sure that we could cope in different kinds of situations,” she said. Marin said when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, the priority of most Finns changed “overnight” to security. Until Russia invaded Ukraine, Finland’s priorities were to have working bilateral relations with Russia and be close partners with members Nato, but not be a member, she said. “That was the best way to secure our nation.” The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Weapons manufacturer Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told Politico late Thursday: There are Nasams deployed across the Middle East, and some of our Nato allies and we [the US] are actually working with a couple of Middle Eastern countries that currently employ Nasams and trying to direct those back up to Ukraine.” He spoke a day after the Pentagon awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon for six Nasams expected to be built in late 2025. “Just because it takes 24 months to build, it doesn’t mean it’s going to take 24 months to get in country,” Hayes said. He declined to name the Middle Eastern countries that would send the systems to Ukraine, but Defence Security Cooperation Agency records cited by Politico list Oman and Qatar as its purchasers. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Nasams, or national advanced surface-to-air missile systems, have a longer range than other western-supplied air defence systems in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. I’m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he’s looking for a way to end the war. He hasn’t done that yet,” Biden told a news conference at the White House with Macron on Thursday. Macron said he would continue to talk to Putin to “try to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete results” such as the safety of nuclear plants. Biden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for “widely documented atrocities and war crimes” in Ukraine. At the East Room press conference, Biden said he had been shocked by Russia’s brutality in Ukraine but insisted that Vladimir Putin was “not going to succeed”, adding: “President Macron and I have resolved that we’re going to continue working together to hold Russia accountable for their actions and to mitigate the global impacts of Putin’s war on the rest of the world.” “Intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.” Taking questions from reporters, Biden added: There’s one way for this war to end – the rational way. Putin to pull out of Ukraine … it’s sick, what he’s doing … I’m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he’s looking for a way to end the war.” Macron said they discussed initiatives “to keep supporting and strengthen our support to the Ukrainian troops and enable them to resist”. Russian forces reportedly struck the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia overnight. Zaporizhzhia mayor Anatoly Kurtev announced the attack on Telegram early this morning. As a result of the enemy attack, the building of the infrastructure object is on fire. The blast wave blew out windows in nearby houses.” Kurtev said emergency services are on the scene and casualties are not yet known. Zaporizhzhia administrative head Oleksandr Starukh posted an update to Telegram this morning, writing: Tonight, the enemy once again launched a rocket attack on Zaporizhzhia. Its goal was the destruction of the industrial and energy infrastructure of the regional centre. As a result, a fire broke out. According to available data, there are no victims.” Ukraine’s armed forces have lost somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers so far in the war against Russia, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told a Ukrainian television network on Thursday. We have official figures from the general staff, we have official figures from the top command, and they amount to [between] 10,000 and 12,500 to 13,000 killed,” Podolyak told the Kanal 24 channel. Zelenskiy would make the official data public “when the right moment comes”, he added. Top US general Mark Milley last month said more than 100,000 Russian military personnel have been killed or wounded in Ukraine, with Kyiv’s forces likely suffering similar casualties. Those figures - which could not be independently confirmed - are the most precise to date from the US government. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukraine’s armed forces have lost somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers so far in the war against Russia, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told a local television network on Thursday. Meanwhile Russian forces reportedly struck the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia overnight. City mayor Anatoly Kurtev announced the attack on Telegram early this morning. “As a result of the enemy attack, the building of the infrastructure object is on fire. The blast wave blew out windows in nearby houses,” he said. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. “I’m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he’s looking for a way to end the war.

Biden said their support would continue in the face of Russian aggression, which he added has been “incredibly brutal”. In a joint statement with Macron, the leaders said: “Intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.” Russian rockets pounded neighbourhoods in Kherson knocking out power in the city where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops left. Local authorities said about two-thirds of Kherson had electricity as of Thursday night. Some residents congregated at the train station or at government-supported tents that provided heating, food, drinks and electricity to charge mobile phones. Ukraine’s military said Russia had pulled some troops from towns on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Kherson city, the first official Ukrainian report of a Russian withdrawal on what is now the main frontline in the south. The statement gave only limited details and made no mention of any Ukrainian forces having crossed the Dnipro. Kyiv’s mayor Vitaliy Klitschko told residents to stock up on water, food and warm clothes in the event of a total blackout caused by Russian strikes. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Wednesday nine people had been killed in fires in the past 24 hours as people broke safety rules trying to heat their homes following Russian attacks on power facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces have lost somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers so far in the war against Russia, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told a Ukrainian television network on Thursday. “We have official figures from the general staff, we have official figures from the top command, and they amount to (between) 10,000 and 12,500 to 13,000 killed,” Podolyak told the Kanal 24 channel. More than 1,300 prisoners have been returned to Ukraine since Russian troops invaded, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday. Zelenskiy was speaking after a new exchange of 50 prisoners with Russian and pro-Russian forces. “After today’s exchange, there are already 1,319 heroes who returned home,” Zelenskiy said on Instagram, posting a photo showing a few dozen men holding Ukrainian flags. EU members have tentatively agreed to a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil, diplomats said on Thursday. Europe will begin enforcing an embargo on Russian crude shipments from Monday, so the price cap will apply to oil exported by sea by Moscow to ports around the world. Poland is left to give the final nod and Estonia is under pressure to abandon its threat to veto the cap that it believes is set too high to have an impact on the Russian war machine. The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was too early reach a verdict on talks between Poland and Germany about sending the Patriot air-defence systems from Germany to Ukraine. “We all agree on the urgent need to help Ukraine, including with air defence systems,” Stoltenberg said at a joint news conference with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. European Council President Charles Michel urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to use the country’s “influence” on Russia over its war in Ukraine during a visit to Beijing on Thursday. “I urged President Xi, as we did at our EU-China summit in April, to use his influence on Russia to respect the UN charter,” Michel said. President Xi made it clear that China is not providing weapons to Russia and that nuclear threats are not acceptable, the European Council president added Spain has ordered increased security at government buildings and embassies after the discovery of letter bombs and incendiary devices, including one that exploded at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid on Wednesday and another that was detected at the US embassy on Thursday. Devices have also been sent to the prime minister, the defence ministry, an arms company that makes rocket launchers donated to Kyiv, and a military airbase near the Spanish capital. Ukraine will move to impose limitations on religious organisations in the country which have links to Russia. “The National Security and Defence Council has instructed the government to propose to [parliament] a bill on proscribing activities in Ukraine by religious organisations affiliated with centres of influence in Russia,” Zelenskiy said in his latest national address on Thursday. “National security officials should intensify measures to identify and counteract the subversive activities of the Russian special services in the religious space in Ukraine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/09/addiction-russian-gas-putin-military","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-09T07:00:26Z","webTitle":"It’s not too late to free ourselves from this idiotic addiction to Russian gas | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/09/addiction-russian-gas-putin-military","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/09/addiction-russian-gas-putin-military","fields":{"headline":"It’s not too late to free ourselves from this idiotic addiction to Russian gas","bodyText":"As Russia threatens to cut off the fossil gas on which much of Europe depends, the continent’s storage facilities are a crucial line of defence. So you’ll be glad to hear that Germany possesses a massive gas storage reservoir, under the town of Rehden, in Lower Saxony. The biggest strategic reserve in western Europe, it can hold enough fossil gas to supply 2 million households for a year. You’ll be less delighted to discover who owns it. It belongs to a company called Astora. Astora is a subsidiary of the Russian state company Gazprom. Altogether, it owns about one-quarter of Germany’s gas stores. All of them are almost empty. They have been run down to 10% or less of their capacity. According to the German minister for economic affairs and climate action, these storage facilities have been “systematically emptied”. Idiocy is nested within idiocy like a stack of Russian dolls. Germany has allowed private companies to control its strategic reserve, and has imposed no legal requirements on how much gas the reserve should hold. Nor has it prevented companies controlled by foreign states from owning it. Instead, like the UK, it has ceded this crucial security issue to a mysterious deity it calls “the market”. With the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Germany hooked itself to Russian gas, even as analysts warned that this might become a major strategic liability. Their warnings have been vindicated: this is the pipeline Russia is now threatening to shut in retaliation for sanctions. As if to reinforce its dependency, in 2005 Germany commissioned a second pipeline, Nord Stream 2. The approval was rushed through by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, just before he left office. Within weeks, he was appointed to run the Nord Stream AG shareholder committee, overseeing the pipeline’s construction. He later joined the boards of several Gazprom companies, and became chair of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. Why does Germany need Russian gas so badly? Partly because in 2011, after the Fukushima disaster, the federal government decided to shut down all its nuclear plants, owing to the risk of tsunamis in Bavaria. The nuclear shutdown is to Germany what Brexit is to the UK: a needless act of self-harm, driven by misinformation and the irrational allocation of blame. Within two months of this ruling, Gazprom and the German company RWE signed a memorandum of understanding. It stated that “in light of recent decisions by the German government to reduce their nuclear power programmes, we see good prospects for the construction of new modern gas-fired power plants in Germany”. In 2019, Angela Merkel explained to the World Economic Forum: “We will have phased out nuclear energy by 2022. We have a very difficult problem … we cannot do without baseload energy. Natural gas will therefore play a greater role for another few decades … it’s perfectly clear that we’ll continue to obtain natural gas from Russia.” Germany now relies on Russia for 49% of its gas supply. Technically and politically, it seems to be too late to reverse this crazy decision, which replaced a low-carbon source of electricity with a high-carbon source. As a result of these stacked idiocies, Russia doesn’t have to wage war on Germany to inflict deadly harm. It needs only to cut off the gas. A similar dependency afflicts much of Europe, which collectively receives 41% of its gas imports and 27% of its oil imports from Russia, as well as almost half its imported coal. While our government has promised to phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022, this year alone the UK is likely to fund his war machine to the tune of £2bn in payments for liquefied gas. Gas and oil, and the banks that finance them, are among the Russian businesses that have not been sanctioned by the EU, the UK and the US, though they represent, by a long way, Russia’s most important source of foreign exchange. Why not? Because we have reduced ourselves to craven dependency on that despotic government, through a dismal failure to wean ourselves off fossil fuels. While we sternly condemn Vladimir Putin, we quietly slip him the money required to sustain his atrocities in Ukraine. Like a ruthless pusher, he exploits our addiction. Even before the invasion of Ukraine, Europe had a gas crisis, and households faced soaring heating bills. Today we have a gastastrophe. We are lucky in just one respect: that Putin invaded Ukraine in the spring, rather than the autumn. Now we have until October – when major heating demand kicks in again – to implement the comprehensive energy transition that should have happened years ago. Can it be done so quickly? Yes. When governments want to act, they can do so with great force and effect. When the US joined the second world war, it transformed itself from a largely civilian economy to a military economy in a similar period. Manufacturing, services, administration: all were comprehensively retooled. Almost everyone, in one way or another, was mobilised to support the war effort. The federal government spent more money between 1942 and 1945 than it did between 1789 and 1941. With similar determination and resources, rolling out a massive programme of home insulation, heat pumps, renewable energy, public transport and other mature technologies, we could transform ourselves from a high- to a low-carbon economy just as swiftly and decisively. And, perhaps, go further. On the promise of a scientific discovery that was only three years old, in late 1941 President Roosevelt approved a strategic programme to develop two entirely new technologies. Both were delivered in less than four years. That these were nightmare technologies (explosion and implosion nuclear weapons) does not detract from the principle: when governments use their power, the old rules that are held to determine what is possible no longer apply. I wonder what would happen if governments invested similar resources and political will in the development of kinder nuclear technologies, including new designs for small modular reactors and the fusion programme. I suspect things could shift at extraordinary speed. The measures needed to forestall environmental catastrophe are the same as those required to release ourselves from dependency on the autocratic governments and ecocidal corporations that control the world’s fossil fuels. Starving the Russian military machine of funds, preventing the collapse of life on Earth: we can do both at once. So what are we waiting for?

Under the plan put forward by Great Britain’s energy regulator, electric vehicle drivers could earn money by effectively transforming their cars into mobile power plants by releasing power back to the energy network when demand on the electricity grid reaches a peak. If enough drivers take up the chance to make money from their car batteries by using vehicle-to-grid technology, the UK could avoid investing in new power plants with the equivalent generation capacity of up to 10 large nuclear power stations. This could help to keep energy bills lower, even for households in Great Britain that do not own an electric vehicle, according to Ofgem. The number of electric vehicles on UK roads is expected to accelerate to an estimated 14m by 2030, requiring billions in investment to upgrade the electricity grid, but Ofgem hopes that by changing its grid rules it could unlock big savings for the energy system and consumer bills. There were about 535,000 electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, on UK roads at the end of May 2021. Great Britain’s regulator plans to make it cheaper for charging stations to connect to the electricity grid, which should enable more drivers to have access to charge points where they need them. Ofgem will also encourage “smart” car charging to make better use of electricity when demand is low and power is cheap before releasing the cheap energy back to the grid using vehicle-to-grid technology when demand rises. Neil Kenward, a director at Ofgem, said the regulator would take a “three-prong approach” by increasing the use of electric vehicles, “smart” car charging and vehicle-to-grid technology “which together can help drive down costs for all GB bill payers”. He said: “Electric vehicles will revolutionise the way we use energy and provide consumers with new opportunities, through smart products, to engage in the energy market to keep their costs as low as possible.” Graeme Cooper, the National Grid head of future markets, said Ofgem’s smart charging plan was “an important step” towards limiting the impact of the shift to electric vehicles on household bills. “There will be an uptick in demand for energy, so we need to ensure that we are future-proofing, putting the right wires in the right place for future demand,” he said. “Smart charging essentially allows your car to ‘talk’ to the grid, using data to assess when is the best time for your car to charge,” Cooper added. “It’s a cheaper, more energy efficient and sustainable way of charging electric vehicles.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/06/uk-more-oil-gas-drilling-north-sea-energy-security-strategy-kwasi-kwarteng-net-zero-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"UK to defy net zero targets with more oil and gas drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/uk-more-oil-gas-drilling-north-sea-energy-security-strategy-kwasi-kwarteng-net-zero-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/06/uk-more-oil-gas-drilling-north-sea-energy-security-strategy-kwasi-kwarteng-net-zero-targets","fields":{"headline":"UK to defy net zero targets with more oil and gas drilling","bodyText":"The UK government is set to order more drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea in defiance of its own net zero targets, while neglecting alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions instead of raising them. The energy security strategy to be unveiled on Thursday will acknowledge the need to move away from fossil fuels, the Guardian understands, but still allow for licences to explore new oil and gas fields to be expedited and more production from existing North Sea fields. Ministers are expected to say the UK needs more oil and gas in the short term, including new sources of fossil fuel imports, to replace the small proportion of UK oil and gas that comes from Russia, and ease pressure on prices. The government will present North Sea oil and gas as lower carbon than imported gas, according to a Whitehall source, to meet the UK’s needs while ramping up renewables and nuclear power. Yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change presented a “now or never” warning on Monday, showing that new fossil fuel exploration will put the Paris agreement target of limiting global heating to 1.5C beyond reach. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who will present the energy strategy, is strongly in favour of ramping up renewable energy over oil and gas, but under pressure from Tory rightwingers the government is set to offer a heavy emphasis on gas, with few measures on insulation or switching to heat pumps. The strategy will also set out: A review of the scientific advice on the safety of fracking. The Guardian understands that Kwarteng thinks fracking in the UK is unrealistic and uneconomic, but under pressure from the right will keep the option open. Doubling the target on the use of hydrogen, from 5GW to 10GW, of which half will come from “blue” hydrogen created from fossil fuels, despite evidence that it emits more carbon than coal. Ministers are expected to present blue hydrogen as a necessary bridge to future “green” hydrogen from renewable energy, but campaigners say it will lock in high emissions. A boost to offshore wind, with the expansion of existing coastal offshore windfarms and potential new floating platforms in deeper waters, but solar energy risks being missed. Investment in new nuclear reactors being made easier. Few new measures on ramping up heat pumps and no comprehensive national programme to insulate housing on the scale experts say is feasible and would make a real difference to the cost of living. Hopes for a major loosening of planning regulations in England that would allow more onshore wind will be dashed, owing to cabinet opposition. This is despite multiple opinion polls showing a large majority of people in favour of windfarms, including most Conservative voters and people in areas near actual and proposed turbines. Green campaigners said new North Sea fields licensed today would produce no gas for years or decades but result in continued higher emissions long into the future. Meanwhile, the bigger opportunity – of cutting energy waste – risks being missed. The government’s independent climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has expressed its strong disapproval of plans for more extraction in the North Sea, but said last month it was powerless to prevent it. Philip Evans, oil and gas campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Rushing to sign off new fossil fuel licences that’ll take decades to get going would be no help in standing up to Vladimir Putin, and would actively make the climate crisis worse. The quickest and smartest solution to the energy challenge and the cost of living crisis is a huge push to tackle energy waste. If your bathtub is leaking, you should fix the leak – not just turn up the taps.” Fixing the leaks seems to be low down on the government’s priority list, however. Successive attempts to insulate Britain have failed, for various reasons: poor administration, in last year’s disastrous green homes grant; complex rules and low incentives for its predecessor “green deal” scheme that was abandoned in 2015; and overall a half-hearted, short-term and piecemeal approach from the government. Experts say what is needed is a concerted nationwide push to roll out insulation, double glazing and heat pumps, concentrating first on households in or at risk of energy poverty. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the trade body Energy UK, said: “The benefits of making our homes energy efficient are so overwhelming that nobody seriously disagrees with its importance, but as a country our efforts so far have got nowhere near the scale required. Now is surely the time to press ahead with something that is proven to [reduce bills] by hundreds of pounds a year permanently.” There is little sense that the government is prepared to put in the large-scale effort required. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at E3G, warned: “There is technical potential to halve gas consumption in UK homes. But to realise that extraordinary potential means unleashing a new wave of public investment to help every household to make their home super energy efficient. This requires a wartime effort to build up an army of installers to insulate our homes and fit heat pumps and to ensure it is affordable for everyone.” If the UK wants to stop importing gas by next winter, that would be theoretically possible if every home were made energy efficient, according to calculations by Jan Rosenow, director of the Regulatory Assistance Project. He said: “We import about 150 terawatt-hours of gas for home heating every year. None of this would be needed if we insulated our homes and switched to heat pumps. “We could save more gas than we import for heating with existing technologies. What is needed is the government to step up its policies now to roll out insulation and deploy heat pumps as quickly as possible.” Behaviour change is also out of favour. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has urged people to turn down their thermostats by just 1C, from about 22C on average to 21C – which is still at the upper end of comfortable. But the government is reluctant to call on people to do anything that could be regarded as a sacrifice. Another area of concern is solar power. Offshore wind – Boris Johnson’s favourite form of renewable energy – will get a big boost in the strategy, but solar could lose out despite being the cheapest form of power in the UK and the fastest to get up and running, according to Chris Hewett, chief executive of the industry body Solar Energy UK. He said the UK could reach 54GW capacity for solar power by 2030 – about 17% of the UK’s electricity needs – with the right backing. Plans for some large solar farms have run into opposition, and solar panels are still expensive for most households, despite the removal of VAT on panels. Hewett said: “To unlock the full potential, we need to see the government setting an ambitious target and speeding up investment in the modernisation of our power networks. Supportive planning guidance and a formal recognition that land within a solar farm is frequently used for agriculture or to enhance biodiversity would also enable solar to play an important role in rural economies.” The Guardian understands there are no plans for the government to seek “wriggle room” on missing or delaying the UK’s carbon budgets or legally binding net zero target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jan/14/damian-hinds-says-there-will-be-review-of-suspected-chinese-agents-activities","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-14T16:22:21Z","webTitle":"Damian Hinds says there will be review of suspected Chinese agent’s activities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/damian-hinds-says-there-will-be-review-of-suspected-chinese-agents-activities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/damian-hinds-says-there-will-be-review-of-suspected-chinese-agents-activities","fields":{"headline":"Damian Hinds says there will be review of suspected Chinese agent’s activities","bodyText":"A comprehensive review is to be held into how a suspected Chinese agent was able to get so close to senior British politicians, the security minister, Damian Hinds, has said. MI5, the domestic intelligence agency, on Thursday took the unusual step of circulating a warning to MPs accusing Christine Lee – a prominent London-based solicitor – of being engaged in “political interference activities” on behalf of China’s ruling communist regime. The Chinese embassy rejected the claims, accusing the authorities of “smearing and intimidation” against the Chinese community in the UK, while a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the British were “too obsessed with James Bond 007 movies”. However, Hinds said the security services had been aware of Lee’s activities – including channelling funds to British politicians in an attempt to secure influence – for “some time”. The Times had reported on her activities in 2017, including her extensive payments to the office of Barry Gardiner then the shadow energy minister. It is not clear what prompted M15 to make its surprise statement on Thursday, but, asked about the scale of Chinese influence in the UK, Hinds said on Friday: “We’re learning all the time, all the implications, of course, have to be able to be taken into account.” Much of Hinds’s broadcast round was diverted to questions about further revelations of Downing Street parties, dashing any hopes in government circles that MI5’s warning might draw the media to a new subject. Nevertheless Conservative MPs tried to make political capital out of the revelations, suggesting both Labour and the Liberal Democrats’ approach to Chinese investment in the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, sealed in 2015, may have been influenced by the Chinese. In reality, Gardiner is on the record saying Hinkley was not essential to UK energy needs. The Conservative MP Marcus Fysh claimed: “Chinese government spy agencies have been massively funding frontline Labour and Liberal Democrat political operations in the UK. Energy policy directed by Ed Davey the Liberal Democrat leader and supported by Barry Gardiner has greatly favoured China and this needs to be addressed.” The trade minister Greg Hands said: “This is extremely concerning. I was trade minister. Barry Gardiner was our Labour shadow, and we used to brief him confidentially on complex and sensitive international trade negotiations which certainly would have been of interest to the Chinese government.” Davey’s Kingston constituency party received £5,000 from the Chinese in February 2013 when he was energy secretary. Sir Michael Rake, a member of the board of Huawei UK, also donated £5,000 to Davey in 2020. Gardiner received more than £500,000 from Christine Lee over six years to cover staffing costs in his office as well as employing her son as his diary manager. The son quit his job on Thursday in the wake of the revelations. Lee also received an award from Theresa May when she was prime minister, for her work on a project promoting good relations between the Chinese and British communities in the UK, and was a VIP guest when David Cameron hosted President Xi Jinping in London. Her connections with the Chinese embassy were widely known. Gardiner said he had liaised with the security services for many years regarding his contacts with Lee but had only learned on Thursday that she had been engaged in “illegal activity”. Gardiner had been a supporter of the Chinese investment in UK nuclear power plants, but the current Labour frontbench opposes the potential investment even more than the government. Tim Loughton, one of the four MPs subject to Chinese sanctions said it was “deeply worrying that agents of the Chinese Communist party have been given access to the mother of parliaments and funding the offices of selected politicians. We urgently need an exhaustive audit of where they have bought influence or inveigled their way into virtually every aspect of the U.K. and can then take appropriate measures to roll back that influence.” It is unlikely that Lee will face charges, since the home secretary, Priti Patel, has said her activities fell below the criminal threshold. In the security service interference alert (SSIA) sent to MPs and peers, MI5 said Lee “acted covertly” in co-ordination with the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Chinese Communist party (CCP). It said she had been “engaged in the facilitation of financial donations to political parties, parliamentarians, aspiring parliamentarians, and individuals seeking political office in the UK, including facilitating donations to political entities on behalf of foreign nationals”. The Electoral Commission will be asked to investigate whether these donations breached electoral law since they had in reality come from a foreign power, and not a British citizen. In Beijing, the foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin dismissed the claims, accusing the UK government of making “groundless allegations and hyping the China threat” to serve its own purposes. “It is highly irresponsible to make sensational remarks based on hearsay evidence and certain individual’s conjecture,” he said. The Chinese ambassador was asked for an explanation when he met UK diplomats at the Foreign Office in what is being described as a routine meeting. News of the alert became known when the Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, a frequent critic of China, revealed the Commons Speaker had written to MPs about the MI5 warning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/mar/06/antony-blinken-russia-sanctions-ukraine-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T18:31:43Z","webTitle":"Blinken vows to escalate sanctions on Russia but warns war could last ‘some time’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/antony-blinken-russia-sanctions-ukraine-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/antony-blinken-russia-sanctions-ukraine-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Blinken vows to escalate sanctions on Russia but warns war could last ‘some time’","bodyText":"The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, issued a pledge on Sunday to increase pressure on Russia through sanctions and provide more aid to Ukraine, but warned that Russia held a military advantage that western allies are finding hard to counter and the war was set to last “some time”. “Vladimir Putin has, unfortunately, the capacity with the sheer manpower he has in Ukraine and overmatch he has, the ability to keep grinding things down against incredibly resilient and courageous Ukrainians. I think we have to be prepared for this to last for some time,” Blinken told CNN. America’s top diplomat was speaking from Chisinau in Moldova, which sits between Romania, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) military alliance, and the south-western border of Ukraine on the Black Sea, not far from the Ukrainian city of Odesa which is threatened by advancing Russian forces. Blinken has spent the weekend visiting Nato member nations in eastern Europe that have taken in refugees from Ukraine. He said of the destruction being perpetrated under the direction of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol that: “Just winning a battle is not winning a war, and just taking a city does not mean taking the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people. On the contrary, he is destined to lose.” “The Ukrainian people will not allow themselves to be subjugated to Vladimir Putin or to Russia’s rule – but it could take some time, and meanwhile the suffering is real and it’s terrible,” he told CNN’s State of the Union Sunday morning TV show. Blinken said he had met with refugees fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, currently estimated at a stunning 1.5 million. “We’re doing everything we can to bring this to an end as quickly as we can but this may still go on for a while,” he added. Pressed on US sanctions on Russia, Blinken defended Washington’s comparative lag in application compared with European Union allies and its failure to cut off Russian imports of oil by the US. “We’re adding to sanctions virtually every day,” Blinken said. He said he had spoken to Joe Biden on Saturday and members of the cabinet on the issue of oil. “We are now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning Russian oil while making sure there is an appropriate supply of oil on world markets.” Blinken also reacted to the issue of providing increased military aid to Ukraine, including sending US fighter jets to Poland so that that country can send supplies of used Migs and Sukhoi military planes to Ukraine, where the military is familiar with those Russian-style jets rather than western-made fighters. “We are working with Poland to see if we can backfill anything they provide to Ukraine. We very much support them, providing planes that the Ukrainians can fly. But we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that whatever they provide to the Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in security for Poland.” But Blinken, on NBC, insisted that while the US would continue to add to Ukraine with “security assistance” – totaling more than $1bn over the past year – the US would not enforce a Ukrainian no-fly zone or put the US in “direct conflict” with Russia. “For everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the president also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war, with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands beyond Ukraine to Europe. We’re trying to end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one,” he said. The White House issued a report of Biden’s call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Saturday evening, saying his administration was “surging security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine and is working closely with Congress to secure additional funding”. Lawmakers in a video call with Zelenskiy on Saturday morning said they were eager to approve an additional $10bn in spending to aid Ukraine. Leaders are also accusing Vladimir Putin of suspected war crimes based on Russia’s blatant killing of Ukrainian civilians as part of its action, destroying residential areas far from likely military targets and also directly firing on civilians trying to evacuate. “We have some very credible reports of attacks on civilians, which is what is considered a war crime,” Blinken said. The Republican senator Marco Rubio, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, said he thought the Russian people would ultimately remove Putin from power over his action in Ukraine. “Hopefully to stand trial for war crimes, for what he has done,” Rubio said. He described Putin as “a monster” on ABC. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Sunday morning on the same CNN show that an investigation was needed into whether Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine. “I think there needs to be a strong and clear investigation on this question,” she said. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told ABC’s This Week: “Any attack on civilians is a war crime.” Meanwhile, Ukraine is not willing to compromise on its territorial integrity in talks with Russia but is open to discussing “non- Nato models” for its future security, in a wider forum, one of its negotiators told Fox News. Ukraine has pursued membership of Nato, cited by Putin as evidence of what he portrays as Nato aggression toward Russia. Nato members “are not ready to even discuss having us in Nato, not for the next period of five or 10 years”, negotiator David Arakhamia said in remarks published on the Fox News website late on Saturday. “We are ready to discuss some non-Nato models. For example, there could be direct guarantees by different countries like the US, China, UK, maybe Germany and France. We are open to discussing such things in a broader circle.” And on Sunday afternoon, retired army general David Petraeus, former head of US central command during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he did not accept military assumptions that Kyiv will inevitably fall to Russia. Russian forces have a 40-mile-long convoy of military vehicles stalled on the approach to the Ukrainian capital and Petraeus said it appeared “they cannot keep their columns fueled” and praised Ukrainian resilience so far. “They’ve taken down road signs or pointed “Welcome to Hell” and stuff like that,” Petraeus told CNN. “This is going to be a very long fight in Kyiv. The locals there have been stockpiling food, there is going to be an enormously fierce resistance. I don’t accept assumptions that it will fall,” he said. Petraeus also noted Kyiv’s extensive surface area as a major obstacle for the Russian military, pointing out that the capital is spread across around 320 sq miles, larger than New York City and a little over half the size of London’s sprawl."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/06/what-to-expect-uk-energy-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"What might the UK energy strategy contain and how feasible are options?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/what-to-expect-uk-energy-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/06/what-to-expect-uk-energy-strategy","fields":{"headline":"What might the UK energy strategy contain and how feasible are options?","bodyText":"The way in which Britain is powered and heated could be dramatically reshaped by the government’s energy strategy, set to be published this week. Against the backdrop of Russia’s brutality in Ukraine, the landmark policy proposals have been rendered all the more poignant. On top of targeting net zero carbon emissions and wrestling with sky-high energy bills, the UK is also looking to reduce its exposure to Kremlin-controlled oil and gas supplies. With the stakes so high, various industries and political factions are pushing their own special interests in the hope of steering the government – and billions of pounds of taxpayer-backed funding – in the “right” direction. The cabinet is split, with the Treasury sceptical about the funding required for a huge expansion of the UK’s nuclear fleet and divisions also emerging about whether to roll out more onshore wind turbines. So what might be in store when the long-awaited strategy is finally published? Are we going nuclear? Yes. Boris Johnson and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) minister, have said they intend to reverse the industry’s long-term decline. Nuclear capacity reached nearly 13GW in the late 1990s – about 25% of electricity demand – but will fall to just 3.6GW by 2024 as reactors are retired. Johnson wants to return to that 25% watermark. National Grid estimates UK peak electricity demand in 2050 will be around 85GW, up from 60GW now, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. That implies required nuclear capacity of about 21 GW, equivalent to between six and seven nuclear power plants. The first step is the 3.2GW Hinkley Point C, due for completion in 2027 unless it is delayed yet again. The life of Sizewell B is likely to be extended until 2050, adding another 1.2GW back into the mix. Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey – both of which have already been through the early stages of planning – are obvious next steps, adding nearly 6GW. Small nuclear reactors (SMRs), known as mini-nukes, are being developed by both Rolls-Royce and GE Hitachi, in theory adding about another 5GW by 2035. To reach the government’s target, another two or even three sizeable plants could be needed. In 2011, the government identified a further five options. Oldbury in Gloucestershire, Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria, Bradwell in Essex, Heysham in Lancashire and Hartlepool, County Durham. The government has already given the green light to a “regulated asset base” funding model via the nuclear financing bill, transferring some of the multi-billion pound risk of major projects to the taxpayer. Now the Treasury needs to give its blessing. Nuclear projects take a long time though. If we want energy security in short order, something swifter is required. Wind and solar are quick, aren’t they? Relatively speaking, yes. Offshore wind projects take about four years to build and onshore is even quicker, as well as being cheaper and cleaner. The good news is that offshore wind already has full government backing to increase from 11GW to 40GW. Ministers could go further this week and take the target to 50GW. Onshore wind expansion has potential but is complicated by politics. Capacity is approaching 15GW now and the wind industry wants the government’s blessing to get to 30GW. The big question is how much of that would be in England, amid a cabinet split. Scotland’s high wind speeds and remote locations already make it more attractive. It has 8.6GW of onshore wind and could get to 26GW if proposed projects get the green light. England has just 2.9GW and only a further 0.2GW in the pipeline. That’s due to a 2015 moratorium, introduced when Ukip were an electoral threat and had set their face against windfarms. A block on subsidies was lifted in 2020 but ramping up English onshore wind projects would also require reform of planning laws that were introduced at the time, amounting to a de facto ban. That’s where the politics come in. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called windfarms an “eyesore” at the weekend and is among a group of MPs hoping to thwart a major rollout in England, with Kwarteng and Michael Gove pushing back. Solar is also in line for significant expansion with Kwarteng keen on a ramp-up from 14GW to as much as 50GW. That, too, could be met with opposition. A proposed new £600m solar farm in eastern England – covering an area eight times bigger than Hyde Park in central London – has been labelled a potential “blight” on the countryside. Are they going to back fracking? Not straight away but it is no longer ruled out. In 2019 the government imposed a moratorium on fracking, which pumps water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. Kwarteng is said to be dead against it, with Boris Johnson only marginally less determined, depending on political expediency. But, amid a growing clamour among climate-sceptic Tory MPs, the government has re-opened the debate. Kwarteng has commissioned a study from the British Geological Survey into any new fracking techniques suitable for use in the UK, which will consider the impact of tremors, saying on Tuesday: “In light of Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources”. And the fracking firm Cuadrilla was recently given another year before it has to cement over its fracking wells in Lancashire. Watch this space. But it’s all systems go for North Sea oil and gas? More or less. Jacob Rees-Mogg said this week that the government wants “every last drop” of North Sea oil. There almost certainly will not be a windfall tax on oil explorers, after Kwarteng said that such a plan, proposed by Labour to pay for discounts on home energy bills “would destroy investment and would add to the uncertainty in oil markets”. The likelihood is that they will be encouraged to keep drilling and maximise production. Shell certainly seems to think so. It had abandoned plans to develop the Cambo oilfield in the North Sea before reversing the decision amid high oil prices. Days later it was granted a two-year extension to the field’s licence. Why is nobody talking about insulation and energy efficiency? Good question. The important flip side of increasing energy output is to reduce energy demand. In his spring statement, the chancellor announced that homeowners installing energy efficiency materials such as solar panels, heat pumps or insulation would not pay VAT, but he was accused of merely “scratching the surface”. Few people can afford to spend thousands of pounds retro-fitting their homes even without the tax. The Green Homes Grant closed last year, so the government could announce a home energy efficiency scheme to replace it. The Energy and Climate Intelligent Unit (ECIU) thinktank backs more ambitious targets for insulation and replacing gas boilers with electric heat pumps. The annual gas savings from insulation upgrades would reach 18 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2027 for 5m homes, they said, matching the output of proposed new gas fields. The ECIU reckons 1.5m heat pumps could be installed before 2027, giving gas savings of 17TWh a year. • This article was amended on 6 April 2022 to refer to the British Geological Survey rather than the “British Geographical Survey”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jan/24/saxon-church-prays-for-deliverance-from-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-24T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"Saxon church prays for deliverance from nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/24/saxon-church-prays-for-deliverance-from-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jan/24/saxon-church-prays-for-deliverance-from-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Saxon church prays for deliverance from nuclear plant","bodyText":"For the 55 years that Tim Fox has worshipped at St Peter-on-the-Wall, his only neighbours have been a farm and a birdwatchers’ shelter. Now, the tranquil surroundings of the salt marsh and the Essex sea wall at Bradwell-on-Sea are threatened by a new arrival: a sprawling nuclear power station, Bradwell B. If all goes to plan, the Grade I-listed St Peter-on-the-Wall, built in an abandoned Roman fort in about 660 during the Saxon settlement of Britain, will be an ideal place to watch 10,600 construction workers building the nuclear reactor. “My parents brought me here in 1965 when I was four years old and I can’t remember not coming,” Fox said. “If they build the power station, it would have a devastating effect on us – I don’t think we’d be able to survive the construction.” Fox is a member of an obscure Christian community called Othona, founded by an RAF chaplain after the second world war, and named after the Roman fort that the chapel was built on, although most of the ruins have been swallowed by the seas around the Blackwater estuary. “We have about 700 members in Essex,” Fox, Othona’s centre manager, said. “There’s no hierarchy and no restrictions. Anyone who wants to lead can take the daily service. That might be reading a bit of poetry or meditating – anything as long as it’s not inciting hatred or bigotry. It’s open to people of all faiths and none.” Although Othona is welcoming to visitors, that generosity is not extended to EDF Energy and China General Nuclear Group (CGN), the Franco-Chinese consortium behind the Bradwell B project. “I know this has to be on somebody’s doorstep, but it seems to me that nuclear power isn’t the way to go,” Fox said. “Renewable energy is getting cheaper and there are two wind farms here. This is the driest part of England – you could put a solar farm here.” Bradwell B was part of David Cameron and George Osborne’s vision of a string of six new nuclear power stations. Hinkley Point C in Somerset is under construction and in December when the government published its energy white paper, it said ministers would reach a decision on “at least one large-scale nuclear project” by 2024. Although most attention has focused on Sizewell C in Suffolk, Bradwell B could be ready for approval next year. Earlier this month the Environment Agency told CGN that it needed to make at least six changes to the reactor design. “My view, like a lot of the community, is that we shouldn’t be taking money from the Chinese government,” Fox said, citing the Hong Kong crackdown on opposition politicians and the Chinese government’s genocidal campaign against Uighur Muslims. Radiation and nuclear waste are other concerns. Further along the Blackwater estuary is Bradwell A, an old Magnox reactor that has been decommissioned. “It’s encased in some sort of cladding, and they’ll leave that there for 200 years or so for the next generations to worry about. I don’t know what they will do with the waste if they build a new one.” The Bradwell B proposal is “10 times as big as Bradwell A, and needs a hole in the earth five times the size of Wembley Stadium,” he added. “It will absolutely devastate the sanctuary of the Saxon chapel.” Electricity demand is expected to double by 2050, but that does not mean nuclear power is necessary, according to Roz Bulleid, deputy policy director at the Green Alliance. “With Hinkley Point coming online supposedly by 2025 and Sizewell C being lined up, even if we do need new nuclear, do we need this one right now?” she said. “We would prefer that the government makes a much more concerted effort to avoid the need for power and invest in more electricity storage for renewables.” Since 2016, the cost of offshore wind power has fallen by about two thirds, she said, costing about £40 per megawatt hour, compared with £90 for Hinkley Point. “Obviously, renewables are more intermittent so you don’t have a steady supply, but all sorts of other options are coming online with storage – pumped storage, batteries, compressed air storage. “And digital technologies allow us a much more sophisticated management of demand, so you can charge electric vehicles overnight when the wind is blowing but no one’s using power.” Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said that “all credible assessments” by bodies such as the International Energy Agency, the OECD and Climate Change Committee showed that nuclear power was needed to bolster wind and solar energy to meet the target of zero emissions by 2050. “We need to have four times the amount of clean power on our system than we do today,” Greatrex said. “Pretending it can be done without zero-carbon nuclear simply increases the reliance on burning fossil fuels, and means more carbon emissions and peril for the planet. Net zero needs nuclear.” Nuclear power is part of the government’s ‘ten point plan for a green industrial revolution’, he added. The Climate Change Committee said in 2019 that about 57% of electricity should come from renewable sources, with 38% from low carbon power such as nuclear plants or biomass plants that capture carbon dioxide emissions. The Bradwell B consortium was approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/apr/01/first-thing-russians-flee-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T08:56:14Z","webTitle":"First Thing: Russians flee Chernobyl with radiation sickness, says Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/first-thing-russians-flee-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/first-thing-russians-flee-chernobyl-with-radiation-sickness-says-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Russians flee Chernobyl with radiation sickness, says Ukraine","bodyText":"Hello and good morning. The UN atomic watchdog is investigating Ukrainian claims that Russian soldiers occupying Chernobyl nuclear power station left after receiving high doses of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it could not confirm the claims by the Ukrainian state power company Energoatom and was seeking an independent assessment. It will send its first “assistance and support mission” to Chernobyl, in northern Ukraine, in the next few days. Energoatom said the Russians dug trenches in the forest inside the exclusion zone at the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, and that the troops “panicked at the first sign of illness” that “showed up very quickly” and began preparing to leave. Meanwhile, Energoatom also said the Russian side had formally agreed to hand back to Ukraine the responsibility for protecting Chernobyl. It shared the scan of a document signed by people it identified as a senior staff member at Chernobyl and the Russian military official assigned to guarding Chernobyl. What is Chernobyl? The plant is the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in 1986. Staff continue to oversee the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel and supervise the concrete-encased remains of the reactor that exploded. When did Russia take control of Chernobyl? Russian troops seized the nuclear plant soon after the 24 February invasion. There have been concerns over the past month about power cuts and fighting making staff shift rotations difficult. What claims is the UN agency likely to investigate? Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk claimed Russian troops dug trenches in the forest and were exposed to radiation. Some reports suggest soldiers are being sent to a special medical facility in Belarus after driving tanks through the “dead zone” around the nuclear plant, kicking up radioactive dust. (These claims are unverified.) Mariupol officials say Russians are blocking aid reaching besieged Ukraine city An aide to the mayor of Mariupol has said the besieged southern Ukrainian city remains closed for anyone trying to enter and is “very dangerous” for anyone trying to leave. Petro Andryushchenko said Russian forces have been preventing even the smallest amount of humanitarian supplies reaching trapped residents. A convoy of buses that set out for Mariupol did not reach the city, Ukrainian officials said last night. Russia had promised a limited ceasefire along the route from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Repeated efforts to set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of up to 170,000 people who remain in Mariupol, which has suffered four weeks of bombardment and dwindling supplies, have failed. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of shelling supposedly safe routes outside of several fighting hotspots, claims that Moscow denies. Meanwhile, insiders in the UK intelligence agency are divided over GCHQ boss Jeremy Fleming’s strategy of leaking intelligence, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports. Fleming revealed details such as Russian forces “accidentally shooting down their own aircraft”, sparking debate among spy insiders over the strategy. Trump may face day in court thanks to lawsuit from reggae singer Eddy Grant The reggae singer Eddy Grant may succeed where the attorney general of New York state and other powerful figures have struggled – by forcing Donald Trump to answer questions under oath in a legal proceeding. Grant sued the former president and his campaign over the use of his song Electric Avenue in an ad in 2020. In the ad, Grant’s song plays over an animation of Joe Biden traveling slowly in a handcar, after a Trump campaign train passes at high speed. Remarks from Biden are also heard. Trump has failed to have the suit dismissed and claims it was fair use under a satire exemption. Who is Eddy Grant? A 74-year-old Guyanese-British reggae musician. The song Electric Avenue was released in 1982. How much is Grant seeking in damages? $300,000 for copyright infringement. How many times has the video been viewed? More than 13.7m times, the lawsuit claims. In other news … A Palestinian baby has died after her treatment was delayed by Israel’s blockade of Gaza.

Stat of the day: more than 9,500 Indigenous people listed missing in 2021 In 2021, the National Crime Information Center listed more than 9,500 Indigenous people as missing, with 1,554 of those cases still active by the end of the year. One year after the Department of the Interior announced it was launching a new investigative unit to prioritize the crisis of missing and murdered Native Americans, at least nine Indigenous families have watched jurisdictional issues and miscommunication hamper efforts by the unit to investigate their relatives’ cases, or been met with months of silence.

The announcement that Australia was ditching the contract in favour of United States or United Kingdom nuclear-powered submarines as part of the Aukus pact has caused fury in France, which has described it as a “stab in the back”. “The Australian authorities have terminated the contract for convenience thus acknowledging that Naval Group did not fail in its commitment,” the statement from Naval Group’s Paris headquarters said. “The consequences of the termination of the contract for convenience are addressed in the strategic partnership agreement (SPA) signed in 2019.” The comments come as a French official said Australia had made a fresh approach several days ago for a call between Scott Morrison and French president Emmanuel Macron. While France would “prepare seriously” for such a phone call, its position is that it will have to be a conversation of substance. Since the SPA between Australia and Naval Group was negotiated there have been accusations of cost and schedule overruns. The SPA is secret, but an auditor general’s report has revealed it contains “off ramps”, or “exit gates” – points at which Australia could withdraw from the contract in the event of poor performance. What is not clear is what happens if that withdrawal is because of a preference for a different deal instead of a failure by Naval Group to deliver specific outcomes. Early on the morning of 16 September Australia time, Morrison, in a joint virtual address with US president Joe Biden and UK prime minister Boris Johnson, announced the switch to nuclear-powered submarines. Defence minister Peter Dutton has said Naval Group’s Attack-class submarines were no longer suited to the nation’s operational needs, and that the government had been “upfront, open and honest” with France about its decision. Last week Herve Grandjean, the French Ministry of Defence spokesperson, said Naval Group received an official letter from the Australian navy saying it was “extremely satisfied that performance of the French submarine was excellent” on the same day the cancellation announcement was made. Macron has apparently snubbed Morrison’s attempts to make contact in the wake of the Aukus announcement. The French ambassador to Australia was recalled to Paris and is yet to return. Under the SPA, Australia will pay a “break fee” to Naval Group, but company is also planning to seek further compensation. “We have begun to analyse the financial and contractual consequences of this Australian sovereign decision for Naval Group,” the statement said. “We are discussing this with the Australian authorities in a constructive mindset but it is too early at this stage to give any estimation [of costs].” France beat Germany and Japan to win the submarine contract with a diesel-electric version of its existing nuclear submarine, the Barracuda. France has been open to the idea of converting back to nuclear power, and Dutton says that option was considered then dismissed in favour of a submarine developed under the Aukus aegis. On Wednesday, the Nine newspapers reported that Malcolm Turnbull, who was prime minister when the contract with France was inked, said the current government should have considered the French nuclear option. It has “safety and non-proliferation advantages” over the US and UK options, as the uranium used has a lower level of enrichment, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-net-zero-strategy-not-tough-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-19T18:17:14Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the net zero strategy: not tough enough | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-net-zero-strategy-not-tough-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-net-zero-strategy-not-tough-enough","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the net zero strategy: not tough enough","bodyText":"In a number of ways the net zero strategy published by the UK government on Tuesday falls short of what was hoped for, and perhaps even expected by more optimistic observers. The public investment that ministers have committed to is insufficient, their faith in private-sector solutions overblown. The combination is concerning. As the host of the upcoming Cop26 summit, and the first major industrialised country to put a net zero target into law, the UK is in a unique position. By significantly upping their ambitions with regard to emissions cuts, ministers had the chance to send a powerful message. Instead, they have hedged many of the new commitments in ways which risk undermining them. Nowhere is this clearer than in the section of the strategy dealing with the heating of homes and other buildings. Heating accounts for almost a third of the UK’s total emissions, and progress on reducing these has long lagged behind other areas. Bold action to end households’ dependence on gas was urgently needed. But instead of clear deadlines, the strategy states only an “ambition” that by 2035 no new gas boilers will be installed. And while grants to enable 90,000 households to install low-carbon heat pumps are likely to be popular, gestures such as this are not enough. Just last month the government was strongly criticised by the National Audit Office for the shambolic handling of a £1.5bn green homes scheme. But the net zero strategy does not make it clear how such mistakes are to be put right. A domestic energy-use policy should contain strict new standards for insulation, as well as mandating the switch from dirty to clean energy. This would have the huge bonus of helping people to reduce bills, at a time when the cost of living is rising and average household incomes are certain to be badly squeezed. Instead, the government has concentrated on a business-friendly package, with the promise of £3.9bn funding to help create 240,000 new jobs. Strong support for the offshore wind sector is one of the strategy’s more positive aspects. This forms part of a wider commitment to decarbonise the electricity supply altogether by 2035, conditional on security of supply. The emphasis on carbon sequestration, both through natural means (peat bogs, trees) and new capture and storage technologies, is welcome. The commitment to build another new nuclear power station, after Hinkley Point C, looks like the least bad answer to the question of how to meet the demand not met by renewables. The further expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure also makes sense, although the government’s broader road policies must be watched closely. While electric cars are a big improvement on internal combustion engines, what is needed is a modal shift away from driving. Some of the other pledges contained in the document are more fanciful. There is nothing wrong with investing £180m in the development of sustainable aviation fuel. But it is irresponsible for the prime minister to encourage people to envision a future of flying “without guilt”, and to be contemptuous about the idea of scaling back consumption. On diet, particularly meat, the strategy says almost nothing, which is disappointing given the constructive approach taken in the recent national food strategy. The expansion of fossil fuels in the North Sea should be strongly opposed. The policy announced at the Labour party’s recent conference, of investing £28bn a year on green measures until 2030, would have taken the UK further, faster. But Boris Johnson’s government has set out its chosen path to net zero, and it falls to its critics and opponents to try to speed things up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2021/sep/27/should-scientists-run-the-country","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-27T07:00:35Z","webTitle":"The big idea: should scientists run the country?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/27/should-scientists-run-the-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2021/sep/27/should-scientists-run-the-country","fields":{"headline":"The big idea: should scientists run the country?","bodyText":"How many lives would have been saved in the pandemic if the UK government had truly “followed the science”? The question is unanswerable but hardly academic. We cannot accurately quantify how many lives were lost by the politically driven delays to lockdown in the first and second waves, but the number is not small. So would we have done better simply to put scientists in charge of pandemic policy? Might we hand over climate change policy to them, too? In fact, would their evidence-based methods make them better leaders all round? How much say scientists should have in running society has been debated since the dawn of science itself. Francis Bacon’s utopian Bensalem in his 1626 book New Atlantis is a techno-theocracy run by a caste of scientist-priests who manipulate nature for the benefit of their citizens. Enthusiasm for technocracies governed by scientists and rooted in rationalism flourished between the world wars, when HG Wells advocated their benefits in The Shape of Things to Come. But while post-second world war issues such as nuclear power, telecommunications and environmental degradation heightened the demand for expert technical advice to inform policies, the UK government’s first official scientific adviser, Solly Zuckerman, appointed in 1964 by Harold Wilson, stressed the limits of his role. “Advisory bodies can only advise,” he said. “In our system of government, the power of decision must rest with the minister concerned or with the government as a whole. If scientists want more than this then they’d better become politicians.” That remains the common view today: scientists advise, ministers decide. “The implicit contract,” says the Conservative peer David Willetts, a former minister of state for universities and science, “is that the scientists get to have their voice heard, and in return they accept that ministers will ultimately decide on what should be done.” He considers the view (often credited to Churchill) that “scientists should be on tap but not on top” to be “the right model in a democracy”. But the equation was never that simple. For one thing, in a democracy people have a right to know on what basis decisions are being made: scientific advice can’t happen behind closed doors. After the shambolic BSE crisis of the 1990s, when the minister of agriculture, John Gummer, asserted without scientific justification that British beef was safe to eat (and tried to enlist his reluctant daughter to prove it), a public inquiry concluded that it is vital that science advice to government be transparent and open, and that scientific advisers be able to communicate directly with the public so that people could assess whether what ministers claimed was true. That right was vigorously asserted by Sir David King when he advised the Blair government on the foot-and-mouth epidemic and on nuclear power. It was a perceived initial lack of transparency in the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) at the start of the Covid crisis that led King to establish Independent Sage as an alternative, public-facing source of expert advice. The pandemic has also highlighted the tightrope that chief scientific officers such as Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance must walk. As civil servants, they are duty bound to support the government, and their careful chaperoning by ministers at press briefings led to questions about their independence. When government policy began to diverge markedly from scientific advice during the second wave, the tension was palpable. If a chief medical officer believes that a government policy poses a public health hazard or is downplaying dangers, then where should their allegiance lie? There is now a strong case for reconsidering the constraints placed on scientific advisers: the top/tap dichotomy fails to acknowledge their broader responsibilities, especially in the face of irresponsible or incompetent governance. And while the idea that they refrain from explicit policy recommendations (which include value judgments) makes sense in normal times, Jonathan Birch of the London School of Economics has proposed that a mode of “normatively heavy” advice that does include such recommendations – perhaps unconditionally (“Do this”) – is warranted in crisis situations. “Different norms apply to scientific advisers in extremis,” he argues. What’s more, the “on tap” model assumes a view of scientific objectivity that has long since been exploded by experts on the social roles of science. “The idea that scientists can speak truth to power in a value-free manner has emerged as a myth,” wrote the social scientist Sheila Jasanoff in 1990. For one thing, scientists who join the mechanism of government but imagine they can operate untrammelled by political influences are fooling themselves. The landscape of options considered and modelled by Sage was set not by scientific considerations but by political diktat. As Sage member John Edmunds has said: “The politicians came up with [the] strategy and our job was to make it work” (the strategy here being the fateful “controlled herd immunity” scheme). And modellers predicting the consequences of the full relaxation of restrictions in July did not compare against the baseline scenario of keeping remaining restrictions in place, because they were not asked to do so. Whitty and Vallance must, meanwhile, have recognised that Dominic Cummings’s violation of lockdown rules had implications for public trust and compliance; their silence on the matter was not “staying out of politics”, but itself a political decision. In its obligation to embrace fallibility and uncertainty, science is antithetical to the current mode of politics in which admissions of doubt and error are regarded as weakness. Yet it is precisely because of those attributes that science is vulnerable to exploitation for political agendas. Studying US policies on cancer risks, Jasanoff concluded that the adversarial style of regulatory decision-making polarises scientific opinion and prevents the resolution of disputes. “Far from promoting consensus, knowledge fed into such a process risks being fractured along existing lines of discord,” she wrote three decades ago. Don’t we know it now. That consideration exposes, too, the fundamental problem with any notion of “rule by science” – we have to ask: “Which science?” Where there is lack of scientific consensus, science risks becoming a tool not for informing but for justifying policies. One of the most striking aspects of the denialist movements around Covid-19, vaccines and climate change is how “sceptics” position themselves as the true rationalists, parading cherrypicked data in support of fringe views. And they can always find “experts” with superficially plausible qualifications (including Nobel prizes) to support them, just as Johnson could convene a panel of lockdown-sceptic scientists to justify his procrastination last autumn. But even good-faith experts will disagree, not least because different disciplinary expertise creates different perspectives. The problem is rendered worse by the persistent hierarchy of the sciences that privileges the “hard” disciplines – virology over social sciences, say. Technocrats prefer “hard” fixes: witness how in China, leaders such as Hu Jintao trained as engineers to seek solutions to social problems of water resource management in gargantuan techno-projects. Some say our pandemic response was too much led by “hard” epidemiological modelling and lacked adequate input from public health experts. So the choice of “expert” matters hugely. Cummings’s enthusiasm for more science-based policymaking sounded all very well until you recognised his tendency to capriciously anoint handpicked “geniuses” (sometimes mavericks). His reliance on the mathematician Tim Gowers to see why the herd immunity policy in early 2020 was “catastrophically wrong” was arbitrary and opaque to scrutiny. Gowers happens to be very smart (and was right), but plenty of experts in public health and epidemiology were already screaming into the void about that mistaken plan. In the end, we rightly elect politicians to make decisions and judgments, and not simply to enact what experts or data seem to dictate. As the sociologists Harry Collins and Robert Evans have put it: “Democracy cannot dominate every domain – that would destroy expertise – and expertise cannot dominate every domain – that would destroy democracy.” As a scientist, I don’t want to see scientists on top or on tap. Mature leaders, irrespective of their training, who respect science for what it is – a social system for arriving at reliable but contingent knowledge, based on data, embracing error and uncertainty and diversity of opinion – will not struggle to put it to good use. All we need to do is elect them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-unleashes-major-drone-attack-as-kyiv-prepares-to-celebrate-birthday","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-28T17:47:59Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: ‘We haven’t started yet to act very seriously,’ says Kremlin ambassador – as it happened to UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-unleashes-major-drone-attack-as-kyiv-prepares-to-celebrate-birthday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-unleashes-major-drone-attack-as-kyiv-prepares-to-celebrate-birthday","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: ‘We haven’t started yet to act very seriously,’ says Kremlin ambassador – as it happened to UK","bodyText":"We are now closing this blog, but you can read all our Ukraine coverage here. Thank you It’s now 8.30pm in Ukraine. In case you missed it, here’s a quick rundown of all the latest developments from throughout the day. Two people were killed in a series of drone strikes in Kyiv overnight, the largest such attack to hit the Ukrainian capital since the Russian invasion. The Ukrainian military said that 58 of 59 Russian drone strikes across the territory of Ukraine were intercepted by aerial defence systems. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that “most of the lives that could have been taken by the [strikes] were saved” and thanked “each and everyone” of the people who had taken part in defensive operations. Zelenskiy has also asked his country’s parliament to approve 50-year-long sanctions against Iran because of its role in supplying Russia with drones and military equipment for the war. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on a medical facility in Dnipro on Friday has risen from two to four people, according to the region’s governor. Russian attacks near the eastern city of Bakhmut, the scene of heavy fighting in recent months, have abated slightly, according to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military. The EU’s spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, Nabila Massrali, has said Russia “will be held accountable” for attacks on civilian areas. Authorities in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine continue to coerce local populations into accepting Russian passports as part of efforts to annex territory, according to Ukrainian officials. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin has told the BBC that Russia has “enormous resources and we haven’t just started yet to act very seriously”. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed a panel to investigate US allegations that a Russian ship collected weapons from a naval base near Cape Town last year, the presidency said in a statement. The authorities in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine continue to coerce local populations into accepting Russian passports, Ukrainian officials have said. In its latest operational update, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said “forced passporting” was taking place in the Nyzhni Sirohozy district in the southern region of Kherson. “In particular, the Russian occupiers constantly put pressure on the locals, threaten deportation and confiscation of property,” it said. “Thus, local citizens with a Ukrainian passport, driver’s licence and technical passport for a vehicle are threatened with confiscation if they refuse to receive Russian-style documents.” Kherson was among the regions Russia attempted to annex in September by staging referendums that were widely condemned by the UN and others as shams. In an intelligence update last month, the UK Ministry of Defence said Russia was using passports as a “tool in the ‘Russification’ of the occupied areas, as it did in Donetsk and Luhansk before the February 2022 invasion”. It added that the measure was part of attempts to “paint the invasion as a success, especially in the run-up to the 2024 presidential elections”. Pictures show some of the damage done to buildings in Kyiv by last night’s drone strikes. Russia will be held accountable for attacks carried out on civilian areas, the European Union has said. Writing on Twitter, Nabila Massrali, an EU spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, said: “Russia’s barbaric attacks continue, killing &amp; terrorising civilians: attack on hospital in #Dnipro, now #Kyiv on dawn of #KyivDay. “[Russian] leadership &amp; perpetrators will be held accountable. We remain committed to help Ukraine defend itself.” Last night’s strikes on Kyiv came after four people were killed and more than 30 were injured when a Russian missile hit a medical facility in the eastern city of Dnipro on Friday. We have some testimony now from a Kyiv resident whose home was damaged by the strikes that hit the city overnight. Sergei Movchan, 50, said the attack had left people “in shock”. “People are in shock. There’s a lot of damage, the windows were broken, the roof was damaged,” he said. “Russians are intimidating us. But I think it’s the agony of their regime.” Kyiv had been relatively spared since the start of the year, but last night’s attack was the 14th its residents have had to endure this month. Reporters from Agence France-Presse (AFP) have visited the bombed Russian border region of Belgorod, where they found that an air of resignation has taken over a week after forces linked to Ukraine invaded. Marina Saprykina thought about leaving the Russian border city of Belgorod, but finally, despite the bombing, incursions and fear, she says she is staying. “We are used to it,” the 34-year-old sales director told AFP. The Belgorod region witnessed on Monday the biggest armed incursion into Russia from Ukraine since Moscow launched its offensive in February 2022. Shelling and drones were part of the assault which raised questions about the strength of Russian border defences. People living in several border communities fled and the army and security forces deployed warplanes and artillery to halt the raids. In the regional capital, also called Belgorod, 40km (25 miles) from Ukraine, no signs of panic are visible despite the frequent shells and drones that have fallen here for the last few months. “The news is really concerning, we are worried,” Saprykina says. The strikes “take place every day, we can hear them”. “But even if it’s frightening, we are used to it,” she adds. Viktor Kruglov, 24, who works for an online sales site, says he too wondered about leaving Belgorod because of the repeated bombings. “But if it’s your destiny, it doesn’t matter where you go, what will happen will happen.” Fatalism seems to be a dominant force across the city. While some people do confess to a certain amount of worry, there’s no sign of panic. There is no military presence or even a stepped-up police deployment to be seen in the city centre. The town centre is full of carefree people enjoying the sun in parks and along the banks of the Vezelka River. Shops are packed and cafe terraces are doing brisk business. Retired teacher Rimma Malieva, 84, is above all worried about her dog, which frets whenever military helicopters buzz overhead or explosions are heard. “He runs all over without knowing where to go. Dogs are afraid of loud noises, especially when the [Russian] anti-aircraft guns go into action. So he’s the one who’s most afraid,” she said. “As for us, what can we do? We just shout ‘Oh!’ and ‘Ah!’. What will that change?” Here’s some footage of the aftermath of the overnight Russian drone attack on Kyiv on Sunday, which is Kyiv Day, marking the anniversary of the city’s establishment. The head of President Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, has said that Ukraine will need security guarantees as it enters Nato membership. Speaking to the Voice of America website, he said: “We are not talking about [Nato’s] article 5 until we become members of Nato. That is, these are absolutely realistic guarantees. “Regarding security guarantees, you know that President Zelenskiy started talking about it many months ago, that we need security guarantees on the path to our membership in Nato. Because the main guarantee is Nato membership. Nato is the world’s strongest alliance today. Everyone admits it. And I am sure that it will be like that.” Nato’s article 5 is the maxim that an attack on one Nato member is perceived as an attack on all of them, which should provoke a joint response. President Zelenskiy has praised his country’s air defence forces, after the capital, Kyiv, was hit by what Ukrainian officials said was the largest drone attack since the beginning of the Russian invasion, AFP reports. The overnight attack killed two people and wounded three others. The latest drone attack came as Russia has intensified aerial strikes on the capital this month, and warned the west against escalating the conflict after the United States agreed to green-light F-16 deliveries. Ukraine said the latest attack on Kyiv was “the most important” of the invasion, with more than 40 out of 54 drones targeting the capital. “Every time you shoot down enemy drones and missiles, lives are saved ... You are heroes,” Zelenskiy told his air defence forces on Sunday morning, also thanking rescuers. The time is now approaching 3pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of today’s latest news as Russia launched a mass drone attack overnight on Kyiv. A 41-year-old man was killed by falling debris of Russian drones being shot out of the air, as the Kremlin launched a 54-strong drone attack on the Ukrainian capital. The death was confirmed by the Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, who said a 35-year-old woman was also injured by the fall of the drone’s wreckage in the Solomyanskyi district. Ukraine’s air force said it had downed 52 of the 54 drones during the attack, which it said was a “record” attack with the Iranian-made Shaheds. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin has told the UK’s BBC that Russia has “enormous resources and we haven’t just started yet to act very seriously”. In an interview with Laura Kuenssberg, he repeated Russia’s line that the jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was a “spy”. In response to a question by Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife, he said it was a decision of the “courts” rather than government-led oppression that led to Kara-Murza’s 25-year jail term. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on a clinic in Dnipro on Friday has risen from two to four people, according to the region’s governor. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed a panel to investigate US allegations that a Russian ship collected weapons from a naval base near Cape Town last year, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is asking the country’s parliament to approve 50-year-long sanctions against Iran because of its role in supplying Russia with drones and military equipment for the war. Russian attacks near Bakhmut have abated slightly, according to a spokesperson for the eastern section of Ukraine’s army. Serhii Cherevatyi is quoted by the Ukrinform website by saying that there was only one military clash in the last 24 hours. He said: “In the Bakhmut direction, the occupiers opened fire with different weapons 250 times. Our forces also launched strikes in response. As a result, 80 occupiers were eliminated, 99 injured, and one Russian soldier was taken prisoner. Three self-propelled howitzers, one electronic warfare system and one ammunition depot were destroyed.” He added that Wagner group’s troops were being replaced with other units. President Zelenskiy is asking Ukraine’s parliament to approve 50-year-long sanctions against Iran because of Tehran’s role in supplying Russia with drones and military equipment for the war. It would include a complete ban on trade with Iran, investments and transferring technologies, the Kyiv Independent reports. A vote has not been scheduled. The announcement comes hours after a mass drone attack by Russia, using 54 Iranian-made Shahed drones. Ukraine claims it has downed 52 of them. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on a clinic in Dnipro has risen from two to four people, according to the region’s governor. In a post on Telegram, Serhii Lysak said further analysis had confirmed that three missing people had been killed in the attack on Friday. Those killed were doctors and employees of the clinic and neighbouring vet clinic. The initial two who were identified as being killed were a 69-year-old man who was passing by the centre and an employee at the vets. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has appointed a panel to investigate US allegations that a Russian ship collected weapons from a naval base near Cape Town last year, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday. The US ambassador to South Africa, Reuben Brigety, said on 11 May that he was confident that a Russian ship, which docked at a naval base in Simonstown in the western Cape in December last year, took aboard weapons from South Africa. The South African has since denied it, Reuters reports. The allegations have caused a diplomatic row between the US, South Africa and Russia and called into question South Africa’s non-aligned position on the Ukraine conflict. South Africa says it is impartial and has abstained from voting on UN resolutions on the war. “The president decided to establish the inquiry because of the seriousness of the allegations, the extent of public interest and the impact of this matter on South Africa’s international relations,” said the statement. Author Bill Browder, appearing on a panel on the BBC One current affairs show Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, said the Russian government was “failing miserably”. Browder has written two books about Russia and his experience in finance there, which covers corruption and money laundering. He said: “Corruption inside Russia has hollowed out the military. The supposed strong force failed at every step, they lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers, they lost huge amounts of equipment. “As he said Ukraine is a small country compared to Russia and they are being decimated by this small country. “It is difficult watching that interview because everything he said is a lie. It will be painful when [Ukraine] launch that spring offensive.” He said it is impossible that Putin is popular, as is claimed, when he has to rely on “totalitarian” measures. When Kuenssberg mentions war crimes, including a maternity hospital being attacked in Mariupol and asks why Kelin won’t be honest about what has happened, he replies that the war has been going on since 2014 in the Donbas with crimes being committed on the Ukrainian army side. He adds: “We want peace. We want no threat from Ukraine to Russia, this is one thing, and second that Russians in Ukraine will be treated like all other nations in the world. Like a French person in Ukraine. “It is a big idealistic mistake to think that Ukraine will prevail. Russia is 16 times bigger than Ukraine. We have enormous resources and we haven’t just started yet to act very seriously. “We are just defending the lands which are under control and assisting Russian people over there. We are rebuilding the Donbas. “It depends on the escalation of war that is taking place. Sooner or later this escalation might have a new dimension that we do not need and we do not want. We can make peace tomorrow, if Ukrainian side will be prepared to negotiate but there is no preconditions for that. “The German defence minister said if we stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, it will stop the day after tomorrow,” he said and laughs, saying he is right. “If supplies of weapons will be stopped, it will be stopped the day after tomorrow. Please, stop it.” The jailed Russian journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife Evgenia is then able to ask a question via Kuenssberg’s phone. She asks why the Russian government needs to use oppression when it says it has support of the people. Kelin says that Kara-Murza has been treated as a Russian citizen despite his dual-nationality, which Kelin acknowledges. He said he had not been treated differently from any other prisoner, and it is the court’s judgment. On the subject of jailed westerners in Russia, Kelin claims that Evan Gershkovich was arrested as a spy. The Kremlin’s man in London, Andrei Kelin, has spoken to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday morning about the war in Ukraine. He said that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, is a “free man” who is “commenting on what is happening in Bakhmut, and how the battle has gone”. “I don’t think that he is very much wrong because the threat that existed for us on the eve of the military operation … was really the danger that presented to the existence of our state,” he said, in regards to Prigozhin saying Russia’s existence is at threat. Kuenssberg challenged him on this, saying it was untrue. Kelin replied with conjecture about the size of the Ukrainian army. Kelin went on to say that he did not agree with Prigozhin that there was a chance of “losing Russia”. In response to a question about whether the attack on a hospital is justified, he brought up apparent incidents in Luhansk and Donetsk and claimed there had not been any mentions of it in British press. An interesting piece here from the Kyiv Post on President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speechwriting team and process. Senior correspondent Maryna Shashkova said that Zelenskiy’s team say that speeches are “80%” him. “He always knows what he wants to say, and he immediately formulates it in sentences and phrases. He speaks ready-made thoughts, the speechwriter needs to listen, take notes and possibly add what the president did not say,” a source told the Post. Others involved are Dmytro Lytvyn, a speechwriter, and Yuriy Kostyuk, who worked with Zelenskiy when he was an actor. “The main task of a speechwriter is to completely turn off your ego and become a reflection of another person. They can do it,” an official in the president’s office said. A 41-year-old man died during Russia’s mass drone strike on Kyiv on Sunday morning, after being hit by falling debris. The death was confirmed by mayor Vitali Klitschko. Posting on Telegram he said that the man had been killed, along with a 35-year-old woman who was injured by the fall of a Shahed drone’s wreckage near a petrol station in Solomyanskyi, in the south-west of the city. Fires were also reported in Kyiv, caused by the drones, as well as damaged buildings which had been struck by the UAVs. Ukrainian officials are calling the raid on Kyiv the largest drone attack on the city since the start of the war. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 52 out of the 54 Russia-launched drones, calling it a record attack with the Iranian-made “kamikaze” drones. It was not immediately clear how many of the drones were shot over Kyiv. The air force said on Telegram that Russia had targeted military and critical infrastructure facilities in the central regions of Ukraine, and the Kyiv region in particular. Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said earlier that preliminary information indicated the air raid was the largest drone attack since the start of Russia’s invasion in February 2022. He added that Russia used the Iranian-made Shahed drones in the attack. Reuters was not able to independently verify that information. “Today, the enemy decided to ‘congratulate’ the people of Kyiv on Kyiv Day with the help of their deadly UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles),” Popko said on the Telegram messaging app. “The attack was carried out in several waves, and the air alert lasted more than five hours.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iran earlier this week to reconsider the supply of deadly drones to Russia in order to stop their slide into “the dark side of history”. But Iran on Saturday said his comments were really designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Christine Kearney and here’s an overview of the latest. Russia carried out a major two-wave overnight air attack on Kyiv that killed at least one person, officials said, calling it the biggest drone attack on the capital since the start of the war, as Kyiv prepares to celebrate its birthday on Sunday. The pre-dawn attacks came on the last Sunday of May when the capital celebrates Kyiv Day, the anniversary of its official founding 1,541 years ago. Ukraine says it shot down more than 40 drones. More on that story soon. In other news: Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. The commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent, declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhnyi’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told the Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/30/tuesday-briefing-ukrainian-counteroffensive-begins-in-kherson","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T06:09:34Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Ukrainian counteroffensive begins in Kherson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/tuesday-briefing-ukrainian-counteroffensive-begins-in-kherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/30/tuesday-briefing-ukrainian-counteroffensive-begins-in-kherson","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Ukrainian counteroffensive begins in Kherson","bodyText":"Good morning. Last night, a senior advisor to Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that a long-awaited counteroffensive in the southern Kherson region was underway. Zelenskiy did not directly address the attack in his nightly address, but told Russian troops “If they want to survive, it is time … to flee”. Russia confirmed that a new offensive had begun, but claimed that it had “failed miserably”. The live blog has the very latest this morning. Today’s newsletter, which comes a little late as the situation develops, will run you through what we do know so far, reasons for caution over the scale of the attack – and why a counteroffensive in Kherson could be so important. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Education | Leading Conservatives including two former Tory education secretaries have urged the incoming prime minister to address rising cost pressures on schools as a matter of urgency, as head teachers struggle to pay soaring energy and wage bills. Immigration and asylum | The Home Office is paying a company £2m over six months to pick up people trying to cross the Channel, amid tension with the Royal Navy over its role in Priti Patel’s plans to deter asylum seekers. Details were published as crossing in small boats hit a new record. Space travel | Nasa postponed its planned launch of a test mission for a rocket that can ferry humans to and from the moon because of an unexpected engine issue. The Artemis 1 mission is now scheduled to launch on 2 September. Conservatives | Liz Truss has been accused of “running scared” of scrutiny after pulling out of a BBC interview scheduled for Tuesday, meaning she is likely to become prime minister without undergoing a single set-piece broadcast quizzing. Agriculture | A presidential taskforce in Indonesia is investigating the recruitment of fruit pickers who say they took on debts of up to £5,000 to secure jobs in Kent. The Guardian revealed that Indonesian labourers were harvesting berries on a farm that supplies Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Tesco. In depth: What we know about the attack so far *** How did Ukrainian officials frame the attack in Kherson? At a briefing reported on Monday afternoon, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, said that an offensive in Kherson, the only regional capital Russia has been able to secure since the war began, was underway. Her comments came after video circulated that apparently showed a soldier from the Russian-run self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk saying Ukrainian forces had broken through. The Guardian’s Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv reported comments echoing Humenyuk’s last night from Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy himself did not refer to the attack specifically in his nightly address. But he said: “The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Other Ukrainian officials echoed those claims. Sergiy Khlan, a local deputy and adviser to Kherson’s regional governor, said it was “the beginning of the end of the occupation of Kherson region” and “a prepared, well-balanced start of a counteroffensive”. *** How do they say it has gone so far? Arestovych said that Ukrainian troops were attacking Russian defences along the frontline and claimed they had broken through in several places. He also said ferries on the west bank of the Dnieper river, which are being used to supply Russian forces in the territory, were being shelled. The BBC reported officials in Kyiv claiming that US-supplied Himars rocket systems had been used to destroy three bridges across the Dnieper as well as temporary bridges created by Russian forces. The BBC also said that a Ukrainian operational group in the region claimed a Russian-backed regiment had left its positions and Russian paratroopers had fled. Ukrainian officials declined to give many details of the attack, citing operational security. But their claims could not be independently corroborated. While witnesses reported blasts in the cities of Kherson and Nova Kakhovka, the extent and success of Ukrainian operations are yet to be confirmed. The Financial Times reported remarks from John Kirby, a US official, who said Ukraine’s actions had “already had an impact on Russia’s military capabilities” because Moscow had been forced to divert resources to the region from the east of the country. This at-a-glance piece gives a wider picture of the situation in Ukraine this morning, including news of a team of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, where Kyiv claims Russian occupiers are violating nuclear safety protocols. *** What does Russia say? Russia’s state-owned news agency Ria cited the defence ministry in Moscow as acknowledging that Ukrainian troops attempted an offensive in the southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. A senior official in Nova Kakhovka told Ria that civilians had been ordered to take refuge in bomb shelters. The Russian defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had sustained significant casualties and claimed the “enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably”. The FT reported that Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, said on Telegram that the claimed counterattack was “the latest fake [news] from Ukrainian propaganda” and said Ukraine’s forces were “taking extremely severe losses”. Again, it is not yet possible to verify these claims, and Russia routinely inflates the scale of Ukrainian losses in its updates. Recently, Western and Ukrainian intelligence has noted a buildup of Russian troops and equipment in the region, potentially suggesting Russia was preparing its own offensive. *** What are the prospects of success? Humenyuk told reporters that Russian forces were strong in the region – and that even though morale was low among their ranks, “it was too early to relax”. In comments on his Telegram account reported by the Guardian’s Samantha Lock on the live blog, Oleksiy Arestovych characterised the operation as “a planned slow operation to grind the enemy” and said: “This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s ability to conduct its claimed counteroffensive has been greatly enhanced by the provision of weapons by the West, and Russian positions in the region have been under artillery barrage for weeks and cut off from their supply lines. But it is too early to say whether those successes will translate to victory on the ground. A US official quoted by the New York Times said that the Pentagon “remained cautious about whether Ukraine’s current military capabilities were sufficient to make significant gains.” *** Why is an attack in Kherson significant? Kherson has huge symbolic and practical significance as the only regional capital to have been secured by the Russian invaders – and if Ukraine can entirely cut off enemy forces on the western bank of the Dnieper, they will have a realistic prospect of success. That would disrupt Russian attempts to proceed with a sham referendum designed to give credibility to Moscow’s claims that residents of Kherson and other parts of southern Ukraine wish to be part of Russia. For more on how that prospect is viewed by citizens in Kherson, read this piece by Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer from earlier this month, in which one interviewee says: “no one thought about [a referendum] before the war. Now it will be a referendum at gunpoint.” There has been a growing sense that if Kyiv is to retake the city, it must do so as a matter of urgency: changing weather – including rain that will make the countryside muddy and far harder for ground troops to traverse – in the autumn means that there is a powerful incentive to launch a counteroffensive now. There are also fears that European support could fade as the impact of high energy prices begins to take hold. Success in any operation to take Kherson could break a long period of deadlock – and persuade Western allies that it is worth continuing to provide the arms and funding that Ukraine needs. But if an attack fails, Ukrainian morale would be undermined, and Russia’s plans to bring the south of the country under its full control would be reinforced.

The Green federal economics minister, Robert Habeck, answered with a decisive “yes it can”, a day after the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was meant to deliver from Russia as much as 70% of Germany’s gas requirements. There are considerable doubts as to whether the $11bn project will ever now go ahead. But even before Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday morning, NS2 was just a small part of the wider discussion some say Germany has been far too slow to have. At stake is nothing less than the future of German – and by extension European – energy security. Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants, leaving observers wondering how the country was planning to make its energy policy workable and future-proof. Sceptics have questioned how it made sense for Germany to make itself so dependent on Russian gas when it should be distancing itself from Putin’s autocratic machinery. Until recently, the answer from the top of government was that this was an economic project, not a political one. The robotically repeated mantra now sounds at the best naive, and at the worst, given the current turn of events, a self-defeating decision which has helped fund Putin’s war. Habeck admitted “we face turbulent days ahead”, as he promised on Wednesday that the government would provide relief where necessary to compensate for the expected rise in gas prices. One of the government’s main predicaments is whether it can deliver on its promise to make a switch to renewable energy sources in order to reach its climate goal to become carbon neutral by 2045. Gas is seen as the vital bridge in that endeavour, which, while seen as ambitious by international standards, is viewed by many climate experts as barely adequate. Importing liquified natural gas (LNG) has been viewed as one option as part of a diversification strategy. However, this has been beset by numerous problems – not least the lack of a terminal in Germany necessary to handle LNG imports. Neither would available LNG supplies be able to fully replace Russian gas and it is also an expensive alternative. Gas already comes from Norway, but those supplies cannot be increased as it is already producing to capacity. Leonhard Birnbaum, the CEO of Germany’s biggest gas and electricity provider E.ON, said that while energy supplies for this winter were secure, next year could be more of a challenge. “If Russian gas imports were to break down completely, the immediate effect wouldn’t be so dramatic as we’re almost at the end of the heating season. But next winter it could be the case that we’re not able to meet the supply demands of all the industrial customers. Some of them may have to turn off the power. It is utopian to believe that Russian gas can be completely replaced from one day to the next by other sources,” he told Die Zeit. Other critics have said Germany only has itself to blame, having dillydallied on its much vaunted plans to switch from fossil fuels to renewables. A positive headline to emerge from the recent heavy storms which hit much of northern Europe, was the record amount of energy fed into the grid by its wind turbines on Sunday. But it also served to underline how slow the development of renewables has been. Beyond Germany’s borders the short-term answer is thought to be simple: why not reverse the decisions, or at least prolong the use of coal-fired power plants and temporarily restart the nuclear reactors? But these options are seen as politically suicidal in Berlin – in particular the reactivation of nuclear plants (as well as being highly impractical and disastrous from a legal point of view). Opposition to nuclear was the founding principal of the Green party – two of whose former leaders, Habeck and the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, are now in government. Both have always opposed the pipeline. There is no evidence of ordinary Germans panicking, although heating installation companies say there has been a considerable increase in inquiries about heat pumps from people keen to find an alternative to the gas central heating. “In the short term it won’t be easy to move away from natural gas,” Hans-Martin Henning, the head of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, told Tagesspiegel. “But in the medium term this must be part of the concept of speeding up the energy source switch in the heat sector and wherever possible electrical heat pumps should be used as a way of becoming more independent from natural gas.” Andreas Löschel, an energy economist, told the same newspaper that even before the Ukraine crisis, Russia had destroyed its own narrative about being a reliable provider of cheap gas. “The trust is no longer there,” he said. “Russia has shot itself in the foot”. Just days ago at a press briefing with Scholz in Moscow, Putin heaped praise on Scholz’s fellow Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor turned lobbyist for Gazprom, saying he was responsible for brokering generous fuel rates. It was one of Schröder’s final acts in office in 2005 to sign the NS2 deal before he was appointed chairman of the company behind it. On Thursday calls were growing for the government to remove Schröder’s privileges as a former chancellor, including an office and staff, amid reports they cost the taxpayer more than €400,000 (£344,244) a year, on top of his considerable earnings from lobbying for companies including Rosneft and Gazprom. An online petition said a “former chancellor who is financed by autocrats, and makes himself dependent on them, in so doing ridiculing German interests, should no longer be financed by the German taxpayer”. Some politicians called for him to be added to the list of individuals facing sanctions. Writing on the LinkedIn platform, Schröder said although “many mistakes” had “been made on both sides” in the relationship between the west and Russia, Russia’s “security interests did not justify its intervention by military means”. He called on the Russian government to “end the suffering of the people in Ukraine as soon as possible”. He also warned against “cutting the remaining political, economic and societal connections” between Europe and Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-deadly-shootout-between-russian-troops-followed-argument-over-religion-says-zelenskiy-adviser","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-16T18:53:30Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war, as it happened: nearly 9,000 Russian troops to be stationed in Belarus; Putin’s forces continuing ‘forced deportations’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-deadly-shootout-between-russian-troops-followed-argument-over-religion-says-zelenskiy-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-deadly-shootout-between-russian-troops-followed-argument-over-religion-says-zelenskiy-adviser","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war, as it happened: nearly 9,000 Russian troops to be stationed in Belarus; Putin’s forces continuing ‘forced deportations’","bodyText":"President Zelenskiy said a “very severe” situation persists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with the “most difficult” fighting near the town of Bakhmut. Officials in Donetsk, which remains under Russian separatist control, have blamed Ukraine for a rocket attack that did significant damage to the city’s mayor’s office. More than 30 settlements across Ukraine have been hit by Russian strikes in the last day, according to the Ukrainian military. The Ukrainian military has also said the estimated number of Russians killed since the start of the war has reached 65,000. Two schools in the southern Zaporizhzhia region have reportedly been destroyed in Russian strikes. Ukraine has succeeded in maintaining its energy stability after Russian attacks last week that targeted key parts of its infrastructure, Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal has said. Russia is “probably incapable of producing advanced munitions at the rate they are being expended”, according to the latest update from the UK Ministry of Defence. US and allied security officials believe Iran has agreed to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles and attack drones intended for use in Ukraine. The Belarusian defence ministry has said just under 9,000 Russian troops will be stationed in Belarus as part of a “regional grouping” of forces to protect its borders. Russian soldiers have reportedly shot dead Ukrainian conductor Yuriy Kerpatenko in his home after he refused to take part in a concert in occupied Kherson. US-based thinktank The Institute for the Study of War has said Russia continues to conduct “massive, forced deportations” of Ukrainians that “likely amount to a deliberate ethnic cleansing campaign”. The UN’s undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs has reportedly arrived in Moscow for talks over grain exports. Poverty in Ukraine has increased tenfold since the start of the war, a top World Bank official has said. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said it was incumbent upon Nato allies and other responsible countries, including China and India, to “send a very clear and decisive message to Russia that they should not contemplate the use of nuclear weapons in this conflict”. He was a surprise absentee from the leadership race in July, but the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is now being touted as a replacement for UK prime minister Liz Truss. Wallace was promoted to defence secretary in 2019 and has been praised for his handling of the Ukraine crisis. He was one of the first to make Kyiv’s case with western allies, and pushed the government to support Ukraine. Retaining control of its electricity assets has given Queensland in Australia an edge over other regions in coordinating and funding the race to decarbonise the economy, Mick de Brenni, the state’s energy minister, said. Queensland last month unveiled a $62bn plan to rid its power grid of coal by 2036, replacing the generation with 25 gigawatts of large-scale wind and solar farms, new transmission lines and two giant pumped hydro plants for storage. With its dominant ownership position of electricity generation and distribution assets, the government has been able to offset the impact of higher energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On the ground, Ukrainian soldiers told AFP there was now close combat with members of pro-Russian forces. Enemy troops “start when night falls. They send their reconnaissance units around 6pm,” said one soldier who uses the nom de guerre “Poliak”. In a bitter tone of voice, the 50-year-old from the 93rd brigade said inexperienced, “single use” soldiers are sent into the line of fire to “divert” attention from more experienced units carrying out sabotage. “Between then and 5 am, we get about seven or eight (diversion) attacks like that,” he explained. Poliak recently suffered a minor shrapnel injury and returned exhausted from the most intense of the fighting. After four sleepless nights, the former truck driver said he experiences “hallucinations” from the stress and fatigue. One evening, his unit opened fire, thinking they could see a Russian commando through night-vision goggles. Early in the morning, they realised they had been shooting at a pile of logs. The Russian missiles come to Zaporizhzhia when the “people’s dreams are at their deepest”, says Oleksandr Starukh. The governor of this south-eastern region of Ukraine since 2020, Starukh, 49, took the call from his bed at 5.08am on the morning of 24 February when one the first missiles of the Russian invasion had hit a local air defence system. Nearly eight months later he is still taking the dawn calls. The Russians generally strike, he says, at 2am, 4am and 6am. The latest raid out of the dark had been just a few hours earlier, when 10 S-300 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed-136 kamikaze drones crashed into the suburbs of the region’s eponymous capital at 5.30am on Saturday morning. An update from the ministry of defence of Ukraine. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday it was incumbent upon Nato allies and other responsible countries, including China and India, to “send a very clear and decisive message to Russia that they should not contemplate the use of nuclear weapons in this conflict”. If you’re just joining us, here’s a quick roundup of all the day’s news from the war in Ukraine. President Zelenskiy has said a “very severe” situation persists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with the “most difficult” fighting near the town of Bakhmut. Officials in Donetsk, which remains under Russian separatist control, have blamed Ukraine for a rocket attack that did significant damage to the city’s mayor’s office. More than 30 settlements across Ukraine have been hit by Russian strikes in the last day, according to the Ukrainian military. The Ukrainian military has also said the estimated number of Russians killed since the start of the war has reached 65,000. Two schools in the southern Zaporizhzhia region have reportedly been destroyed in Russian strikes. Ukraine has succeeded in maintaining its energy stability after Russian attacks last week that targeted key parts of its infrastructure, Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal has said. Russia is “probably incapable of producing advanced munitions at the rate they are being expended”, according to the latest update from the UK Ministry of Defence. US and allied security officials believe Iran has agreed to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles and attack drones intended for use in Ukraine. The Belarusian defence ministry has said just under 9,000 Russian troops will be stationed in Belarus as part of a “regional grouping” of forces to protect its borders. Russian soldiers have reportedly shot dead Ukrainian conductor Yuriy Kerpatenko in his home after he refused to take part in a concert in occupied Kherson. US-based thinktank The Institute for the Study of War has said Russia continues to conduct “massive, forced deportations” of Ukrainians that “likely amount to a deliberate ethnic cleansing campaign”. The UN’s undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs has reportedly arrived in Moscow for talks over grain exports. Poverty in Ukraine has increased tenfold since the start of the war, a top World Bank official has said. Ukraine has succeeded in maintaining its energy stability after Russian attacks last week that targeted key parts of its infrastructure, Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal has said. In a post on Facebook, Shmyhal said that, in the first three days of the week, Russia launched up to 130 missile and drone strikes against civilian and energy facilities, particularly in the capital, Kyiv. He said maintenance workers had been able to restore electricity to some 4,000 settlements, and that people across Ukraine had voluntarily reduced their consumption by an average of 10%, making it easier to avoid outages. “The aggressor sought to intimidate Ukrainians and paralyse the state’s energy industry. He did not achieve his goal,” Shmyhal said. Four ships carrying 140,000 tonnes of agricultural products left Ukrainian ports on Sunday, the country’s ministry of infrastructure has said. The ministry said the ships left the ports of Odesa and Pivdennyi on Ukraine’s south-western coast and were destined for Africa, Asia, and Europe. It added that, since a deal agreed in July, 1.1m tonnes of grain had been sent to Africa, including five ships’ worth chartered by the UN World Food Programme. Many African countries depend heavily on Russian and Ukraine for their grain imports. In September, Russia’s President Putin threatened to reintroduce limits on exports, claiming the majority of the grain leaving Ukraine was going to the European Union, not developing countries. UN data shows that, since the deal was signed, dozens of shipments have gone to developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. Speaking during a visit to Senegal earlier this month, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his country would “do our best until the last breath to continue exporting Ukrainian grain to Africa and the world for food security”. As per our previous post, the UN’s undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs is currently in Moscow negotiating an extension to the July deal. Martin Griffiths, the UN’s under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, has arrived in Moscow for talks over grain exports, Russian state media agency Tass reports, citing a diplomatic source. The agency said Griffiths – along with Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development – is attending talks with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Vershinin. Since a deal brokered in July between the UN, Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, more than six million tonnes of grain and other agricultural exports have been allowed to leave Ukraine. The original deal applied for 120 days after signing and is set to expire next month. Speaking earlier this week, Griffiths said he was “reasonably confident” the deal could be extended, possibly to apply for a longer period. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Israel prepared for a new wave of immigration from the former Soviet state. About 13,000 Ukrainians with Jewish heritage have made aliyah, or emigrated, since then. Unexpectedly, double that have come from Russia, meaning around one in eight Russian Jews have left the country. Since Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation announcement in September, their numbers are growing. “I got an Israeli passport many years ago because I always knew something like this was possible. I always knew the dark days of the Soviet Union could return,” said Anna Klatis, a journalism professor at Moscow State University who left for Jerusalem with her 16-year-old daughter in February. “I could not let [my daughter] grow up in a place where freedoms are vanishing.” Read the full story here: The Belarusian defence ministry has said just under 9,000 Russian troops will be stationed in Belarus as part of a “regional grouping” of forces to protect its borders, Reuters reports. Last week, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said his troops would be deployed with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border as part of a “joint grouping”, citing what he said were threats from Ukraine and the west. “The first troop trains with Russian servicemen who are part of the [regional grouping] began to arrive in Belarus,” Valeriy Revenko, the head of the defence ministry’s international military cooperation department, tweeted on Sunday. “The relocation will take several days. “The total number will be a little less than 9,000 people.” People in the Kyiv region have averted blackouts by reducing their power usage, the regional governor has said. Posting on Telegram, Oleksiy Kuleba said that, by exercising “responsibility and solidarity, residents had helped reduce energy consumption by 7%”. “This made it possible to spend the evening without forced power outages,” he said. “In the evening, turn off at least one electrical appliance and unnecessary lighting. Let’s hold another front! Let’s use energy wisely!” Ukrainian authorities have been concerned about the country’s power supply since Russian strikes at the start of this week damaged key parts of its energy infrastructure. US and allied security officials believe Iran has agreed to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles and attack drones intended for use in Ukraine, the Washington Post reports. The paper says intelligence from a US-allied country suggests Iranian officials visited Moscow last month to finalise the terms of a shipment of additional weapons. It comes after UK intelligence suggested Russia was unlikely to be able to produce missiles as fast as it is currently using them. On Monday, Russia is believed to have used up more than 80 missiles in a series of strikes across Ukraine, including onthe capital, Kyiv. On Saturday, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said the country “has not and will not provide any weapon to be used in the war in Ukraine”. No matter what Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, says, international opinion is dead against Putin’s war of aggression. More than 140 countries condemned Moscow at the UN last week. Only North Korea, Syria, Belarus and Nicaragua voted in support. Yet despite this huge anti-war consensus, backed by three-quarters of the world’s countries, substantive steps to halt the fighting and pursue a genuine peace process remain wholly absent. The reason there’s no peace – the reason diplomacy isn’t working – is simple. Putin does not want it. Since the US first warned of invasion, he has rebuffed all efforts to resolve matters peacefully. Western leaders must now deploy the one big non-military weapon they still have in reserve. It’s time to admit diplomacy has failed. It’s time to complete Moscow’s isolation by withdrawing all American, European and G7 diplomats, closing all western embassies, and ostracising Russian officials in international forums, including the UN. All Russian diplomats must simultaneously be expelled. Read Simon Tisdall’s full piece here: The number of children killed since the start start of the war now stands at 423, the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general has said. It added that a further 810 children had been injured in the conflict and that the most child casualties were suffered in the regions of Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Kyiv. It also said the numbers were not final because work was ongoing to collate tallies of those killed and injured in areas still occupied or where fighting is ongoing. Russian-installed officials have said Ukraine is responsible for a rocket attack that struck the mayor’s office in a key Ukrainian city controlled by pro-Kremlin forces. Separately, Ukrainian officials said Russian rockets struck a city across from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, injuring six people. The municipal building in separatist-controlled Donetsk was seriously damaged by the rocket attack, the Associated Press reports. Plumes of smoke swirled around the building, which had rows of blown-out windows and a partially collapsed ceiling. Cars nearby were burned out. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Kyiv did not immediately claim responsibility or comment on the attack. Ukrainian authorities have also reported that at least six people were wounded as a result of rocket attacks across from Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, where Russia has stationed its troops. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said that two residents of Nikopol had been hospitalised following the strikes, which also damaged five power lines, gas pipelines, and civilian businesses and residential buildings. Ukraine’s presidential office and regional authorities also reported that Russian rockets destroyed two schools, a park and private houses in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, which has undergone sustained Russian shelling since Moscow illegally annexed it along with three other Ukrainian provinces last month. The presidential office also said Moscow continued to shell civilian settlements along the frontline in the eastern Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, where Kyiv has been pressing a counteroffensive. It added that “active hostilities” continued in the southern Kherson region, another key focus of the Ukrainian advance, with repeated Russian strikes on a series of villages recently retaken by Kyiv. Russia claims to have repelled efforts by Ukrainian troops to advance in the Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, and says its forces have inflicted what it described as significant losses against the enemy as well as destroying three US-made M777 howitzers. The battlefield reports could not immediately be verified. Russia also said it was continuing airstrikes on military and energy targets in Ukraine, using long-range precision-guided weapons. Two schools in the southern Zaporizhzhia region have been destroyed in Russian strikes, the regional governor has said. Posting on Telegram, Oleksandr Starukh said a school in the village of Vozdvizhivka was “almost completely destroyed” after being hit by two rockets. A second school in the village of Dobropilla was also destroyed, he said, as were a number of private homes. Starukh added that there were no casualties in the attacks. “The enemy is defeated on the front, so it destroys and destroys the civilian infrastructure,” he said. Russian soldiers have shot dead a Ukrainian musician in his home after he refused to take part in a concert in occupied Kherson, according to the culture ministry in Kyiv. Conductor Yuriy Kerpatenko declined to take part in a concert “intended by the occupiers to demonstrate the so-called ‘improvement of peaceful life’ in Kherson”, the ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page. The concert on 1 October was intended to feature the Gileya chamber orchestra, of which Kerpatenko was the principal conductor, but he “categorically refused to cooperate with the occupants”, the statement said. Read the full story here: Poverty in Ukraine has increased tenfold since the start of the war, a top World Bank official has said. Speaking to Reuters, Arup Banerji, the bank’s regional director for eastern Europe, said Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure away from the frontlines of the conflict have complicated an already dire economic situation in the country. “If this continues, the outlook is going to be much, much harder,” he said. “As winter really starts biting ... certainly by December or January, and if the houses are not repaired ... there may be another internal wave of migration, of internally displaced persons.” He said that, by the end of next year, more than half of the population of Ukraine could be living in poverty. More than 30 settlements in Ukraine have been hit by Russian strikes in the last day, according to the Ukrainian military. The latest update from the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the strikes had hit civilian areas. It said particularly targeted had been an area east of the capital, Kyiv, as well as others in the eastern regions of Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia and the southern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson. “Violating the norms of international humanitarian law … [Russia] strikes critical infrastructure and the homes of the civilian populations,” it said. It added that Russia also continued to shell the position of Ukrainian troops “along the entire contact line”. For years, and especially since the invasion of 24 February, Russian state media has been calling to wipe Ukraine off the map, for killing Ukrainians en masse, and dehumanising its people, smearing them as “Nazis” who need to be “denazified”. As the cases of war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and genocide pile up against the Russian leadership and military, is there a way to hold members of the propaganda machine accountable as well? Are they protected by freedom of speech or is their role qualitatively different: not mere trumpeters of abhorrent opinion but facilitators of crimes? Read the full piece from Peter Pomerantsev, author of a number of acclaimed books on modern Russia, here: In case you missed it last night, Elon Musk has said SpaceX will continue to provide Starlink satellite internet over Ukraine. Musk, who runs SpaceX alongside electric car manufacturer Tesla, had earlier said the company had spent $80m providing the service for free, and that it couldn’t continue doing so indefinitely. The US military had confirmed it was communicating with Musk about funding the network. But on Saturday night, Musk tweeted: “The hell with it… even though Starlink is still losing money &amp; other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.” Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to President Zelensky, replied to the post with a Star Wars reference. “You were supposed to destroy the Sith… So you did…” he said. “Thank you for joining the right side. Ukraine appreciates that.” Norway has arrested a Russian national carrying a drone and camera equipment after he was seen taking photos of an airport in the far north, the second such arrest in a week. Agence France-Presse reports that Norway is on high alert following accounts of mysterious drone sightings close to offshore oil and gas drilling platforms run by the country’s major energy producer. Last month’s Nord Stream gas pipeline blasts in the Baltic Sea are widely assumed to be the result of sabotage. The 51 year-old Russian man, whose name was not disclosed, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of flying a drone in Norway, to which he confessed. Along with several other Western nations, Norway has banned Russian nationals from overflying its territory, with breaches punishable by up to three years in jail. In a statement, police in the northern town of Tromso: Police have confiscated a large amount of photography equipment, including a drone and a cache of memory cards. Russia continues to conduct “massive, forced deportations” of Ukrainians that “likely amount to a deliberate ethnic cleansing campaign”, according to a US-based think tank. In its latest assessment of the conflict, the Institute for the Study of War notes that Russian officials have “openly admitted to placing children from occupied areas of Ukraine up for adoption with Russian families”. It adds: “Russian authorities may additionally be engaged in a wider campaign of ethnic cleansing by depopulating Ukrainian territory through deportations and repopulating Ukrainian cities with imported Russian citizens.” Russian is “probably incapable of producing advanced munitions at the rate they are being expended”, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence. The ministry said attacks like those launched across Ukraine on Monday, in which Russia fired some 80 cruise missiles, represent a “further degradation of Russia’s long-range missile stocks, which is likely to constrain their ability to strike the volume of targets they desire in future”. Andrei Nikiforov, a lawyer from St Petersburg, was one of the hundreds of thousands of Russians mobilised since last month to hold the frontlines in his country’s faltering war in Ukraine. On 25 September he received his call-up papers. By 7 October, just two weeks later, he was dead. “We don’t know what happened,” said Alexander Zelensky, the head of the Nevsky Collegium of Lawyers, of which Nikiforov was a member. Zelensky and a member of Nikiforov’s family confirmed his call-up and death. “All we have is a date and a place.” That place was Lysychansk, one of the most dangerous spots near the frontlines. The first coffins are now returning to Russia from Ukraine, bringing the remains of ordinary Russians who at first were promised a quick “special military operation” and now have been drafted to go and fight in a war. Their deaths may mark another inflection point for Russia in the conflict, where at least half a million men have been drafted or fled their homes to avoid it. Andrew Roth in Moscow has the full story: The estimated number of Russians killed since the start of the war has reached 65,000, according to the Ukrainian military. This morning’s update from the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the death toll had risen by 300 over the last 24 hours. It added that the number of tanks lost had reached 2,529, and that 5,193 armored personnel vehicles had also been destroyed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the situation in eastern Ukraine is “the most difficult” near the town of Bakhmut, a few days after pro-Russian forces announced they were moving closer to the city. “A very severe situation persists in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions” in the Donbas, the Ukrainian president said in his daily address on Saturday. The most difficult is near Bakhmut, like in previous days. We are still holding our positions. Agence France-Presse also reported that Zelenskiy’s comments came after Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donetsk region of Ukraine’s said on Thursday that they had captured two nearby villages, Opytine and Ivangrad. Russian troops have for weeks been pummelling Bakhmut, a wine-making and salt-mining city that used to be populated by 70,000 people, in the hope of capturing the city. Shelling from Ukrainian forces damaged the administration building in the city of Donetsk, the Russian-backed administration of the city said on Sunday. Reuters reported it saying on the Telegram messaging app that the main entry into the building was hit and several nearby cars damaged. There was no immediate reaction from Ukraine to the attack on the eastern city, which is the capital of the Donetsk region and is controlled by Russian-backed forces. No civilians were killed in the attack at a military base in Russia’s Belgorod region, but many soldiers were killed or wounded, the governor of Belgorod region said early on Sunday. Vyacheslav Gladkov was quoted by Reuters as saying on the Telegram messaging app: A terrible event happened on our territory, on the territory of one of the military units. Many soldiers were killed and wounded ... There are no residents of the Belgorod region among the wounded and killed. Gladkov did not say how many soldiers were killed. The Russian state news agency RIA cited the defence ministry as saying 11 people were killed and 15 wounded. Some Russian independent media outlets reported that the number of casualties was higher than the official figures. An adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the two Russian volunteers who opened fire on fellow volunteers at a military base had carried out the attack after an argument over religion. At least 11 people were killed and 15 wounded in the shooting at a military training ground in the Belgorod region in south-western Russia on Saturday, the Russian defence ministry has said. The two attackers were shot dead. Reuters reported that Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy, said in a YouTube interview that the attackers were from the Central Asian nation of Tajikistan and had opened fire on the others after an argument over religion. Tajikistan is predominantly Muslim, while around half of Russians follow various branches of Christianity. The Russian ministry had said the attackers were from a nation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, which groups nine ex-Soviet republics, including Tajikistan. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the comments by Arestovych, a prominent commentator on the war. The independent Russian news website Sota Vision said the attack occurred in the small town of Soloti, close to the Ukrainian border and about 105km (65 miles) south-east of Belgorod. The Russian state media outlet RIA cited a defence ministry statement as saying: During a firearms training session with individuals who voluntarily expressed a desire to participate in the special military operation [against Ukraine], the terrorists opened fire with small arms on the personnel of the unit. The attack took place a week after an explosion damaged a bridge in Crimea linking to Russia. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here’s a rundown on the latest news and overnight developments as it just passes 9.30am in Kyiv. At least 11 people were killed and 15 wounded at a military training ground in south-west Russia’s Belgorod region when two volunteers opened fire on other troops, the Russian defence ministry said. The shooters were nationals from a former Soviet republic and had been shot dead after Saturday’s shooting, the ministry said, calling it a terrorist attack. Baza, a Russian news site with close ties to police, said the attack occurred at 10am local time during shooting practice. Elon Musk has announced his company SpaceX will continue to pay for Starlink satellite internet in Ukraine, a day after suggesting he could not keep funding the project. “The hell with it,” the billionaire tweeted on Saturday. “Even though Starlink is still losing money &amp; other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.” Russia has continued to try to hit Ukrainian’s energy infrastructure but Vladimir Putin’s forces did not appear to have enjoyed any significant success. One missile seriously damaged a key energy facility in the region around Ukraine’s capital, however, and 10 missiles and four drones hit locations in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian forces have repelled Russian attacks near 11 settlements, the Kyiv Independent has reported. According to the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces, Russian forces were attempting to advance near the settlements of Novosadove, Yakovlivka, Berestove, Bakhmut, Bakhmutske, Opytne, Krasnohorivka, Nevelske, Pervomaiske, Mariinka, and Pobieda. France will train up to 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers on its territory, France’s minister for the armed forces told Le Parisien newspaper in an interview on Saturday. Sebastien Lecornu said soldiers would “be taken into our units for several weeks”, and that France would also provide Ukraine with Crotale air defence systems, without specifying how many. Iran has reiterated that it rejects accusations it has supplied Russia with weapons “to be used in the war in Ukraine”, its foreign ministry said. The topic is due to be discussed by EU foreign ministers in a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. In a statement, the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, “emphasised that the Islamic republic of Iran has not and will not provide any weapon to be used in the war in Ukraine”. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence has revealed the identity of the “Ghost of Vinnytsia” who had replaced the “Ghost of Kyiv”, which turned out to be propaganda. The pilot, named as Vadym, has been Ukraine’s poster fighter in the past few weeks after multiple reports of Russian losses in Ukrainian skies. A fuel depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, caught fire after shelling on Saturday, its governor said, without specifying the shelling’s origin. The Russian foreign ministry has confirmed the re-equipping of Belarusian Su-25 aircraft to carry nuclear weapons, according to the Belarusian Hajun project. Ukrainian troops have launched an offensive in Kherson oblast, the Kyiv Independent reported, while it has not been confirmed by Ukraine.

In a debate that lasted more than two hours, the hard-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon and the hard-right Éric Zemmour, expected to be a presidential candidate, went head to head on prime-time television on Thursday evening. The much-publicised clash featured mentions of gulags, Mao, Stalin, pizzas and couscous in a verbal slugging match that Mélenchon had said he hoped would not be “a cockfight”. In the end, it was. Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) vaunted the merits of what he called “créolisation”, which he described as the idea in which “human beings come together and create something in common”. Zemmour, a political essayist, writer and TV pundit, hammered home his trademark themes: immigration, opposition to Islam, the ethno-nationalist Great Replacement Theory and a plan to ban “non-French” given names. Islam is “incompatible” with the Republic’s motto “liberty, equality, fraternity”, Zemmour said. The French “feel colonised … and have an existential fear of disappearing”. Lawlessness in the country was “a jihad … a war being waged against us, a war of civilisations, a war of looting, a war of theft, a war of rape and a war of murder,” the political writer added. Mélenchon accused Zemmour of having a “stunted vision of France” and being “a danger for our country”. “There are many of us and we will not let you drive out Muslims, Monsieur Zemmour,” he said. “You are a racist and you’ve been convicted as such.” “Aren’t you ashamed?” he asked. “No, not all,” Zemmour replied. Zemmour said he would limit social security benefits, Mélenchon said he would increase them “including for foreign families” and raise the minimum wage for good measure. Mélenchon said he was more interested in the environment and climate crisis and would drop nuclear power. “Life has taught me that it is dangerous,” he said. Zemmour responded that France’s nuclear production that supplies 75% of electricity in the country was to be praised. “He wants to save the planet, I just want to save France,” he said. And so it continued. One of the rare subjects both agreed on was that France should pull out of Nato. That, and the fact they were not going to be called to order by the television journalists trying to keep the debate on track. The televised confrontation was a hit for BFMTV, which recorded 3.8 million viewers for the live programme. The Morocco-born Mélenchon, who ran in the 2012 presidential election and again in 2017 when he came a respectable fourth in the first round against a field of 11 candidates, has already announced he will be standing again next April. Zemmour, born in France to a Jewish-Algerian family of French nationality that came to France during the Algerian war, has yet to officially declare his candidature, but supporters have already started canvassing the country’s mayors for the 500 signatures necessary to stand. If he does, he will be trawling in the same pool of voters as the far-right Rassemblement National candidate, Marine Le Pen. Opinion polls suggest neither man will be collecting the keys to the Élysée Palace next spring. Currently, the most predicted outcome is a Macron-Le Pen second-round runoff as in 2017. Still, seven months is an eternity in French politics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2021/nov/23/boris-johnsons-much-criticised-speech-to-the-cbi-in-full","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-23T11:08:43Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson’s much-criticised speech to the CBI, in full","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/23/boris-johnsons-much-criticised-speech-to-the-cbi-in-full","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/nov/23/boris-johnsons-much-criticised-speech-to-the-cbi-in-full","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson’s much-criticised speech to the CBI, in full","bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s speech to the CBI has been called a “mess”, the “most embarrassing by a Conservative prime minister” since his most recent PMQs performance. It is said to have capped off a “pretty bad bloody fortnight” and left the prime minister struggling to command the confidence of his party. In it he referenced Peppa Pig, “funkapolitan” cafes and his time as motoring correspondent of GQ. Then he lost his place. So how bad was it? Here is the official transcript, judge for yourself: “Great to be here in Tyneside, the number one exporting region of the UK. Great to be with the CBI. And I want to begin with a massive thank you to British business for keeping going, for looking after your employees, for rising to the challenge, for responding to the call for ventilators in those first dark days. Dozens of you – kitchen appliance makers, hairdryer makers, Formula One motorcar manufacturers – turning your production lines over in days to try to save lives. For making the masks and the gowns and the gloves at such speed, turning things round from that awful moment when we realised we simply didn’t have the domestic production. So we have gone from being able to supply 1% of our domestic needs to 80%. And thank you British industry, enterprise, commerce, for producing not just one but perhaps half a dozen vaccines. Because, without you, let’s face it, we would simply not be here. And nor would tens of thousands of people in our country and millions around the world who owe their lives to your resourcefulness and inventiveness. And while I’m on the subject can I ask: who has had your booster? You all look far too young and thrusting to need a booster but get your booster as soon as you can because it is by vaccinating our country that we have been able to get your staff back to their place of work, to open our theatres, our restaurants and to get back for longer now than any other comparator country to something like normal life; even if we are still bumping elbows and wearing masks. I am not going to pretend that everything is going to be plain sailing – we can see the state of the pandemic abroad, the supply chain issues that we’re facing, the pressure on energy prices that we’re all facing, the skills shortages. But don’t forget, folks, my friends, it was only last year they were saying we would have an unemployment crisis now on the scale not seen since the 1980s or 1990s. They were forecasting 12% unemployment. And what have we got? Thanks to you – thanks to the resilience of British business – we have employment back in work at pre-pandemic levels. It was only last year that we experienced the biggest fall in output in a century as we were forced to lock down the economy. Well, look at us now. Thanks to you and thanks to British business bouncebackability, we are forecast to have the fastest economic growth in the G7. And I was there in the 70s and 80s and 90s. And I remember mass unemployment and the misery and the drain of the human spirit. And I would much rather have our problems today, which are fundamentally caused by a return in global confidence and a surge in demand. Because now we have a massive opportunity to fix these supply-side problems, to transform whole sectors of our economy and to tackle the chronic problems underlying the UK economy. The woeful imbalance in productivity across the country, but also the imbalance between British business between the go-getting world-beaters represented by so many people in this room and the long comet tail whose potential is, frankly, yet to be realised; that don’t have the skills – particularly the IT skills, as Rishi the chancellor so often points out – that don’t have the banks behind them, that don’t have the investment. And that is the mission of this country: to unite and level up; of this government, to unite and level up across the whole country. And I’ve got to be honest with you, it is a moral mission. As you get older, the funny thing is you get more idealistic and less cynical. It’s a moral thing but it is also an economic imperative. Because, if this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and, if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. And we would achieve what I believe we can, and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe. And, today, fate has handed us an opportunity to do that. When the first Industrial Revolution began 250 years ago, it was British industry that had first-mover advantage. For hundreds of years, we maintained that pace. Right up until the beginning of the 20th century, we were producing more coal, smelting more iron, building more ships and boilers and making more machines than virtually any other country on Earth. And today, we are on the brink of another revolution: a green industrial revolution. And again, there are many ways in which we have first-mover advantage. And today, I want to tell you in the CBI how Britain is going to win in the new green industrial revolution – provided we act and act now. I have had some pretty wonderful jobs in my life. But among the most purely hedonistic I would rank motoring correspondent of GQ magazine. I drove Ferraris, Maseratis, Nissan Skylines, Proton Sagas. You name it, I drove it. And I learned to admire the incredible diversity of the UK specialist motor manufacturing sector, which is actually the biggest in the world. And I have spent hours in the traffic listening to the porridge-like burble and pop of the biggest and most sophisticated internal combustion engines ever made. And I have heard that burble turn into an operatic roar as I have put my foot down and burned away from the lights at speeds I would not now confess to my protection officers. In that time, that great era, I only tried two EVs – electric vehicles: an extraordinary wheeled rabbit hutch that was so tiny you could park it sideways and I tried the first Tesla for sale in this country for GQ, that expired in the fast lane of the M40 – they’ve got a lot better. And when, a few years later, as mayor of London, I tried to get London motorists to go electric and we put in charging points around the city, I must confess that they were not then a soaraway success. And they stood forlorn like some piece of unused outdoor gym equipment. But 10 years after that, the tipping point has come, hasn’t it? UK sales of EVs are now increasing at 70% a year. And, in 2030, we are ending the market for new hydrocarbon ICEs – ahead of other European countries. And companies are responding. Here in the north-east, Nissan has decided to make an enormous bet on new electric vehicles and, together with Envision, there is now a massive new gigafactory for batteries. And around the world, these cars are getting ever more affordable. And at Glasgow two weeks ago, the tipping point came, as motor manufacturers representing a third of the world market – including the EU and America – announced that they would go electric by 2035. And, of course, Glasgow was far bigger and more important than that: 250 years after we launched the first Industrial Revolution, we are showing the world how to power past coal. When I was a kid, 80% of our electricity came from coal. And I remember those huge barges taking coal up the Thames to Battersea power station and those four chimneys belching fumes into the face and lungs of the city. By the time I became mayor, Battersea was a wreck; closed for being simply too polluting and good for nothing except the final shootout in gangster movies. But, in 2012, we were still 40% dependent on coal. Today, only 10 years later, coal supplies less than 2% of our power and, by 2024, it will be down to zero. And Battersea, of course, is a great funkapolitan hive of cafes and restaurants and hotels and homes, thanks to the vision of the former mayor. And every time I made that point to leaders in Glasgow – about the speed of the switch that we’ve made from coal – I could see them thinking about it and I could see them thinking ‘right, OK, maybe this is doable’. And, when I was a kid, literally 0% of our energy came from wind. And it seemed faddish and ludicrous to imagine that we could light and heat our homes with a technology that dated from ninth-century Persia, I think. And yet, today, look at the coast of the north-east where we are today: row after row stretching out to the North Sea, of beautiful white mills, as we claim a new harvest rich and green from the drowned meadows of Doggerland. And, on some days, we derive almost half this country’s energy needs with the biggest offshore wind production anywhere in the world – and growing the whole time. And that tipping point having been reached, the pace of change is now going to accelerate like a new Tesla. Because I can tell you, as a former motoring correspondent, EVs may not burble like sucking doves and they may not have that arum arum araaaaaagh that you love. But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari. And we are now embarked on a new epoch and, in just a few years’ time, after almost a century of using roughly the same technology, we are going to change radically. We are going to change radically our cars, our trucks, our buses, our ships, our boats, our planes, our trains, our domestic heating systems, our farming methods, our industrial processes, our power generation, and much else besides. And I can tell you the force driving that change, it won’t be government. And it won’t even be business – though business and government together will have a massive influence. It will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, the disciples of David Attenborough – not just in this country but around the world – who can see the consequences of climate change and who will be demanding better from us. And I confidently predict that, in just a few years’ time, it will be as noisome, offensive to the global consumer to open a new coal-fired power station as it is to get on a plane and light up a cigar. And, as the world reaches this pivotal moment post-Glasgow, it’s vital that we recognise not just the scale of the challenge, but the opportunity now for British business and industry. Because, in the end, it is you – it is businesspeople – who will fix this problem. Governments don’t innovate, governments don’t produce new products and get out and sell them in the market place. And, though governments can sell, governments can spend tens if not hundreds of billions, we know that the market has hundreds of trillions. And yet we also know that government has a vital role in making that market and in framing the right regulation. And to ensure that you, the British business, succeeds in this new world, we have set out a 10-point plan for government leadership; a new Decalogue that I produced exactly a year ago when I came down from Sinai and I said to my officials, ‘the new Ten Commandments thou shalt develop’: 1. Offshore wind 2. Hydrogen 3. Nuclear power 4. Zero-emission vehicles 5. Green public transport, cycling and walking 6. ‘Jet zero’ and green ships 7. Greener buildings 8. Carbon capture and storage 9. Nature and trees 10. Green finance And for each of those objectives, we are producing a roadmap so that you in the private sector can see the opportunities ahead and what you need to do. And we are regulating so as to require new homes and buildings to have EV charging points – with another 145,000 charging points to be installed thanks to these regulations. We are investing in new projects to turn wind power into hydrogen and the net zero strategy is expected to trigger about £90bn of private sector investment, driving the creation of high-wage, high-skill jobs across the UK as part of our mission to unite and level up across the country – not just in the green Industrial Revolution, of course, but in all sectors of the economy. And to help you and to build the platform to give you the advantage you need, we are now waging a cross-Whitehall campaign to solve our productivity puzzle and to rebalance our lopsided economy, fixing our infrastructure with investment on a scale not seen since the Victorians. And we must begin with energy and power generation if we are going to have, allow our manufacturing industry to succeed, we must end the unfairness that UK, high-energy intensive manufacturing pays so much more than our competitors overseas. And that’s why we are going to address the cost of our nuclear power and we are all now paying for the historic under under-investment in nuclear power. Which country first split the atom? Which country had the first civilian nuclear power plant? It was this one. And why have we allowed ourselves to be left behind? Well, you tell me. So we are investing not just in big new nuclear plants but in small nuclear reactors as well. And we are consulting on classifying this essential technology as “green investment” so that we can get more investment flowing in and ahead of the EU. Lenin once said that the communist revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country. Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin, Tony, before the CBI, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country. We are electrifying our cars, we are electrifying our rail – last week we announced three vast new high-speed lines, cutting the time from London to Manchester by an hour and creating a new Crossrail of the North, cutting the time from Manchester to Leeds from 55 to 33 minutes, a Crossrail for the Midlands, cutting journey times from Birmingham to Nottingham from one hour and 14 minutes to 26 minutes. But these plans are far richer and more ambitious than some of the coverage has perhaps suggested. To solve this country’s transport problems, you can’t just endlessly carve your way through virgin countryside. You have to upgrade and to electrify; you have to use the tracks that already exist and bring them back into service. And we are doing the Beeching reversals – that’s putting in lines that were taken out, sadly, in the last century. You have to put other transport networks as well, you have to put in clean buses, you have to improve – 4,000 new clean green buses we’re putting in. And, of course, you have to fix the roads as well. We cannot be endlessly hostile to road improvements. And we have to do it now, we have to fix it now. I know that there are some people who think that working habits have been remade by the pandemic and that everyone will be working only on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday in an acronym I won’t repeat. I don’t want to be dogmatic about this, but I have my doubts. And it is not just that young people need to be in the office to learn, and to compete, and to pick up social capital, there are also sound evolutionary reasons why mother nature does not like working from home. So I prophesy that people will come back, Tony, they will come to the office and they will come back on the roads and the rail. But people also want choice and that is why we must put in the gigabit broadband – as we are – which has gone up massively just in the last couple of years from 7% when I became PM to 65% at the beginning of next year. And, with safer streets, with great local schools, with fantastic broadband … [Lost it] [Uhhh] [Forgive me] [Forgive me] [Forgive me] … people will have the confidence to stay nearer the place they grew up to start business and business will have the confidence to invest. And then, of course, there is one thing that business wants and that this country needs far more than a hundred supersonic rail links, far more than broadband, and that is skills and the people that you all need to staff your business. It’s an astonishing fact that the 16- to 18-year-olds in this country are getting 40% less time and instruction than our competitors in the OECD, and so we’re turning that round. We are focusing on skills, skills, skills; investing in our FE colleges, our apprentices, in the knowhow and confidence of young people. And, since – as everybody knows – 80% of the 2030 workforce are already in work, we are giving every adult who needs it the chance to get a level-three skill – £3,000 for a lifetime skills guarantee. We are supporting bootcamps for everything from IT to entrepreneurship. And, at this pivotal moment in our economic history, we are taking advantage of our new freedoms to deliver freeports, as well as free trade deals, and to regulate differently and better to lengthen our lead in all the amazing new technologies of the 21st century: AI, cyber, quantum computing and all the rest – and all the applications of those technologies to the areas in which we excel. So you get fin tech, ed tech, bio tech, med tech, nano tech, ad tech, green tech. So you sound basically like 15th-century Mexico. And that is what this country is doing. There are only three countries that have produced more than 100 tech unicorns. And they are, as you will know, well which are they? Let’s see who’s been paying attention to any of my speeches in the last few … which, which three nations have produced more than 100 tech unicorns? [Audience-member: The United States, China and the UK.] Correct. They are the US, China and the UK. And the wonderful thing about the more than the 100 tech unicorns is they are dispersed now far more evenly across the whole of the UK than the tech unicorns of some of our rival competitor economies. And that is a fantastic thing. We want to see the dispersal of this growth and development across the UK. That’s why this government has doubled investment in scientific research – and, again, we want to see the benefits of that research across the whole of the country. But, in the end, and this is the most important message of all, there are, there are limits to what governments can do. And I just want to be absolutely clear about this – because this has been an extraordinary period. There has been the financial crisis of 2008 – where government had to intervene on a massive scale, then Covid – when government had to intervene on a massive scale. But government cannot fix everything and government sometimes should get out of your hair. And government should make sure there is less regulation and, indeed, less taxation. And the true driver of growth is not government, it is the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector And Tony, yesterday, I went as we all must to Peppa Pig World. Who’s been to … hands up anybody who’s been to Peppa Pig World? Not enough. I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World but I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place – it had very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass-transit systems, I noticed. Even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig. But the real lesson for me about going to Peppa Pig World – I’m surprised you haven’t been there – was about the power of UK creativity. Who would have believed, Tony, that a pig that looks like a hairdryer or possibly, well a sort-of Picasso-like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC would now be exported to 180 countries, with theme parks both in America and in China, as well as in the New Forest. And a business that is worth at least £6bn to this country – £6bn and counting. Now, I think that it is pure genius, don’t you? Peppa Pig? And no government in the world – no Whitehall civil servant in the world – could conceivably have come up with Peppa. So my final message to you, as we stand on the brink of this green industrial revolution and we prepare to use our new regulatory freedoms in what I believe will be a very strong post-Covid rebound, we are blessed, we are blessed not just with capital markets and the world’s best universities and incredible pools of liquidity in London and all the … the right time zone and the right language and opportunity across the whole country, we are also blessed with the amazing inventive power and range of British business. And that, above all, is what fills me with confidence, members of the CBI, for the days ahead. Thank you very much for your kind attention this morning, thank you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2019/sep/07/nuclear-power-station-could-destroy-minsmere-wildlife-haven-i-have-loved-since-childhood","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-07T12:00:07Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power station could destroy wildlife haven I’ve loved since childhood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2019/sep/07/nuclear-power-station-could-destroy-minsmere-wildlife-haven-i-have-loved-since-childhood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2019/sep/07/nuclear-power-station-could-destroy-minsmere-wildlife-haven-i-have-loved-since-childhood","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power station could destroy wildlife haven I’ve loved since childhood","bodyText":"Minsmere and I go back a long way. I can still remember the thrill of my first visit, in 1973, when I was just 13 years old. Later, I made my very first wildlife programme there, with Bill Oddie. And most recently, I presented live programmes from the reserve on the BBC’s red button for Springwatch. So naturally I am worried that this unique place could be ruined by the proposed building of Sizewell C nuclear power station, a few hundred metres down the coast. And I’m not the only one. My colleague Chris Packham, who like me first went there as a teenager, has called on EDF Energy to ensure that it safeguards Minsmere and its wildlife, now and in the future. More than 20,000 people have already written to EDF to raise their concerns, and the RSPB – which is firmly against the plans – is holding a Love Minsmere festival at the reserve on 15 September. There are more than 200 RSPB reserves in the UK – so what makes Minsmere special? The main reason is the incredible range of species found in such a small area – just 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres). The reserve’s bird list currently stands at nearly 350 species, of which more than 100 have bred; while more than 1,000 types of butterfly and moth have been recorded, including the eponymous Minsmere crimson underwing, recorded just once in the UK, here at Minsmere. This is all thanks to a complex mosaic of habitats, including woodland, scrub, meadow, heath, freshwater wetland and coastal marsh. Yet the name Minsmere might have remained obscure were it not for a quirk of military history. During the second world war, there were very real fears of a Nazi invasion across the North Sea. To create a barrier against a seaborne attack, farmland along the Suffolk coast was deliberately flooded and this accidentally created an ideal home for wetland birds. Two years after the end of the conflict, in 1947, avocets returned to breed in the UK after an absence of more than a century. They did so at Minsmere, and this led the RSPB to lease (and eventually buy) the land from local owners and turn it into a nature reserve. As a teenager, I remember hearing about this famous place, with its impossibly exotic birds, including avocets, bitterns and marsh harriers. I nagged my mother to take me there until finally she gave in. So, in April 1973, we drove up the A12 from our suburban London home to Suffolk, intending to spend as much time as possible at Minsmere. That was not as easy as it sounds: in those days, the reserve was open only four days a week, and you had to apply in advance, by post, for one of a limited number of permits. On the day of our first visit, I could hardly contain my excitement. I can still remember seeing my very first avocet: that striking piebald plumage, distinctive upturned bill, and best of all, the bright blue legs. But I was even more thrilled when I saw the celebrated warden of Minsmere – Bert Axell – walking along with a group of people. We followed them discreetly into a hide, where we scanned the horizon for marsh harriers. At the time, Minsmere was home to the only breeding trio of this polygynous (one male mating with several females) raptor in Britain, but sightings were few and far between. My mother didn’t have a great interest in birdwatching and never used binoculars, so when a large brown bird flew up to the hide, unseen by the rest of us, she casually drew our attention to its presence. “My goodness, a marsh harrier,” boomed Bert. “Well done, madam!” Axell was not the first warden of Minsmere, but he was largely responsible for turning it into what it is today. He was both a visionary and a zealot, who kept up a running battle with his superiors at RSPB HQ in Sandy, Bedfordshire. In his view, they were deskbound bureaucrats, intent on stifling his ideas for improving the reserve for birds. True to character, Axell simply ignored them, and pressed ahead with what at the time seemed a harebrained plan. He decided to create an artificial wetland, known as the Scrape, with individually numbered islands on which avocets and other waterbirds could nest, and shallow areas of brackish water where they could feed. Not only did the Scrape become one of the best-known birding hotspots in the UK, but Axell later took his idea all around the world, creating wetland reserves on the same model. More than 20 years after my first visit, Oddie and I met to discuss the location for the opening episode of our TV series Birding with Bill Oddie. He suggested the idea of spending a single day, in early May, exploring one very special place for birds. I asked him where he would suggest and, in perfect unison, we both uttered a single word: “Minsmere!” We began filming before sunrise, listening to a spectacular dawn chorus in the woods. Afterwards, while we were enjoying breakfast in the recently built visitor centre and cafe, Oddie suddenly dropped his knife and fork, grabbed his binoculars, and ran outside. The camera crew and I emerged moments later, to find him happily watching sand martins, just back from Africa, swooping in and out of their nest-holes in a sandbank. After that excellent beginning, we enjoyed an action-packed day. Oddie showed us how to tell reed and sedge warblers apart by their song; we came across three baby tawny owls, looking like huge balls of fluff as they sat on a branch in broad daylight; and, as dusk fell, we enjoyed the special sight of cranes flying in to roost. It all made for a delightful programme, which helped launch our careers in wildlife television. That was almost a quarter of a century ago. Since then, Minsmere and its birds have changed – and not always for the better. It was once possible to see or hear 100 different species before breakfast, but with the loss of birds such as the lesser spotted woodpecker, tree sparrow and corn bunting, that sadly no longer happens. On the credit side, new species have colonised the reserve, including the Cetti’s warbler and Mediterranean gull. And rarities such as Britain’s first western swamphen (which looks like a giant purple moorhen), and an all-too-brief visit in 2015 from a black-browed albatross, have attracted hordes of twitchers. The sheer variety of birds in such a small area made Minsmere the ideal destination for Springwatch, which was based on the reserve for three years, from 2014 to 2016. In what would be my final job in wildlife television, I spent a fortnight broadcasting live on the red button. The assignment brought back many happy memories of Minsmere and its birds. Among many memorable moments, highlights included Arctic waders dropping in on the Scrape on their long journey south to Africa; a determined stoat climbing several metres up a tree to slaughter a brood of green woodpeckers; and, best of all, a sparrowhawk chick hatching out of its egg, right in front of our eyes. I was constantly reminded of the capacity of nature to astonish and entertain. Being back at Minsmere, so long after my first visit, reminded me that this is a crucial haven for wildlife in a rapidly changing world. It also confirmed my belief that places like this – where people can engage with wildlife, guided by the RSPB’s superb staff and volunteers – offer an essential service to people, at a time when we all need nature more than ever. So I hope and pray that, whatever happens with the nuclear power station next door, this unique place will continue to thrive. And most of all, I hope that teenage boys and girls who come to Minsmere for the very first time will be enthralled by its birds – just as I was, all those many years ago.

In Hungary, however, the state news agency, the Hungarian Telegraph Office (MTI), took a different line. Instead of using the word “war”, it described a “Russian military operation”, wording close to the Kremlin-mandated phrase special military operation. During the first five days of the war, the influential agency referred to a “Russian military operation” (orosz hadművelet) 431 times, according to Zsuzsanna Wirth, a journalist with the investigative media outlet Direkt36, who has studied how the government controls MTI. Only after criticism, did MTI begin to use the word “war” in its coverage. For years Viktor Orbán’s government has been Vladimir Putin’s staunchest ally in the EU, with Kremlin talking points relayed across Hungarian state media. Now the Hungarian government faces a stark choice between Moscow and the EU, although it appears Budapest is trying to have it both ways. Through a series of leaked memos, Wirth uncovered how the government had long told Hungary’s main news agency what to write, from covering the opposition to the Covid pandemic – and Russia. Sensitive topics were off limits, including the difficulties Russia’s Sputnik vaccine encountered in getting an EU licence, Russia’s loan to fund the expansion of the Paks II nuclear power plant and Putin’s time in quarantine. When Russia invaded Ukraine, that pro-Kremlin stance came under fire. Opposition politicians organised a demonstration outside the headquarters of the MTVA, the umbrella organisation for Hungarian state TV, radio and the news agency. At another anti-war protest, people shouted “Russians out” at the gates of the Russian-backed International Investment Bank, an institution with Soviet roots that opened a headquarters in Budapest in 2019. “There was an outrage in Hungary because of how the public media reacted to this war of Russia and there were also protests, real crowds showed up and there were people protesting against the media,” Wirth said. “I think that must have played a role in this switch [calling the invasion a war]. I think they must be more careful than they used to be before. They could do Russian propaganda on public media quite openly, now it’s a bit more difficult for them.” The message from Orbán was more consistent. The Hungarian prime minister condemned Russia’s “military action” within hours of the invasion, although he declined to criticise Putin personally. Nor did Orbán block EU sanctions, although there was a wobble. Two days before the invasion, Hungary angered other EU member states when it was not ready to sign up to sanctions against Russia. At a meeting of senior diplomats, Hungary’s representative neither supported, nor opposed the sanctions, pleading the need for further talks with Budapest. “To consult with [the] capital is a pretext of face-saving vis-a-vis the EU and ass-saving vis-a-vis Russia,” one diplomat commented acidly at the time. After a half-day delay, Hungary fell into line. Orbán was said to be touched by a dramatic appeal for support from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at an EU summit. Speaking over video link, Zelenskiy told the leaders it might be the last time they saw him alive. “He [Orbán] is not pretending, he was touched by what is happening. Of course he is not super happy to have to do this, but he is not blocking,” said a senior EU diplomat. Daniel Hegedüs, a policy analyst at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said many people had expected much more trouble from Orbán. Instead, he said, “we were able to see an unexpected realignment with the EU and Nato over Russia over the past couple of weeks.””. Hungary, however, has declined to support a ban on Russian oil and gas exports, although it is hardly alone. Germany, Bulgaria and other EU member states that depend on Russian fossil fuel flows also oppose an immediate ban on oil and gas exports. Budapest also did not block EU funding for lethal weapons for Ukraine, although it will not finance such equipment itself, nor let arms pass over its territory. It argued that sending weapons to Ukraine would endanger people in Transcarpathia, a region in western Ukraine with a large Hungarian minority. Speaking to tens of thousands of flag-waviing supporters on Tuesday, Orbán said Central Europe was only a “chessboard” for big powers and if Hungary did not stand up for its interests, it could easily fall victim of the crisis. “Russia looks at Russian interests, while Ukraine looks at Ukrainian interests. Neither the United States, nor Brussels would think with Hungarians’ mind and feel with Hungarians’ hearts. We must stand up for our own interests,” Orbán said at an event to mark the start of the 1848-49 revolution, when Hungarian demands for self-determination were brutally crushed by armies sent by the Russian tsar at the behest of ruling Austria. Hungary’s support for the EU common line was not a surprise to some officials in Brussels. While Budapest has blocked other EU foreign policy decisions, it has never stood in the way of sanctions against Russia. Similarly, talk of Orbán blocking the Brexit process, a move some British commentators believed could help the UK secure a better deal, was never anything more than that: talk. EU officials believe Orbán is treading a fine line, as Hungarian public opinion swings against Russia in the final weeks of the Hungarian election campaign. Although the united opposition is trailing the government in the polls, Orbán is seen as seeking to avoid criticism of his pro-Russia policy before voting on 3 April. His leading rival, Péter Márki-Zay, a conservative supported by six opposition parties, has accused Orbán of being too accommodating towards Russia and China. “We only have one choice: we must choose Europe instead of the east and freedom instead of authoritarianism,” Márki-Zay said at an opposition rally on Tuesday. While Orbán wants to stay on board with the EU and Nato, there is a different message for his domestic audience. The Hungarian state media machine continues to regurgitate Kremlin talking points, while downplaying the brutality of the war. One national security “expert” on state TV compared Zelenskiy to Adolf Hitler; another talking head on Pesti, a private network that receives state funding, said there was no such thing as the Ukrainian people and culture, while the language was just a dialect of Russian. Both examples were collated by the NGO Átlátszó, which also reported how Hungarian state TV described Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine as “areas between Russia and Ukraine”, a description that chimes with Moscow’s narrative, although not Hungary’s official policy. “Hungarian pro-government media, but also public media is still overly dominated by pro-Russian narratives, and even pro-Russian disinformation is prevalent in the Hungarian media space,” Hegedüs said. “Changing the narrative harshly or making a U-turn could pose some very uncomfortable questions to the governing party in the middle of the election campaign, which they would like to avoid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/09/suspending-shares-embarrassing-saga-southeastern-rail-serious-go-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-09T19:18:25Z","webTitle":"Suspending shares is embarrassing, the saga of Southeastern rail is serious | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/09/suspending-shares-embarrassing-saga-southeastern-rail-serious-go-ahead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/09/suspending-shares-embarrassing-saga-southeastern-rail-serious-go-ahead","fields":{"headline":"Suspending shares is embarrassing, the saga of Southeastern rail is serious","bodyText":"The most important item in Go-Ahead’s annual accounts last year, it turns out, was buried on page 188.

The accounts confidently asserted that should the DfT’s claim prove successful “the outflow of resources could be in the region of £8m”. The small problem, however, keeps getting bigger. In September, the DfT stripped Southeastern of the franchise and accused the company of a “serious” breach of the franchise agreement. Go-Ahead apologised and said £25m – a far chunkier sum – had been returned. Now comes another grovelling admission of “serious errors” plus news that the two parents’ postmortem on events is so complex that the auditors, Deloitte, need extra time to finalise this year’s accounts. One uncertainty is how to estimate the size of the provision for the fine that DfT, almost certainly, will impose. The delay means Go-Ahead will miss its deadline for filing this year’s accounts, in turn provoking a suspension in trading in the shares on 4 January, an embarrassment for a public company. No investor likes to be stuck in the sidings, so you can understand why the shares reversed by 15%. The stock now stands at a 20-year low. The main way in which events could get worse for Go-Ahead is if the DfT decides to remove the remaining Thameslink franchise, a big commuter route. That feels unlikely since the failings relate solely to Southeastern, but the board has some explaining to do when the accounts eventually appear, which is expected to be before the end of January. This saga relates to taxpayer funding from 2014 and its seriousness seems to have been serially underappreciated. After a scare Rolls-Royce keeps on rolling on in the right directions It’s not exactly a triumph, but it is a milestone: aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce, a corporate Covid sufferer via the collapse in air travel, is no longer burning cash every quarter. Between July and September, there was an inflow. The net tally for the whole of 2021 will still be an outflow of £1.6bn-ish, but 2022 should be positive. The effort has involved £1bn of cost-cutting, 8,500 job losses and a mammoth refinancing, but one can say now that the turnaround programme did what it was supposed to. Rolls can stay aloft even when “engine flying hours”, a critical contractual metric for income, are still only half the level of 2019. A couple of weeks ago, the news might have given fresh wings to the rally in Rolls’ shares that has been powered by the reopening of transatlantic air routes. Instead, Thursday’s 3% fall was a case of investors wondering if Omicron will cause a re-closing. No wonder chief executive Warren East was keen to talk up the idea that Rolls was now a “balanced” business. He has a point. The civil aerospace side grabs about 90% of the attention but, in its newly shrunken form, is only about one-third of the group. Meanwhile, the defence side has predictably sailed through the crisis and won high-profile work to upgrade the engines on the US air force’s B-52s. The Power Systems division is toiling against shortages of semiconductor chips but the order book is strong. Then there’s the new hope of riches from small modular reactors, a business East reckons one day could be bigger than the whole of today’s Rolls-Royce. That projection feels a little dreamy since the kit for the mini nuclear power stations is still at the assessment stage, but it is a reminder that Rolls works on extremely long cycles. After a scare, it seems to be moving in the right direction. Imperfect pricing You get thrills and spills with IPOs, but two of this year’s high-profile crop in the retailing sector have settled near their float prices. Dr Martens, the boot firm, and Moonpig, the online greetings card outfit, reported good-ish numbers on Thursday and both are just above their starting prices (4% and 7% respectively). The same can’t be said of Made.com, which served up a profits warning. Supply chain upsets and port blockages have played havoc with a business model that relied on just-in-time ordering, including from factories in Vietnam. Up to £45m of revenue, or 10% of the total, has been kicked into next year. Cue another year of losses in 2021, instead of the expected move into profitably. Therein lies the other reason why the shares are now 40% below their listing price. At £775m at launch, but no profits under its belt, Made was priced for perfection."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/apr/19/australia-news-live-david-pocock-jobseeker-cost-of-living-crisis-budget-dominion-fox-news-indigenous-voice","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-19T08:18:24Z","webTitle":"Text messages from no campaign herald new phase of voice debate – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/19/australia-news-live-david-pocock-jobseeker-cost-of-living-crisis-budget-dominion-fox-news-indigenous-voice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/19/australia-news-live-david-pocock-jobseeker-cost-of-living-crisis-budget-dominion-fox-news-indigenous-voice","fields":{"headline":"Text messages from no campaign herald new phase of voice debate – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for following along on the blog today. Here is a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: Beloved social justice advocate and Catholic priest Father Bob Maquire has died aged 88. The Labor government has been roundly criticised for ignoring calls from its own experts to substantially lift the jobseeker rate. Labor MP Catherine King told Afternoon Briefing that “nothing has been particularly rejected”, but also said budget decisions needed to be “responsible”. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, denied that power is centralised in his office after an anti-corruption inquiry found a $1.2m contract was awarded to a union due to pressure applied by Victorian government advisers. The Albanese government will impose a fuel efficiency standard on new cars and encourage electric vehicle uptake as part of its new electric vehicle strategy. An inquiry into the Beetaloo Basin has called for a national plan to offset vast emissions expected from gas projects. NSW’s upper house vote has been finalised and the makeup of parliament is known, with Labor taking eight seats to the Coalition’s seven in the Legislative Council. The no campaign appears to have begun sending text messages en masse across the country regarding the Indigenous voice vote. Electric car innovations win $70 million charging boost New ideas for charging electric vehicles from the outback to the suburbs and inner city will receive $70 million in federal grant funding, AAP reports. Energy Minister Chris Bowen announced the additional grants today, revealing the funds could go towards electric vehicle charging solutions for remote and regional communities or new ways to charge cars in urban apartment blocks. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency will oversee the fund, with businesses and government organisations eligible to apply. The extra funding came hours after Bowen and Transport Minister Catherine King launched the government’s highly anticipated National Electric Vehicle Strategy. Bowen said: Everyone knows where to find a petrol station when they need one – they should know there’s an EV charger nearby when they need that too. The brief is open ... this might include proposals to target apartment block residents and high-density areas with low access to off-street parking, or remote or regional communities and improving their user experience. Innovations eligible for grants of between $500,000 and $15m will include trials for public charging infrastructure that overcame barriers to fuelling electric cars, as well as smart charging technology. Also eligible for the grants are projects to enable battery-powered cars to feed electricity back into the grid. Menindee fish kill to be investigated by Environment Protection Authority The Menindee fish kill has been classified as a “pollution incident” and will be investigated by the New South Wales EPA. The state environment minister, Penny Sharpe, said the independent regulator would consider the role of individuals, companies and government agencies in the kill and would consider regulatory action if it was warranted. Sharpe said: The community has told me that the response by all agencies to this event hasn’t been up to scratch. No one is above the law – including the government. It is my expectation as minister that should the EPA uncover any breaches of the act, they will enforce regulatory action. The EPA has already ruled out a pesticide pollution issue after testing. An independent inquiry into the mass death event on the Darling – Barka River will also be conducted by the chief scientist. The mass text phase of the Indigenous voice referendum appears to have begun. We’re getting reports of many people across the country getting text messages spruiking the new ad from Fair Australia, the no campaign led by Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and the Advance conservative lobby group. The texts, which appear from the sender “FairAus”, point to Fair Australia’s website and promote a new campaign ad which will be premiered on Sky News tonight, on Peta Credlin’s show. Several of us here in the Guardian Australia office have received one, as have many others on social media. Another text begins: “Jacinta Price here!” We’ve reached out to Advance, Fair and Price’s office for comment. Have you received one of the texts? Please email me at josh.butler@theguardian.com Catch up on today’s biggest headlines with this great wrap-up from my colleague Antoun Issa: Federal Liberal weighs in on Warragamba Dam wall Liberal MP Melissa McIntosh has criticised the NSW Labor government’s decision to scrap the raising of the Warragamba Dam wall. Announced earlier today, the NSW government will instead look to other measures to mitigate flood risk in Western Sydney. As my colleague Jordyn Beazley reported, the Perrottet government announced plans last year to raise the dam wall by 14-metres but the plan drew fierce criticism, particularly due to revelations the project could harm the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. In a statement, McIntosh said the NSW government has made a “short-sighted political response” and accused them of “literally playing politics with people’s lives”. She said: I’ve stood in the debris of flooded homes, consoling shattered families after they’ve lost everything in the floods. Not just once, but multiple times over the last few years. It is extraordinary that one of the first acts of this new Labor State Government is to dismiss the safety of residents of my community in Western Sydney. McIntosh said her community “deserves to know right now” what the state governments alternative plan is, and evidence to show this would save more lives and homes. Question time for you Regular listeners to the Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast will know that we periodically ask the federal politics team to answer reader questions. Do you have a question you would like us to answer in a forthcoming podcast episode? Please email me (paul.karp@theguardian.com) before 1pm on Thursday (20 April) if you have a burning question and we’ll put our heads together for you. Matt Thistlethwaite says government’s priority is controlling inflation The Labor MP is also asked about the economic inclusion advisory committee’s recommendation for Jobseeker to be raised and the governments response to this: [The committee] made a number of recommendations, not simply the proposal to increase the rate of Jobseeker. There was a number of recommendations that have been made and the government will work through those. Like Catherine King, Thistlethwaite said the government’s priority is providing cost of living relief for families and getting inflation under control: We know that rampant inflation can reduce people’s purchasing power, it reduces real incomes at results in interest rates being pushed up so that people’s mortgages and rents are affected. We want to make sure that any measures we undertake are aimed at providing cost of living relief, but do not fuel further inflation… Greg Jennett: …do you still see value in the Joint Select Committee going about this work (on the Voice proposal), given that the party political positions are pretty well marked out federally? Labor frontbencher Matt Thistlethwaite: Yeah we do see value in it and that is why we support the committee doing its work. It’s a necessary part of this important legislation going through the Parliament and we are open to as much scrutiny and consultation as possible. Andrew Bragg says he has ‘a very open mind’ on support for Indigenous people The Liberal senator is being asked on Afternoon Briefing whether he is being gradually persuaded on the Indigenous voice to parliament proposal: I’ve always had a very open mind about the idea of giving new institutions or establishing new institutions to support Indigenous people and on Friday in Canberra we heard about the constitutional legal issues and today in Cairns we heard about community views in relation to the voice. Today there were strong endorsement in the idea of grassroots decision-making and community led judgements … the challenge is getting mechanics right and constitutional change right. King asked about Jobseeker payment level Although outside of her portfolio, Catherine King is asked about the economic inclusion advisory committee’s recommendation for Jobseeker to be raised: Jennett: [The government] has rejected summarily some of the major recommendations there, particularly around taking Jobseeker to a substantial increase. It was the point in creating the body in the first place if it was rejected so quickly? King: Nothing has been particularly rejected. We’ve publicly made available the advice that has been given to us. Obviously there’s a lot in there and [it would be] a huge budgetary impulse if we did all of those things. We will take the advice of the advisory group, but there are lots of things in all of us would like to do particularly for vulnerable people but given their budget we’ve inherited … we have to be responsible about that. The infrastructure and transport minister is speaking on Labor’s electric vehicle strategy which was announced today. She said her intention is to have an exposure draft of legislation available by the end of the year: I would hope to have that introduced to the parliament, but I don’t want to promise that incase some of the technical issues become more complex, but that is the intention to do that. Legislated by next year and part of the consultation is determining when the start date is, how fast this goes, all of those things are part of consultation [process]. The consultation will run for six weeks. Decades of economic growth, but poverty remains unchanged, says adovcate Still speaking on Jobseeker, Angela Jackson said it’s important to raise the payment because it is “the main driver of poverty in Australia”. One of the things we highlight in the report is despite having three decades of economic growth in this country, rates of poverty have not come down, and the main reason for that failure to drive down rates of poverty is the inadequacy of welfare payments. We do need to address this and hopefully the budget will provide a path forward. If not the full increase, certainly an indication of a commitment from the government to moving towards providing an adequate payment. Calls to raise Jobseeker to 90% of aged pension Angela Jackson, a member of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee, is speaking on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing about calls for Jobseeker to be raised. In its interim report, the committee proposed lifting jobseeker to 90% of the value of the aged pension, which would cost $24bn over four years. Greg Jennett (host): …was that what you were aiming for, the 90% pegging against the [aged] pension? Jackson: …90% of the aged pension rate was something we coalesced around being a reasonable proxy for where the Jobseeker payment should probably land. In terms of how we get there, it is a big increase, it equates to $250 a fortnight. We are not necessarily saying to the government ‘do that all at once’ but certainly, after what has been three decades of neglect, there does need to be a path forward that we look toward, returning this payment to what … can provide a reasonable standard of living. At the moment it is simply inadequate and leading to significant hardship, and we heard as a committee about the level of hardship that is out there. An Aboriginal red ochre necklace believed to be the only one of its kind has returned to Tasmania for the first time in almost 200 years, AAP reports. There are hopes its arrival can lead to talks about the permanent return of culturally significant items. The necklace, on display in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) in Hobart, was collected from the island and sent to England some time before 1834. It was bought by Chicago’s Field Museum from a British collector in 1958 along with about 200 items from Tasmania, also known by the Indigenous name lutruwita. Pakana man and artist Andrew Gall has created a kangaroo skin necklace to sit alongside the original, which is thought to have been made from plant fibre. He said the return of the necklace, which is on loan for two years to TMAG, was “incredibly important”: This is culture that has been taken away. Its journey had stopped until it came back home. It is home and its journey starts again. The accompanying necklace made by Gall contains a breast plate, his way of indicating the original was held against its will. We’ve got two years to change their minds (about the necklace going back to America when the loan finishes). Nothing is ever fixed. Let us look after our own, let the cultural belongings stay with (their) people. Internet service provider peak body rejects call for VPN crackdown Internet service providers say cracking down on virtual private network (VPN) tools for use in online piracy would make the internet worse, and would send a bad message to the rest of the world. Late last year, the federal government consulted the sector on the effectiveness of 2015 laws blocking piracy websites after court orders. In the eight years since, thousands of websites have been blocked. Those blocks can be circumvented using virtual private networks or by changing domain name server (DNS) settings, and the discussion paper suggested that this was a flaw in the scheme. Comms Alliance – which represents internet service providers – pushed back at the idea that the government should seek to ban or restrict use of VPNs because it would have a negative impact on “a secure, private, and open internet” and send the wrong message to the rest of the world. Comms Alliance said: Australia’s regulation of these technologies, even under the premise of protecting copyright, would be a strong signal to other governments that it is permissible, even acceptable, for them to also do so for goals unrelated to copyright – there is a worrying trend of authoritarian jurisdictions regulating VPNs and DNS with the intent of curtailing rights and freedoms. Australia taking any actions to regulate VPN and DNS technologies would essentially justify these repressive actions and potentially set off a cascade of copycat rules around the globe. In submissions to the discussion paper, News Corp and Foxtel both called for digital platforms to take swifter action in removing copyright infringing content, while Foxtel asked for the site blocking scheme to account for streams of live sports. The New South Wales government will fulfil its election promise to scrap the proposed raising of the Warragamba Dam wall, promising other measures to mitigate flood risk in western Sydney Minister for water, Rose Jackson, said the Minns government opposed the raising of the wall, given the project did not guarantee it would flood-proof the region. Last year, the then Perrottet government announced plans to raise the dam wall by 14 metres after successive devastating floods in the Hawkesbury and Nepean region. But the plan drew fierce criticism, particularly after revelations the project could harm the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage area. Jackson said the government would receive briefings from the department and Water NSW on the dam in the coming days.: We know, raising the wall will flood the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area; inundating 1,200 Aboriginal sites and artefacts, destroying habitat for critically endangered species and risk Blue Mountain’s World Heritage listing. The government also has a real plan to address floods in the immediate term: we will build levies, improve evacuation routes and improve emergency communications in the Hawkesbury-Nepean. Labor Macnamara MP Josh Burns has penned a tribute to Father Bob Maguire: Father Bob Maguire cared for the people, and the people cared about our beloved Bob. I admired Bob’s cheeky charm, his big heart and his humility. Just over a decade ago, I volunteered for Bob when he started his community pantry in South Melbourne. Every single person who walked through Bob’s warehouse, whether they wanted to chat or not, was greeted with a “g’day cobber” and then offered whatever Bob could give. Bob didn’t judge. He just tried to help. The forgotten people, the quiet people, the people doing it tough - they were Bob’s people. He could charm prime ministers and he could entertain the youth on the airwaves with his mate John Safran. Father Bob may be gone but he will forever be etched into the history of our local community. Rest easy comrade, and thank you for a life of service with a smile. Vale Father Bob No campaign launches national advertising campaign for no vote in voice referendum The no campaign in the voice referendum is capitalising on the promotion of its spokesperson Jacinta Nampijinpa Price to the shadow cabinet, launching a new TV ad and a nine-minute documentary on the Northern Territory senator via Sky News tonight. Price, the first-term senator from Alice Springs, was yesterday catapulted into the senior ranks of the Coalition, taking up the post of shadow minister for Indigenous Australians. She will also retain her role as leader of the Fair Australia campaign, the anti-voice push from conservative lobby organisation Advance. Advance’s executive director, Matthew Sheahan, has just sent an email to subscribers, saying Price will front the group’s national advertising campaign against the referendum. He wrote: I guarantee you these ads – based on a short documentary filmed in Jacinta’s hometown Alice Springs – will knock the pro-voice activists out of the park. The ads will launch via Peta Credlin’s show on Sky tonight, and feature Price and her husband. A short clip shared on the email shows Price in her hometown of Alice Springs, saying: “this will divide us”. Sheahan wrote in the email: We don’t divide ourselves along the lines of race in this country because we are a family of human beings. Tributes flowing for Father Bob Maguire The beloved social justice advocate and Catholic priest has died at the age of 88. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, described him as “a man of warmth and faith who faced struggles with a cheeky grin.” An irrepressibly cheerful champion for all those battling disadvantage, he dedicated his life to brightening the lives of those most in need. NDIS minister Bill Shorten said he first met Bob back in 1983: He would poke fun at those in power but he never stopped fighting for those without it. God Bless, Father Bob. I’m sure heaven has its gates wide open for you, but boy are they are in for a ride. Greens leader Adam Bandt described him as a “ferocious advocate for justice, refugees, and the vulnerable.” Your generosity &amp; humour will be missed, comrade. Melbourne man arrested while wearing disguise over alleged interstate skimming racket A man has been arrested at a Melbourne ATM while wearing a wig, glasses and face mask disguise over an alleged interstate skimming racket where he allegedly acquired more than $30,000. The 43-year-old Glen Waverley man was arrested at 6.30am yesterday morning at an ATM in Mount Waverley. He was interviewed by Financial Crime Squad detectives and charged with nine counts of obtain financial advantage by deception. The man was remanded overnight to appear at Ringwood Magistrates’ court today. Detectives searched his Glen Waverley property and allegedly located 18 cloned bank cards with PINs written on them, a hire vehicle, various skimming equipment including device and card readers, a large number of additional cloned cards and various clothing and articles of disguise. Investigators will allege the man was involved in at least 15 incidents of using cloned cards associated with the “deep skimming” insert device, fraudulently withdrawing at least $30,000. Police will allege the man has been utilising disguises including wigs, glasses and face masks, as well as using a variety of vehicles. The investigation – which remains ongoing – began in January of this year when police became aware of a number of card skimming incidents in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Thanks Natasha for leading us through the morning! I’ll be with you for the remainder of the day. Thanks for your attention today. Emily Wind will take you through the rest of the afternoon! Federal funding for more EV charging stations Off the back of the announcement of the National Electric Vehicle Strategy which is designed to help people buy electric cars, the government has also committed more money to help charge them. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, is promising that drivers will be able to find electric vehicle charging stations approximately every 150km on major highways. Businesses, local governments and councils, as well as state and territory owned corporations, will be able to apply for grants as part of $70m in funding for charging infrastructure. The announcement is part of a total package of $146.1m, which will be implemented by the renewable energy agency (Arena) over the next five years. In a statement, Bowen says that range anxiety has been one of the biggest hurdles for Australians buying an electric vehicle for too long. Range anxiety occurs because electric charging stations aren’t as widespread as petrol stations, meaning EV drivers often have to worry whether they can make the stretches in between. Our economics correspondent, Peter Hannam, has written about what it feels in this piece about his road trip in an EV last year. Bowen said these grants will help improve the situation with the aim of one day making EV chargers as accessible as petrol service stations right across the country. Today’s announcement through Arena is in addition to the government’s National Electric Vehicle Charging Network which will deliver a truly national EV charging network with a charger approximately every 150km on our major highways. Australians know that electric and more fuel-efficient vehicles are cleaner and cheaper to run and after less than a year in government, more Australian households and businesses can access them. Transport costs are a huge part of household budgets and getting the charging infrastructure in place for electric vehicles is critical to ensuring households have a real choice when it comes to picking their next car. For more information and to apply for funding, go to Arena’s website. Hastie points to Wong’s speech in ongoing exchange with McGowan Andrew Hastie has done an interview with Sky News on the spat with West Australian premier, Mark McGowan, who was recorded suggesting Hastie had “swallowed some kind of, you know, cold war pills back when he was born and he couldn’t get his mindset out of that”. Hastie said: I was actually flattered that I was living rent free inside premier McGowan’s head. But Hastie said Australians when overseas representing their country should keep such comments to themselves and should “back in” the national interest. Hastie again urged McGowan to read the National Press Club speech by the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong. Hastie said it was a “good, strong speech” and if McGowan read it “he’d be asking her if she was taking Cold War pills too”. Hastie is endorsing Wong’s views on the challenging strategic circumstances - including China’s military modernisation and militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea. Hastie is suggesting that his own views are not out of step with the federal Labor government’s cabinet. So the time has now come for the premier to seriously consider his position and to think about whether he’s the person who can tackle corruption under his leadership when he’s the source of the culture and the leader who drives the culture that sees so much wrongdoing under his watch. If he can’t do it and it’s clear that he can’t, with a long and growing list of adverse reports into his government, if he can’t do it, then the time has come for somebody else inside his government to step forward to see if they can do a better job. What we do know is while Daniel Andrews remains in his position, he can’t tackle the corruption that he’s allowed under his own leadership and it will take somebody else inside his government to deal with these serious issues. Victorian opposition leader claims Andrews government is corrupt Pesutto has gone on to say the “scathing” Daintree report “goes to the very heart of the Andrews’ government” which he alleges is mired in corruption. Ibac did not make any findings of corruption against Daniel Andrews, health ministers Jill Hennessy and Jenny Mikakos, or staff working in their offices. Abuse of process and a complete lack of integrity. Soft corruption, grey corruption, call it what you like, it’s all corruption. This is a government after so many adverse reports from integrity agencies, this is a government that is mired in corruption. It’s in its DNA. … Today’s report, as you can see from all of the reports we have laid out, is just another in a long and growing line of corruption scandals in this government and it shows that nothing is going to change. We have a system under the premier’s leadership that sees processes skirted. A government that looks after its mates and puts its political interests before the public interest. Victorian opposition leader blames premier after Ibac finding John Pesutto is speaking in Melbourne, criticising the premier, Daniel Andrews, after the release of the anti-corruption commission’s findings this morning. Ibac found a Victorian government adviser “improperly influenced” the awarding of a $1.2m contract to the health workers union. Andrews said in a press conference this morning that he would lead the government’s response, to which Pesutto has hit back that he can’t be the answer at the same time as the problem: I say to premier Daniel Andrews, the time has come for him to seriously think about his position and whether he can actually tackle those serious issues when he has been and is the problem. He can’t be the answer at the same time. A youth homelessness program says it can save governments hundreds of millions of dollars by providing long-term solutions not just short-term accommodation. The Foyer Foundation wants the federal government to commit to $9.6m per year for new facilities for ten years, with matched state or territory funds. An Accenture report, commissioned by the foundation and released today, found that investment could save $950m by 2030 by stopping the cycle of disadvantage. Foyer links philanthropists, policymakers, investors and community services including Mission Australia and St John’s Youth Services and its existing programs have increased the chances of young people finding jobs and stable housing. It provides up to two years’ accommodation for young people while supporting them in education, employment, training, volunteering and mentoring. Chief executive officer, Liz Cameron-Smith, wrote in the report that 44,000 young people needed specialist homelessness services each year, leading to cycles of disadvantage. Giving those young people sustained support could break that cycle, she wrote: It breaks the pattern of disadvantage, helping them overcome the structural barriers that make it hard to get back on track once the young person is placed in the cycle of homelessness and disadvantage. An experience of homelessness is a fork in the road, and if we intervene, we can set young people on the path to a future they want. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says she will fly to New Caledonia and Tuvalu this week “to listen first-hand to their priorities and build on our close relationships”. Wong flagged the travel in her National Press Club speech on Monday, but in a statement issued today says this will be her 10th visit to the Pacific since being sworn in as minister 11 months ago. She says the trip “fulfils the government’s commitment to visit all 17 of our fellow Pacific Islands Forum members”. Wong says she is “honoured to have the opportunity to address the Congress of New Caledonia on Australia’s regional vision and the value of New Caledonia’s regional engagement since it became a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum in 2016”. Wong says Tuvalu is “on the front line of climate change” and she will use the visit to reiterate Australia’s commitment to climate action, including its bid to co-host a UN climate conference with other Pacific countries in 2026: A strong and united Pacific Islands Forum is central to supporting a region that is peaceful, prosperous, and resilient. With final NSW election count in, Minn’s minority government faces making deals with left and right to pass laws The New South Wales Labor government will be forced to make deals with members of the upper house crossbench from both the left and right in order to pass laws following the final vote count this morning. While there was a slight progressive majority in those elected on March 25, there was a slight conservative majority in the continuing members. Election analyst Ben Raue said Labor would be forced to work with a combination of minor party members in the legislative council. He said: Unless they work with the Coalition, they are going to need minor party members from both sides- the left and the right... It is quite messy. Labor works quite well with the Shooters but Animal Justice and the Greens don’t. One Nation has confirmed former Labor MP, Tania Mihailuk, will take the party’s vacated spot in the upper house after NSW leader, Mark Latham, used the vote to be re-elected for another eight years. Federal One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, said: Thank you to all the candidates, volunteers and voters who have helped One Nation increase our representation in the NSW upper house to three members. I also congratulate Tania Mihailuk on her successful selection to fill the One Nation casual vacancy spot where she will be joining our other elected members and continuing her work as part of One Nation in the legislative council. O’Neill chastises opposition for ‘missed opportunity’ in not supporting safeguard mechanism O’Neill has chastised the opposition for the “missed opportunity” for supporting the Albanese government’s safeguard mechanism (which puts a cap on Australia’s biggest emitters) and “playing to the fringes”: The safeguard mechanism was actually first introduced under a coalition government. And now a Labor government has tightened it. Which the industry actually has long expected. This was very appropriate. The urgency for global action on climate change has increased. I commend Prime Minister Albanese and ministers Chris Bowen and Madeleine King to move the policy debates towards the centre and seek practical outcomes. However, it was a missed opportunity [that] the coalition was not prepared to deal with the government on this legislation. For Australia to tackle climate change sustainably, it’s got to be done in the centre, and in a way that can endure, regardless of who is in power. Otherwise you ping pong from government to government, playing to the fringes with outcomes that do not serve the Australian people well. Just look at the past 10 to 15 years of climate policy in Australia. Circling back to Woodside CEO, Meg O’Neill’s, address to the National Press Club As the Albanese government is putting the finishing touches on its May budget, O’Neill is calling on them to keep the long term in mind when it comes to any changes to the tax framework. She warns that over reaching could undermine the future revenue the government receives from the sector – basically the message is don’t raise the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT). Last week, as Paul Karp wrote, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, confirmed Treasury is working on options to reform the PRRT, suggesting it could be the next revenue measure to repair the budget after Labor’s “modest but meaningful” changes to halve superannuation tax concessions on balances of more than $3m. Speaking about energy security, O’Neill says: The Australian government has stated its support for the gas industry and has provided strong reassurances that Australia is not quietly quitting its LNG industry. Woodside is certainly not quietly quitting. We are deliberately delivering. The same partners who invested in our gas projects can provide the capital to develop lower carbon hydrogen and renewable projects, but only if they consider it a secure investment. For Australia to remain an attractive destination for global capital, fiscal and regulatory certainty is paramount. We understand the government needs revenue. Revenue for the NDIS. Revenue for Aukus. To fund health, education, other services. We are already a big contributor. As the treasurer acknowledged this week, high export earnings are helping the budget, right now. We urge the government in any changes to the tax framework to consider the long term. And to preserve Australia’s ability to attract the next generation of investment, jobs, and energy supply. Over reaching now could risk undermining future revenue. In terms of regulatory certainty, agreement on clear processes and response times for project approvals is essential to unlocking reliable supply. Otherwise energy investment will find another home, taking jobs and opportunities with it. Hearings into the voice continue in Cairns The deputy mayor with the Torres Strait regional shire, Getano Lui, has told the inquiry that for too long his people had been ignored by governments of all persuasions and their voice as a minority within a minority had been sidelined. That’s why our voice is very difficult for people to be to listened to. When we talk about the voice, we’re not talking about a voice to be heard. We’re talking about our voice to be listened to. Lui said communities in the Torres Strait have been “crying on the shoulders of governments” to no avail: “This is a unique opportunity, something that we don’t want to lose. We hope that the referendum will be successful … Things will change for the best.” The Northern Peninsula Area council mayor, Patricia Yusia, said housing and economic opportunities and empowerment are critical issues that must be addressed to improve disadvantage experienced by First Nations people. When we do not have a stable house or we live in an overcrowded house, it is nearly impossible to adequately participate in school and education, attend work and look after our health. She said communities are frustrated with wide-reaching decisions affecting people’s daily lives are made thousands of kilometres away: “These decisions have been made in Canberra without adequate consultation or consideration of what it means on the ground.” Remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need to have a voice in guiding the policy set by the federal government to ensure that it has the outcomes that are needed. The hearing is continuing. Torres Strait and Far North Queensland leaders advocate for voice to parliament This morning in Cairns, Queensland remote community leaders are giving testimony for the latest public hearings into the parliamentary committee into the referendum on the voice to parliament. They are urging the country to back a voice to parliament and support the referendum, saying it’s time for their voices to be listened to. Leaders from the Torres Strait and the mayor of Yarrabah, near Cairns, in Far North Queensland have passionately advocated for a voice. The Yarrabah mayor, Ross Andrews, said he believes the voice would have make a difference to communities and help roll back social and economic disadvantages going in the “wrong direction”. There’s an opportunity for us to really try something different, to try something new. If we can have some support around the opportunities on the systemic, structural nature of our challenges. The acknowledgment of a voice to parliament, is something worth exploring. Andrews said community-led solutions were key to driving change and improving peoples lives and that if the advisory body was properly represented through communities that would help drive success: If we can take it to the people that elect their leaders then we can have a framework in place to allow people to have a greater say and greater autonomy. The beloved social justice advocate and Catholic priest Father Bob Maquire has died aged 88, his foundation has confirmed. ‘Climate change is real’ says boss of Australia’s largest LNG producer Meg O’Neill says she will be using the address to speak about energy security through the energy transition, addressing specifically the role of the gas industry. The challenge as I see it is for Australia to use its vast natural gas resources for three interrelated goals. First, to provide affordable and reliable energy for Australians. Secondly, to maintain strategic partnerships and energy security in our region. Third, to progress global decarbonisation. Climate change is real. And global action is needed to address it. Woodside Energy supports an Indigenous voice, CEO says The chief executive of Australia’s largest LNG producer Woodside Energy, Meg O’Neill, is addressing the National Press Club this lunchtime. She opens her speech saying Woodside supports the yes campaign in the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum: We are on a journey in our relations with First Nations people. We haven’t always gotten that right. That said, we are working to get it right by listening to and learning from First Nations people. For Woodside, a big part of this is working with the traditional owners of Murujuga in northern Western Australia, where our largest Australian operations are based. … Australia as preparing for a vote this year, on recognising Indigenous Australians in the constitution and establishing a voice to parliament. Woodside supports the yes campaign. Almost four weeks after New South Wales residents headed to the polls, the state’s upper house vote has been finalised and the makeup of the parliament is known. Labor snagged eight seats to the Coalition’s seven in the Legislative Council. Despite predictions of a large minor party vote, the Greens only managed two spots, with Legalise Cannabis, the Liberal Democrats and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party snagging one a piece. One Nation had hoped to pick up two seats on the strength of its NSW party leader, Mark Latham’s personal following but the party saw just one further seat secured. Student accommodation organisations say purpose-built housing for international students needs to be regulated separately in order to attract domestic investors to the market and reduce strain on housing pressures. Speaking to a parliamentary inquiry, The president of the Student Accommodation Council (a branch the Property Council Australia) and chief executive of major provider Scape, Anouk Dowling, said international student housing was defined as “boarding houses” or “co-living”, placing requirements on providers similar to residential buildings. Dowling said the sector was “misunderstood” despite being “there to care” and faced “punitive environments” around foreign ownership surcharges and tax. In Sydney, she said it took seven years between application and building approval for new accommodation. We’re operating in our own and unique way … [but] we have to stack up an investment case and see how we can attract capital around planning restrictions. There are extreme pressures around housing and letting. The executive director of the Student Accommodation Council, Torie Brown, said international providers were being used as a “Trojan horse” and it was an “all of housing market problem”. The founder of MyStay, Andrew Bycroft, said Australia was in the midst of a housing crisis and traditional forms of housing wouldn’t “come close” to meeting demand. Bycroft said more needed to be done to promote tax-free hosted accommodation, also known as homestay, to Australians with spare rooms to reverse a “supply and demand imbalance” which was “ripe for exploitation of students”. The 2021 census found there were 3.5m empty rooms around Australia. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has been caught on camera in China saying that the Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, “swallowed some kind of, you know, cold war pills back when he was born and he couldn’t get his mindset out of that”. Hastie has returned fire, denouncing McGowan as “a prison guard looking for work now that the pandemic has finished”. WA Today reported that McGowan’s office had yesterday circulated footage from a China-Australia Chamber of Commerce lunch in Beijing to Perth-based media outlets. This arrangement was apparently put in place because only the West Australian newspaper’s representatives had been able to obtain visas from China to accompany McGowan on the travel. The report by WA Today – which includes the video – says McGowan made the comments in an informal conversation with the chair of the China-Australia Chamber of Commerce, Vaughn Barber. It was reportedly also within earshot of Australia’s ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher. McGowan had been making observations about the sway of senior WA Liberal figures – including former finance minister Mathias Cormann – in setting Australian foreign policy under the former government. McGowan also said he liked Cormann, whom he claimed “had the same view as me” on China but had no sway on the issue and was “the odd one out” in Coalition ranks. McGowan went on to make the comments about Hastie, a China hawk who was assistant defence minister in the former government and previously an SAS officer. Hastie, now the shadow defence minister, issued a statement saying that McGowan was “out of his intellectual depth”. Hastie said McGowan should not be “running down Australian MPs in China”: But it is surprising from a former legal officer in the Royal Australian Navy. I’m not sure I’d want to serve alongside him on a naval ship in a crisis. Character is everything. What’s he really saying when the cameras aren’t running? Hastie urged McGowan to “do himself a favour and read” Penny Wong’s speech to the National Press Club on Monday, when the Labor foreign affairs minister described China’s military modernisation as lacking transparency. An inquiry into major plans to exploit gas in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin has recommended the federal government commit to a national plan to offset the vast emissions the project is expected to release. The former government made gas exploration in the Beetaloo Basin a central tenet of its plans for recovering from the Covid pandemic, using grants and tax breaks to incentivise gas corporates to begin work in the region. The basin covers about 28,000 square kilometres south-east of Katherine and is thought to contain huge reserves of shale gas. But environmentalists have warned that developing the gas resources in the region will unleash a “carbon bomb” and render Australia unable to meet its emission reductions targets. A Senate inquiry on Wednesday recommended that the government commit to finding a way to offset all scope two and three emissions from the basin. It also recommended establishing a fresh inquiry into the proposed Middle Arm precinct, a petrochemical manufacturing hub, designed to facilitate the expansion of the gas sector in the region. The inquiry also recommended the establishment of a beneficial ownership register to better understand who is behind companies working in the region. That followed evidence to the inquiry that one of the companies, Falcon Oil &amp; Gas, was linked to Russian oligarchs. The inquiry also recommended the expansion of the water trigger to cover all forms of unconventional gas. Water triggers are designed to protect groundwater from the impacts of the gas industry Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young chaired the inquiry. She said in a statement: This report is a huge blow to the prospects of gas corporations trying to frack the Beetaloo Basin. Labor went to the last election promising to open the Beetaloo Basin, but through this inquiry and our changes to the Safeguard Mechanism, the Greens are gaining Labor support to put serious roadblocks in the way of the Beetaloo. Independent MPs welcome EV strategy Independent MPs Sophie Scamps and Monique Ryan have welcomed the government’s electric vehicle strategy, including the announcement Australia will introduce fuel efficiency standards on new cars. Ryan writes: This will ensure that Australians have access to less polluting cars that are cheaper to run, saving $$ and reducing emissions. Scamps said the release of a national EV strategy is “long overdue”: Transport is responsible for nearly 20% of emissions so more EVs will be good for our climate and good for cost of living – with EVs reducing our reliance on dirty and expensive fossil fuels. You can read more about the strategy here: Andrew Wilkie criticises stage-three tax cuts Independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie has released a statement criticising the governments stage-three tax cuts, labelling it “completely out of step with community needs”. He said that stage-three cuts will “only further increase the inequality in our country”, not just between lower and higher income earners but also between Tasmania and the mainland: New research that the stage-three tax cuts will do very little to help low and middle-income earners, but provide a huge windfall to high-income earners, highlights the deep unfairness of the federal government’s policy. It’s also fiscally irresponsible that the federal government is willing to spend more than a quarter of a trillion dollars on this policy that only benefits high-income earners when many Australians are confronting a cost-of-living crisis. Wilkie said that the cost of living crisis is only set to rise because of an “underinvestment in public services caused by tax cuts”: What the government should be doing instead is investing this money into essential services like health, education, aged care, housing, and boosting pensions and payments. These are things that would make a real difference to people’s lives. Cemetery sector set for overhaul amid grave shortage The rapidly diminishing number of available burial plots in New South Wales has prompted an overhaul of the long-troubled cemetery sector, AAP reports. The incoming lands and property minister, Steve Kamper, announced the shake-up, saying he was determined to provide a fresh start for the industry and reassure people of continued access to quality burial services in Sydney. He said: For two years this process has been marred by procrastination and infighting, while the supply of available gravesites dwindled to alarming levels. It comes after the Berejiklian government in 2021 announced five of the major operators would merge into one, after a review found they were on the brink of financial collapse. The operators held collective debts of more than $300m, and were also quickly running out of burial space. The then government decided to amalgamate the five operators into a single entity named OneCrown. The minister says little has been achieved in that time, and he plans to get the sector back on track by publicly releasing an independent report into OneCrown. There will also be an audit carried out into the lack of cemetery space in Sydney, while decisions will be made regarding OneCrown’s future. What we learned from Andrews’ Ibac presser And that’s a wrap on the Daniel Andrews press conference! Here’s a brief summary of what we learned: Andrews said he will be leading the process to consider the Ibac’s 17 recommendations from the Operation Daintree report. He said his role is to be accountable, but stressed “there are no findings against anyone in this report” and that staffers and ministers mentioned no longer work in parliament. He admitted the Ibac findings are not a clean bill of health for the Victorian government. Andrews stated there is no suggestion that he knew of the problems before the 2018 election. He also repeatedly defended himself against the idea that power has been centralised in his office during questioning from reporters, adding he is “not here to talk about the vibe”. He said some issues raised in Ibac report are “a bit out of date” and the response needs to be done “right”, not speedily. Andrews defends his government’s culture amid Ibac findings With the greatest of respect, I am not here to talk about the vibe. I can only talk about what is my experience, my expectations and what I am going to do and that is we are going to go through the 17 recommendations properly, appropriately in an orderly way and we will report progress to you. I don’t believe that the report speaks to that, confirms that culture and I don’t believe that culture exists … if that culture existed, I think we would be in very different circumstances, we obviously would be. And that’s a wrap on the Andrews press conference. Andrews defends against charges of centralisation of power in premier’s office Andrews is continuing to defend himself against the idea that power has been centralised in his office, which journalists are raising at this media conference – particularly his involvement in health. I would not advise anybody to hold their breath waiting for me to apologise for being very, very interested in the biggest service delivery part of government which is the health portfolio. … I have been a health minister and my premier [at the time] was just as involved and just as concerned and just as motivated to do the right thing by patients and their families and our staff as I am. I have done both roles. Very few people have. I am uniquely placed to be able to tell you that this notion of centralisation, people are entitled to their opinions but the facts are, I am deeply concerned to make sure patients get the care they need and that is not unusual. The reason I know that is because I have been a health minister and Premier Brumby was just as engaged in the health portfolio as I am because it is really important. It is perhaps the most important, particularly if you need that care. Victorian premier’s press conference continues Without intending to be critical of any previous Labor governments, he says, Andrews toots the horn of his own a little: We have been a very busy government. We have achieved more than any government in the history of this state, whether it is in construction, in reform, in enhancing the services that we need, in dealing with all manner of crises. We are a pretty busy outfit. We have got a lot of stuff done. We are humbled by the support we have received by the Victorian community and we are focused on getting on and doing more of that work. The Daniel Andrews press conference is still going on, with the premier fronting questions about these Ibac findings. He says he doesn’t accept that power has been centralised in his office. Reporter: Do you agree that power has been centralised in your office? Andrews: No, I don’t accept that at all. I put it to you this way, I was a member of the Bracks government. I was a member of the Brumby government and I have been a member of the government that I lead, of course. I have got some appreciation of other governments over my journey, albeit I wasn’t in the parliament. I don’t think that is accurate at all. … The notion that somehow the Premier’s office today is a vastly different one to what it used to be in the past and it used to be some sort of timid outfit – no, that is just not right. I wouldn’t expect integrity agencies who run very sweeping and broad commentary to have any appreciation whatsoever of what occurred in previous Labor governments or Liberal governments. The job of the Premier is to chair the cabinet, lead the government and lead the state. My staff work with their counterparts in ministerial offices, just as I work with my counterparts in cabinet to deliver our agenda. We all work together. Calls for education agent register to help fight international student labour exploitation A peak international body for international students has echoed calls for an employee agent register to cut down on exploitation in the sector. Speaking to a parliamentary inquiry, Sharon Cooke, the national president of the ISANA International Education Association, said regulations to monitor the performance of education agents – who charge commission to assist international students with their degrees – “clearly aren’t working”. We see a lot of problems of students being given misinformation … that leads to course hopping. Speaking at the inquiry yesterday, the chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, Phil Honeywood, said Australia’s international education system had become a “Ponzi scheme” in which overseas agents were paid bonuses to lure foreign students with the promise of full-time work. Cooke said a greater crackdown was also needed to prevent the “astronomical” amount of exploitation of gig workers. She said students were reluctant to report any form of exploitation but “the reality is” they were being paid cash in hand or via ABNs to hide substandard pay conditions. One of the easiest ways to traffic labour is with a student visa … there’s an opportunity to put in place certain provisions that would discourage that. Daniel Andrews says Ibac report has ‘no suggestion’ he knew of problems before 2018 election Back to the Daniel Andrews press conference: The premier says there is no suggestion that he knew of the problems before the 2018 election. He’s keen to emphasise he announced a partnership, not a provider. He also gives us a clue on perhaps why the location of the press conference was chosen: The report makes it very clear that there is no suggestion that I knew of the problems in the administration of the first part of the pre-2018 stuff. So that is clear, before anyone gets any ideas that we should have been alive to this and not made the election commitment. That is not the case at all and Ibac goes directly to that. … I didn’t announce a tender, I didn’t announce the winner, I announced a partnership … That detail was not there. Any commitments are always predicated on the pretty self-evident logic that you would be capable of delivering what we are partnering with you to do. That you would do it to the highest standard, that you would be up to the task. That is borne out as well by the constant and repeated and very clear acknowledgment by Ibac that at various points, I was very keen to see a Tafe provider – much like the one we’re standing at right now – be the partner to deliver this training. Annastacia Palaszczuk says ‘no consultation’ over suggestion states step up NDIS funding The Queensland premier has sledged the federal government over its demands that states step up their funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told parliament on Wednesday she was concerned by Bill Shorten’s comments that the federal government could not go it alone when it comes to NDIS funding. There has been no consultation.. we have not been informed. Let me make it very clear that the word is National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is a national scheme ... and not a state scheme. Palaszczuk said the state government already provides support for 127,000 people with a disability. I’ll always stand up for Queensland ... The federal government needs to go back to the drawing board. Andrews admits the anti-corruption commission’s findings are not a clean bill of health for his government. Reporter: It is not a clean bill of health, it doesn’t say everything is awesome, and there [are] a number of reports in the same vein? Andrews: Of course it doesn’t. It says in 17 different recommendations, there are ways in which we can do more, not to deal with conduct that is actually happening but to prevent conduct happening in the future and that is a really important thing. … I am not going to stand here today and say, no worries, we will accept all of this, and it will all happen like some sort of magic thing. … there is a lot of work going on in different areas. This will be added to that body of work. Andrews: my role is to be accountable but there are no findings against anyone in this report Taking questions, the first one is: You said you accept responsibility. But you didn’t apologise, do you think you have anything to say sorry for? Andrews: My role is to be accountable and I just stress, I have seen some of the coverage this morning, I stress again for people watching and listening, there are no findings against anyone in this report. The anticorruption commission has looked at a series of matters from some years ago and has found no corrupt conduct. That is just a fact and it is important that that fact is out there and people know and clearly understand that. My responsibility – I can’t change what happened four or five years ago. The people involved are either no longer in the parliament or from a staff point of view, they don’t work for the government any more. They don’t work for the public service. They haven’t done for years. My responsibility is to look at the 17 recommendations in an educational report, not a report delivered because wrongdoing was found, this is a report under the education powers. … My role is to lead that cabinet process and I will and we will sit down as a cabinet and work through those 17 recommendations. There is some complexity to some of those. This is not simple work and we will do that properly. That is the fundamental responsibility that I have. Victorian premier: some issues in Ibac report ‘a bit out of date’ Andrews: There are some things that have already happened and processes that are alive and on foot. We will do that work and we will report progress to you once that work is finished. Andrews: Ibac response must be done ‘right’ Andrews says the process of consideration he will be accountable for needs to be done “right”, not speedily: I am accountable and fundamentally responsible for driving a process to consider those 17 recommendations, look at them very carefully, to potentially further engage with Ibac to seek their advice and then to respond once that work has been done. This matter has not been to cabinet. It is not possible for this to go to cabinet and given the educational elements of this, it is not about taking action immediately. It is not about necessarily responding to calls for action and findings that have been made against anybody, there are no findings against anyone in this report. We do have the time to get this right and we should. Daniel Andrews on Ibac: ‘there are no findings against anyone in this report’ Andrews is now speaking about the Ibac findings, saying he will be leading the process to consider the report’s recommendations: I will lead, as the chair of the cabinet, a cabinet process to consider those issues and we will respond in due course but we’re grateful for that educational report and those 17 recommendations. … There are no findings against anyone in this report. It is an educational report, they’re not my words, that is the way in which Ibac themselves have described this. The recommendations go to a number of serious and important matters and we will give proper consideration as part of a proper cabinet government process to each of those. The staff members that are referred to in this report do not work for the government any more and have not worked for the government for years and as you well know, the two ministers who are referenced in the report are not even members of the parliament any longer. Dan Andrews fronts media following Ibac findings The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is speaking in Melbourne about the opportunities for apprenticeships which the North East Link road project is creating – but we are of course expecting him to front questions about these finding of the anticorruption body in Victoria released this morning. It found that a ministerial adviser improperly influenced a contract granted to the health workers union. We’ll bring you what he has to say when he takes questions, but in the meantime you can read Benita Kolovos’ article about those findings here: Universities relying on ‘clunky’ online models to plug gaps from job losses, inquiry told Back to the education inquiry: Sharon Cooke, the national president of the ISANA International Education Association, told the inquiry the pandemic had been the “most challenging period for the sector on record” and institutions were still feeling the pain of significant job cuts. We are continuing to see a large reduction of staff was detrimental to student support areas of institutions, leaving the workforce inexperienced due to a large loss … of practitioner knowledge. Cook said staff levels remained significantly lower than Covid and she didn’t see it being reversed amid a “push to go online to clunky websites and apps”. Dr Terry McDonald from the NT’s education union said there was an understandable rush for everything to move online during Covid but, while hybrid and online models were valuable, they were also being used as a crutch to fill funding gaps. It’s problematic … we lost thousands of jobs. The big concern we have is … some institutions are looking to online learning as a cost-saving measure. If done properly … it’s just as expensive. We are very concerned that student support services are not there in the way they were prior [to the pandemic] and even then they were stretched. Her colleague, Kieran McCarron, said now domestic and international numbers were rebounding, higher workloads were falling on teachers. He said members had reached out saying they’d three people cut out of a eight-person team, with only one replaced. They all do 20% more work and are told that’s just the way it is. Greens respond to Operation Daintree The Victorian Greens have responded to Ibac’s Operation Daintree report, saying it’s reinforced the urgent need to open ministerial diaries to the public in Victoria. The measure, which is already in place in New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT, would allow Victorians to see who is influencing government decisions and how they are doing it, according to the acting Greens leader, Tim Read. He said: Today’s Ibac report has laid bare the need to bring our integrity standards up to scratch. This means requiring detailed diaries of ministers and parliamentary secretaries to be made public, as called for by Ibac last year, so Victorians can see who is influencing government decisions. We must also legislate codes of conduct for lobbyists, ministers and their staff and strengthen them to require clearer information on potential conflicts of interest between government ministers and lobbyists. Ministers are responsible for the actions of their staff, who are often following orders, and their intrusion into the public service shown here was the responsibility of those ministers and the premier. It’s embarrassing that Ibac feels Labor’s ministers need to be told the meaning of ministerial accountability, but adding this to their code of conduct should stop the gradual erosion of this concept. Queensland Labor crows over housing initiative It’s feeling a lot like Groundhog Day in Queensland parliament, with the deputy premier reciting the same lines about a housing initiative over and over again. The deputy premier, Steven Miles, told parliament the Palaszczuk government will allocate $25m to purchase 64 homes on the private market that will house vulnerable Queenslanders. But it was the second part of his announcement that attracted groans from the LNP opposition – “with funding previously earmarked for the repurposing of student accommodation.” Miles paused before boldly repeating the same line two more times over the opposition’s injections before the acting speaker, Joe Kelly, intervened. I ask the deputy premier to move past this part of your speech. Kelly then turned to the opposition: “Members, there is far too much interjection. Given the number of times you raise housing as an issue I would think that you would want to hear the ministerial statement”. ACT way ahead of federal government on EVs, chief minister says The ACT’s chief minister, Andrew Barr, has released a statement in response to the government’s national electric vehicle strategy. He’s welcomed the announcement but highlighted the territory has been way ahead of the federal government: The ACT has advocated consistently for a more stringent emissions standard for vehicles to reduce emissions and increase the diversity of electric vehicles on offer in the Australian market. … Today’s commitment to a more stringent emissions standard provides vehicle manufacturers with the incentive needed to deliver more electric vehicle models to Australia, including more affordable options. Last year, there were 39 zero emissions vehicle options in Australia, with only five models priced below A$60,000. This compares with the UK, where there are twenty six models available for less than A$60,000*. *These stats are from RepuTex’s powering Australia policy analysis and the Electric Vehicle Council’s state of EVs report. The Australian Capital Territory’s chief justice, Lucy McCallum, has described secrecy as “anathema to the rule of law” while releasing the long-awaited sentencing decision against Witness J. On Wednesday, the ACT supreme court considered whether to publish sentencing remarks about the man, known by the pseudonym Alan Johns and also as Witness J, who was jailed in complete secrecy after pleading guilty and being convicted for the disclosure of confidential information. Johns, a former commonwealth official, had his employment at an unnamed agency terminated due to loss of his security clearance. He was then convicted for offences related to complaints to his former employer that he had been treated unfairly, using what the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor referred to as “unsecure means” to communicate “classified information”. Nothing was known about his case until a legal fight in 2019 over Johns’ prison memoir alerted media to his earlier conviction. Documents released earlier in April, authored by the Australian government solicitor representing the attorney general, revealed Johns was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison as an aggregate sentence for five charges. In deciding to release the remarks, McCallum said: The prospect of a person being imprisoned in this country in proceedings closed to the public on suppressed charges proved by secret evidence is inherently likely to cause consternation. Secrecy is anathema to the rule of law. The administration of justice thrives on the discipline that comes with public scrutiny. That is the premise of the principle of open justice. But she also said open justice was not “absolute”. There will be occasions on which some limitation of the principle is necessary to secure the proper administration of justice. Anti-corruption watchdog’s acting commissioner statement on Operation Daintree The Ibac acting commissioner, Stephen Farrow, has released a statement following the release of the anti-corruption watchdog’s Operation Daintree report. He said the investigation revealed breaches of duties and obligations of ministers, ministerial advisors and senior public servants: Our investigation showed that the HWU [Health Workers Union] was given privileged access and favourable treatment in its access to ministerial offices. The proposal from HEF raised a conflict between the government’s interest in procuring the most suitable supplier for the training and the governing party’s interest in assisting an affiliated union. This conflict of interest was not properly managed or declared. Advisors in the premier’s private office and the minister for health’s office also interfered in the management of the HEF contract to obstruct consideration of its termination and to ensure it continued. The DHHS awarded the contract to HEF without a competitive procurement process due to senior staff in the department believing it was the minister’s and government’s preference, and because of ongoing pressure from both the minister for health’s advisor and secretary of the union. This conduct by senior public servants falls short of the required Victorian public sector standard. Australia Institute calls for end to subsidies on utes and better support for public transport The left-wing think tank the Australia Institute are also saying there needs to be more “pedal to the metal” when it comes to the government’s fuel efficiency standards, which are the centrepiece of its electric vehicle strategy. Noah Schultz-Byard, the director for South Australia at the institute, said: While it’s good to see Australia move incrementally forward, the longer we delay setting real fuel efficiency standards the harder it will be to meet our 2030 target. When you start from behind, as Australia is on EV policy, you can’t catch up by going slower than everybody else. The longer we keep subsidising big 4-wheel-drive utes, the longer they will keep topping sales charts and polluting. They say transport sector emissions reductions are critical due to the inefficiency of our car and bus fleets at present and that any reductions from EVs will be canceled out by utes and SUVs, which enjoy tax concessions. To bring down transport emissions, subsidies for large, polluting vehicles need to end, public and active transport options need to be supported, and our policies around fuel efficiency standards need to be at least as strict as those already in place around the world. Transport is so much more than cars – electric vehicles are not an option for much of the population. We need creative and equitable policy to provide clean transport options for all Australians. Climate Council responds to new EV strategy Different stakeholder groups are sharing their two cents on the government’s new national electric vehicle strategy. The Climate Council have welcomed the government’s announcement but pushed them to go further. They want the fuel efficiency standards delivered as soon as possible and have recommended their five top design priorities to ensure households will benefit: A target that all new vehicles being sold would be zero emission by 2035 at the latest. The standards should align with other other car markets like New Zealand, the United States and Europe as a minimum, so Australia moves up the queue for cleaner, cheaper vehicles. They should genuine reductions in emissions from new cars sold in Australia and avoid credits and loopholes that undermine their effectiveness. Making the standards mandatory and legislated, meaning auto manufacturers would not be able to opt out. And they should start as soon as possible, as every new vehicle sold today will likely be on the road for at least the next 10 years. The council says that fuel efficiency standards should be accompanied by other policies that support and enable the uptake of lower and zero-emissions vehicles. The government could go further, they say, by reviewing current tax incentives which skew purchases towards heavier and higher emitting vehicles and supporting those on lower incomes to swap older, more polluting cars for ones that are cleaner and cheaper to run. Dr Jennifer Rayner, the head of advocacy, said: The federal government needs to put the pedal to the metal in delivering strong fuel efficiency standards. There are around 1m new cars sold in Australia each year so we need to act fast to give drivers more choice and see them start saving. Victoria’s anti-corruption commission has this morning tabled the findings of its Operation Daintree report. It’s found that a ministerial adviser improperly influenced the awarding of a $1.2m training contract to the Health Workers Union. My colleague Benita Kolovos has the full story: Inquiry hears universities ‘heavily dependent’ on international student income International students have been depended on to subsidise university research and build private investment portfolios, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. Kieran McCarron, the policy and research officer at the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) said international students were highly susceptible to exploitation and had been used as an “effective way to traffic labour”. Prior to the disruption of Covid and the sudden shutdown of the international student sector, which led to thousands of job losses in public universities, university providers were heavily dependent on international student fee income. This discretionary revenue, derived from a largely unconstrained market, was used by providers to subsidise their domestic, teaching and research … it was also used by some of our larger public institutions to build private investment portfolios. McCarron said relying on international student fees was an “inherently high-risk business model” but feared the dependence would become more pronounced in post-Covid recovery due to federal government cuts in university funding. The job-ready graduate funding cuts - enacted in 2020 - effectively cut resourcing per domestic student place by an average of 14% and cut funding for several disciplines. It failed in its intent to produce job-ready graduates … instead it further incentives universities to rely on international student fees. Policy drivers have encouraged a profit driven corporatised culture to grow in public universities … we need leadership on this … the sector’s focus so far appears to be on market growth and expansion. The government services minister, Bill Shorten, has admitted he couldn’t live on the current jobseeker rate, telling Sky News this morning “I couldn’t live on it”. However, he can’t say the government will support the raise its own independent committee has recommended: The decision about raising any rate, it’s going to be one for the government and our economic team. We can only do what is responsible and sustainable and unfortunately the the budget that we inherited from the previous government is heaving with a trillion dollars of Liberal debt. So [we] can’t do everything. Covid PCR tests no longer available without a referral in NSW Covid PCR tests will no longer be available without a pathology referral from a doctor from 13 May in New South Wales. The new health minister, Ryan Park, announced the change this morning, saying now was the time to make shifts in line with other parts of Australia. He said: I want to thank all of the healthcare staff who have worked tirelessly in testing clinics across the state to help keep the community safe during the pandemic. However, since January we’ve seen a significant reduction in demand for PCR testing driven by changes in health recommendations, testing behaviour and increased access to rapid antigen tests. The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said rapid antigen tests were the most convenient and appropriate test for most of the population, while PCR tests were still important for those most at risk. Greens release Hecs-Help indexation calculator to highlight June debt rises The Greens have released a calculator which allows university graduates to estimate their debt hikes when next indexed on 1 June. It comes after the Greens education spokesperson Mehreen Faruqi’s bill – which proposed pausing indexation and increasing the minimum repayment threshold to the median wage – was rejected by a Senate inquiry on Monday. Indexation on Hecs-Help and vocational education loans is expected to increase by up to 7% on 1 June amid high cost of living increases, equating to thousands of dollars of extra debt. Modelling reported by Guardian Australia suggests the increase will hit people with an average student debt of $24,770.75 with an extra $1,700. The 585,000 people with debts in excess of $40,000 or more will have debts increased by $2,876.21. Others will face even higher rises. Faruqi said by rejecting the bill, the federal government was ignoring “loud, desperate calls” from students, graduates and experts for “urgent action” to address the student debt crisis: Labor is choosing to make life harder for millions of people, especially young people and women who are on the front lines of almost every crisis we face: whether it be cost-of-living, housing, student debt or climate. An education system that traps graduates in a debt spiral and forces them to repay student loans when they are barely earning above the minimum wage is unsustainable and broken. Check out the calculator here. Andrews also revealed yesterday that she would not be campaigning for a “no” vote in the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum. Asked how she reconciles saying she will support the Liberal party’s position opposing the voice referendum at the same time as saying she won’t be campaigning for a “no” vote, Andrews says: I can reconcile that quite easily because I have always believed very strongly that people need to be able to be given the information that they need to make the decisions that they need to take. This is actually a referendum, so every single person, every single Australian, has the opportunity to vote in that. What’s important is that they understand the issue and what the implications are both positive and negative. So I’m not going to be the one out there saying you should vote “no” or vote “yes”. I’m going to be the one out there saying here is the information that you need to be able to make the decisions. Karen Andrews says Australia should not have ‘presidential-style elections’ as Dutton approval ratings slump Karen Andrews is defending the Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, despite some pretty bad polling out this morning. The Resolve poll in the Nine newspapers has shown that Dutton’s approval rating has nose-dived to -28%. (That is to say, 26% of poll respondents approve of his leadership and 54% disapprove, making an overall rating of -28%.) Asked if Dutton is electable, Andrews responds: He is extraordinarily popular in Queensland. So he does resonate very well with people here in Queensland. What we need to do is make sure that we pick up seats in Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia, primarily, and hold all of the seats we have currently got. I think Peter has made a very strong commitment to make sure that he will rebuild the party, he will keep the team together so that we are united as we go into the next election. The important thing is to look at the policies … and as soon as those policies come together and we’re able to talk about them, I mean, that’s going to help. Michael Rowland: It’s been a year since Peter Dutton took the job. He may be popular in Queensland, but is he electable, in your view, like states like Victoria? Andrews: He’s obviously going to have to be electable if we’re going to win the next election. Rowland: Do you believe he is electable? Andrews: I can’t see any reason why he shouldn’t be, but – and I know you’re going to say that I’m not answering your question. I actually don’t think we should have presidential-style elections here in this country anymore. So this should not be a personality contest between Peter and Anthony Albanese or whoever is leading at the time you go into those elections. I would actually like to see more of the frontbench of both sides out there prosecuting their own portfolios. Do I believe Peter is electable? He was elected unopposed within our party. He has strong support and it is the job of every single member of parliament to make sure that they are out there making sure that Peter Dutton is electable. The other parliamentarian doing the rounds on breakfast news shows is Karen Andrews, following her announcement yesterday to step down from her role as shadow home affairs minister and to quit politics altogether at the next federal election. She’s told ABC’s News Breakfast program: The reality is that I have never considered myself to be a career politician. I have always tried to do my best, but I’m an engineer, I have worked in industrial relations, I have now had a political career and I think it is time for me to call time on my political career. My party is going through the process of rebuilding, shaping up for the next election, and it would have been wrong of me to stay on if I wasn’t prepared to stay for at least one more term after this one. Pocock: voters will hold Labor to account over jobseeker The committee which released the independent advice to raise jobseeker – which the government looks set to ignore – was established as a carrot to Pocock in return for his support on the government’s industrial relations legislation. However, Pocock won’t say he regrets the deal. His answer to Sky News was that he wanted independent advice to be publicly available and the transparency measure he’s put in place will be “harder and harder for governments to ignore” : This is conversation on budget, we can see what they actually deliver on that advice. And then voters can hold them to account. If voters think that this is an issue, then they can they can vote at the next election and vote for someone who’s going to hear that call, and actually ensure that we are building the kind of communities and society that that people want to be part of. So I think it’s a transparency measure. And I think over time, it’s going to be harder and harder for governments to continue to ignore expert advice. David Pocock on government’s refusal to raise jobseeker: ‘budgets are about priorities’ The government appears set to reject a call from its very own expert advisory panel to raise the jobseeker rate. The independent senator David Pocock was instrumental in setting up that panel, and as Amy already mentioned this morning, has urged the government to accept its advice. He’s doing the breakfast news show rounds with that message, telling ABC he does not buy the government’s excuse of a tight budget: There’s pressure on budgets across the country. If you want to hear about tight budgets, talk to people who are deciding between medicine and food. That’s a tight budget. And for a government that won’t touch $250bn of stage-3 tax cuts going to the wealthier Australians, we saw another report that’s showing it’s going to people in urban centres, not going to benefit the regions at all – I frankly just don’t buy it. Budgets are tough. Budgets are about priorities. And we are hearing from the government that whilst they now know that there’s a lot of people doing it tough, they are not enough of a priority. We’re going to continue with stage-3 tax cuts, we’re going to find tens of billions for inland rail and hundreds of billions of dollars for submarines, but people in our communities who need the support, they’ll just have to wait and somehow make a plan. Voice committee heads north to hear traditional owners The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has defended the wording of the proposed Indigenous voice to parliament, dismissing fears of possible high court challenges, AAP reports. It comes as traditional owners from far north Queensland and the Torres Strait are due to give evidence as an inquiry into the proposed body resumes. Albanese said the prospect of cases being brought before the courts due to the wording had been shot down by Australia’s top constitutional law experts. He told 2SM Sydney this morning: This is a legally sound proposition. It makes it very clear that parliament is in charge. There’s no obligation and there’s certainly not an obligation on the government to agree to the voice. There is the provision for the voice to be heard, for at least the views to be put. The third hearing of the parliamentary inquiry into the voice to parliament and executive government will be held in Cairns today. The committee is examining the proposed constitutional changes and the question that will be taken to the public before the terms of the referendum are locked in by federal parliament. Torres Strait Island councils and traditional owner groups from Cape York and the Torres Strait are among those giving evidence at the hearing. Bill Shorten says ‘budget heaving with a trillion dollars of Liberal debt’ as raise in jobseeker looks unlikely As we mentioned earlier, it’s looking unlikely the government will substantially lift jobseeker payments despite its own poverty experts calling for an increase to the “seriously inadequate” unemployment support. The government services minister, Bill Shorten, told ABC News Breakfast this morning, he can’t answer the question. That will be up to the government as a whole. I don’t know. The reality is that we know that people are doing it tough, absolutely doing it tough. And what we want to do is where it’s responsible that we can – and affordable – that we can support people doing it tough. The reality is we got to weigh that up against all the other things in the budget and the budget is heaving with a trillion dollars of Liberal debt. The electric vehicle strategy will look at reducing the barriers to electric vehicle uptake, including demand, supply or infrastructure. The minister for infrastructure and transport, Catherine King, said the government would ensure the fuel efficiency standards work for Australia’s market. This strategy offers an historic opportunity to develop fuel efficiency standards that learn from international best practice, while recognising the unique needs of Australians. It will send a strong message to the global car industry that when it comes to transport technology, Australia will no longer settle for less. More than 85 percent of all cars sold in the world are subject to fuel efficiency standards. It’s time Australians were offered the same choice. Consultation on the design of fuel efficiency standards begins today, and is available here. Following that consultation, the government will release the proposed Fuel Efficiency Standard by the end of this year. Australians can expect a better choice of electric vehicles and less pollution as the government launches Australia’s first national electric vehicle strategy. The strategy will introduce a fuel efficiency standard which will outline how much pollution (specifically, carbon dioxide) a car will produce when it’s running. Up until today, Australia – together with Russia – was among the only developed countries that didn’t have fuel efficiency standards. It has meant Australians have missed out on a greater choice of car models because manufacturers have prioritised sending more efficient vehicles to countries with standards in place. The efficiency standard is also set to save motorists $519 per year in fuel costs, the government said previous analysis has shown. With passenger cars making up almost 10% of Australia’s CO2 emissions, the government says it is an important step to meet our emissions reduction targets. A joint statement from the minister for climate change, Chris Bowen, and infrastructure minister, Catherine King, said: Transport is the third largest source of emissions in Australia. This Strategy will help cut our emissions by at least 3m tonnes of carbon by 2030, and over 10m tonnes to 2035. Australian governments, car makers, motoring clubs, climate groups, businesses and unions were all on board with the strategy, according to Bowen. He said: Fuel-efficient and electric vehicles are cleaner and cheaper to run – today’s announcement is a win-win for motorists. The efficiency standards will only apply to new cars, and not retrospectively, so consumers will still be able to choose they vehicle they want to drive, the government says. The national electric vehicle strategy is available here. Karen Andrews agrees that LNP is distracted by the no campaign Karen Andrews, who yesterday stepped down as shadow home affairs ministers and announced she would not contesting her seat of Macpherson in the next federal election, has this morning reflected on the state of the party and parliament she will be leaving. Speaking to ABC Radio this morning, Andrews said she was very surprised by the Liberals’ historic defeat in the Aston byelection. She said she agreed with the former deputy state director of the Victorian Liberal party Tony Barry’s opinion that if the party focuses on fringe issues, it will get fringe results. Andrews wasn’t pessimistic about the party’s future, as she said conversations will all her colleagues showed they were all “committed to doing things differently”. Asked if her party was being distracted by the vote no case, Andrews said “I believe so”. She said “it is clearly an important issue” and that there is a strong will from the Australian people to respond to it. She believed the party’s focus on local communities was “the right thing to do” but acknowledged they needed to respond to the issue of constitutional recognition. The more talk there is of one issue in isolation, the greater the risk of disenfranchisement amongst Australian voters, Andrews said. On the issue of the voice, she believes the “better way forward” is for there to be greater dialogue and discussion between two major parties so that recognition can be resolved. She called on both major parties to focus on a more positive approach, saying Question Time is full of negativity and politicians who “beat each other up for silly little reasons.” I’d like to see a gentler parliament … the Australian people deserve better. Dutton reiterates push for nuclear power Dutton argued that a 82% renewable energy target – including 28,000km of transmission wires by 2050 costing at least $100bn – is unfeasible. The only policy he elaborated on in detail was nuclear power: That’s why we’re pushing for a discussion on next-generation, zero emission, small and micro nuclear technologies which countries around the world are investing in. These reactors can plug into an existing distribution network. Similar technology in the form of sealed nuclear reactors will power our future submarines for up to 30 years – equal to the life of the boat. They will be based here in South Australia. Nuclear power within the energy mix has the potential to help us meet three obligations: To improve our environment by reducing emissions. Ensure Australians have affordable power. And create a dependable energy system which supports our businesses, industries and households. And that is policy pragmatism. Dutton also attacked Labor for “dramatically increasing numbers under a ‘Big Australia’ agenda”. He said: Across this and next financial year, around 650,000 migrants will come to our country. It will be the biggest surge in the history of our population. It will occur amidst the housing and rental shortage. Migration on this scale will put even more pressure on transport, on classrooms, on hospitals and on other services. Dutton: Liberals are down but not out Last night the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, gave the Sir John Downer oration at the University of Adelaide. In it, he argued that the Liberals are down but not out and promised new policies to maximise the difference with Labor, including support for nuclear power. Dutton said: The Liberal party has obviously suffered recent setbacks at the federal and state levels. Labor is in power across mainland Australia. I know that many Liberals – whether it’s our members or our rusted-on supporters – are feeling despondent and disillusioned. But in the cycle of politics, parties will be down, but, of course, they are never out. We have been there before. And we’ve come back. It’s in our darkest hours where we find the courage, the camaraderie, the commitment, the conviction and the confidence for revival, for resurgence and for victory. Dutton noted commentators in the media made similar predictions in 2007, and argue their policy prescriptions amount to arguing if the Liberals “could be more like the Labor party they would be able to vote for us for the first time”. Dutton channelled Winston Churchill, claiming “the next election will be one of our finest hours” because the Liberals had “learnt from past mistakes”. He said the next election will be “a very significant choice, between ongoing policy of taxing and spending and fulfilling the union wish list under Labor ... or restoring policy grounded in reason under the Coalition”. He promised the Liberals “will not adopt a cowardly small-target strategy”. Good morning! Natasha May on deck with you. David Pocock says Labor not protecting most vulnerable after failure to raise jobseeker rates Hello again from Canberra where the economic inclusion advisory committee interim report - which was released just after 5pm yesterday recommending a rise in jobseeker - is still making waves. The Antipoverty Centre, which advocates for people living on welfare and in poverty (they go hand in hand these days) have taken to calling it the “economic exclusion committee”. They were sceptical of the process from the outset, questioning what impact it would actually have when it came to raising the rate. Well, it seems we have the answer – not really a lot. As Paul Karp reported, it doesn’t appear that the government is going to take up the committee’s (non-binding) recommendations. And that has left senator David Pocock, who had negotiated for the committee to be established in return for his support on the government’s IR legislation, a bit miffed. The current level of income supports for more than one million Australians is seriously inadequate. The committee recommended a substantial increase in the rate of jobseeker as a first priority and an increase to commonwealth rent assistance. It is unacceptable that as one of the wealthiest countries in the world so many people in our community, especially children, are being forced to live in poverty in this worsening cost-of-living crisis. It appears that this Labor government can find extra money for just about anything - from inland rail cost blowouts to submarines - but it won’t do more to protect the most vulnerable. The Antipoverty Centre was a little more blunt in its response, saying the government “never cared” what the committee would say. Good morning. I’m Martin Farrer and welcome to today’s rolling news coverage. It promises to be a pretty busy day so I’ll have a couple of breaking stories for you before my colleague comes along to run the show. We’re getting into budget bargaining season as stakeholders and interest groups bid to put pressure on the Albanese government ahead of Jim Chalmers’ big day next month. Specifically, our story says ministers are being urged to include a pay rise and increased rent assistance for all childcare and aged care workers as part of “specific and urgent” recommendations by the women’s economic equality taskforce. Meanwhile, there are warnings the planned extra $4.8bn spend on aged care will still not be enough, while the government may ignore calls from its own experts to lift ‘seriously inadequate’ jobseeker rate. The latter move has angered the independent senator David Pocock who says it is “unacceptable”. More coming up on his comments. Students are being left with as little as $13 a day to live on as the youth allowance fails to keep pace with soaring rents, according to analysis from Homelessness Australia. We’re also looking at how Help or Hecs debts are ballooning thanks to inflation, and how best to tackle paying them off. One former student tells us that she now owes more than she did when she left uni. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry will no doubt also have suggestions for the treasurer when it releases its national electric vehicle strategy this morning. Chris Bowen and Catherine King, the energy and infrastructure ministers respectively, will make a joint announcement about it shortly and we’ll have the latest as soon as it happens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2021/oct/28/brexit-fishing-rights-row-what-is-the-dispute-about-and-what-happens-next","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-28T16:04:01Z","webTitle":"Brexit fishing rights: what is row about and what happens next?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/28/brexit-fishing-rights-row-what-is-the-dispute-about-and-what-happens-next","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/oct/28/brexit-fishing-rights-row-what-is-the-dispute-about-and-what-happens-next","fields":{"headline":"Brexit fishing rights: what is row about and what happens next?","bodyText":"For much of the year, British and French ministers have traded threats and accusations over post-Brexit arrangements for fishing waters. But the row now appears to be coming to a head. What is the clash about? When the UK left the EU’s single market and customs union on 31 January 2020 – the so-called transition period after the end of the country’s membership of the bloc – it left the common fisheries policy that has peacefully divvied up the spoils of Europe’s waters since the 1970s. It also ended the Bay of Granville agreement, signed in 2000 by Britain and the self-governing Channel Islands, which had established a pattern of rights for French boats up to three miles from the islands’ coasts. Within the Brexit trade and cooperation agreement, struck last Christmas Eve, there is a new EU-UK fisheries agreement that offers French fishers a continuation of the status quo in a zone in the waters of Jersey and Guernsey, and in the coastal zone between six and 12 miles from the UK’s shores, up to 2026 – if they can prove that they had previously been operating in those waters. What is going wrong? Almost 1,700 EU vessels have now been licensed to fish in UK waters, the UK government says, equating to 98% of EU applications for fishing licences. The percentage figure is disputed in Paris. The main differences between the two sides are centred on rights within the six- to 12-mile zone off the British coast. Earlier this week, the European Commission said the UK government had approved 15 out of 47 applications for French boats to operate in those coastal waters. A further 15 applications are being considered where evidence of activity in those waters is limited, but 17 applications have been withdrawn by French applicants because of “poor evidence”. Of greater concern to the French authorities is that 55 boats applying to fish in the waters off Jersey, a British crown dependency, have also been turned down by the island’s government. The French government says that the level of evidence being demanded by the authorities is unrealistic and that the UK is acting in breach of its treaty obligations. On Wednesday the French government said that unless something changed, it would ban British fishing boats from landing seafood in French ports from next Tuesday. France also vowed to impose onerous checks on cross-Channel trade, and threatened the UK’s energy supply. The UK and Jersey rely on subsea cables bringing energy from French nuclear power stations. How has Downing Street responded? Angrily. The French government is threatening to act unilaterally. It does not yet have the support of the other EU member states to go through the dispute resolution mechanism in the trade and cooperation agreement to impose sanctions on the UK. Downing Street, somewhat ironically given its actions over Northern Ireland, has accused Paris of threatening to break international law. The government has said that if the French threats come to pass, they “will be met with an appropriate and calibrated response”. What is going to happen? While the French government is infuriated by the British government’s attitude to the trade and cooperation agreement, including the separate row over Northern Ireland, the coming presidential election in France is further fuelling the disagreement. Emmanuel Macron wants to show that he is backing his fishing communities. A full trade dispute appears inevitable, with tit-for-tat measures. A deadline of Monday 1 November has been set by the French for the problem to be resolved through the issuing of further licences. It does not seem likely that the UK will respond in a favourable manner to the sabre-rattling, although Jersey’s government announced a few extra permits on Thursday and has said it will consider any further evidence presented by applicants. The trade and cooperation agreement allows the UK to respond with proportionate sanctions on the French, which will most likely affect those vessels that do have permits to operate. The situation is likely to get worse, with potential blockades by French fishers of British and Jersey ports, before it gets any better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jul/22/great-britain-faces-risk-of-winter-blackouts-system-operator-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-22T20:41:49Z","webTitle":"Great Britain faces rising risk of winter blackouts, system operator warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/22/great-britain-faces-risk-of-winter-blackouts-system-operator-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jul/22/great-britain-faces-risk-of-winter-blackouts-system-operator-warns","fields":{"headline":"Great Britain faces rising risk of winter blackouts, system operator warns","bodyText":"Great Britain faces its greatest risk of blackouts for six years this winter as old coal plants and nuclear reactors shut down and energy demand rises as the economy emerges from Covid-19 restrictions. National Grid’s electricity system operator, which is responsible for keeping the lights on, said it expected the country’s demand for electricity to return to normal levels this winter, and would be braced for “some tight periods”. The system operator published a surprise report warning that the tight electricity supplies recorded last winter could be tighter in the winter ahead due to “uncertainty” over the country’s power supplies. It said that in some scenarios the “margin” of forecast electricity supplies might exceed demand by 5.3%, the tightest margin recorded since the winter of 2015-2016, when National Grid was forced to ask businesses to reduce their electricity usage to keep the lights on after a spate of breakdowns at coal plants. National Grid has traditionally published its forecasts for the winter in September but surprised the market on Thursday by issuing a preview report. “Following tighter margins in winter 2020-21 compared to previous winters, we have decided to publish an early view of the margin for winter 2021-22. We believe this will help to inform the electricity industry and support preparations for the winter ahead,” it said. The system operator issued a string of official warnings that electricity supplies were under pressure last year, despite a 3-4% slump in energy demand as people stayed away from offices, pubs and restaurants during the Covid-19 pandemic. The UK was forced to rely on its last remaining coal power plants to meet demand during cold, still periods when demand was high and wind speeds low last winter. This year it could be more difficult to cover the loss of a sudden outage at a power plant, subsea power cable or low wind speeds due to the closure of older nuclear plants. The system operator has assumed that the Dungeness B and Hunterston B nuclear power stations will not be available for the full winter, and that the Baglan Bay, Severn Power and Sutton Bridge gas power stations will remain unavailable. “While we remain confident there is sufficient supply to meet peak demand, we should prepare for some tight periods during the winter” because there “is still some uncertainty” about electricity supplies, the electricity system operator said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/aug/15/spain-launches-inquiry-after-dams-drained-for-profit-amid-heatwave","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-15T12:29:08Z","webTitle":"Spain launches inquiry after dams drained for profit during drought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/15/spain-launches-inquiry-after-dams-drained-for-profit-amid-heatwave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/aug/15/spain-launches-inquiry-after-dams-drained-for-profit-amid-heatwave","fields":{"headline":"Spain launches inquiry after dams drained for profit during drought","bodyText":"The Spanish government has launched an inquiry after it emerged that a power company drained two reservoirs during a heatwave and drought in order to profit from exceptionally high electricity prices. Iberdrola, the country’s second biggest producer, drained the dams in Zamora and Cáceres provinces in western Spain over a period of a few weeks to produce cheap hydroelectricity while the price to consumers is at a record high. Air conditioners and fans are going flat out as Spain remains in the grip of a heatwave. It recorded its highest ever temperature on Saturday, 47.2C (117F), in Córdoba in Andalucía. The minister for ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, described Iberdrola’s actions as scandalous and has written to the company. “This can’t be allowed to happen,” she said in a televised interview. “Water is a scarce resource which is just as important for the wellbeing of families and the economy as it is for generating electricity.” Ribera said she viewed Iberdrola’s actions as irresponsible, but that they were not illegal because the companywas allowed to use a fixed quantity of water a year whenever it wished and regardless of climatic conditions. “It’s legitimate but not reasonable, which is why we want to intervene as soon as possible,” she said. Both reservoirs are a long way from the sea and were popular for swimming and boating, especially in the hot summer months. Now they’re a desert, according to Javier Aguado, the mayor of San Cebrián de Castro, one of the villages affected. In another, San Pedro de la Nave-Almendra, the water level is so low the pumps that extract drinking water have become clogged with mud and the filters have to be cleaned twice a day. Electricity prices in Spain are fixed on a daily basis through what is effectively an auction as power generators bid for their slice of the market based on expected demand. A base price is set by the cost of nuclear power and renewables such as wind and solar, because they are the cheapest, and then the rest – hydro and fossil fuel generators – make their bid. The net effect is that the higher the demand, the higher the price, with fluctuations making it almost impossible for consumers to budget for their electricity bill. Draining the reservoirs to accelerate hydroelectricity production put Iberdrola in a position to bid for a bigger slice of the cake. With the heatwave expected to continue for several more days, most of the country faces temperatures ranging from 30 to 44 degrees.

Labour will soon be defending another seat in a byelection after the MP Kate Green was announced as Andy Burnham’s choice for deputy mayor of Greater Manchester. Rishi Sunak says the UK will “never back down” when it comes to supporting Ukraine. A preview of I’m a Celebrity shows Matt Hancock crawling through dark tunnels, showered with bugs and wading through sludge, my colleague Rachel Hall reports. Harriett Baldwin, a former Treasury minister, has been elected as chair of the Commons Treasury committee. She will replace Mel Stride, who was made work and pensions secretary in Rishi Sunak’s first reshuffle, and she secured the post after beating four other Conservatives: John Baron, Richard Fuller, Andrea Leadsom and Kit Malthouse. In her election statement, Baldwin said she had been a member of the committee since 2019. She went on: The Treasury select committee needs a wise, knowledgable chair to lead proceedings and I’ve worked closely with our previous chair, Mel Stride, to ensure that the committee challenges witnesses without fear or favour. The committee works best without the shackles of economic ideology and focuses on a strong evidence base to make its recommendations. At a time when the country is looking closely at the way its government manages the economy, all eyes will, too, be on the Treasury select committee to rigorously challenge its thinking. The government is set to make changes to a controversial bill to deal with Northern Ireland’s troubled past, PA Media reports. PA says: The draft legislation would see a form of immunity offered to those suspected of killings during the conflict if they agree to co-operate with a new truth recovery body. The Northern Ireland troubles (legacy and reconciliation) bill, which is going through its parliamentary stages, would also prohibit future civil cases and inquests related to Troubles crimes. It has been almost universally opposed by parties across the political divide in Northern Ireland as well as all victims groups. Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris told the House of Commons today that he would make changes to it but did not specify what the changes would be. Heaton-Harris said the bill would return to the House in Lords “in a couple of weeks”. Jens Stoltenberg said he was “absolutely confident” the UK would continue to “lead by example” on defence spending. Speaking after a meeting with Rishi Sunak, the Nato secretary general said: The United Kingdom has led by example over many years when it comes to … defence spending, spending more than 2% of GDP on defence, the United Kingdom has done that, and now more and more allies are following the example of the United Kingdom. But, of course, in a more dangerous world we need to invest more in our defence, and I am absolutely confident that the United Kingdom will continue to lead by example on defence spending. Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, claimed he was holding but “not using” his mobile phone as he pleaded guilty to a driving offence, PA Media reports. PA says: The Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling, 49, is facing a ban from the roads at a court hearing next week after he was stopped by police in his Skoda 4x4 in Wandsworth on April 4. Tugendhat, who stood for the Tory leadership after Boris Johnson stepped down, previously apologised after he was prosecuted for using a mobile phone while driving. In a written guilty plea to Bromley magistrates’ court, which heard the case in private under the single justice procedure, the politician said: “I was holding my phone - not using it. “After the incident I took a course to refresh and correct my driving. “I have included the result of the course. Please accept the course report. “I accept my responsibility and recognise my culpability.” Tugendhat was assessed as “low” risk following his advanced driving course in May, according to the report. “Thomas does not come across as a fast driver who likes to rush; in fact, Thomas is very calm and handles situations accordingly,” his instructor wrote. The Metropolitan police sent Tugendhat a conditional offer of a fixed penalty notice in April, and Tugendhat agreed to pay the fine and surrender his driving licence, according to court papers. But the offence was sent to court for prosecution because Tugendhat already had six penalty points on his driving record. Using a mobile phone while driving can attract six penalty points and a disqualification can be imposed if a driver tots up 12 points within three years. But a ban can be avoided if the defendant can show “exceptional hardship” would be caused by the loss of their licence. Tugendhat’s case has been sent for a full hearing to consider disqualification at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on November 17. Suella Braverman gave a speech to the National Police Chiefs Council conference earlier. Here are the top lines. Braverman said she wanted police officers to have more confidence to tackle dispruptive protesters robustly. She said: Although most police officers do an excellent job, sadly, in recent months and years we have seen an erosion of confidence in the police to take action against the radicals, the road-blockers, the vandals, the militants and the extremists. But we have also seen the police appear to lose confidence in themselves - in yourselves, in your authority, in your power - an institutional reluctance. This must change. Criminal damage, obstructing the highway, public nuisance - none of it should be humoured. It is not a human right to vandalise a work of art. It is not a civil liberty to stop ambulances getting to the sick and injured. Such disruption is a threat to our way of life. It does not ‘further a cause’. It is not ‘freedom of expression’ and I want to reassure you that you have my - and this government’s - full backing in taking a firmer line to safeguard public order. Indeed, that is your duty. Scenes of members of the public taking the law into their own hands are a sign of a loss of confidence and I urge you all to step up to your public duties in policing protests. She said she was concerned that police were applying too narrow a definition of “serious disruption” when applying the law. Speaking to reporters after her speech, she said: I’ve got some concerns about the interpretation of serious disruption and when that threshold is hit, and also the cumulative impact. So when we see a daily reset do you assess it cumulatively over a 10-day period or week or do you say, well I’m just measuring it in a 24 hour period? I think police forces and chiefs would welcome clarity on the law and what their powers actually are. She said she wanted officers to focus on “common sense policing”. She praised the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Stephen Watson, saying he “rejects woke policing”. And she said: The way to ensure public confidence in the police is to focus on getting the basics right. What I call ‘common sense policing’. The kind of policing the law-abiding majority deserves and expects. No politically correct distractions, just good old-fashioned policing - with a relentless focus on making our streets, homes and transport networks safer. She said she had asked officials to revisit rules on “non-crime hate incidents”, because she wanted officers to focus on serious crimes, such as “threats to people and their property”. She said she wanted to make crime recording requirements less burdensome. She said: I am concerned that crime recording requirements can be seen as too complex and burdensome. I am committed to working with the police to see how recording can be simplified without compromising on putting victims first. She said she wanted the police and the NHS to provide better help to people experiencing acute mental health distress “so that people in need of medical help get the right care at the right time, while also reducing inappropriate demand on policing”. She said she wanted to create a new, non-graduate entry into policing. Nicola Sturgeon will have her first face-to-face talks with Rishi Sunak on Thursday, the Scottish government has confirmed. They will meet in Blackpool ahead of the British-Irish Council meeting, which brings together senior figures from administrations across the UK. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: Ahead of the 38th British-Irish Council this Friday, the first minister will hold bilateral talks with the prime minister in Blackpool on Thursday afternoon, and take part in a meeting of the prime minister and heads of devolved government council immediately following that. The meeting will be an opportunity to discuss the cost-of-living crisis, the need to avoid damaging austerity in the upcoming autumn statement, and the importance of respecting the right of the people of Scotland to choose their own constitutional future. Commenting on the UK government’s decision to allow more time for talks in Northern Ireland before an election has to be held, Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, said: The secretary of state’s announcement provides further space for early substantive progress in discussions between the EU and UK on the issues of most concern to people and business in NI. I urge the UK authorities to make use of this renewed opportunity to engage positively, and with real urgency, in the knowledge that the European Commission has listened carefully to the concerns of people across Northern Ireland, including and especially unionists. Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland and first minister designate, has challenged Rishi Sunak to explain what he will do to break the deadlock in Northern Ireland while elections are delayed. Responding to the UK government’s announcement that legislation will be passed to delay the point at which an election has to be held because power-sharing has not been restored at Stormont (see 1.47pm), O’Neill said Sunak needed to “get down to business” and reach an accommodation with the EU on the Northern Ireland protocol. She said: We’re yet to see any substance in terms of finding an agreed way forward on the protocol. There’s been some very positive statements. Like all these things, if there’s a political will to do something, it can be done. So my question to Rishi Sunak is around what is he going to do in the time ahead to actually find an agreed way forward for the protocol. O’Neill also said it was unfair of the UK government to cut the pay of all MLAs because the assembly is not sitting, when it was the DUP that was to blame. She said: I think it would have been more effective to target that towards those people that are actually failing to turn up and join all the rest of the team that actually want to be here to make politics work. The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, has arrived in Downing Street for a meeting with Rishi Sunak, PA Media reports. PA says: He is the first international leader to visit No 10 since Sunak became prime minister, in a sign of the concerns over the situation in Ukraine and the importance of the Nato alliance. Earlier Stoltenberg was hosted by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, at Lydd army camp in Kent, where Ukrainian volunteers are being trained to fight in the war against Russia. Nurses have voted to stage strikes across the UK for the first time in their history in pursuit of a better pay deal, in a move that will seriously disrupt NHS care, my colleague Denis Campbell reports. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has apologised for calling Jeremy Corbyn “senile” in the Commons chamber. Streeting, who made the comment when he was sitting down while a commotion was taking place as Corbyn tried to raise a point of order at the wrong moment in proceedings, says he was speaking “in jest”, but accepts the remark was in poor taste. Streeting said he would be apologising in reply to a tweet from my colleague Owen Jones, the leftwing columnist who was generally supportive of Corbyn. Streeting is on the right of the Labour party and is something of a hate figure for people on the Corbynite left. Some of them have been condemning his comment on Twitter. This is from Andrew Fisher, who used to be Corbyn’s head of policy when Corbyn was Labour leader. And this is from Samuel Sweek, a councillor and a supporter of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum. Rishi Sunak has quietly reintroduced Britain’s national security council of leading ministers, which was scrapped by Liz Truss during her short-lived premiership. Chaired by Sunak and with eight other senior ministers as full members, the committee has reappeared in a fresh shake-up of the machinery of government. The new national security council will also discuss matters of global foreign policy – but European matters will be dealt with in a separate subcommittee. Truss had scrapped the NSC and merged it with two Boris Johnson foreign policy committees, sparking criticism that the body would lose its security focus. Under Truss, the body was called the foreign policy and security council (FPSC), similar to a structure last adopted when Gordon Brown was prime minister. Sunak appears to have addressed some of the concerns by hiving off Europe, bringing back its former name, first introduced when David Cameron was prime minister. Members include Dominic Raab, as deputy prime minister, plus the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, and the home secretary, Suella Braverman. Completing the list are Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, Oliver Dowden, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Victoria Prentis, the attorney general and Tom Tugendhat, the security minister. Spy chiefs and the chief of defence staff, Sir Tony Radakin, also attend in an advisory capacity. At the post-PMQs lobby briefing, the prime minister’s spokesperson said it was “vital” that journalists were allowed to do their job properly. But he would not comment specifically on the arrest by Hertfordshire police of three journalists covering the Just Stop Oil protests. “I am cautious about commenting on specific incidents. Operational decisions are a matter for the police but the prime minister strongly believes in championing press freedoms,” he said. Here is my colleague Damien Gayle’s story about the arrest of the journalists covering the protests. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has not commented on the arrest of journalists, but this morning she posted a message on Twitter praising Essex police for their handling of protests today. Braverman is speaking now at a conference for police chiefs. I will post extracts shortly. Colum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, says Heaton-Harris is right to say an election now would be a bad idea. But it is “shameful” that a single party is blocking the formation of an executive, he says. Heaton-Harris says he has to deal with reality as he finds it. He says there is a huge swathe of the unionist community that objects to the Northern Ireland protocol. (The DUP is boycotting the executive until the protocol issue is resolved.) Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, says it is unfair for MPs to complain about the DUP having a veto on the formation of a power-sharing executive (the DUP is currently blocking it) when in the past Sinn Féin blocked power-sharing for three years. He says people in Northern Ireland want a solution that sees the institutions restored on the basis of Northern Ireland being “an integral part of the United Kingdom”. In the Commons, Scott Benton (Con) asks why MLAs are having their salary cut when Sinn Féin MPs who do not attend the House of Commons get a full salary. Heaton-Harris says he understands the point, and intends to swerve well away from it. Under the existing legislation, Northern Ireland is meant to have a new election to end the deadlock at Stormont by 19 January. Under the new timetable set out by Chris Heaton-Harris, the new deadline for the actual election would be 2 March or 13 April (if there is a second, six-week extension). Back in the Commons the Rishi Sunak statement is over, and Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, is making a statement about the need for an election in Northern Ireland. The law says an election must be held because a power-sharing executive has not been formed. Heaton-Harris says he is currently under a legal duty to call an election. But he says everyone is telling him that calling an election now will change nothing. So, he says, he is going to legislate to push back the deadlines by which an election must be called. Under the existing legislation, the deadline for the creation of an executive was 28 October. Heaton-Harris says the new legislation will extend that by six weeks, to 8 December, with the option of a further six-week extension, to 19 January. He says the aim of this is to “create the time and space needed for talks between the UK government and the European Commission to develop and for the Northern Ireland parties to work together to restore the devolved institutions as soon as possible. He also says people in Northern Ireland are “frustrated” that members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) continue to get their full salaries, even though the assembly is not sitting. He says he will legislate to reduce those salaries “appropriately”. UPDATE: Heaton-Harris said: The one thing that everyone agrees on is that we must try and find a way through this current impasse. When I have a legal duty to call an election that few want and everyone tells me will change nothing. Thus, I will be introducing legislation to provide a short straightforward extension to the period for executive formation, extending the current period by six weeks, to December 8, with potential for a further six-week extension 19 January if necessary. This aims to create the time and space needed for talks between the UK government and the European Commission to develop, and for the Northern Ireland parties to work together to restore the devolved institutions as soon as possible. Here are the main points from the No 10 post-PMQs lobby briefing. The PM’s press secretary says Sir Gavin Williamson will not necessarily be replaced as a minister. Someone will take over his ministerial responsibilities, but that could be a minister already in the Cabinet Office, not a new minister, she said. She said: [The PM is] considering the role and whether that is taken on by someone already in the Cabinet Office or someone who would replace Gavin Williamson. No decisions have been made. The press secretary said it would be for the forfeiture committee to decide of Williamson should lose his knighthood, not No 10. The Lib Dems are saying Williamson should lose the honour if allegations against him are upheld. The press secretary rejected claims that Sunak originally refused to accept Williamson’s resignation. Asked if Williamson would have been sacked if he had not resigned, she said that was a hypothetical question. Chris Bryant (Lab) invites Sunak to visit the Rhondda to see the problems climate change is already causing. He mentions flooding, rain running off hills and houses than need better insulation. Sunak says he would urge the local authority to engage with the government on insulation programmes. Sammy Wilson (DUP) criticises the “obsessive” pursuit of net zero. While the chattering classes like these policies, does he understand how people struggling to pay their bills are concerned by them. Sunak says he agrees with Wilson about the need for more North Sea oil and gas licences. David Mundell (Con) criticises the SNP government in Scotland for blocking nuclear power. Sunak says he would like to spread the benefits of new nuclear power technology across the UK. Ben Bradshaw (Lab) asks what Sunak’s problem is with onshore wind. Sunak says it is important “to bring people with us as we transition to net zero”. He says it would be wrong to alienate communities, he says. And he says the UK is lucky in having a good source of offshore wind. The worst thing we can do is alienate communities if we want to actually deliver on our climate commitment, and as it turns out we are very lucky to have a very reliable, very affordable form of energy in offshore wind which is also creating jobs domestically in the UK. It’s right that that is our priority. Rehman Chishti (Con) asks Sunak to confirm that UK sanctions on Russia do not target food supplies to developing countries. Sunak says two-thirds of the wheat leaving the Black Sea is going to developing countries. So it is crucial that Russia allows it to leave, he says. Chi Onwurah (Lab) asks why the government treats the oil and gas companies with such generosity. Sunak says it is not realistic to think that we can do without oil and gas in the short term. So it is better to produce it here than to import it, he says. Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chair of the Commons defence committee, says climate change is a problem now. The armed forces will have to meet the burden of some of these problems. So it is not right to cut the defence budget now, he says. Sunak says he is committed to supporting the armed forces. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says the government has not delivered its climate promises. When will it do so? And will climate finance not be raided from the aid budget. And does he support finance for loss and damage. Sunak says the UK started the dialogue on loss and damage. That is not the same as reparations, he says. He does not address the point about the UK not meeting its pledges. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, says he is grateful for this continuing rent-free tenancy in Sunak’s head. He says Sunak should give him advance notice when he plans to mention him. Sunak says, if Keir Starmer gives him advance notice of his questions, he will tell Corbyn when he intends to discuss his security policies. Sarah Champion (Lab) says Sunak made “savage cuts” to the international aid budget when he was chancellor. Will aid be cut again? Sunak says he does not shy away from the fact he had to make difficult decisions as chancellor. He says we have all seen now what happens when the government loses the confidence of the markets. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says he is alarmed that Sunak has banned onshore wind. Why won’t the government get rid of that ban? Sunak says the government has a good track record on renewable energy. Offshore wind is what he is focusing on, along with nuclear, he says. That is how they will transition. Jon Trickett (Lab) says the 1% richest people on the planet are responsible for the same amount of emission as the poorest 50%. Does Sunak agree that you can not tackle this problem without social justice? Sunak says the UK does have a moral obligation to help the poorer countries address the problems caused by climate change. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says Scotland has become the first developed country to promise loss and damage payments to developing countries. Will the UK guarantee that overseas aid pledged for climate finance will be spent in five years, as planned. Sunak says it was the UK that established a dialogue on loss and damage. That is ongoing. He says the government intends to deliver its climate finance over the timetable. Theresa May, the former Tory PM, asks what the government’s plan is for training for green jobs. Sunak says the government’s lifelong learning account plans will allow people to retrain. Sunak is responding to Starmer. On his attendance, he says Labour prime ministers missed 12 of the 13 Cops held when they were in power. He claims Labour used to oppose nuclear power. And he says oil and gas will have to be a part of our energy mix as we transition to net zero. The UK plan is the right plan, he says. It is realistic and credible. He says Ed Miliband has described Labour’s plan as “a borrowing plan”. That is not the right approach. He says the British people trust him to manage the economy, not Labour. Labour is focused on the case for reparations, he claims. Keir Starmer is responding to Sunak’s Cop27 summit. He starts by asking what progress Sunak made when he raised the case of the pro-democracy activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah with the Egyptian president. Starmer says Sunak should not have said initially that he would not go to Cop27. He says the lesson of this is that, if you want Sunak to commit to a cause, you have to get Boris Johnson to make that commitment first. (Sunak only agreed to go to Cop27 after Johnson said he was going.) He says Sunak is a roadblock to tackling climate change in the UK. He says Sunak is still committed to the ban on onshore wind, and he included a loophole in his windfall tax on energy companies. As soon as PMQs was over, Rishi Sunak delivered a statement to MPs about the Cop27 summit. He said that when the UK took the Cop26 presidency, only a third of the world was signed up to net zero. Now it is 90%. PMQs would have been even worse for Rishi Sunak if Gavin Williamson had not resigned last night, but he must have arrived at the Commons knowing that this was a day when he bound to take a hit over his decision to appoint Williamson in the first place. And he did. The only surprise was quite how one-sided it turned out. Keir Starmer delivered a proper clobbering. There were two features of Starmer’s performance that made it particularly effective. First, he was withering, and even funny, about Gavin Williamson: “a cartoon bully with a pet spider”, “a sad middle manager getting off on intimidating those beneath him”, and “a run-of-the-mill bully”. Insults work when they have the ring of truth, and these did. And, second, Starmer was reasonably persuasive in turning this into an argument about Sunak being weak. At PMQs it is always dangerous focusing on Westminster process, and not policy. But Sunak is a new prime minister, and members of the public probably do not have a fixed view on the sort of person he is yet. Polling last week suggested people think he outperforms Starmer on being decisive and strong. That polling probably reflects the views people formed as they compared Sunak to Liz Truss, and gave him credit for telling his party over the summer that Truss’s plans were based on a fantasy. For Labour, it is vital to drive those numbers down, and land the claim that actually Sunak is “weak”, and performances like Starmer’s today may have an impact. Sunak might have done better if he had come armed with some surprise attack line to use against Starmer. But he did not have anything up his sleeve, and instead he had to resort to going on about Jeremy Corbyn – a clear sign that he has not got any more effective ammunition to use against the opposition. Siobhan Baillie (Con) asks if Sunak will provide proper childcare reform. Sunak says the government is looking at plans to improve childcare, including changing the staff/child ratios, and making it easier for people to become childcare workers. The results of the review of those plans will be published “in very short order”, he says. Ben Bradshaw (Lab) says the government has not published the results of the review of the security risk posed by issuing “golden visas” to Russians. Sunak say he will get the home secretary to write to Bradshaw about this. Barry Sheerman (Lab) asks what Sunak will do to ensure that children do not go to bed hungry. Sunak says the best solution is to ensure they do not grow up in a workless household. The government is creating jobs, he says. He says work is the best anti-poverty strategy. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, asks if Sunak agrees with the OBR, which says Brexit will harm trade, or Kemi Badenoch, the international trade secretary, who said last week she disagreed with the OBR. Sunak says Brexit will offer more opportunities for trade, including for Wales. Sunak says the online safety bill will make it harder for people smugglers to advertise on social media. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says Sunak’s judgment is as flawed as Liz Truss’s. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, is being lined up for a peerage in Boris Johnson’s honours list, he says. Is it right to keep Jack in cabinet when he is now just interested in going to the Lords. Sunak says he won’t comment on Johnson’s honours list. Blackford says the Scottish Office is now being run by a baron in waiting, who will get a £300-per-day job. Will Sunak stop this? Sunak says he is working with Jack on what the Scottish people want. Bob Blackman (Con) asks about antisemitism, which he says is still prevalent in society today. Will the PM congratulate Holocaust survivors? Sunak thanks Blackman for his powerful question. The government is tackling antisemitism in all its form. Starmer says Sunak is too weak to stand up to people. He would not stand up to the climate change deniers, and then went to Cop27 at the last minute. If he cannot stand up to “a cartoon bully with a pet spider”, what chance has he got of running the country? Sunak says Starmer talks about judgment. He says Starmer thought Jeremy Corbyn was the right person to look after our security. Starmer is not focused on the serious issues, he says. Starmer is supporters strikers and protesters, and opposing measures to deal with immigration, he says. Starmer says he is someone who stands up against vested interests, including against people who are blocking the roads. He says Shell has not paid anything. Sunak says he is standing up for people and delivering jobs. Starmer says, if Sunak cannot stand up to bullies, he will not be able to stand up to vested interests. How much has been raised from Shell from the windfall tax. Sunak says he introduced the windfall tax. Starmer says everyone in the country knows someone like Williamson, a “sad middle manager getting off on intimidating those beneath him”. But they also know someone like Sunak, a boss afraid to stand up to bullies. Sunak says the government is delivering on the people’s priorities. Starmer says Williamson was a “pathetic bully”. Does Sunak regret appointing him? Sunak says of course he regrets appointing someone who had to resign. But he has ensured these allegations are being investigated. Keir Starmer backs what Sunak said about Remembrance Day. How does the PM think the victim of Gavin Williamson, allegedly told to “slit your throat”, felt about Sunak saying he felt great sadness about his resignation. Sunak says he did not know about those allegations. He says people in public life should treat others with respect. Stephen Crabb (Con) asks Sunak to promote floating offshore wind in the Celtic Sea. Sunak says he agrees, and more leases are expected. Neil Coyle (independent) says people who followed Covid rules were betrayed by the Conservatives “who partied their way through lockdown”. Will this PM promise that no one who received a penalty for breaking Covid laws gets a peerage? Sunak says “this government during Covid ensured we protected people’s jobs”. And he mentions the vaccine programme too. He ignores the question. Rishi Sunak starts by referring to Armistice Day, saying he wants to remember those who have lost their lives in the service of this country. PMQs is starting shortly. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. As promised, here is more on the death of Sir David Butler, the father of modern election science. Here is our story about his death. These are from Michael Crick, the political journalist and broadcaster who wrote a biography of Butler, Sultan of Swing. This is from the BBC, where Butler was the lead elections expert for many years. This is from Prof Jane Green, one of the academics running the British Election Study. And this is from Anthony Wells from YouGov. The autumn statement – the second fiscal statement of the autumn described as, in reality, a colossal budget (or the third if you include the statement reversing the mini-budget) – takes places a week tomorrow, and the papers continue to carry stories about what will be in it. Here are three of them. Ben Riley-Smith in the Daily Telegraph says Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, is considering increasing the amount of money raised by the top rate of income tax. He says: Rishi Sunak is considering expanding the top rate of income tax next week after the Treasury warned that more money was needed to protect pensions and benefits. The Telegraph understands that raising the 45 per cent top rate, or lowering the £150,000 annual income threshold at which it kicks in are options now being discussed. Such a move would be a dramatic reversal in position from September, when Liz Truss abolished the 45 per cent rate, before later reinstating it when the markets baulked at her plans. Riley-Smith also says the Treasury is “looking at increasing the National Insurance rate paid by employers by 1.25 percentage points, despite a similar move being reversed by Ms Truss”. Steven Swinford in the Times says Hunt is considering making it easier for councils to raise council tax. Currently councils in England wanting to put up council tax by 3% or more (or 2% or more if they are a district council with no social care responsibilities) must get residents to support the move in a referendum. The government is considering changing this, Swinford says. He writes: The plan was initially rejected over concerns that it would hit the poorest hardest when people are struggling to cope with the cost of living. The council tax referendum requirement is also a manifesto commitment. However, No 10 and No 11 have returned to the council tax discussion over the past 24 hours after deciding to prioritise benefits and pensions. A government source thought Sunak and Hunt would ultimately reject the plan, but said the fact that it was being discussed again made it more likely than before. The Financial Times says plans for investments zones announced by Liz Truss are likely to be abandoned. It says: Liz Truss’s plans for low-tax investment zones to boost UK economic growth are due to be axed by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in next week’s autumn statement. Two Whitehall insiders said levelling-up secretary Michael Gove had lobbied hard for the zones to be ditched in favour of a revamped urban regeneration policy. Although no final decisions have been made, and the zones might alternatively be scaled back dramatically by Hunt, government officials said the chancellor was expected to kill off what was a pet Truss project. The Liberal Democrats are calling for Sir Gavin Williamson to be stripped of his knighthood if the bullying allegations against him are upheld. Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem chief whip, said: The complaints being made about Gavin Williamson are extremely serious and suggest a bullying culture at the very top of the Conservative party. If these complaints are upheld he should be stripped of his knighthood, or else the whole honours system risks being brought into disrepute. Rishi Sunak appointed Williamson to cabinet despite knowing of serious complaints about his behaviour. Since then he sat on his hands for days instead of taking action. The very least Sunak could do now is confirm he would support taking Williamson’s knighthood away if the investigations into his behaviour find him guilty. The problem with this analysis, of course, is that it assumes that the honours system has not already been brought into disrepute. Anyone who thinks scoundrels don’t get knighthoods and peerages hasn’t been paying attention. Chamberlain has written to Sir Chris Wormald, the civil servant who chairs the forfeiture committee, which has the power to take away knighthoods, saying Williamson should lose his if serious allegations against him are upheld. Only rarely do people with knighthoods have them removed. The most recent prominent examples are the bankers Fred Goodwin and James Crosby who lost their knighthoods because of the role they played in the banking crash. (In Crosby’s case, he asked for his knighthood to be taken away.) At Westminster some older hands have been been minded to excuse Gavin Williamson’s Urquhart-style menacing by pointing out that, by the standards of previous whips, his tactics were routine, or even mild. Jack Straw recalls an encounter with Walter Harrison, deputy chief whip during the 1974-79 government (and a leading character in James Graham’s brilliant play, This House) when Harrison shoved him against a wall and grabbed him by the testicles. Straw asked what he had done. “Nowt,” Harrison replied, “but think what I’d do if you crossed me.” But Nicky Morgan, the former Tory education secretary, is one of many parliamentarians glad that this sort of behaviour is no longer acceptable. She told Times Radio: I was talking to somebody yesterday in Westminster, senior MP, and they were a bit like: ‘Oh well, you know, you have to man up and toughen up and everything else.’ And I just don’t think that that’s the case anymore. There’s no doubt that the whips’ office tactics, as they would have been 50 years ago, 30 years ago, are already something that you don’t see. But Westminster has to get into the 21st century ... There are different ways of getting people to fall into line. But there is also a pastoral element, which some whips are better at than others, no doubt. I think the fact that this has been called out and called out so quickly, is perhaps positive evidence that actually the norms in Westminster have changed. There are two ministerial statements in the Commons today. Straight after PMQs Rishi Sunak will be making a statement about the Cop27 summit, and after that Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, will make a statement about the need for elections in Northern Ireland. The government should not have announced a trade partnership with Egypt with the case of jailed British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah unresolved, David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said today. Lammy told the Today programme: I’m not sure in these circumstances we [Labour] would have launched a new strategic relationship with Egypt, which was announced in July this year. We have a £4bn trading partnership with Egypt, that is tremendous leverage. Why has it taken months and months and months for the Foreign Office to act? The prime minister has effectively been dragged into this case because of Cop. That should not have been the case. The secretary of state for foreign affairs only recently in the last few days made contact with the family despite me as MP raising this issue with successive foreign ministers. I don’t think the government should be announcing a strategic relationship with Egypt this year when, in fact, this case is lingering and has gone on for months and months and months, and UK officials have not had access to check on his welfare. That is not acceptable. Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, was batting for the government on the airwaves this morning. Her interviews were dominated by questions about Sir Gavin Williamson, and here are her key lines. Keegan rejected Labour claims that Williamson’s appointment showed that Rishi Sunak’s judgment was flawed. She told BBC Breakfast that Sunak had “fabulous judgment”. And she told Times Radio: I think Rishi has the highest degree of integrity and judgment. We saw it all over the summer, he was prepared to tell the hard truths. That’s real leadership. She said she thought Williamson’s resignation would close down the row about this matter. She said: The reality is you appoint people and, you know, the only thing you can do if things don’t work out or things go wrong or things come to light afterwards is act quickly. Gavin’s acted quickly, he’s removed the distraction. I would expect after today that it won’t be discussed any further. She defended Sunak’s decision to say in his letter to Williamson that he accepted his resignation “with great sadness”. Sunak was being polite, she implied. She said: I think it’s always sad when a colleague resigns. It does have an impact on them personally, it has an impact on their family. So, you know, nobody takes glee out of these situations at all. But ... it happens quite a lot in politics actually. She said she had never seen evidence herself of Williamson bullying colleagues. She told Sky News: I’ve worked with him several times and I haven’t seen any of that. He’s never threatened me, or he’s only only ever been supportive actually, personally, to me. A sixth local authority is taking legal action to stop the government using a hotel to house asylum seekers, PA Media reports. PA says: North Northamptonshire council wants to prevent migrants being accommodated at the Royal Hotel in Kettering. The authority applied to the high court for an emergency injunction and is considering its next steps after this was dismissed. Council leader Jason Smithers said: “We do not feel that the Royal Hotel in Kettering is the appropriate place to accommodate asylum seekers for a number of reasons. “We do not feel the proposals have been properly considered to ensure the best possible welfare can be provided to asylum seekers and the local communities in which they are housed. “We are now considering our options in light of the injunction’s dismissal by the high court.” Five other local authorities are also taking legal action: East Riding of Yorkshire council, Ipswich Borough council, Stoke City council, Great Yarmouth borough council, and Fenland district council. When Sir Gavin Williamson was education secretary, he recorded a video for his department in which he said “bullying is never acceptable”. He said all schools should have anti-bullying policies in place. The Liberal Democrats say the fact that Williamson could say this, when there is now considerable evidence that he himself bullied colleagues, shows the “rank hypocrisy” at the heart of government. Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem education spokesperson, said: This exposes the rank hypocrisy and double standards at the heart of this Conservative government. Gavin Williamson himself admitted that bullying is never acceptable. Schools rightly have a zero tolerance approach to bullying. But once again it seems it’s one rule for Conservative ministers and another for everyone else. Good morning. There are two big departures in the news at Westminster this morning: Sir Gavin Williamson has left the government, and Sir David Butler has departed life, at the age of 98. We will be focusing on Williamson, but Butler, who almost invented modern psephology, is the greater and more consequential figure. If you think about elections in terms of percentages, swings and demographics, and if you value the TV punditry of experts like Prof Sir John Curtice, you are inhabiting a mental framework that Butler did as much as anyone to create. More on him later. But, first, Gavin Williamson. He may have gone, but the questions about the decision to appoint him in the first place haven’t, and this morning David Lammy rehearsed some of the lines we might here from Keir Starmer at PMQs. Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, told the Today programme: This raises real questions about the prime minister’s judgment. The behaviour [from Williamson] that we’ve heard about in the last few days is repellent, it’s odious, and it’s quite, quite unacceptable. The prime minister knew much of this. It was reported to him. Why did he appoint Gavin Williamson to the government in the first place? Why did it even take 10 days to understand what Gavin Williamson would be doing? He appointed him as some sort of enforcer, apparently because this is the way he behaves. This is weak, it’s unacceptable, and we really should have an account of why why he came back into government. When a scandal reaches the ‘raises questions about the PM’s judgment’ phase, that is a sign that it is beginning to go away. You don’t complain about “judgment” when you can complain about substance. But it is understandable why Labour does not want to let this go, and this attack line is valuable to the opposition because Rishi Sunak is unhappy having to defend the last 12 years of Tory government and would like the public to think he is leading a brand new government. But the Williamson appointment showed that he isn’t. Sunak’s cabinet is like an “edited highlights” of the Theresa May/Boris Johnson/Liz Truss administrations (with a bit of David Cameron thrown in), and, as a highly effective, backroom fixer and vote engineer, Williamson was someone who had made himself invaluable to Cameron, May and Johnson. And he performed a similar role with Sunak, which is why he got a job. Here is our overnight story on Williamson’s resignation, by Pippa Crerar and Rowena Mason. And here is the agenda for the day. 11am: MPs start voting in the ballot for a new chair for the Commons Treasury committee. The result will be announced in the afternoon. 12pm: Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. After 12.30pm: Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, makes a statement to MPs about the need for an election in Northern Ireland. 3.15pm: Sunak meets Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, in Downing Street. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it.

In the meantime, here’s a roundup of the latest developments: Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. The comments came as Russia said it was willing to resume peace negotiations, Russia’s lead negotiator said Sunday, but the initiative to continue them is with Kyiv. Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky claimed in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”. Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire West. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region. Ukraine is set to top the agenda at the four-day World Economic Forum, which kicks off on Monday with a video address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This year Russia’s “house” at the event was transformed into a “Russian War Crimes House”, portraying images of misery and devastation. UK prime minister Boris Johnson spoke with Zelenskiy about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries. The Moscow-installed mayor of Enerhodar, a southern city of Ukraine and the location of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been wounded in an explosion. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Andrey Shevchik was in intensive care. A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years,” France’s Europe minister said. “We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying. It’s probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time,” Clément Beaune said. Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her. Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin’s military. YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”. Ukraine’s parliament on Sunday banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine but agreed to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes, Reuters reports. Yaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition member, announced the decision on the Telegram messaging app, saying 313 deputies had voted in favour in the 423-member Verkhovna Rada assembly. Zelenskiy had vetoed an earlier version of the bill and called for the two symbols to be allowed in displays in museums, libraries, scientific works, re-enactments, textbooks and similar instances. Neither of the two letters exists in the Russian alphabet. They have been widely used, particularly on Russian military vehicles and equipment, to promote the aims of the conflict. The new bill bans the creation of non-governmental organisations using Russian war symbols or undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty. The Ukrainian parliament on Sunday also extended for another 90 days, or until 23 August, the period of martial law in the country. Hello, this is Helen Livingstone taking over the blog from my colleague Vivian Ho. Ukrainian-Polish relations are “finally on a completely clean, sincere basis, without any quarrels and old conflict heritage,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest nightly address after welcoming Polish president Andrzej Duda to Kyiv. In recognition of a law in Poland that gives Ukrainians the same opportunities as Poles, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was preparing a similar bill in Ukraine for Poles. Let it be so that the citizens of Poland will never have to use such a law. But let us show our gratitude and our respect. And I also want it to be part of our new neighborhood policy. We must resolve disputes and remove the pressure of the past from our current relations with all Ukraine’s neighbors who respect us and are not occupiers of our state. He also said a new decision to introduce joint customs controls with Poland was “revolutionising” the countries’ border and was a step towards Ukraine’s entry into the European Union. This will significantly speed up border procedures. It will remove most of the corruption risks. But it is also the beginning of our integration into the common customs space of the European Union. That is a truly historical process. He also said he had spoken to UK prime minister Boris Johnson to discuss ways of increasing exports, especially agricultural products, and increasing fuel imports to Ukraine. It is 1:30am in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that with the fighting in the eastern region, Ukraine may lose up to 100 soldiers a day. A Russian attack on Malyn, a city in the Zhytomyr oblast, has killed at least one person, according to the governor of the oblast. After Manchester City won the Premier League title, Ukrainian player Oleksandr Zinchenko wrapped the Ukrainian flag around the trophy in an emotional scene. Russia is willing to resume peace negotiations, Russia’s lead negotiator said Sunday, but the initiative to continue them is with Kyiv. Boris Johnson, prime minister of the UK, spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. At this year’s World Economic Forum, Ukrainian artists have dressed up the space that would have been the Russia house showcasing Russian business leaders and investors as on the main street of Davos in Switzerland as instead a Russian War Crimes House. In the settlement of Staryi Krym outside Mariupol, the dirt lays fresh on far too many newly made graves. Typically at the World Economic Forum, Russia would have its own house to showcase its business leaders and investors. This year, Reuters is reporting that Ukrainian artists have dressed up the space on the main street of Davos in Switzerland as a Russian War Crimes House. “This is a place where all influencers and all decision-makers of the world come together,” the artistic director of Kyiv’s PinchukArtCentre, Bjorn Geldhof, told Reuters TV. “What is happening in Ukraine will define tomorrow.” Boris Johnson, prime minister of the UK, spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port, Reuters is reporting. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries. Before the invasion in February, Ukraine was known as the bread basket of Europe, exporting 4.5m tonnes of agricultural produce a month through its ports – 12% of global wheat supply, 15% of corn and half of sunflower oil. Last week, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, accused Russia of “using food as a weapon” with its blockade of ports. In Kharkiv, some residents displaced by Russian shelling had been living underground for months in a metro station. Today, they had to leave – authorities plan to restart the subway system this week and are providing temporary housing for those made homeless in student dormitories. Some scenes from around Ukraine today: Russia is willing to resume peace negotiations, Russia’s lead negotiator said Sunday, but the initiative to continue them is with Kyiv. The Associated Press is reporting that Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky said in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”. “For our part, we are ready to continue the dialogue,” Medinsky said. “Freezing talks was entirely Ukraine’s initiative,” Medinsky said, adding that the “ball is completely in their court”. Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations have been held regularly both in person and via video link since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. In March, the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers met for inconclusive talks in Turkey, followed by a meeting of the delegations in Istanbul, which also failed to bring about concrete results. On Tuesday, Kyiv’s lead negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak said that talks with Moscow were “on hold”. After Manchester City won the Premier League title, Ukrainian player Oleksandr Zinchenko wrapped the Ukrainian flag around the trophy and got emotional: A Russian attack on Malyn, a city in the Zhytomyr oblast, has killed at least one person, according to the governor of the oblast. Tymofiy Seidov, 8, was the last child left behind in Kutuzivka, a ruined village in north-eastern Ukraine. For 87 days, he lived with 23 others in the almost pitch black 40-by-five-meter basement below the ruins of two-story kindergarten and medical center. When a benefactor read about his family’s plight in the Guardian this week, he got the chance to leave the bomb shelter for the first time in three months and escape to safety. Instead of relief to finally to see the sky once again, however, Tymofiy responded with fear. “He kept telling me, ‘Mum, let’s go back inside, Mum, let’s hide, Mum, let’s not be out in the open,’” said his mother, Rita Sotnikova. Read more here: The Moscow-installed mayor of Enerhodar, a southern city of Ukraine and the location of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, was wounded in an explosion Sunday, AFP is reporting. Andrey Shevchik was appointed mayor of Enerhodar after Russian troops took control of the city and the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. “We have accurate confirmation that during the explosion the self-proclaimed head of the ‘people’s administration’ Shevchik and his bodyguards were injured,” Dmytro Orlov, the elected mayor of Enerhodar, said on Telegram. Orlov said that they were in hospital “with injuries of varying severity”, but nobody else was injured in the blast. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Shevchik was in intensive care. Ukraine may lose up to 100 soldiers a day fighting in the eastern region, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Sunday. In a bit of lighter news, the National Opera of Ukraine raised its curtain in Kyiv for the first time since Russian forces invaded in February. An update on an earlier story that a Russian who was appointed head of an occupied Ukrainian town was injured in an explosion on Sunday (see 15:17) Andrei Shevchik, named mayor of Enerhodar by Russian after its invasion and subsequent occupation, was in intensive care after the blast according to Russia’s RIA news agency. Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of the town recognised by Ukraine said on Sunday night that Shevchik had been taken to the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol to recover, and that he would be temporarily replaced as leader of the town. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo has been speaking to the lawyer who is representing the Russian soldier in court after being charged with committing war crimes. Defending a Russian soldier accused of a war crime in Ukraine is no easy task, which is why some people have described Viktor Ovsyannikov as “the devil’s advocate”. But the 43-year-old Ukrainian is unrepentant. “First of all, I am defending a person, not a crime,” Ovsyannikov said on Sunday on the eve of the verdict in the trial of 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shysimarin, who has already pleaded guilty to killing an an unarmed civilian in late February. “I’m trying to prove that my defendant’s actions were misqualified. It’s up to judges to decide. I just do my job.” “My family, friends and colleagues support me,” Ovsyannikov added. “They know someone has to do it. But there are other people who ‘invited’ me to go to Moscow or Donbas [the area in eastern Ukraine claimed by Russia-backed separatists.” A sea of flags mark graves of dead soldiers at a Kharkiv cemetery. The graveyard in Bezliudivka, on the outskirts of Ukraine’s second city has had a military section for several years. However, it has been burying soldiers since the invasion began in February. More were laid to rest on Saturday, according to Agence France Presse. Flags have been planted, one for each grave. Two coffins placed on trestles belonged to soldiers who were killed in Vilkhivka, to the east of Kharkiv. Their dates of death were given as 11 May, but the likelihood is that this was when their bodies were found. “They were found with five other bodies that we couldn’t identify,” said one soldier, who spoke on condition he was not identified. “We suspect they were executed,” he added. “They were killed by bullets to the back of the head.” The conflict in Ukraine is making its mark at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Normally Russia would have a presence, but this year a space on the main street in the town in Switzerland has been turned into a Russian War Crimes House by Ukrainian artists, Reuters reports. It depicts images of misery and devastation caused by the Russian invasion, which began in February. Russia denies allegations of war crimes. The conflict is the top of the agenda for the four-day meeting of global business leaders, which will begin on Monday with a video address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Russian institutions are absent, as well as its politicians, executives and academics. Parties once hosted by state banks, private companies and its sovereign wealth fund are nowhere to be seen. A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years,” France’s Europe minister said on Sunday. Clément Beaune told Radio J: We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying. It’s probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time. Beaune reiterated an offer by French president Emmanuel Macron to create a looser “European political community” that could help integrate Ukraine with the bloc sooner, as reported by AFP. However, that offer has received a cold welcome from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who on Saturday denounced “such compromises” and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. A Russian-appointed mayor of a Ukrainian occupied town was injured in an explosion on Sunday. Andrei Shevchik was appointed mayor of Enerhodar following the Russian army’s occupation of the town, Reuters reported. Shevchuk is in intensive care following the attack, according to a report from Russia’s RIA news agency, citing a source in the emergency services. Dmytro Orlov, who Ukraine recognises as mayor of the town said in a post on the Telegram messaging app: We have accurate confirmation that during the explosion the self-proclaimed head of the ‘people’s administration’ Shevchik and his bodyguards were injured. Enerhodar has a population of more than 50,000 and many of the residents work at the two power plants located next to the town, one of which is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe. YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”. The platform is hugely popular in Russia, where, unlike some of its US peers, it has not been shut down despite hosting content from opposition figures such as Alexei Navalny. YouTube has also been able to operate in Russia despite cracking down on pro-Kremlin content that has broken guidelines including its major violent events policy, which prohibits denying or trivialising the invasion. Since the conflict began in February, YouTube has taken down channels including that of the pro-Kremlin journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Channels associated with Russia’s ministries of defence and foreign affairs have also been temporarily suspended from uploading videos in recent months for describing the war as a “liberation mission”. Read more: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has extended the country’s martial law for three months through to 22 August 22. Zelenskiy first signed the decree along with a general military mobilisation call on 24 February when Russian forces invaded. Ukraine’s parliament on Sunday voted by an absolute majority for the third extension of the decree as Russia pursues its offensive targeting the eastern Donbas region, reports AFP. Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her. My colleague Isobel Koshiw is reporting from Zhytomyr region, which shares a border with Belarus. She reports: Ukrainian forces have built a new line of defences along the country’s previously unfortified northern border with Belarus amid signs of another attack. Russian forces invaded Ukraine through the Belarusian border in February when they tried to capture the capital, Kyiv. On 10 May, Belarus’s army chief, Viktor Gulevich, announced the deployment of Belarusian special forces and equipment in response to what he described as a “southern threat” from Ukraine and Nato. Belarus has been conducting military drills on its border with Ukraine since early May. The Belarusian president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, has been Russia’s closest ally in its war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Lukashenko urged the Russian-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, which met in Moscow, to remain united on Ukraine and accused the west of prolonging the conflict. Read more: The Polish president Andrzej Duda has been filmed in Kyiv alongside Zelenskiy. Duda delivered a speech to Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada on Sunday. He said: “I will not rest until Ukraine becomes a member of the European Union.” Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists, all with vast experience in making and delivering the crude explosive, have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin’s military. Their arrival is understood to be one factor behind US and European warnings that the Russian military may have been preparing for the use of chemical weapons in the conflict, which has entered its fourth month with little sign of slowing. Read more here: Here is everything you might have missed: Russian airstrikes hit Ukrainian forces in the Mykolaiv and Donbas regions, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesperson for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas, Reuters reported. In Ukraine’s southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, about 100km north-east of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. Ukraine’s Severodonetsk is one of Russia’s ‘immediate tactical priorities’, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said on Sunday. The city of Severodonetsk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities” as its forces deploy terminator tanks to the area, the MoD has said. The latest intelligence report, released at 7am BST, said: “Russia’s only operational company of BMP-T Terminator tank support vehicles has likely been deployed to the Severodonetsk axis of the Donbas offensive. Their presence suggests that the Central Grouping of Forces (CGF) is involved in this attack, which is the only formation fielding this vehicle. CGF previously suffered heavy losses while failing to break through to eastern Kyiv in the first phase of the invasion.Russia developed Terminator after identifying the need to provide dedicated protection to main battle tanks it used during the Afghan and Chechen wars.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of blocking export of 22m tonnes of food. The Ukrainian president also said that an energy crisis would swiftly follow a food crisis if Ukraine was not given help to unlock its ports. The city of Severodonetsk has been attacked from ‘four separate directions’, says region’s governor. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city, despite targeting it from four different directions. Only Ukraine has the right to decide its future, the Polish president told lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday. Andrzej Duda said:”Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands. Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future … nothing about you without you. Duda became the first foreign leader to give a speech in person to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia’s invasion. Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion. Gasum, Finland’s state-owned energy company, said it would use other sources, such as the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to fellow EU member Estonia. Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia. Speaking on Saturday, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that “discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place … under what format I don’t know … but the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table.” However, Kyiv has ruled out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Russia that involved ceding territory. “Any concession to Russia is not a path to peace, but a war postponed for several years. Ukraine trades neither its sovereignty, nor territories and Ukrainians living on them,” he said in a video posted to Twitter on Saturday. Making concessions would backfire on Ukraine because Russia would hit back harder after any break in fighting, he added. “The war will not stop [after concessions]. It will just be put on pause for some time. They’ll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.” Russia claims to have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol. The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steelworks have surrendered, Russia’s defence ministry said late on Friday, marking an end to the three-month siege of the defenders’ last stronghold in Mariupol. “Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that in total 2,439 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered. Moscow is considering giving up Ukraine fighters captured in Mariupol for Viktor Medvedchuk, a detained ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin. “We are going to study the possibility,” said Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia’s negotiating team on Ukraine, speaking from the separatist city of Donetsk in south-eastern Ukraine, Russian state media agency RIA Novosti reported. Zelenskiy described the situation in Donbas as “extremely difficult” in his latest national address, adding that the Russian army is trying to attack Slovyansk and Severodonetsk, a frontline city now at risk of encirclement where 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said. Germany’s reliance on Russian gas is providing a backdrop for chancellor Olaf Scholz’s first trip to Africa. He is embarking on a three-day tour of Senegal, Niger and South Africa kicking off on Sunday. The first stop on Scholz’s trip is Senegal, which has billions of cubic metres of gas reserves and is expected to become a major gas producer in the region. Germany is seeking to reduce its heavy reliance on Russia for gas following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. It could help explore a gas field in Senegal, a government official said on Friday. The source told Reuters that Scholz also wanted to discuss possible cooperation on the development of renewable energy. In Senegal, he will visit a solar power plant after meeting and holding a joint news conference with the country’s President Macky Sall. Germany has invited both Senegal, which holds the rotating chairmanship of the African Union, and South Africa to attend the G7 summit it is hosting in June as guest countries.

It is a 10-minute drive from Serhi Belyaev’s house in the village of Tsyrkuny to his fiancee’s home in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. A quick spin west on Soborna Street, over the E40 motorway on to the Lesia Serduika highway, and you are there. That was, until the war came. It took just hours for Russian forces to sweep into Belyaev’s village on 24 February, as they advanced on Kharkiv, the closest major Ukrainian city to the Russian border. Lives across Ukraine were changed that morning. For Belyaev, the frontline of the largest conflict in Europe since the second world war now lay between him and both his girlfriend, Nataliy Drozd, 28, and his parents. No longer the familiar road into town, Lesia Serduika was now an impassable no man’s land. Belyaev was cut off, worried for his sick mother, Galina, 66, and determined to be with his terrified girlfriend. Then Belyaev, 32, a professional poker player, had an idea. A gamble. He mused on it, initially rejected it and then settled on it. He would replace the 10km drive with a 3,700km odyssey. Read the rest of this incredible story by Daniel Boffey below: The latest updated map from the Ministry of Defence on the situation in Ukraine: Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesperson for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas, Reuters reported. In Ukraine’s southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, about 100km north-east of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. He added: Rockets and artillery hit 583 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment amassed, 41 control points, 76 artillery and mortar units in firing positions, including three Grad batteries, as well as a Bukovel Ukrainian electronic warfare station near the settlement of Hannivka, Mykolaiv region. The Ukrainian president also said that an energy crisis would swiftly follow a food crisis if Ukraine was not given help to unlock its ports. After a meeting with Portuguese prime minister António Costa on Saturday, he told the media: The world community must help Ukraine unblock seaports, otherwise the energy crisis will be followed by a food crisis and many more countries will face it. Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food – our grain, barley, sunflower and more. A lot of things. There will be a crisis in the world. The second crisis after the energy one, which was provoked by Russia. Now it will create a food crisis if we do not unblock the routes for Ukraine, do not help the countries of Africa, Europe, Asia, which need these food products. He added that one way to unblock the ports would be via a military solution that would involve procuring further weapons from allies. Why do Finland and Sweden want to join Nato? Severodonetsk has been attacked from ‘four separate directions’, says region’s governor. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city, despite targeting it from four different directions. On the Telegram messaging app, he said: The Russians tried to enter Sievierodonetsk from 4 directions at once, but they were repelled and retreated to their earlier positions. However, they continued to shell residential neighbourhoods with mortars and artillery. Almost every Ukrainian-controlled town and village sustained damage. On Friday, Haidai said that a school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region. Neither of these accounts could be independently verified. The city of Severodonetsk was earlier on Saturday morning described as one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities”, the UK Ministry of Defence said. Gazprom halts gas exports to Finland Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, said it has halted gas exports to Finland. The country refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas-consuming companies in the country have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows, Reuters reported. Most European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars. Last month, Moscow cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland after they refused to comply with the new terms. Mariupol facing health and sanitation ‘catastrophe’, says mayor The Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol Vadim Boychenko said on Saturday that mass burials in shallow pits across the city and the breakdown of sewage systems could prompt a health crisis. He added that summer rains threaten to contaminate water sources as he pressed Russian forces to allow residents to safely leave the city. In addition to the humanitarian catastrophe created by the (Russian) occupiers and collaborators, the city is on the verge of an outbreak of infectious diseases, he said on the messaging app Telegram. International sanctions have ‘practically broken all’ logistics corridors for trade, Russian transport minister says. Transport minister Vitaly Savelyev said on Saturday that the raft of sanctions imposed by western countries on Russia is causing serious logistical problems in the country. According to state news agency Tass, Savalyev said: The sanctions that have been imposed on the Russian Federation today have practically broken all logistics [corridors] in our country. And we are forced to look for new logistics corridors together. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Joe Middleton and now taking over from Samantha Lock to bring you the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The city of Severodonetsk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities” as its forces deploy terminator tanks to the area, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The latest intelligence report, released at 7am BST, reads: Russia’s only operational company of BMP-T Terminator tank support vehicles has likely been deployed to the Severodonetsk axis of the Donbas offensive. Their presence suggests that the Central Grouping of Forces (CGF) is involved in this attack, which is the only formation fielding this vehicle. CGF previously suffered heavy losses while failing to break through to eastern Kyiv in the first phase of the invasion. Russia developed Terminator after identifying the need to provide dedicated protection to main battle tanks it used during the Afghan and Chechen wars. The Severodonetsk area remains one of Russia’s immediate tactical priorities. However, with a maximum of 10 Terminators deployed they are unlikely to have a significant impact on the campaign.” Russia on Saturday released a list of 963 Americans it said were banned from entering the country, including US president Joe Biden. The lifetime bans imposed on the Americans, including secretary of state Antony Blinken, US senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, defence secretary Lloyd Austin and CIA head William Burns, are largely symbolic. They came on the same day Biden signed a support package providing nearly $40bn (£32bn) in aid for Ukraine. You can peruse the full list here. Russia has intensified its offensive in the Donbas while its forces advance on the Luhansk front. Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy described the situation in Donbas as “extremely difficult” in his latest national address. The regional governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region, Sergiy Gaiday, said Russia is trying to destroy the city of Severodonetsk, with fighting taking place on the outskirts of the city. The frontline city is now at risk of encirclement after 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, Gaiday added. “Shelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night,” he said in a video post on the Telegram messaging app. Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, the city on the other side of the Siverskiy Donets River, form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv. In the neighbouring Donetsk region, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram on Saturday that seven civilians had been killed and 10 wounded. Further north in Kharkiv, just 50km from the border with Russia, new networks of trenches and checkpoints have cropped up as the city prepares to defend against a fresh assault, according to a Reuters report. Polish president Andrzej Duda is set to deliver a speech to Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada on Sunday, a gesture that will make him the first head of a foreign state to do so since the start of Russia’s invasion. Duda arrived in Kyiv on Saturday and “will deliver the address as the first head of a foreign state since the outbreak of the war”, his office said. Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia, while ruling out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said during an interview with the United News telethon on Saturday that “discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place”. I really thought that the war could end with dialogue. But, unfortunately, I thought that this was a dialogue with the appropriate timing, that it would be possible to find answers to many questions and many decisions with the Russian side. I really thought so. And now it is a hybrid. That is why the war is so difficult. And the victory will be very difficult. It will be bloody, it will be in battle, but the end will definitely be in diplomacy. We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table. We want the territories back and this war to be over. But how and when it will happen depends on the time when the conversation with Putin will take place. I think that the conversation between Ukraine and Russia will definitely take place. But we don’t know in what format: with or without intermediaries, in a wide circle or in the format of bilateral conversation.” Zelenskiy’s senior adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Russia that involved ceding territory. He said making concessions would backfire on Ukraine because Russia would hit back harder after any break in fighting. Any concession to Russia is not a path to peace, but a war postponed for several years. Ukraine trades neither its sovereignty, nor territories and Ukrainians living on them.” The war will not stop [after concessions]. It will just be put on pause for some time … They’ll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while before my colleagues in London take the reins a little later. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has suggested he is willing to resume talks with Russia, though his senior advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, clarified that Kyiv will not accept any deal with Russia that involves ceding territory. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia. Speaking on Saturday, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that “discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place … under what format I don’t know … but the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table.” However, Kyiv has ruled out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Russia that involved ceding territory. “Any concession to Russia is not a path to peace, but a war postponed for several years. Ukraine trades neither its sovereignty, nor territories and Ukrainians living on them,” he said in a video posted to Twitter on Saturday. Making concessions would backfire on Ukraine because Russia would hit back harder after any break in fighting, he added. “The war will not stop [after concessions]. It will just be put on pause for some time. They’ll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.” Russia claims to have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol. The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steelworks have surrendered, Russia’s defence ministry said late on Friday, marking an end to the three-month siege of the defenders’ last stronghold in Mariupol. “Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that in total 2,439 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered. Moscow is considering giving up Ukraine fighters captured in Mariupol for Viktor Medvedchuk, a detained ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin. “We are going to study the possibility,” said Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia’s negotiating team on Ukraine, speaking from the separatist city of Donetsk in south-eastern Ukraine, Russian state media agency RIA Novosti reported. Zelenskiy described the situation in Donbas as “extremely difficult” in his latest national address, adding that the Russian army is trying to attack Slovyansk and Severodonetsk, a frontline city now at risk of encirclement where 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said. Polish president Andrzej Duda has arrived in Ukraine to address the Ukrainian parliament. Duda arrived in Ukraine on Saturday and will be the first head of a foreign state to deliver a speech to Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada since the start of Russia’s invasion. Russia banned 963 Americans, including president Joe Biden, from entering the country. The list, which also includes the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, US senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, defence secretary Lloyd Austin and CIA head William Burns, is largely symbolic. Biden signed a funding bill that will provide nearly $40bn (£32bn) in aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy met Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, and described the meeting as “important and meaningful”. Portugal later announced an agreement to provide €250m ($264m) in financial aid to Ukraine. The Ukraine president also had a phone conversation with Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, and said he stressed the importance of more sanctions on Russia and unblocking Ukrainian ports. Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base near Odesa, Ukraine’s main Black Sea port, as well as a significant cache of western-supplied weapons in northern Zhytomyr region, Russia defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said on Saturday. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side. Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan, who has objected to Sweden and Finland joining Nato, held phone calls with the leaders of the two countries on Saturday and discussed his concerns about terrorist organisations. Turkey surprised its Nato allies last week by objecting to the two countries’ accession to the military alliance, but western leaders have expressed confidence that Ankara’s objections will not be a roadblock for the membership process. Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion. Gasum, Finland’s state-owned energy company, said it would use other sources, such as the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to fellow EU member Estonia. Canada has imposed sanctions on the Russian-born billionaire and newspaper proprietor Alexander Lebedev. The former KGB agent is the owner of UK newspapers the Evening Standard and the Independent. The world must help Ukraine unblock seaports, otherwise the energy crisis will be followed by a global food crisis, Zelenskiy said. “Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food … There will be a crisis in the world. The second crisis after the energy one, which was provoked by Russia. Now it will create a food crisis.” According to A second meeting of partner countries is set to take place on 23 May at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base. Zelenskiy said he expects Ukraine will be provided with more weapons. “To be honest, we have high expectations. I would call it a long-awaited process. We are grateful for the great military support provided by various states. We expect a positive result on the supply of MLRS,” he said.

His 45-minute address mercilessly lampooned political opponents while claiming his own chaotic rule left the country facing not multiple crises but a historic opportunity to make the “big generational changes shirked by previous governments”. The party faithful lapped it up. But for all Mr Johnson’s tall claims, the rhetoric of “levelling up” Britain remains a political attitude rather than a policy prescription. The only proposal that came out of the slogan was a smaller version of a previously scrapped policy on school funding. A decade of austerity under Tory governments and a disastrous, hard Brexit have been a bad deal for this country. The prime minister’s humorous speech offered little more than pledges of a better tomorrow. In demonstrating his own star power he reminded voters that he has no plan to deal with the country’s many problems beyond lower migration. Mr Johnson did offer a masterclass in how to appear radical while sounding like a voice from the past. At one moment he was speaking up for old-fashioned sovereignty, the next auditioning the UK for the role of an Indo-Pacific nuclear power. He wanted Latin in schools and gigabit broadband in homes. His government’s hardline immigration policies were, he said, generous to those fleeing Chinese rule from Hong Kong. Mr Johnson went out of his way to praise bankers, drug companies and tech entrepreneurs after a week of ministers bashing business. This was a speech meant to cut off his opponents’ attack lines. Mr Johnson’s calculation was that millions of voters had too great an emotional investment in the Brexit Britain he delivered to abandon the cause. Too often, his account of past events has little regard for the truth. His claim of a successful “Kabul airlift” is a case in point. And for all Mr Johnson’s tough talk on rape convictions, he won’t commit to meeting government targets set three months ago. His speech, shamefully, was another attempt to rig the record on Covid, despite clear evidence the government failed to take timely action to prevent this country’s needlessly high death toll. The prime minister claimed a vote to leave the EU was one to deliver “a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity, low-tax economy” by “taking the pressure off parts of the overheating south-east while offering hope and opportunity” to left-behind areas. This won’t happen under the economic orthodoxy that he has submitted to. Mr Johnson made a virtue of raising taxes to pay to fix the backlogs in the NHS, yet failed to acknowledge that it would have been fairer to target assets rather than income. He made the economically illiterate argument that “more borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later”. During the pandemic, fiscal deficits went up to record levels and interest rates were cut to record lows. Rather than offer proposals to deal with sharply rising costs of energy, fuel and food, Mr Johnson has chosen to make things worse by cutting universal credit for 6 million families by more than £1,000 a year. Whether it is Mr Johnson’s actions or words that voters judge him on depends in part on the timing of the next election. His strength is that he sells himself as the candidate of “hope”. He has no deficit of optimism but suffers from a lack of substance. Mr Johnson talked of “taking the tough decisions” to hit net zero targets but did not spell out how he will achieve that. Without policies, his vision remains an empty one. For Britain’s sake, the prime minister cannot just preach change; he needs to show what he would do to achieve it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/jun/09/mice-floods-and-the-climate-crisis-why-your-insurance-wont-cover-society-wide-catastrophes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T03:27:13Z","webTitle":"Mice, floods and the climate crisis: why your insurance won’t cover society-wide catastrophes | Richard Denniss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/09/mice-floods-and-the-climate-crisis-why-your-insurance-wont-cover-society-wide-catastrophes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/09/mice-floods-and-the-climate-crisis-why-your-insurance-wont-cover-society-wide-catastrophes","fields":{"headline":"Mice, floods and the climate crisis: why your insurance won’t cover society-wide catastrophes","bodyText":"No matter how much you pay for your home or car insurance, if your property is damaged by mouse plague, nuclear radiation, war or rising sea levels you are almost certainly on your own. If you’re lucky, your insurance might cover you against storms but maybe not against floods (you know the difference, right?). Likewise, your insurance almost certainly doesn’t cover you against storm surges or a dam bursting. Australians spend more than $10bn for non-life insurance products each year, even though there’s only a one in 500 chance your house will catch fire. That’s why there’s so much profit to be made in insurance. If a forecaster says something’s likely to happen, then it’s highly unlikely you’ll be able to get insurance against it. Insurance is like a lottery in reverse; lots of people lose a little bit of money paying for premiums they don’t claim against, a few people get a fair bit of money, and the insurer makes a lot of money for handing one group of people’s money to the other. As with gambling, the house always wins. Which brings me back to mice, nuclear power stations and climate change. There is a plague of mice rampaging from Queensland through northern New South Wales. Some farmers and small business owners have lost their entire income. So far the cost is estimated to be about $1bn but unless the mice eat through your wiring and burn your house down, insurance almost certainly won’t cover any losses. While insurance companies make their profit out of our fear of an individual catastrophe, they would lose their entire business if they insured against society-wide catastrophe. We take it for granted that insurance companies will pay out if an accident hits our car or house but most people rarely think about what will happen if catastrophe hits us all at once. Which is why the small print on insurance premiums is so small. The Fukushima nuclear disaster is likely to cost the Japanese government more than $500bn in damages and compensation simply because no private company would build a nuclear plant if it were liable for those costs, and no private insurance company would ever take on such a large risk. If there was an accident at Lucas Heights in Sydney, people would need to rely on government support as their insurance explicitly doesn’t cover the costs. For the same reasons, a growing number of insurers are reluctant to insure Australians living in the tropics against storm damage. Just as no bookmaker will take a $10bn bet on the flip of a coin, no insurance company will take a bet that nuclear power stations won’t have accidents or that sea levels aren’t going to rise in the next 50 years. While you can still get cyclone insurance in northern Australia, the prices are rising rapidly as global temperatures rise and tropical cyclone intensity increases. In response, the Morrison government announced a $10bn “reinsurance pool” to help lower insurance premiums for northern Australians. But not even the insurance industry thinks that will work. According to the chief executive of Suncorp, Steve Johnston, “disaster mitigation, rather than disaster clean-up, is where Australia should focus. It is a sad fact that 97 cents of every dollar of disaster funding goes to recovery and rebuild. The remaining 3 cents spent on preparation and mitigation is but a small drop in a rapidly filling bucket.” While we could force insurance companies to cover all Australians for the risks of mice, nuclear accidents and tropical cyclones, that wouldn’t make the risks go away, it would just redistribute the cost. Just as forcing insurance companies to provide insurance to young people with powerful cars and poor driving records would inevitably drive up the cost of everybody else’s insurance, so too would requiring insurance companies to offer insurance to those who face the almost inevitable costs of climate change. Just as the best form of health insurance is a healthy diet and regular exercise, the best way to keep insurance premiums down is to prevent climate change and the disasters it causes. If we want to subsidise the cost of insurance for vulnerable groups, we can choose to do that but, if we take that route, it makes sense to not just ask who should benefit, but who should pay. According to Australia Institute research 65% of Australians support a levy on fossil fuel exports to help pay for climate disasters (only 21% are opposed). Such a levy wouldn’t directly help with the costs of a mouse plague, but it would mean governments could provide a lot more help to the latest victims if they wanted to. • Richard Denniss is chief economist at the independent thinktank the Australia Institute"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2021/dec/17/from-tempestuous-child-to-little-rocket-man-10-years-of-kim-jong-un","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-17T00:29:14Z","webTitle":"From ‘tempestuous’ child to little rocket man: 10 years of Kim Jong-un","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/from-tempestuous-child-to-little-rocket-man-10-years-of-kim-jong-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/17/from-tempestuous-child-to-little-rocket-man-10-years-of-kim-jong-un","fields":{"headline":"From ‘tempestuous’ child to little rocket man: 10 years of Kim Jong-un","bodyText":"It was not, perhaps, the image Kim Jong-un would have wanted to project in his first public appearance as the latest authoritarian leader of North Korea in 2011. As wailing citizens exhibited their grief along the snowbound streets of Pyongyang, Kim, then only in his late 20s, cut a forlorn figure. Dressed in a long black coat, Kim walked with grim purpose alongside the hearse carrying his father, Kim Jong-il, one hand resting on the bonnet of the 1970s Lincoln Continental, the other executing an awkward salute. He was later seen crying and drying his eyes at the burial service, in footage broadcast on state television. The younger Kim’s sudden ascent to lead an unpredictable, nuclear-armed nation on 17 December 2011 offered little indication of how – and for how long – he would rule the secretive state. Some observers predicted an early political demise for a young man who had yet to earn the loyalty of the inner circle of the ruling Korean Workers’ party and the generals of the country’s million-strong army. The state machinery, observers predicted, would use the succession to exploit Kim’s inexperience, plunging the country and the world into unprecedented uncertainty. Just two days into Kim’s leadership, Victor Cha, the former White House Asian affairs director, wrote: “Whether it comes apart in the next few weeks or over several months, the regime will not be able to hold together after the untimely death of its leader, Kim Jong-il.” Others, more in hope than expectation, predicted a new style of leadership under the “cosmopolitan” Kim Jong-un, who had been educated at an exclusive Swiss boarding school and professed a love for NBA basketball. In the best-case scenario, its new, free-spirited leader would address the regime’s nuclear ambitions and appalling human rights record. Now, as he embarks on a second decade in power, Kim leads a country assailed by international sanctions, natural disasters and the unprecedented challenges posed by Covid-19. A year that began with him being named general secretary of the Workers’ party – his late father’s title – has ended with fears over food shortages, the pandemic and the economy, with a return to nuclear talks only a distant possibility. In October 2020, Kim offered an extraordinary public apology to the people of North Korea, tearfully acknowledging that he had failed to guide the country through difficult times. Faced with food shortages and more economic pain caused by the Covid-enforced closure of the border with China, he called on his people to embark on another “arduous march”, appearing to compare the situation to a 1990s famine during which hundreds of thousands of people died. And yet, predictions that his regime is in danger of collapse are as hopelessly wide of the mark now as they were a decade ago. A ruthless leader-in-waiting Thirteen days after the death of Kim Jong-il, his youngest son was formally declared supreme commander of the Korean People’s army, a year after he had been briefly introduced at a military parade. That appearance confirmed that the then 26-year-old was preferred ahead of his older half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, who had fallen out of favour in 2001 after an embarrassing encounter with Japanese immigration officials. “It was a mistake for some people to assume that he would be a reformer,” says Duyeon Kim, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “Being educated in the west does not automatically mean one will subscribe to democratic values. At the end of the day, it’s all about ensuring the Kim dynasty lasts forever, so it is only natural that Kim will do anything to maintain a firm grip on absolute power. “Kim has maintained his grip on power through a combination of the regime apparatus, keeping the elites happy who help sustain a Kim family leadership system, and employing brutal practices to enforce loyalty and eliminate threats.” Addressing the first major party congress in decades, Kim in 2016 outlined his byongjin policy – a vision of a North Korea that married economic development with acquiring status as a genuine nuclear power. He also revealed a “tempestuous” side that, according to Kim Jong-il’s former sushi chef, had marked him out as a leader-in-waiting when he was still a child. In 2013, he ordered the execution of his own uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the once-powerful adviser who had walked immediately behind him as they mourned three years earlier. Jang would be just one of dozens of officials purged or executed by Kim, whose determination to tighten his grip on power had made him deeply distrustful of many of those around him, including his own family. Sixteen years after his unsuccessful attempt to visit Tokyo Disneyland, Kim Jong-nam was waiting to check in at Kuala Lumpur airport when two women – groomed by North Korean agents – smeared an oily substance on his face that turned out to be the nerve agent VX, one of the most deadly chemical weapons in the world. Twenty minutes later, he was dead. Few believe the assassination could have happened without the approval of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam and Jang Song-thaek were not the regime’s only high-profile victims. In 2017, the world reacted in horror after the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who had been detained in North Korea, reportedly after attempting to steal a poster as a memento of his visit. Although details of his death remain murky, we do know that the 22-year-old university student was medically evacuated from North Korea on 13 June that year and flown to the US, where he died on 19 June. North Korea’s 24 million people have also suffered under Kim, whose human rights abuses include the torture, humiliation and sexual assault of criminal suspects and the use of a network of gulags for the politically “impure”. Many of the defectors who have made it to the South during Kim’s time in power said they had been motivated by worsening poverty and malnutrition. The regime’s response – according to high-profile defectors, including Thae Yong-ho, a senior diplomat at the North Korean embassy in London – was to resort to executions and killings as a form of “terrorism” to crush dissent. The Seoul-based human rights organisation the Transitional Justice Working Group said it had identified hundreds of sites where witnesses say North Korea carried out public executions and extrajudicial state killings as part of an arbitrary and aggressive use of the death penalty designed to intimidate its citizens. Meeting Trump the ‘dotard’ At the end of 2016 the world held its breath with the election of a US president every bit as idiosyncratic as his North Korean nemesis. Fears grew that tensions fomented during the Obama administration could spill over into a military conflict as Donald Trump spent the first months of his presidency trading insults with the “little rocket man” in Pyongyang, who responded in kind with public denunciations of the “dotard” in the White House. Having exhausted their arsenal of insults, the two men embarked on an unprecedented round of nuclear summitry, in Singapore in 2018 and Hanoi in 2019, as well as a historic meeting at the demilitarised zone, the heavily fortified border that dissects the Korean peninsula. Kim had embarked on a furious round of diplomacy that included three summits with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, six meetings with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and one with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The Singapore summit marked Kim’s debut as a statesman and ended with a loose agreement to “denuclearise” the Korean peninsula. The Hanoi summit, however, ended in ignominy after the two leaders failed to agree on how North Korea would be rewarded for dismantling its nuclear weapons. To date, Kim has not abandoned a single nuclear weapon, and only this month, satellite imagery showed the regime continuing to produce nuclear-grade plutonium at its main Yongbyon plant. At around the same time, Kim was in a strong enough position to begin crafting the North Korean state in his own image, albeit one that stylistically borrowed heavily from his grandfather, from his dark Mao suits and short-back-and sides to his visible weight gain. He has since stepped out of the shadow of his predecessors, using a constitutional revision in 2019 to expunge all mention of his father’s songun “military-first” policy. South Korean media reported this month that portraits of former leaders have been removed from meeting rooms, while officials now use the term “Kim Jong-un-ism” to underline the break with the ideologies of his predecessors. “Kim has manipulated the strategic levers of power to survive and thrive,” says Patrick Cronin, chair for Asia-Pacific security at the Hudson Institute in Washington. “He revived party power and discipline, co-opted elites, opened more markets, developed strategic arms, and balanced outsider powers.” Kim’s greatest test Much of what the outside world knows about North Korea comes from satellite imagery, brave citizen journalists equipped with contraband mobile phones, recent defectors, South Korea’s spy agency, the North’s state-run media and, inevitably, a degree of guesswork and speculation. That applies as much to Kim’s health as it does to his nuclear weapons. Official photos offered watertight proof that he piled on the pounds in his first few years as leader and that his weight had caused him occasional discomfort. Prolonged absences from public life triggered speculation he was suffering a serious illness. A three-week absence in 2020 sparked rumours of heart surgery, with some reports suggesting he had died. A more plausible theory – that he had simply been isolating as a precaution during the pandemic – emerged after Kim reappeared, apparently in good health. More recent photos suggest the leader has been advised to make lifestyle changes and has subsequently lost enough weight to tighten the strap on his favourite $12,000 watch. Little is known about his diet or drinking habits – we know his father was fond of Hennessy cognac – but he has frequently been photographed with a cigarette in his hand. South Korean intelligence officials recently told MPs that an apparently healthy Kim had lost 20kg, and dismissed reports a body-double had been enlisted to make public appearances. In the 10 years since he shed tears beside his father’s corpse at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun mausoleum, Kim has turned North Korea into a nuclear power, withstood unprecedented economic pressure from the UN security council and cemented North Korea’s role as a constant source of geopolitical frustration for three US presidents and counting. His greatest test, though, could be largely home-grown, says the Hudson Institute’s Cronin. “The biggest unknown for Kim remains the true impact of Covid, which has stifled North Korean progress and may yet undermine the regime in ways not yet visible to the outside world,” he says. Some analysts expect Kim to mask pandemic and economic shortcomings by bolstering his reputation as a friend of the people, an image nurtured during photo opportunities with children and “ordinary” civilians, and public appearances with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, with whom he reportedly has three children aged between four and 11. While drawing heavily on traditional methods of quashing dissent, Kim’s public persona “is that of a loving supreme leader who cares most about his people’s welfare and putting on a human face by openly acknowledging policy failures and even crying to tug at his people’s heart strings, while trying to show the world that he is a normal leader of a normal state,” says Duyeon Kim. With UN security council sanctions still in place, warnings of more economic hardship and the prospect of an unvaccinated population facing another wave of Covid, North Korea’s situation is anything but normal. But having defied the odds for so long, the consensus is that Kim Jong-un is here to stay. As Cronin says: “More likely than not, North Korea will be celebrating 20 years of ‘glorious’ leadership under Kim.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/jul/07/no-business-need-at-all-now-for-a-chinese-nuclear-plant-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-07T18:37:54Z","webTitle":"No business need at all now for a Chinese nuclear plant in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/jul/07/no-business-need-at-all-now-for-a-chinese-nuclear-plant-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/jul/07/no-business-need-at-all-now-for-a-chinese-nuclear-plant-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"No business need at all now for a Chinese nuclear plant in the UK","bodyText":"Get ready for the “new Huawei” is the word from Westminster, meaning another flare-up in UK-China business and political relations, this time over Chinese involvement in the UK’s nuclear power programme. Ditching state-owned China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) would indeed be a political development on a political par with a Huawei exclusion. The 2016 agreement, which imagined CGN’s “progressive entry” into the UK’s “resurgent” nuclear ambitions, was given maximum hype at the time by both Beijing and David Cameron’s government. But here’s the good news: unlike with Huawei, where a ban would seriously disrupt 5G rollout in the UK, there are few direct downsides to excluding CGN. The UK does not need Chinese nuclear technology. The construction of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, where CGN is merely a 33% investor, could proceed without interruption. The plant is being built to French firm EDF’s European design, so the security risks ought to be minimal or nonexistent. The same applies at the proposed follow-on plant at Sizewell C, where CGN has the option to take a 20% stake in another EDF-dominated project. The major impact would be at Bradwell in Essex, the prize CGN was really seeking – the first Chinese-built nuclear plant outside China. But the Bradwell proposal is years away from being approved, and already looks surplus to need for the reasons the National Infrastructure Commission offered in its most recent long-term assessment: “Given the balance of cost and risk, a renewables-based system looks a safer bet at present than constructing multiple new nuclear power plants.” The NIC thought only one new big nuclear plant needed to be commissioned before 2025 – and that, presumably, will be Sizewell. Cancelling Bradwell would involve no real sacrifice on the part of the UK. In fact, the Cameron/Osborne nuclear vision has aged horribly in four years. The offshore wind revolution has accelerated and the industry’s costs now beat nuclear’s every time. If replacement nuclear capacity is still deemed essential for baseload purposes, the aim should be to build as few mega-plants as possible. Advances in battery storage technology should further tilt the economics in favour of renewables. While we wait, small modular reactors look a nimbler nuclear alternative. Rolls-Royce is in the development vanguard on that front, and carries no geopolitical headaches. In short, for purely business reasons, one would rip up that 2016 agreement in an instant. Boohoo needs a lesson in crisis management Online fashion retailing is a fast and furious place, as Boohoo should know; at the flick of a few switches, its clothes have been delisted from the websites of Next, Asos and Zalando. The industry’s response is impressively speedy – and far clearer than the confused messaging from Boohoo’s boardroom in response to allegations of illegal pay rates at a factory in Leicester producing its clothes. The factory may have been operated by an unauthorised subcontractor, as Boohoo said, but that’s not an excuse; it’s up to the retailer to control its supply chain. A temporary loss of sales on a few third-party websites may be tolerable, but Boohoo’s breezy image will suffer permanent damage if this saga drags on. Mahmud Kamani, founder and executive chairman of Boohoo, needs to get a grip. He should do what most observers are advising: appoint an outside auditor or lawyer to examine what went wrong. The failure to take that obvious step looks more perverse by the day. Does he also need Next &amp; co to give him lessons in how to manage a crisis? A share price within Reach? The news from Reach, as the owner of the Daily Mirror, Daily Express and Daily Star newspapers insists on calling itself, was predictably downbeat. The management plans to cut 550 jobs, equal to 12% of the workforce. Revenues from printed papers have plunged during lockdown. An increase in online readership has not been accompanied by a boost in online advertising revenues. For all that, the City still expects Reach to make pre-tax profits of about £100m this year, equating to 28p per share of earnings. At 76p, down 14% on Tuesday, the shares are therefore priced at slightly less than three times earnings. That’s a company where the City also expects to see net cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year. There’s a deficit in the pension fund, it should be said. But three times earnings is still a spectacularly gloomy assessment of long-term prospects. That’s not to say it’s wrong, of course."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2021/mar/08/fukushima-50-review-ken-watanabe-in-simmering-tribute-to-power-plant-heroes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-08T17:00:32Z","webTitle":"Fukushima 50 review – simmering tribute to power-plant heroes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/08/fukushima-50-review-ken-watanabe-in-simmering-tribute-to-power-plant-heroes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/mar/08/fukushima-50-review-ken-watanabe-in-simmering-tribute-to-power-plant-heroes","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima 50 review – simmering tribute to power-plant heroes","bodyText":"Dangerously high concentrations of politeness are observed in this dramatisation of the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Not only do most of the heroic “50” left behind to avert nuclear catastrophe constantly apologise for underperforming in acts of barely believable self-sacrifice, at one point a manager begs forgiveness for refusing to allow two employees to re-enter the radioactive zone after a failed first attempt. To the feckless western mind more likely to view Homer Simpson as the standard-issue nuclear power-plant employee, it’s a relief when – just for a second – a few Fukushima workers contemplate running away. It is possible director Setsurō Wakamatsu has taken the Hollywood route in portraying the staff as so infallibly courageous – though Fukushima 50 is adapted from journalist Ryusho Kadota’s book, which investigated the response to the earthquake and tsunami in more than 90 interviews. Possibly to avoid lawsuits from Tokyo Electric Power Company executives portrayed here as selfish and shamefully caught on a back foot, everyone in the film is fictionalised – except for prime minister Naoto Kan, though he is never referred to by name, and plant manager Masao Yoshida. Yoshida crucially defies orders and allows the reactors to be cooled with seawater – which prevented meltdown and the possible devastation of Japan’s entire eastern seaboard. The reactors also must be “vented” for pressure manually by workers agonisingly selected for the task. Played by Ken Watanabe as a man having the ultimate bad day at work, the simmering Yoshida looks in need of a similar intervention. Wakamatsu treats his account of these critical hours – the first direct depiction of the disaster, though Sion Sono’s Himizu (2011) was a poetic first responder – like a machine to be kept running at all costs. Often it consists of little more than technicians pelting into crisis rooms, adhering to the Akira school of screaming, with shocking gas-pressure read-outs. The civilian backstories are token, and though the film is critical of the brass, it doesn’t let this anger break into climactic outrage. Yoshida died in 2013 of unrelated oesophageal cancer: Watanabe’s big-shouldered presence makes this an ample tribute to the man, but the film could have been more than an easy clap for his workers. • Fukushima 50 is available from 8 March on digital formats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-15T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Dismantling Sellafield: the epic task of shutting down a nuclear site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","fields":{"headline":"Dismantling Sellafield: the epic task of shutting down a nuclear site","bodyText":"If you take the cosmic view of Sellafield, the superannuated nuclear facility in north-west England, its story began long before the Earth took shape. About 9bn years ago, tens of thousands of giant stars ran out of fuel, collapsed upon themselves, and then exploded. The sheer force of these supernova detonations mashed together the matter in the stars’ cores, turning lighter elements like iron into heavier ones like uranium. Flung out by such explosions, trillions of tonnes of uranium traversed the cold universe and wound up near our slowly materialising solar system. And here, over roughly 20m years, the uranium and other bits of space dust and debris cohered to form our planet in such a way that the violent tectonics of the young Earth pushed the uranium not towards its hot core but up into the folds of its crust. Within reach, so to speak, of the humans who eventually came along circa 300,000BC, and who mined the uranium beginning in the 1500s, learned about its radioactivity in 1896 and started feeding it into their nuclear reactors 70-odd years ago, making electricity that could be relayed to their houses to run toasters and light up Christmas trees. Sellafield compels this kind of gaze into the abyss of deep time because it is a place where multiple time spans – some fleeting, some cosmic – drift in and out of view. Laid out over six square kilometres, Sellafield is like a small town, with nearly a thousand buildings, its own roads and even a rail siding – all owned by the government, and requiring security clearance to visit. Sellafield’s presence, at the end of a road on the Cumbrian coast, is almost hallucinatory. One moment you’re passing cows drowsing in pastures, with the sea winking just beyond. Then, having driven through a high-security gate, you’re surrounded by towering chimneys, pipework, chugging cooling plants, everything dressed in steampunk. The sun bounces off metal everywhere. In some spots, the air shakes with the noise of machinery. It feels like the most manmade place in the world. Since it began operating in 1950, Sellafield has had different duties. First it manufactured plutonium for nuclear weapons. Then it generated electricity for the National Grid, until 2003. It also carried out years of fuel reprocessing: extracting uranium and plutonium from nuclear fuel rods after they’d ended their life cycles. The very day before I visited Sellafield, in mid-July, the reprocessing came to an end as well. It was a historic occasion. From an operational nuclear facility, Sellafield turned into a full-time storage depot – but an uncanny, precarious one, filled with toxic nuclear waste that has to be kept contained at any cost. Nothing is produced at Sellafield any more. Which was just as well, because I’d gone to Sellafield not to observe how it lived but to understand how it is preparing for its end. Sellafield’s waste – spent fuel rods, scraps of metal, radioactive liquids, a miscellany of other debris – is parked in concrete silos, artificial ponds and sealed buildings. Some of these structures are growing, in the industry’s parlance, “intolerable”, atrophied by the sea air, radiation and time itself. If they degrade too much, waste will seep out of them, poisoning the Cumbrian soil and water. To prevent that disaster, the waste must be hauled out, the silos destroyed and the ponds filled in with soil and paved over. The salvaged waste will then be transferred to more secure buildings that will be erected on site. But even that will be only a provisional arrangement, lasting a few decades. Nuclear waste has no respect for human timespans. The best way to neutralise its threat is to move it into a subterranean vault, of the kind the UK plans to build later this century. Once interred, the waste will be left alone for tens of thousands of years, while its radioactivity cools. Dealing with all the radioactive waste left on site is a slow-motion race against time, which will last so long that even the grandchildren of those working on site will not see its end. The process will cost at least £121bn. Compared to the longevity of nuclear waste, Sellafield has only been around for roughly the span of a single lunch break within a human life. Still, it has lasted almost the entirety of the atomic age, witnessing both its earliest follies and its continuing confusions. In 1954, Lewis Strauss, the chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, predicted that nuclear energy would make electricity “too cheap to meter”. That forecast has aged poorly. The main reason power companies and governments aren’t keener on nuclear power is not that activists are holding them back or that uranium is difficult to find, but that producing it safely is just proving too expensive. Strauss was, like many others, held captive by one measure of time and unable to truly fathom another. The short-termism of policymaking neglected any plans that had to be made for the abominably lengthy, costly life of radioactive waste. I kept being told, at Sellafield, that science is still trying to rectify the decisions made in undue haste three-quarters of a century ago. Many of the earliest structures here, said Dan Bowman, the head of operations at one of Sellafield’s two waste storage ponds, “weren’t even built with decommissioning in mind”. As a result, Bowman admitted, Sellafield’s scientists are having to invent, mid-marathon, the process of winding the site down – and they’re finding that they still don’t know enough about it. They don’t know exactly what they’ll find in the silos and ponds. They don’t know how much time they’ll need to mop up all the waste, or how long they’ll have to store it, or what Sellafield will look like afterwards. The decommissioning programme is laden “with assumptions and best guesses”, Bowman told me. It will be finished a century or so from now. Until then, Bowman and others will bend their ingenuity to a seemingly self-contradictory exercise: dismantling Sellafield while keeping it from falling apart along the way. * * * To take apart an ageing nuclear facility, you have to put a lot of other things together first. New technologies, for instance, and new buildings to replace the intolerable ones, and new reserves of money. (That £121bn price tag may swell further.) All of Sellafield is in a holding pattern, trying to keep waste safe until it can be consigned to the ultimate strongroom: the geological disposal facility (GDF), bored hundreds of metres into the Earth’s rock, a project that could cost another £53bn. Even if a GDF receives its first deposit in the 2040s, the waste has to be delivered and put away with such exacting caution that it can be filled and closed only by the middle of the 22nd century. Anywhere else, this state of temporariness might induce a mood of lax detachment, like a transit lounge to a frequent flyer. But at Sellafield, with all its caches of radioactivity, the thought of catastrophe is so ever-present that you feel your surroundings with a heightened keenness. At one point, when we were walking through the site, a member of the Sellafield team pointed out three different waste storage facilities within a 500-metre radius. The spot where we stood on the road, he said, “is probably the most hazardous place in Europe”. Sellafield’s waste comes in different forms and potencies. Spent fuel rods and radioactive pieces of metal rest in skips, which in turn are submerged in open, rectangular ponds, where water cools them and absorbs their radiation. The skips have held radioactive material for so long that they themselves count as waste. The pond beds are layered with nuclear sludge: degraded metal wisps, radioactive dust and debris. Discarded cladding, peeled off fuel rods like banana-skins, fills a cluster of 16-metre-deep concrete silos partially sunk into the earth. More dangerous still are the 20 tonnes of melted fuel inside a reactor that caught fire in 1957 and has been sealed off and left alone ever since. Somewhere on the premises, Sellafield has also stored the 140 tonnes of plutonium it has purified over the decades. It’s the largest such hoard of plutonium in the world, but it, too, is a kind of waste, simply because nobody wants it for weapons any more, or knows what else to do with it. It has been a dithery decade for nuclear policy. After the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, several countries began shuttering their reactors and tearing up plans for new ones. They’d become inordinately expensive to build and maintain, in any case, especially compared to solar and wind installations. In the UK, the fraction of electricity generated by nuclear plants has slid steadily downwards, from 25% in the 1990s to 16% in 2020. Of the five nuclear stations still producing power, only one will run beyond 2028. Hinkley Point C, the first new nuclear plant in a generation, is being built in Somerset, but its cost has bloated to more than £25bn. This year, though, governments felt the pressure to redo their sums when sanctions on Russia abruptly choked off supplies of oil and gas. Wealthy nations suddenly found themselves worrying about winter blackouts. In this crisis, governments are returning to the habit they were trying to break. Germany had planned to abandon nuclear fuel by the end of this year, but in October, it extended that deadline to next spring. The US allocated $6bn to save struggling plants; the UK pressed ahead with plans for Sizewell C, a nuclear power station to be built in Suffolk. Japan, its Fukushima trauma just a decade old, announced that it will commission new plants. Even as Sellafield is cleaning up after the first round of nuclear enthusiasm, another is getting under way. * * * Any time spent in Sellafield is scored to a soundtrack of alarms and signals. The radiation trackers clipped to our protective overalls let off soft cheeps, their frequency varying as radioactivity levels changed around us. Before leaving every building, we ran Geiger counters over ourselves – always remembering to scan the tops of our heads and the soles of our feet – and these clacked like rattlesnakes. At one spot, our trackers went mad. A pipe on the outside of a building had cracked, and staff had planted 10ft-tall sheets of lead into the ground around it to shield people from the radiation. It was perfectly safe, my guide assured me. We power-walked past nonetheless. The day I visited Sellafield was the UK’s hottest ever. We sweltered even before we put on heavy boots and overalls to visit the reprocessing plant, where, until the previous day, technicians had culled uranium and plutonium out of spent fuel. Every second, on each of the plant’s four floors, I heard a beep – a regular pulse, reminding everyone that nothing is amiss. “We’ve got folks here who joined at 18 and have been here more than 40 years, working only in this building,” said Lisa Dixon, an operations manager. Dixon’s father had been a welder here, and her husband is one of the firefighters stationed permanently on site. She meets aunts and cousins on her shifts all the time. When she says Sellafield is one big family, she isn’t just being metaphorical. I only ever saw a dummy of a spent fuel rod; the real thing would have been a metre long, weighed 10-12kg, and, when it emerged from a reactor, run to temperatures of 2,800C, half as hot as the surface of the sun. In a reactor, hundreds of rods of fresh uranium fuel slide into a pile of graphite blocks. Then a stream of neutrons, usually emitted by an even more radioactive metal such as californium, is directed into the pile. Those neutrons generate more neutrons out of uranium atoms, which generate still more neutrons out of other uranium atoms, and so on, the whole process begetting vast quantities of heat that can turn water into steam and drive turbines. During this process, some of the uranium atoms, randomly but very usefully, absorb darting neutrons, yielding heavier atoms of plutonium: the stuff of nuclear weapons. The UK’s earliest reactors – a type called Magnox – were set up to harvest plutonium for bombs; the electricity was a happy byproduct. The government built 26 such reactors across the country. They’re all being decommissioned now, or awaiting demolition. It turned out that if you weren’t looking to make plutonium nukes to blow up cities, Magnox was a pretty inefficient way to light up homes and power factories. For most of the latter half of the 20th century, one of Sellafield’s chief tasks was reprocessing. Once uranium and plutonium were extracted from used fuel rods, it was thought, they could be stored safely – and perhaps eventually resold, to make money on the side. Beginning in 1956, spent rods came to Cumbria from plants across the UK, but also by sea from customers in Italy and Japan. Sellafield has taken in nearly 60,000 tonnes of spent fuel, more than half of all such fuel reprocessed anywhere in the world. The rods arrived at Sellafield by train, stored in cuboid “flasks” with corrugated sides, each weighing about 50 tonnes and standing 1.5 metres tall. The flasks were cast from single ingots of stainless steel, their walls a third of a metre thick. Responding to worries about how robust these containers were, the government, in 1984, arranged to have a speeding train collide head-on with a flask. The video is spectacular. At 100mph, a part of the locomotive exploded and the train derailed. But the flask, a few scratches and dents aside, stayed intact. At Sellafield, the rods were first cooled in ponds of water for between 90 and 250 days. Then they were skinned of their cladding and dissolved in boiling nitric acid. From that liquor, technicians separated out uranium and plutonium, powdery like cumin. This cycle, from acid to powder, lasted up to 36 hours, Dixon said – and it hadn’t improved a jot in efficiency in the years she’d been there. The only change was the dwindling number of rods coming in, as Magnox reactors closed everywhere. The day before I met Dixon, technicians had fed one final batch of spent fuel into acid – and that was that, the end of reprocessing. It marked Sellafield’s transition from an operational facility to a depot devoted purely to storage and containment. The rods went in late in the evening, after hours of technical hitches, so the moment itself was anticlimactic. “They just dropped through, and you heard nothing. So it was like: ‘OK, that’s it? Let’s go home,’” Dixon said. But the following morning, when I met her, she felt sombre, she admitted. “Everybody’s thinking: ‘What do we do? There’s no fuel coming in.’ I don’t think it’s really hit the team just yet.” The reprocessing plant’s end was always coming. The pipes and steam lines, many from the 1960s, kept fracturing. Dixon’s team was running out of spare parts that aren’t manufactured any more. “Since December 2019,” Dixon said, “I’ve only had 16 straight days of running the plant at any one time.” Best to close it down – to conduct repairs, clean the machines and take them apart. Then, at last, the reprocessing plant will be placed on “fire watch”, visited periodically to ensure nothing in the building is going up in flames, but otherwise left alone for decades for its radioactivity to dwindle, particle by particle. * * * Like malign glitter, radioactivity gets everywhere, turning much of what it touches into nuclear waste. The humblest items – a paper towel or a shoe cover used for just a second in a nuclear environment – can absorb radioactivity, but this stuff is graded as low-level waste; it can be encased in a block of cement and left outdoors. (Cement is an excellent shield against radiation. A popular phrase in the nuclear waste industry goes: “When in doubt, grout.”) Even the paper towel needs a couple of hundred years to shed its radioactivity and become safe, though. A moment of use, centuries of quarantine: radiation tends to twist time all out of proportion. On the other hand, high-level waste – the byproduct of reprocessing – is so radioactive that its containers will give off heat for thousands of years. It, too, will become harmless over time, but the scale of that time is planetary, not human. The number of radioactive atoms in the kind of iodine found in nuclear waste byproducts halves every 16m years. In comparison, consider how different the world looked a mere 7,000 years ago, when a determined pedestrian could set out from the Humber estuary, in northern England, and walk across to the Netherlands and then to Norway. Planning for the disposal of high-level waste has to take into account the drift of continents and the next ice age. All radioactivity is a search for stability. Most of the atoms in our daily lives – the carbon in the wood of a desk, the oxygen in the air, the silicon in window glass – have stable nuclei. But in the atoms of some elements like uranium or plutonium, protons and neutrons are crammed into their nuclei in ways that make them unsteady – make them radioactive. These atoms decay, throwing off particles and energy over years or millennia until they become lighter and more stable. Nuclear fuel is radioactive, of course, but so is nuclear waste, and the only thing that can render such waste harmless is time. Waste can travel incognito, to fatal effect: radioactive atoms carried by the wind or water, entering living bodies, riddling them with cancer, ruining them inside out. During the 1957 reactor fire at Sellafield, a radioactive plume of particles poured from the top of a 400-foot chimney. A few days later, some of these particles were detected as far away as Germany and Norway. Near Sellafield, radioactive iodine found its way into the grass of the meadows where dairy cows grazed, so that samples of milk taken in the weeks after the fire showed 10 times the permissible level. The government had to buy up milk from farmers living in 500 sq km around Sellafield and dump it in the Irish Sea. From the outset, authorities hedged and fibbed. For three days, no one living in the area was told about the gravity of the accident, or even advised to stay indoors and shut their windows. Workers at Sellafield, reporting their alarming radiation exposure to their managers, were persuaded that they’d “walk [it] off on the way home”, the Daily Mirror reported at the time. A government inquiry was then held, but its report was not released in full until 1988. For nearly 30 years, few people knew that the fire dispersed not just radioactive iodine but also polonium, far more deadly. The estimated toll of cancer cases has been revised upwards continuously, from 33 to 200 to 240. Sellafield took its present name only in 1981, in part to erase the old name, Windscale, and the associated memories of the fire. The invisibility of radiation and the opacity of governments make for a bad combination. Sellafield hasn’t suffered an accident of equivalent scale since the 1957 fire, but the niggling fear that some radioactivity is leaking out of the facility in some fashion has never entirely vanished. In 1983, a Sellafield pipeline discharged half a tonne of radioactive solvent into the sea. British Nuclear Fuels Limited, the government firm then running Sellafield, was fined £10,000. Around the same time, a documentary crew found higher incidences than expected of leukaemia among children in some surrounding areas. A government study concluded that radiation from Sellafield wasn’t to blame. Perhaps, the study suggested, the leukaemia had an undetected, infectious cause. It was no secret that Sellafield kept on site huge stashes of spent fuel rods, waiting to be reprocessed. This was lucrative work. An older reprocessing plant on site earned £9bn over its lifetime, half of it from customers overseas. But the pursuit of commercial reprocessing turned Sellafield and a similar French site into “de facto waste dumps”, the journalist Stephanie Cooke found in her book In Mortal Hands. Sellafield now requires £2bn a year to maintain. What looked like a smart line of business back in the 1950s has now turned out to be anything but. With every passing year, maintaining the world’s costliest rubbish dump becomes more and more commercially calamitous. The expenditure rises because structures age, growing more rickety, more prone to mishap. In 2005, in an older reprocessing plant at Sellafield, 83,000 litres of radioactive acid – enough to fill a few hundred bathtubs – dripped out of a ruptured pipe. The plant had to be shut down for two years; the cleanup cost at least £300m. The year before the pandemic, a sump tank attached to a waste pond sprang a leak and had to be grouted shut. Around the same time, an old crack in a waste silo opened up again. It posed no health risk, Sellafield determined, so it was still dripping liquid into the ground when I visited. The silos are rudimentary concrete bins, built for waste to be tipped in, but for no other kind of access. Their further degradation is a sure thing. It all put me in mind of a man who’d made a house of ice in deepest winter but now senses spring around the corner, and must move his furniture out before it all melts and collapses around him. * * * Some industrial machines have soothing names; the laser snake is not one of them. After its fat, six-metre-long body slinks out of its cage-like housing, it can rear up in serpentine fashion, as if scanning its surroundings for prey. Its anatomy is made up of accordion folds, so it can stretch and compress on command. The snake’s face is the size and shape of a small dinner plate, with a mouth through which it fires a fierce, purple shaft of light. The laser can slice through inches-thick steel, sparks flaring from the spot where the beam blisters the metal. It took two years and £5m to develop this instrument. If Philip K Dick designed your nightmares, the laser snake would haunt them. Six years ago, the snake’s creators put it to work in a demo at Sellafield. A 10-storey building called B204 had been Sellafield’s first reprocessing facility, but in 1973, a rogue chemical reaction filled the premises with radioactive gas. Thirty-four workers were contaminated, and the building was promptly closed down. Gas, fuel rods and radioactive equipment were all left in place, in sealed rooms known as cells, which turned so lethal that humans haven’t entered them since. The snake, though, could slither right in – through a hole drilled into a cell wall, and right up to a two-metre-high, double-walled steel vat once used to dissolve fuel in acid. Like so much else in B204, the vat was radioactive waste. It had to be disposed of, but it was too big to remove in one piece. For six weeks, Sellafield’s engineers prepared for the task, rehearsing on a 3D model, ventilating the cell, setting up a stream of air to blow away the molten metal, ensuring that nothing caught fire from the laser’s sparks. Once in action, the snake took mere minutes to cut up the vat. But then the pieces were left in the cell. No one had figured out yet how to remove them. The snake hasn’t been deployed since 2015, because other, more urgent tasks lie at hand. As a project, tackling Sellafield’s nuclear waste is a curious mix of sophistication and what one employee called the “poky stick” approach. On the one hand, it calls for ingenious machines like the laser snake, conceived especially for Sellafield. But the years-long process of scooping waste out can also feel crude and time-consuming – “like emptying a wheelie bin with a teaspoon”, Phil Atherton, a manager working with the silo team, told me. New forms of storage have to be devised for the waste, once it’s removed. These have to be secure and robust – but they can’t be irretrievably secure and robust, because scientists may yet develop better ways to deal with waste. “You don’t want to do anything that forecloses any prospective solutions,” Atherton said. No possible version of the future can be discounted. We walked on the roof of the silos, atop their heavy concrete caps. Below us, submerged in water, lay decades’ worth of intermediate-level waste – not quite as radioactive as spent fuel rods, but more harmful than low-level paper towels. Most of it was swarf – the cladding skinned off fuel rods, broken into chunks three or four inches long. What Atherton really wanted to show off, though, was a new waste retrieval system: a machine as big as a studio apartment, designed from scratch over two decades and built at a cost of £100m. Its 13,500 working parts together weigh 350 tonnes. It perched on rails running the length of the building, so that it could be moved and positioned above an uncapped silo. An operator sits inside the machine, reaching long, mechanical arms into the silo to fish out waste. In the water’s gloom, cameras offer little help, he said: “You’re mostly playing by feel.” In the two preceding months, the team had pulled out enough waste to fill four skips. Eventually there will be two more retrieval machines in the silos, their arms poking and clasping like the megafauna cousins of those fairground soft-toy grabbers. Even so, it will take until 2050 to empty all the silos. The skips of extricated waste will be compacted to a third of their volume, grouted and moved into another Sellafield warehouse; at some point, they will be sequestered in the ground, in the GDF that is, at present, hypothetical. Not far from the silos, I met John Cassidy, who has helped manage one of Sellafield’s waste storage ponds for more than three decades – so long that a colleague called him “the Oracle”. Cassidy’s pond, which holds 14,000 cubic metres of water, resembles an extra-giant, extra-filthy lido planted in the middle of an industrial park. In the water, the skips full of used fuel rods were sometimes stacked three deep, and when one was placed in or pulled out, rods tended to tumble out on to the floor of the pond. We climbed a staircase in a building constructed over a small part of the pond. On one floor, we stopped to look at a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV – a steamer trunk-sized thing with a yellow carapace, floating in the algal-green water. “You see the little arm at the end of it?” Cassidy said. “So it’ll float down to the bottom of the pond, pick up a nuclear rod that has fallen out of a skip, and put it back into the skip.” Sometimes, though, a human touch is required. This winter, Sellafield will hire professional divers from the US. Nuclear plants keep so much water on hand – to cool fuel, moderate the reactor’s heat, or generate steam – that a class of specialist divers works only in the ponds and tanks at these plants, inspecting and repairing them. In Sellafield, these nuclear divers will put on radiation-proof wetsuits and tidy up the pond floor, reaching the places where robotic arms cannot go. Two floors above, a young Sellafield employee sat in a gaming chair, working at a laptop with a joystick. He was manoeuvring an ROV fitted with a toilet brush – “a regular brush, bought at the store,” he said, “just kind of reinforced with a bit of plastic tube”. With a delicacy not ordinarily required of it, the toilet brush wiped debris and algae off a skip until the digits “9738”, painted in black, appeared on the skip’s flank. When they arrived over the years, during the heyday of reprocessing, the skips were unloaded into pools so haphazardly that Sellafield is now having to build an underwater map of what is where, just to know best how to get it all out. Skip No 9738 went into the map, one more hard-won addition to Sellafield’s knowledge of itself. * * * “Waste disposal is a completely solved problem,” Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, declared in 1979. He was right, but only in theory. The nuclear industry certainly knew about the utility of water, steel and concrete as shields against radioactivity, and by the 1970s, the US government had begun considering burying reactor waste in a GDF. But Teller was glossing over the details, namely: the expense of keeping waste safe, the duration over which it has to be maintained, the accidents that could befall it, the fallout of those accidents. Four decades on, not a single GDF has begun to operate anywhere in the world. Teller’s complete solution is still a hypothesis. Instead, there have been only interim solutions, although to a layperson, even these seem to have been conceived in some scientist’s intricate delirium. High-level waste, like the syrupy liquor formed during reprocessing, has to be cooled first, in giant tanks. Then it is vitrified: mixed with three parts glass beads and a little sugar, until it turns into a hot block of dirty-brown glass. (The sugar reduces the waste’s volatility. “We like to get ours from Tate &amp; Lyle,” Eva Watson-Graham, a Sellafield information officer, said.) Since 1991, stainless steel containers full of vitrified waste, each as tall as a human, have been stacked 10-high in a warehouse. If you stand on the floor above them, Watson-Graham said, you can still sense a murmuring warmth on the soles of your shoes. Even this elaborate vitrification is insufficient in the long, long, long run. Fire or flood could destroy Sellafield’s infrastructure. Terrorists could try to get at the nuclear material. Governments change, companies fold, money runs out. Nations dissolve. Glass degrades. The ground sinks and rises, so that land becomes sea and sea becomes land. The contingency planning that scientists do today – the kind that wasn’t done when the industry was in its infancy – contends with yawning stretches of time. Hence the GDF: a terrestrial cavity to hold waste until its dangers have dried up and it becomes as benign as the surrounding rock. A glimpse of such an endeavour is available already, beneath Finland. From Helsinki, if you drive 250km west, then head another half-km down, you will come to a warren of tunnels called Onkalo. Other underground vaults have been built to store intermediate waste, but for briefer periods; one that opened in a salt cavern in New Mexico in 1999 will last merely 10,000 years. If Onkalo begins operating on schedule, in 2025, it will be the world’s first GDF for spent fuel and high-level reactor waste – 6,500 tonnes of the stuff, all from Finnish nuclear stations. It will cost €5.5bn and is designed to be safe for a million years. The species that is building it, Homo sapiens, has only been around for a third of that time. Constructed by a firm named Posiva, Onkalo has been hewn into the island of Olkiluoto, a brief bridge’s length off Finland’s south-west coast. When I visited in October, the birches on Olkiluoto had turned to a hot blush. The air was pure Baltic brine. In a van, we went down a steep, dark ramp for a quarter of an hour until we reached Onkalo’s lowest level, and here I caught the acrid odour of a closed space in which heavy machinery has run for a long time. Up close, the walls were pimpled and jagged, like stucco, but at a distance, the rock’s surface undulated like soft butter. Twice, we followed a feebly lit tunnel only to turn around and drive back up. “I still get lost sometimes here,” said Sanna Mustonen, a geologist with Posiva, “even after all these years.” After Onkalo takes in all its waste, these caverns will be sealed up to the surface with bentonite, a kind of clay that absorbs water, and that is often found in cat litter. It took four decades just to decide the location of Finland’s GDF. So much had to be considered, Mustonen said. How easy would it be to drill and blast through the 1.9bn-year-old bedrock below the site? How dry is it below ground? How stable will the waste be amidst the fracture zones in these rocks? What are the odds of tsunamis and earthquakes? How high will the sea rise? How will the rock bear up if, in the next ice age, tens of thousands of years from today, a kilometre or two of ice forms on the surface? Accidents had to be modelled. Fifteen years after the New Mexico site opened, a drum of waste burst open, leaking radiation up an exhaust shaft and then for a kilometre or so above ground. (The cause was human error: someone had added a wheat-based cat litter into the drum instead of bentonite.) In late 2021, Posiva submitted all its studies and contingency plans to the Finnish government to seek an operating license. The document ran to 17,000 pages. In the 2120s, once it has been filled, Onkalo will be sealed and turned over to the state. Other countries also plan to banish their nuclear waste into GDFs. Sweden has already selected its spot, Switzerland and France are trying to finalise theirs. The UK’s plans are at an earlier stage. A government agency, Nuclear Waste Services, is studying locations and talking to the people living there, but already the ballpark expenditure is staggering. “If the geology is simple, and we’re disposing of just high- and intermediate-level waste, then we’re thinking £20bn,” said Jonathan Turner, a geologist with Nuclear Waste Services. The ceiling – for now – is £53bn. “It’s a major project,” Turner said, “like the Chunnel or the Olympics.” At the moment, Nuclear Waste Services is in discussions with four communities about the potential to host a GDF. Three are in Cumbria, and if the GDF does wind up in this neighbourhood, the Sellafield enterprise would have come full circle. The GDF will effectively entomb not just decades of nuclear waste but also the decades-old idea that atomic energy will be both easy and cheap – the very idea that drove the creation of Sellafield, where the world’s earliest nuclear aspirations began. On one of my afternoons in Sellafield, I was shown around a half-made building: a £1bn factory that would pack all the purified plutonium into canisters to be sent to a GDF. We ducked through half-constructed corridors and emerged into the main, as-yet-roofless hall. Eventually, the plant will be taller than Westminster Abbey – and as part of the decommissioning process, this structure too will be torn down once it has finished its task, decades from now. I stood there for a while, transfixed by the sight of a building going up even as its demolition was already foretold, feeling the water-filled coolness of the fresh, metre-thick concrete walls, and trying to imagine the distant, dreamy future in which all of Sellafield would be returned to fields and meadows again. • This article was amended on 16 December 2022.

Nuclear power, apart from destroying biodiversity throughout its life cycle, produces up to 37 times the CO2 emissions of renewable energy sources, owing partly to the mining and refining of uranium. The impact of this process on people and the environment is not included in the rationale for nuclear power in the UK. As the CBI looks for investment from abroad, UK taxpayers will pick up the bill for the likely time and cost overruns of new nuclear build under the regulated asset-based funding proposals so welcomed by the CBI. Nuclear has failed to achieve the investment needed so far because it is no longer seen as economically viable. Even Hitachi (one of the world’s largest multinationals) cannot magic Wylfa Newydd into a commercially viable business. In January this year, Hitachi announced it had failed to squeeze the UK government for the very high levels of subsidies desired by large investors upfront for Wylfa.

The first is that gas escapes from previously frozen deposits could outweigh reduced human emissions, so geo-engineering may yet be necessary. The second is the need for funding for useful actions that already exist. It is no use politicians declaring a climate emergency and then lacking the backbone to deal with it. If taxes (including mine) need to increase, then so be it. If this seems overly alarmist or they are unforgivably prepared to let the world’s poor go hang, MPs should remember just how much food Britain imports and ask exactly who would guarantee our supplies if major global disruption occurred.

It’s slightly past 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Smyhal said on Sunday that 900 Ukrainian teachers have volunteered to join Ukraine’s Armed Forces to fight against Russia’s invasion since February 24. “This is a great example of serving your people,” he said. The body of Paul Urey, a British aid volunteer who died after being captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine has been returned to the UK. Urey’s family raised £9,000 to repatriate his body after the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it was unable to pay the transport costs. Ukrainian forces have shot down 8 Iranian-made kamikaze drones on Sunday, the Kyiv Independent. According to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Ukraine’s air force also carried our four strikes that hit two Russian weapon stockpiles, as well as two anti-aircraft missile systems. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said that he believes Ukraine is “making progress” in the war. In a CNN interview that aired on Sunday, Austin attributes the changing tide of war to the calibre of Ukrainian soldiers and their use of weapons provided to them by the US and NATO countries. Ukraine is starting to believe it can take back Crimea, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s top representative in the region. While there’s no suggestion that Ukraine is close to being in a position to regain the annexed region, Tamila Tasheva and her team spend their days discussing the logistics of what would happen should Kyiv regain control. The recapture of Lyman is a key factor for “further de-occupation” in the neighbouring Luhansk region, according to its Governor Serhiy Gaidai. The comments, reported by Reuters, come after Ukrainian forces declared full control of a city located in one of the four regions annexed by Vladimir Putin on Friday. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has been discussing the military importance of Lyman, following the news that Russia has lost control of the eastern city. AP reports that the Donetsk city was described as crucial during a daily intelligence briefing on Sunday, owing to its “key road crossing over the Siversky Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defences.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed Ukraine has “fully cleared” Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. In a short video clip on his Telegram channel, Zelenskiy thanked serving Ukrainian troops for liberating Lyman. “As of 1230 [Kyiv] local time Lyman is completely cleared,” he said, adding: “Glory to Ukraine.” The nine European countries who issued a statement earlier to condemn Russia’s annexation of Ukraine were all signalling their support for Ukraine to join Nato. AP reports that the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and Slovakia were backing a path for Ukraine’s Nato membership in their slightly opaque joint statement. Ukraine’s capture of Lyman demonstrates that the country is making progress and able to push back against Russian forces, Nato Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, has told NBC. “We have seen that they have been able to take a new town, Lyman, and that demonstrates that the Ukrainians are making progress, are able to push back the Russian forces because of the courage, because of their bravery, their skills, but of course also because of the advanced weapons that the United States and other allies are providing,” Reuters reports that Stoltenberg said. A leading charity which has been helping the government with rematching Ukrainian refugees with UK hosts after initial placements end or break down, is to scale back its work because they say the scheme is unworkable. Refugees at Home is one of five voluntary and community organisations listed as “recognised providers” on the gov.uk website to help match and rematch Ukrainian refugees with UK hosts. The Associated Press has found evidence of 10 torture sites in the city of Izium, following Russia’s retreat. “The AP spoke to 15 survivors of Russian torture in the Kharkiv region, as well as two families whose loved ones disappeared into Russian hands. Two of the men were taken repeatedly and abused. One battered, unconscious Ukrainian soldier was displayed to his wife to force her to provide information she simply didn’t have,” the AP reported. Russia has attacked Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home town with suicide drones. Kryvyi Rih, the southern Ukrainian town where the president grew up, was hit by a Russian suicide drone early on Sunday, according to Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of Dnipropetrovsk. Russia’s constitutional court has today recognised the annexation of four key Ukrainian territories as lawful. The court has effectively rubber stamped the annexation accords signed by Vladimir Putin with the Moscow-backed leaders of the regions, despite widespread condemnation by the West. Germany, Denmark and Norway have commissioned a batch of long-range weapons to be built for Ukraine. The supply of 16 Slovak Zuzana-2 howitzers, just announced by the German defence ministry, will begin next year. It follows calls from Ukraine for heavier armaments to build on recent successes on the battlefield. The gas leaks on the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline have now been stopped. This follows Saturday’s announcement that gas was no longer flowing out of Nord Stream 2. Denmark’s energy agency said on Sunday it had been informed by Nord Stream AG that stable pressure had been achieved in the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline and that this indicates the outflow of natural gas from the last leaks had now halted, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Smyhal said on Sunday that 900 Ukrainian teachers have volunteered to join Ukraine’s Armed Forces to fight against Russia’s invasion since February 24. The body of a British aid volunteer who died after being captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine has been returned to the UK. The family of Paul Urey raised £9,000 to repatriate his body after the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it was unable to pay the transport costs, the Guardian’s Robyn Vinter reports. Urey, 45, was captured by pro-Russia separatists along with other British nationals in April after travelling to Donetsk. He had initially planned to join the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, but was rejected on health grounds and became an aid volunteer. Shortly after he was captured at a checkpoint near the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia his family members begged his Russian captors to provide him with the medication he needed to manage his type 1 diabetes. When his death was reported in July, a Russian official, Natalya Nikonorov, blamed “acute coronary insufficiency aggravated by pulmonary and brain edema.” More details found here: Ukrainian forces have shot down 8 Iranian-made kamikaze drones on Sunday, the Kyiv Independent reports. According to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Ukraine’s air force also carried our four strikes that hit two Russian weapon stockpiles, as well as two anti-aircraft missile systems. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said that he believes Ukraine is “making progress” in the war. In a CNN interview that aired on Sunday, Austin attributes the changing tide of war to the calibre of Ukrainian soldiers and their use of weapons provided to them by the US and NATO countries. “What we’re seeing now is a kind of change in the battlefield dynamics…They’ve done very, very well in the Kharkiv area and moved to take advantage of opportunities. The fight in the – the Kherson region’s going a bit slower, but they’re making progress,” said Austin. He added that Ukrainian soldiers have been using “technology like HIMARS” and that they are using it in the “right way…[to] conduct attacks on things like logistical stores and command and control, that’s taking away – taken away significant capability from the Russians.” “It’s not just about the equipment that you have. It’s about how you employ that equipment, how you synchronize things together to create battlefield effects that then can create opportunities,” he said. Ukraine is starting to believe it can take back Crimea, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s top representative in the region. While there’s no suggestion that Ukraine is close to being in a position to regain the annexed region, Tamila Tasheva and her team spend their days discussing the logistics of what would happen should Kyiv regain control. “This is moment X. Right now everything is happening in a way that it feels inevitable,” said Tasheva. “It may not happen tomorrow, but I think it will be much quicker than I thought a year ago.” Read more here The recapture of Lyman is a key factor for “further de-occupation” in the neighbouring Luhansk region, according to its Governor Serhiy Gaidai. The comments, reported by Reuters, come after Ukrainian forces declared full control of a city located in one of the four regions annexed by Vladimir Putin on Friday. In a move rejected by the international community, Putin annexed Donetsk together with Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk – proclaiming the quartet to be part of Russia “for ever”. Russian forces have lost Lyman four months after first seizing the city, a move that Governor Gaidai hopes will prove pivotal for his region. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has been discussing the military importance of Lyman, following the news that Russia has lost control of the eastern city. AP reports that the Donetsk city was described as crucial during a daily intelligence briefing on Sunday, owing to its “key road crossing over the Siversky Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defences”. Lyman has been retaken by Ukrainian forces despite Putin announcing Donetsk’s incorporation into Russian Federation on Friday, an annexation that AFP reports has today been recognised as lawful by Russia’s constitutional court. The liberation of Lyman has “brought a new mood of optimism” into the nearby city of Sloviansk, a place that has been acutely impacted for months as a result of once being one of Russia’s main objectives alongside neighbouring Kramatorsk. Reporting from the Donbas city is Peter Beaumont, who paints a picture of returning hustle and bustle following the recapture of Lyman about 12 miles away. Buses are operating again, while crowds are milling in the main market. This follows Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s confirmation that Ukraine has “fully cleared” Russian forces from the key eastern city, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. While the city itself is tentatively coming back to life, residents say the transformation is most noticeable in the countryside on the road towards Lyman.

In a short video clip on his Telegram channel, Zelenskiy thanked serving Ukrainian troops for liberating Lyman. “As of 1230 [Kyiv] local time Lyman is completely cleared,” he said, adding: “Glory to Ukraine”. Earlier Zelenskiy said his army would continue its offensive in the south and east and would “return back” all of the territory occupied by Russia, including Crimea. He suggested Russian generals were now “biting each other” after a series of embarrassing setbacks. Their loss of Lyman four months after Russian servicemen seized the city in the Donetsk oblast amounts to a humiliating moment for Vladimir Putin. On Friday, in a move rejected by the international community, he annexed Donetsk together with three other Ukrainian regions, and said they were a part of Russia “for ever”. Read more here The nine European countries who issued a statement earlier to condemn Russia’s annexation of Ukraine were all signalling their support for Ukraine to join Nato. AP reports that the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and Slovakia were backing a path for Ukraine’s Nato membership in their slightly opaque joint statement. The leaders of the nine countries said they “firmly stood behind the 2008 Bucharest Nato Summit decision concerning Ukraine’s future membership.” Members at that 2008 summit welcomed Ukraine and Georgia’s aspirations to join, but declined to provide a clear timeline for the two countries’ possible ascension. The latest letter still mentions no timeline. Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced on Friday that he was applying to join Nato and signed an expedited application to join the security alliance of 30 states. When asked on Friday about the application, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the application process in Brussels “should be taken up at a different time.” Ukraine’s capture of Lyman demonstrates that the country is making progress and able to push back against Russian forces, Nato Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, has told NBC. “We have seen that they have been able to take a new town, Lyman, and that demonstrates that the Ukrainians are making progress, are able to push back the Russian forces because of the courage, because of their bravery, their skills, but of course also because of the advanced weapons that the United States and other allies are providing,” Reuters reports that Stoltenberg said. Asked about Ukraine’s application for accelerated membership in the Western defence alliance, Stoltenberg said: “any decision on membership has to be taken by consensus all 30 allies have to agree to make such a decision.” Stoltenberg also said that Nato supports the investigation into the apparent sabotage of Russia’s Nord Stream pipelines that run from Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea. “Any deliberate attack on critical Nato infrastructure will be met with a firm and united response from an angle,” Stoltenberg said. A leading charity which has been helping the government with rematching Ukrainian refugees with UK hosts after initial placements end or break down, is to scale back its work because they say the scheme is unworkable. Refugees at Home is one of five voluntary and community organisations listed as “recognised providers” on the gov.uk website to help match and rematch Ukrainian refugees with UK hosts. Hosting arrangements are for a minimum of six months and many are now coming to an end after the scheme opened in March of this year. As fewer UK hosts are now coming forward, rematching requests from Ukrainians are increasing. Many Ukrainian households have become homeless – around one third of them in London. According to government figures from 24 February 2022 until 26 August 2022 1,565 Ukrainian households were registered as homeless by councils.

Here’s some of their reporting on the ground: A deep sunless pit with dates carved into the brick wall. A clammy underground jail that reeked of urine and rotting food. A clinic, a police station and a kindergarten. These were among the 10 Russian torture sites located by Associated Press journalists throughout the Ukrainian city of Izium. Torture in Izium was arbitrary, widespread and absolutely routine for both civilians and soldiers during the six months the Russians controlled the city, an AP investigation has found. The AP spoke to 15 survivors of Russian torture in the Kharkiv region, as well as two families whose loved ones disappeared into Russian hands. Two of the men were taken repeatedly and abused. One battered, unconscious Ukrainian soldier was displayed to his wife to force her to provide information she simply didn’t have. The AP also confirmed eight men killed under torture in Russian custody, according to survivors and families. All but one were civilians. At a mass grave site created by the Russians and discovered in the woods of Izium, at least 30 of the 447 bodies recently excavated bore visible marks of torture bound hands, close gunshot wounds, knife wounds and broken limbs, according to the Kharkiv regional prosecutor’s office. Those injuries corresponded to the descriptions of the pain inflicted upon the survivors. Russia has attacked Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home town with suicide drones, AP reports. Kryvyi Rih, the southern Ukrainian town where the president grew up, was hit by a Russian suicide drone early on Sunday, according to Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of Dnipropetrovsk. The governor said the strike destroyed two stories of a school. Russia is increasingly using Iranian-made suicide drones to attack targets. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down five Iranian-made drones in southern Ukraine overnight, while two others made it through air defences. Russia’s constitutional court has today recognised the annexation of four key Ukrainian territories as lawful, AFP reports. The court has effectively rubber stamped the annexation accords signed by Vladimir Putin with the Moscow-backed leaders of the regions, despite widespread condemnation by the West. Putin staged a grand Kremlin ceremony on Friday to celebrate the annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, following “referendums” denounced as a sham by Kyiv and its allies. The annexation treaties will now be considered by Russia’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, on Monday, according to Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin. The four territories create a crucial land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, also annexed by Moscow, in 2014. Together the five regions make up around 20 percent of Ukraine. Germany, Denmark and Norway have commissioned a batch of long-range weapons to be built for Ukraine, Reuters reports. The supply of 16 Slovak Zuzana-2 howitzers, just announced by the German defence ministry, will begin next year. It follows calls from Ukraine for heavier armaments to build on recent successes on the battlefield. The guns, which can fire six projectiles a minute over a distance of 40 km, will be built in Slovakia. The three countries will spend 92 million euros on the systems. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office says Ukraine already has the support of 10 bloc countries to join Nato. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the president’s office, tweeted that those supporting the application were “mostly countries that remember [the] poisonous claws of [the Russian] empire.” He added: “We are grateful for the leadership and responsibility. History is being made today.” The President announced on Friday that he was applying to join Nato and signed an expedited application to join the security alliance of 30 states. It looks like the gas leaks on the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline have now been stopped. This follows Saturday’s announcement that gas was no longer flowing out of Nord Stream 2. Reuters reports: Denmark’s energy agency said on Sunday it had been informed by Nord Stream AG that stable pressure had been achieved in the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline and that this indicates the outflow of natural gas from the last leaks had now halted. A total of four leaks were discovered on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea near Denmark and Sweden last week. While neither pipeline was in use at the time of the suspected blasts, they were filled with gas that has been spewing out and bubbling to the surface of the Baltic Sea since Monday. Denmark has signed a letter of intent with Slovakia, Norway and Germany, to aid Slovakian production of Zuzana-2 artillery systems gifted to Ukraine, the Danish government has announced. The country is donating 230m krone (30.1m euros) to the effort, which is worth 9.2m euros. The presidents of nine Nato countries in central and eastern Europe declared on Sunday they would never recognise the annexation by Russia of Ukrainian territory, AFP reports. Their reaction comes two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed treaties to annex four Moscow-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhia - following “referendums” the West has dismissed as “sham”. The presidents issued a joint statement saying they could not “stay silent in the face of the blatant violation of international law by the Russian Federation”. “We reiterate our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” they said. “We do not recognise and will never recognise Russian attempts to annex any Ukrainian territory.” The statement was issued by the presidents of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Four of the signatories - Poland, and the three Baltic states - are on Nato’s eastern flank with Russia. Two others - Romania and Slovakia - have borders with Ukraine. Hungary, which also borders Ukraine, was notably absent from the list. Its nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, has sought close ties with Putin in recent years and railed against European Union sanctions on the Kremlin. Also absent were Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia. The statement, published on the website of the Polish president’s office, said the leaders of the signatory countries had “visited Kyiv during the war and witnessed with their own eyes the effects of Russian aggression”. “We support Ukraine in its defence against Russia’s invasion, demand Russia to immediately withdraw from all the occupied territories and encourage all (Nato) Allies to substantially increase their military aid to Ukraine,” it said. “All those who commit crimes of aggression must be held accountable and brought to justice.” The presidents said they stood by a decision Nato made 14 years ago, supporting Ukraine’s wish to join the transatlantic military alliance at a future date. They did not comment on Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014, or on Ukraine’s request last Friday for fast-track Nato membership following Russia’s annexation manoeuvre. Nato members have hesitated at accepting a country at war - which, by treaty, would oblige the alliance to come to its defence. Nato’s Article 5 says an attack on one member is tantamount to attack on all. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Sunday that it was technically possible to restore ruptured offshore infrastructure of Nord Streams pipelines, TASS news agency reported. Novak said: There have never been such incidents. Of course, there are technical possibilities to restore the infrastructure, it takes time and appropriate funds. I am sure that appropriate possibilities will be found. Russia’s Defence Ministry has said its forces had destroyed seven artillery and missile depots in the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk. It said the guidance radar for a S-300 air defence missile system had also been destroyed near Nova Kaluha in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, Reuters is reporting. More detail here on the Pope’s speech today, from AFP. Pope Francis on Sunday deplored Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory and called on the Russian leader to stop the war and on Ukraine’s president to be open to talks. “I deeply deplore the grave situation that has arisen in recent days, with further actions contrary to the principles of international law. It increases the risk of nuclear escalation, giving rise to fears of uncontrollable and catastrophic consequences worldwide,” he said during the Sunday Angelus prayer. He implored Russian President Vladimir Putin “to stop this spiral of violence and death” and on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “to be open to serious proposals for peace”. He also urged the international community “to do everything possible to bring an end to the war, without allowing themselves to be drawn into dangerous escalations”, and to support any efforts to resolve the conflict through dialogue. It is the first time that the Argentine pope has directly addressed the Russian leader in a speech since the start of Moscow’s invasion on February 24. Francis has been trying since the start of the invasion to open a path of dialogue with Moscow, while condemning a “cruel and senseless war”. It is 2pm in Kyiv, here’s a rundown of the latest news Ukraine is in full control of the eastern logistics hub of Lyman, Kyiv’s most significant battlefield gain in weeks, which a senior official said could provide a staging post for further gains to the east, Reuters reports. The Pope has said it is “absurd” that the world is facing a nuclear threat over Ukraine. Calling for a ceasefire “in the name of God”, he appealed to the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to find a way out of the crisis. The US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has welcomed the capture by Ukrainian forces of Lyman, a key Russian stronghold in eastern Ukraine. Austin said he was “very encouraged” by the Ukrainian victory on Saturday, which is an embarrassment for Vladimir Putin, who declared on Friday that the city – in the Donetsk region – was Russia’s “for ever”. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, made a surprise visit to Ukraine – her first since Russia’s invasion in February – as Kyiv urged Berlin to send it battle tanks. Lambrecht visited the southern port city of Odesa on Saturday and met her Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, the German defence ministry said. Russia has now restricted access to the music-streaming app SoundCloud, Reuters reports. SoundCloud was accused of distributing “false information” about the war by communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor (RKN). It follows existing bans on Facebook and Instagram. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is no longer leaking under the Baltic Sea because an equilibrium has been reached between the gas and water pressure, pipeline spokesman Ulrich Lissek told AFP. The British prime minster, Liz Truss, has said the series of explosions that severely damaged Russia’s gas pipelines were an act of sabotage. Belarus is preparing to receive Russian soldiers and equipment, the Kyiv Independent reports. There are about 1,000 Russian soldiers in the country. Russia failed to win enough votes for re-election to the ICAO’s governing council. The French representative told the assembly after Saturday’s ballot: “When we have votes in our countries, if we don’t like the result, we don’t ask for another vote.” Russia had a place on the UN aviation agency’s 36-member council as one of the “states of chief importance in air transport”. The head of Russia’s region of Chechnya said Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after its battlefield defeat in Lyman. Ramzan Kadyrov said in a message on Telegram addressing Russia’s loss of its stronghold: “In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.” Russian authorities informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “temporarily detained” for questioning. Ihor Murashov was detained on his way from the Russian-occupied plant – Europe’s largest – to the town of Enerhodar at about 4pm on Friday. Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, Petro Kotin, has told the BBC. Turkey, which has been at the centre of mediation between the west and Russia, rejected Russia’s annexations in Ukraine, calling the Kremlin’s move on four regions a “grave violation” of international law. Ukraine is in full control of the eastern logistics hub of Lyman, Kyiv’s most significant battlefield gain in weeks, which a senior official said could provide a staging post for further gains to the east, Reuters reports. “As of 1230 (0930 GMT), Lyman is fully cleared,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a short video clip on his Telegram channel. There was no comment from the Russian armed forces on Sunday on the status of the city. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday it was pulling troops out of the area “in connection with the creation of a threat of encirclement”. The latest stinging setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin came after he proclaimed the annexation of four regions covering nearly a fifth of Ukraine on Friday, an area that includes Lyman. Kyiv and the West have condemned the proclamation as an illegitimate farce. Russian forces captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had used it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region. Losing it is Russia’s largest battlefield loss since Ukraine’s lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region last month. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region that neighbours Donetsk, said control over Lyman could help Ukraine reclaim lost territory in his region, whose full capture Moscow announced in early July after weeks of grinding advances. “The liberation of this city in the Donetsk region is one of the key factors for the further de-occupation of the Luhansk region,” Gaidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday. Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins’s pro-Western centrist party has won elections in Latvia while parties supported by the Baltic state’s large Russian-speaking minority have suffered major setbacks, AFP reports. With almost all ballots from Saturday’s vote counted, Karins’s New Unity party was in first place with 18.94 percent while the Harmony party, traditionally backed by Russian speakers, may not have won enough votes to enter parliament. Harmony came first in the last election in 2018. The results showed other centrist parties coming second and third and just one party associated with Russian-speakers, Stability!, scraping past the threshold to enter parliament with 6.75 percent. The Russian-speaking minority in Latvia makes up around 30 percent of the population. AFP has an interesting report on Germany’s rush to find home-grown energy and escape reliance on Moscow. Here’s a taste of it: Germany’s most strategically important building site is at the end of a windswept pier on the North Sea coast, where workers are assembling the country’s first terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Starting this winter, the rig, close to the port of Wilhelmshaven, will be able to supply the equivalent of 20 percent of the gas that was until recently imported from Russia. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has throttled gas supplies to Germany, while the Nord Stream pipelines which carried huge volumes under the Baltic Sea to Europe were damaged last week in what a Danish-Swedish report called “a deliberate act.” In the search for alternative sources, the German government has splashed billions on five projects like the one in Wilhelmshaven. Altogether the new fleet should be able to handle around 25 billion cubic metres of gas per year, roughly equivalent to half the capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Lyman is now “fully cleared” of Russian forces, Zelenskiy has declared in a short video on his Telegram channel. The Pope has said it is “absurd” that the world is facing a nuclear threat over Ukraine, Reuters reports. Calling for a ceasefire “in the name of God”, he appealed to the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to find a way out of the crisis. This is Robyn Vinter, taking over the Ukraine blog for a while. Russian shelling of the Kharkiv region is continuing alongside urgent attempts to demine the area, its governor says. Governor Oleg Sinegubov said on Telegram that shelling had been particularly heavy in the city of Kupyansk and its surrounding area as well as Vovchansk and the village of Gatishche in Chuguyiv district. A 71-year-old woman was hospitalised with an injury during the day in Kupyan district, he said the regional centre of emergency medical assistance had reported. He also said that 704 explosive devices had already been neutralised in the last day. Star Wars actor Mark Hamill has said Ukraine needs more drones to fight off the Russian invasion and compared Moscow to the dark side of the Force in the film series. Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the films, was made an ambassador to the United24 project – which Ukraine set up to elicit donations of drones to the Ukrainian army – by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that he had discussed parallels with the cult films and the current war in Ukraine with Zelenskiy. “[Zelenskiy] did reference the movies and it’s not hard to understand why,” Hamill said, “I mean, Star Wars was always a fairy tale for children and fairy tales are morality tales of good versus evil, where good is clearly defined, evil is clearly defined and it’s not hard to extrapolate an evil empire with Russia invading a sovereign nation.” Asked whether the platform would be used to supply lethal technology, he answered: “Ukraine needs drones. They have some drones, but not nearly as many as the Russians.” Hamill also paid tribute to President Zelenskiy, saying: “I was really fascinated with this man... because he’s been absolutely heroic. And the Ukrainian people have been inspirational. He’s an amazing man.” Hamill said participating in the project was “a chance to use [the popularity of the films’] for good and I feel a great responsibility to try and do everything I can to further the Ukrainian cause.” Luke Harding reporting in Kyiv has contrasted Ukraine’s success in Lyman with the propaganda about the state of the war on the streets of Moscow. He writes in The Observer today: The banner hanging near Red Square was triumphant. It read: “Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Russia! Together for ever!” On Friday Vladimir Putin formally announced the annexation of these Ukrainian territories and celebrated with a victory concert in Moscow. Russia’s president addressed a cheering crowd waving white blue and red tricolours. “Welcome home,” he said. “Russia! Russia!” they replied. For ever turned out to mean less than 24 hours. As workmen dismantled the stage, put up on the cobbled square outside the Kremlin, Ukrainian troops marched into the eastern city of Lyman, from where Putin’s army had just made an inglorious retreat. At one point Lyman’s liberators even performed a victory dance, hopping cheerfully from side to side along a sandy forest path. They were, according to the Kremlin’s version of reality, encroaching on Russia’s sovereign territory. In his angry west-bashing speech on Friday, delivered before Russia’s supine government, Putin had declared that Donetsk province which includes Lyman would be officially incorporated into the Russian federation. It was, he suggested, a restoration of historical Russian lands.

SoundCloud was accused of distributing “false information” about what Moscow calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine by communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor (RKN). It follows existing bans on Facebook and Instagram. “Roskomnadzor restricted access to the SoundCloud service in connection with placement of materials containing false information regarding the nature of the special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,” the Interfax news agency reported on Sunday, citing RKN. It said the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office had ordered the blocking of service. The ban-worthy information apparently related to warfare methods, including “attacks on civilians, strikes on civilian infrastructure, about numerous civilian casualties at the hands of Russian soldiers”. The Ukrainian armed forces have updated their estimate of Russian casualties in the war so far. As of this morning they claim that around 60,110 Russian soldiers have been killed and 2,377 tanks destroyed. They said Moscow lost 500 soldiers in the last 24 hours, suffering the greatest losses in Kramatorsk and Bakhmut. The Polish weekly news magazine, Wprost, has this powerful image of Putin on its cover this week for a discussion of how the energy crisis is playing into Moscow’s hands. Mark Townsend has a report in today’s Observer about neo-Nazi Task Force Rusich mercenaries fighting in Ukraine for Russia. He writes: A neo-Nazi pro-Kremlin group active in Ukraine is inciting atrocities against prisoners of war and explicitly advocates the torture of captives including “removing body parts”. The self-styled “Task Force Rusich” is fighting in Ukraine on behalf of the Kremlin and is linked to the notorious Wagner Group mercenaries. A message on Rusich’s Telegram channel sent on 22 September advocates the “destruction of prisoners on the spot”. Adam Hadley, executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, a London-based initiative supported by the United Nations, said: “Rusich, an openly neo-Nazi group highly likely operating on behalf of the Kremlin, has promoted the commission of war crimes in the conflict. “Despite Putin’s claims, the actions of Rusich in the conflict demonstrate the concerning prominence of neo-Nazi groups committing atrocities on behalf of the Kremlin.” Rusich fighters, known for their brutality in Syria and the 2014 war in Crimea, have been spotted on open sources in Ukraine’s Donbas region, Kherson and in the Kharkiv region. You can read more of his article here The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has called for the release of the director-general of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ihor Murashov was leaving the plant on Friday when he was detained and “driven in an unknown direction” while blindfolded, Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom said on Saturday. The International Atomic Energy Agency said his detention by Russia posed a threat to safety and security. The agency posted on Twitter late on Saturday night: “IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi expressed the hope that Mr Murashov will return to his family safely and promptly and will be able to resume his important functions at the plant.” From an elegant mansion in Kyiv’s government quarter, Tamila Tasheva is planning what the Ukrainian takeover of Crimea might look like. Tasheva, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s top representative for Crimea, and her team spend their days discussing issues such as how many Ukrainian teachers or police should be sent to the peninsula if Kyiv regains control, and what else would be required to help reverse eight years of Russian rule. No serious military analyst is suggesting that Ukraine is close to being in a position to regain Crimea, but the idea feels much less fanciful than it did a year ago. Shaun Walker in Kyiv has the full story: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pledged that within a week more areas will follow the capture of Lyman by Ukrainian forces. Agence France-Presse reports that the retaking of Lyman, which Moscow’s forces had pummelled for weeks to control, would mark the first Ukrainian military victory in territory that the Kremlin has claimed as its own and has vowed to defend by all possible means. Ukraine’s defence ministry announced its forces were “entering” Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region after the army said it had “encircled” several thousand Russian troops near the town. The ministry posted a video of soldiers holding up a Ukrainian flag near a sign with the town’s name. Zelenskiy said in his evening video address: Throughout this week, more Ukrainian flags have been raised in the Donbas. There will be even more in a week. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of killing 24 civilians, including 13 children, in an attack on a road convoy near a recently recaptured town in Kharkiv. Ukrainian troops on Friday had shown Agence France-Presse reporters a group of vehicles riddled with bullet holes and several corpses in civilian clothes, a short distance east of the recently recaptured town of Kupiansk. A Ukrainian official said on Sunday that the death toll of a Russian attack on a separate civilian convoy near the city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday had risen to 30 civilians and one police officer killed, the news agency reported. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, has said the Russian military in its current state was almost certainly unable to operate on a nuclear battlefield, even though it has historically trained its units to do so. “The chaotic agglomeration of exhausted contract soldiers, hastily mobilised reservists, conscripts and mercenaries that currently comprise the Russian ground forces could not function in a nuclear environment,” Reuters reported ISW analysts as saying. Any areas affected by Russian tactical nuclear weapons would thus be impassable for the Russians, likely precluding Russian advances. Ukraine’s battlefield successes have infuriated Putin allies such as Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia’s southern Chechnya region, who said he believed “more drastic measures” should be taken by Moscow, including “the use of low-yield nuclear weapons”. Other top officials, including former president Dmitry Medvedev, have suggested Russia may need to resort to nuclear weapons, but Kadyrov’s call was the most explicit. The US defence secretary has welcomed the capture by Ukrainian forces of Lyman, a key Russian stronghold in eastern Ukraine. Lloyd Austin told a news conference on Saturday: We’re very encouraged by what we’re seeing right now. Reuters reports Austin noted that Lyman was positioned across supply lines that Russia has used to push its troops and material down to the south and to the west. Without those routes, it will be more difficult. So it presents a sort of a dilemma for the Russians going forward Austin did not say whether he thought Ukraine’s capture of Lyman – in the Donetsk region – might prompt Russian escalation, although US officials have widely denounced Russia’s nuclear rhetoric in recent days and President Joe Biden has publicly urged Putin not to use nuclear weapons. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. As it approaches 9.15am in Kyiv, here’s a rundown on the latest news and overnight developments. Russia suffered a humiliating military defeat on Saturday when Ukrainian troops liberated the key eastern city of Lyman, with videos showing them raising a national flag and performing a victory dance. Russia’s ministry of defence admitted its soldiers had retreated. They had been “withdrawn to more advantageous lines”, the ministry said, after their encirclement by Ukrainian forces. The defeat is an embarrassment for Vladimir Putin, who declared on Friday that the city – in the Donetsk region – was Russia’s “for ever”. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, made a surprise visit to Ukraine – her first since Russia’s invasion in February – as Kyiv urged Berlin to send it battle tanks.

Belarus is preparing to receive Russian soldiers and equipment, the Kyiv Independent reports. There are about 1,000 Russian soldiers in the country. Ukraine’s ambassador to Canada said her country held Russia to account for violating Ukraine’s sovereign airspace by bombing airports, which goes against the 1944 agreement setting out core principles for global aviation. Yuliya Kovaliv told Reuters it was important that all members of the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) addressed “such a drastic breach of the Chicago convention”. Russia failed to win enough votes for re-election to the ICAO’s governing council. The French representative told the assembly after Saturday’s ballot: “When we have votes in our countries, if we don’t like the result, we don’t ask for another vote.” Russia had a place on the UN aviation agency’s 36-member council as one of the “states of chief importance in air transport”.

Brokers are being warned that the sale of MySky, built for Igor Kesaev – sanctioned over the supply of weapons to the Russian army – should not be advertised online. Russia has accused the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, of violating the game’s principles by suggesting that Russian athletes might be allowed to return to competition provided they did not support the invasion of Ukraine. Bach told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: “This war has not been started by the Russian athletes.” Russian authorities informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “temporarily detained” for questioning. Ihor Murashov was detained on his way from the Russian-occupied plant – Europe’s largest – to the town of Enerhodar at about 4pm on Friday. Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, Petro Kotin, has told the BBC. Kharkiv oblast’s governor said Ukrainian authorities found the bodies of at least 20 people in a civilian convoy near the city of Kupiansk. Oleh Syniehubov believed they were killed while they attempted to flee Russian soldiers, according to the Kyiv Independent.

The Ukrainian president shared video footage showing massive destruction at the hospital – a combined 600-bed complex with children’s and maternity wards – in the southern port city that has been under relentless bombardment for nine days. “A children’s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?” said Zelenskiy on Telegram. “Hospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. The aerial bombing of a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.” The White House condemned the attack as “barbaric” while US House lawmakers voted to rush through a $13.6bn aid package that would increase military and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its European allies. The aid includes $6.5bn for the US costs of sending troops and weapons to eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there, and $6.8bn to care for refugees and provide economic support to allies. Senate approval is expected within days. The House also passed a bill banning Russia oil imports. US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she talked to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for 45 minutes on Wednesday. She said they discussed the weapons and other assistance his country needs and “the crimes against humanity that [Vladimir] Putin is committing”, including the maternity hospital air strike. “This is the beast that Putin is,” Pelosi said. Pelosi indicated the $13.6bn US aid package was likely to be just the tip of a much broader aid effort. “All of us will have to do more” to help Ukraine in coming weeks or months and over the long term to help it rebuild, Pelosi said, referring to the US and Nato allies. The US meanwhile warned Russia could be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in the war. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making “false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine”, and added that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing. “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” she tweeted. The concerns came as UK intelligence highlighted the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. In an update on Thursday, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the large Russian column north-west of Kyiv had made “little progress in over a week” and suffers continued losses at the hands of Ukraine forces. The MoD said there had been a noticeable drop in Russian air activity in recent days, likely due to the “unexpected effectiveness” of the Ukraine forces. It also said Russia has deployed conscript troops despite assurances from Putin not to do so. As the Russian president seeks to regain momentum, local authorities described the damage to the Mariupol hospital as “colossal” and said women in labour were among the wounded. A local official said the attack injured at least 17 staff, though no deaths were immediately reported. Zelenskiy said the “direct strike by Russian troops” had left children under the wreckage. The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said Mariupol was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.” The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. The Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as “apocalyptic”, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was “catastrophic”. Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis. Journalists have described corpses lying unburied in the streets and hungry residents breaking into stores in search of food, and melting snow for water while thousands sheltered in basements. The Russian army had also “shot and bombed” a humanitarian corridor agreed with Moscow and intended to allow civilians a safe route out, the deputy mayor of the city said, mined the road, and installed a checkpoint. Of an estimated 200,000 people desperate to leave, only 2,000 to 3,000 a day were able to. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy said at least 35,000 civilians were able to leave the cities of Sumy, Enerhodar and areas around Kyiv. He said he hoped the evacuations would continue on Thursday with three more routes set to open out of Mariupol, Volnovakha in the south-east and Izyum in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was “at the maximum” and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not. Speaking in Washington, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated the Nato position that a no-fly zone would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia. The conflict has also raised fears of a nuclear accident in a country with major nuclear plants and the site of the Chernobyl disaster. The UN’s atomic watchdog said Wednesday it saw “no critical impact on safety” at Chernobyl, location of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, despite a loss of power there. But it warned it was not receiving updates from either Chernobyl or Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is also now under Russian control. The UK said the Russians had confirmed the use of a thermobaric rocket system. The weapons, also known as vacuum bombs, suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. Three rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must “demilitarise” and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it halts what it calls a “special military operation” aimed at ensuring Russia’s security. Moscow insisted on Wednesday it would prefer to reach its goals through negotiation. In other developments: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has landed in Turkey for the face-to-face talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since Russia invaded. Kuleba warned in a Facebook video his expectations were “limited”. So far, the parties have been engaged in lower-level talks in Belarus, largely over humanitarian issues and involving only Ukrainian officials. Leaders of the 27-nation EU are to meet in Versailles on Thursday and Friday.

Washington appeared surprised by the announcement by Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, who said on Tuesday that his government was “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein airbase and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America.” The Pentagon appeared to reject the proposal, saying it was not “tenable”. In a statement, the US Department of Defense said the prospect of the jets departing from the base in Germany “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance”. “We will continue to consult with Poland and our other Nato allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said. The dispute came as Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defence Control Centre, said Russian forces would “observe a regime of silence” from 7am GMT to ensure safe passage for civilians wishing to leave Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. It was unclear if the proposed routes would pass through Russia or Belarus, conditions previously opposed by the Ukrainian government. Authorities in Kyiv have previously accused Moscow of shelling a similar refugee corridor meant to allow residents to escape the devastated port of Mariupol. “The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook on Tuesday, adding that the Russian army “did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city”. The International Committee of the Red Cross said many Mariupol residents face an “apocalyptic” situation, with no water, power or heating. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said 5,000 civilians were successfully evacuated from the Sumy region on Tuesday, where 21 people had been killed in air strikes on Tuesday. The Polish incident has exposed cracks in the Nato alliance which the Biden administration has struggled to keep in lockstep in the face of the Russian invasion. Vice President Kamala Harris is due to hold talks with the Polish government in Warsaw on Thursday where she will attempt to repair some of the diplomatic damage.The US said on Tuesday that it was deploying two of its Patriot antimissile batteries to Poland to help protect Nato troops and territory. The deployment is intended to provide a layer of protection against the Ukraine conflict spilling over the country’s western border. “This defensive deployment is being conducted proactively to counter any potential threat to US and allied forces and Nato territory,” the US European Command said in a statement. In other developments: Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reportedly declined to arrange calls with Joe Biden in recent weeks as the US seeks to increase oil supply after formally banning Russian oil imports on Tuesday, pushing oil prices to $130 a barrel, the highest level in 14 years. Venezuela released at least two jailed US citizens on Tuesday, according to multiple sources, in an apparent goodwill gesture. It follows a visit to Caracas by a high-level US delegation that focused not only on the fate of Americans held in Venezuela, but on the possibility of easing US oil sanctions on the Opec member, which is a close Russian ally. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is no longer transmitting data to the UN’s atomic watchdog, the agency said, as it voiced “deep concern” for staff working under Russian guard at the captured Ukrainian facility. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi voiced fears for nuclear safety and offered to travel to the site. Foreign volunteers will qualify for Ukrainian citizenship, first deputy interior minister Yevhen Yenin said in a TV interview. Nearly 20,000 people from 52 countries have signed up to become volunteers in the war with Russia. More western brands continued to suspend operations in Russia, with Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Pepsi joining McDonald’s in halting sales. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Russia that any attack on supply lines in Nato countries carrying arms and ammunition to Ukraine would be grounds for retaliation. “An attack on Nato territory, on Nato forces, Nato capabilities, that would be an attack on Nato,” Stoltenberg said. British foreign secretary Liz Truss will meet her US counterpart Antony Blinken in Washington on Wednesday to discuss what more can be done to help Ukraine and reduce energy dependency on Russia. Truss called the invasion of Ukraine “a wake-up call for free democracies”. Poland is thought to have 28 of the Soviet-era MiG-29 warplanes, and had been in negotiation with the Biden administration on a three-way deal in which Warsaw would gave the planes to Ukraine, on condition that the US would provide the Polish air force with newer US fighters. “Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” Rau said in a statement on his ministry’s website. “Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.” Rau requested other Nato allies with MiG-29 jets – a reference to Slovakia and Bulgaria – “act in the same vein”. By handing them to the US, Poland was hoping to mitigate the risk of direct retaliation from Russia. However, the US under secretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Nuland, said the Polish announcement had taken Washington unawares, calling it a “surprise move by the Poles”. “To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they plan to give these planes to us,” Nuland told Congress. “I look forward when this hearing is over to getting back to my desk and seeing how we will respond to this proposal of theirs to give the planes to us.” The idea of donating old warplanes to Ukraine was raised on 27 February by the EU foreign and security policy chief, Josep Borrell, who declared: “We are going to provide even fighter jets.” That announcement annoyed Polish officials, who said Warsaw was not properly consulted over a move that could expose the country to risk. The Russian defence ministry did not address the issue directly but warned that any country that provided air fields for Ukrainian warplanes that were later used against Russians would be considered by Moscow as being involved in the conflict. Polish thinking is that when the planes are delivered to Ukrainian pilots, they will be taking off from an air base in Germany as US assets. Poland announced its plan as US officials said the war in Ukraine had reached a pivotal moment, with Russia sustaining severe losses but with Putin determined to press on. “I think the next couple of days are going to be critical for both the humanitarian situation and also for the tide of this war,” Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told the Guardian. US intelligence agencies told Congress on Tuesday that they tentatively estimated that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far, but that Putin would persevere in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. “We assess Putin feels aggrieved the west does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,” the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the House intelligence committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/08/we-couldnt-stand-it-the-ukrainians-travelling-for-days-to-flee-russian-bombs-and-rockets","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-08T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"‘We couldn’t stand it’: the Ukrainians travelling for days to flee Russian bombs and rockets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/we-couldnt-stand-it-the-ukrainians-travelling-for-days-to-flee-russian-bombs-and-rockets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/08/we-couldnt-stand-it-the-ukrainians-travelling-for-days-to-flee-russian-bombs-and-rockets","fields":{"headline":"‘We couldn’t stand it’: the Ukrainians travelling for days to flee Russian bombs and rockets","bodyText":"After four days on the road, sleeping in her car, Ludmila Lyskevska was in a defiant mood. “Putin has gone bonkers. He wants Ukraine to be part of his imperium,” she said, stretching her legs as snow fell from a white sky. “He’s managed to unite the whole country against him.” Lyskevska was travelling in a three-car family convoy. The group was part of a vast caravan of vehicles waiting to leave war-stricken Ukraine and cross the border into Poland. Over the course of a 20-minute conversation, her group advanced a mere 100 metres. They had been queueing for 20 hours. Behind her, more cars arrived. A pensioner, she set off on Friday from the southern city of Zaporizhia on the Dnipro river. Why did they escape? “The Russians were closing in. They seized our nuclear power plant,” she said. “We feared an explosion.” She left with her daughter, son-in-law, three grandkids and a dog, now being walked on the grass next to a petrol station. Across Ukraine, millions of people are similarly on the move. As of Sunday night more than 1.7 million people have fled abroad, with 1 million crossing into Poland, according to the UN. Others had exited western Ukraine for Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova and Romania. It is Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. And it is only just beginning. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has banned men aged 18-60 from leaving the country. More than 60,000 Ukrainian expats have returned home since Russia’s invasion in order to fight. A few men waiting in the queue at the Ukrainian border town of Krakovets said they would drop their families off in Poland before returning home to take up arms. Many of those fleeing had friends and family in enemy Russia. Lyskevska said she had quarrelled with her sister who lives in St Petersburg with her Russian husband. “I rang them up. He told me the Kremlin was only bombing military infrastructure. I asked him to stop watching Russian state TV and said: ‘Our people are dying.’ He doesn’t believe me.” “Putin’s soldiers are killing civilians and shelling cities. They destroy everything. Look at Mariupol,” Lyskevska’s daughter Lena said. During their epic road trip, the family saw a rocket attack when they had parked up for the night. “We heard the explosions. Seven of them. It was terrible,” she said. The route to the border follows Ukraine’s M10 highway. It passes the western city of Lviv and goes through a long stretch of thick pine forest. Along the way are several new checkpoints manned by soldiers and local militia wearing hi-vis jackets. There are sandbags, green camouflage nets, machine-gun posts and piles of logs neatly stacked next to braziers. War feels everywhere. There is also a sense that today’s bitter conflict between Kyiv and Moscow blends with previous historic struggles. Blue and yellow flags fly next to the red and black flag of the Ukrainian insurgent army, which fought against the Red army during the second world war. Roadside billboards read: “It’s our home. We will bury you here” and “Fuck off, Russian warship”, a popular meme. The 12km queue begins on a desolate stretch of road surrounded by yellow scrub and fir trees. Many cars have signs on the windscreen with the word “Deti” – children – in Russian. On Monday the queue was 1,300 vehicles long, plus 500 pedestrians. Some mothers emerged from taxis, and walked the last few kilometres, dragging along children and suitcases. “After seven days sleeping in a Kyiv metro station, we decided to get out,” Marina Pavlova said, explaining that her 13-year-old son, Matvey, had medical issues. She added: “We are Russian speakers. We don’t need Putin to ‘save us’. We have friends like us from Kharkiv. They have vowed to only speak Ukrainian from now on because of what he has done.” Galina Padalko, a communications manager, said she and her husband, Dmytro, left Kharkiv over the weekend, after days of bombardment that saw their flat tremble. A Grad missile landed nearby last Tuesday, blowing the leg off and killing a woman who was out buying supplies. “A couple of rockets fell not far from us. We couldn’t stand it, so we decided to evacuate,” Padalko said. They walked for an hour and half to the train station, stood in a line for eight hours in -3C, and got on a train heading west. Padalko shared a video showing desperate passengers clambering over the rails in darkness before standing in packed carriages. “We travelled for 26 hours in an old electric train to western Ukraine. As we left, the Russian army shot at us,” she said. Stas Mykailov said he and his wife, Daria, decided to flee after a bomb landed close to their kids’ school, in Kharkiv’s Severna Saltivka district. “I’m an engineer. I left my flat, car, job, everything. It’s gone.” The family left by train and travelled for 18 hours. “It was very hard. Some people hadn’t brought enough water. Volunteers gave us water and apples,” he said. Mykailov said Russia was to blame for the conflict and could go “fuck itself”. “The situation is shit. I have Russian relatives. They don’t understand what’s going on here. A friend of mine called his mum in St Petersburg and she told him he was making a fuss. He shouted at her. He said he wouldn’t talk to her again until she had burned her Russian passport.” After arranging a lift to safety for his wife and two small children, Mykailov returned to the city of Lviv, 62km from the Polish border. He checked on their progress via an app on the Telegram platform that gives real-time updates. It took them 27 hours to cross, he said. “They made it an hour ago. They were four women and three kids in a car. They will go to a hotel and sleep.” He added: “At first the Polish border guard didn’t want to let them cross because the car has only five seats. Fortunately, she was a woman and she relented.” Mykailov said since they escaped from Kharkiv, a rocket had buried itself on the roof of his apartment block. “I’m on the 11th floor. It seems we have a flat without windows. The building now has a hole,” he said. Amid this biblical exodus, few refugees had given much thought as to what they might do in Poland. Nobody knew on Monday how long exile might last or whether Ukraine would exist as a sovereign entity by the time they returned. Many expressed support for President Zelenskiy. He has refused US offers of evacuation and has remained in Kyiv, despite great personal risk. Lyskevska’s grandson Dmitriy Hoholenko, who is 16, said he hoped to continue studying in Poland. The war had stopped his education. He and his classmates were too young to fight. They were patriots, he said. “I hope to find a Ukrainian school somewhere in Poland,” he added in English. And long-term? “I want to be a graphic designer,” he replied."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/sep/06/lorry-driver-shortage-strike-threat-two-firms-supply-chain-fears-tesco-owned-booker-hanson","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-06T14:35:17Z","webTitle":"Lorry driver shortage: strike threat at two firms increases supply chain fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/06/lorry-driver-shortage-strike-threat-two-firms-supply-chain-fears-tesco-owned-booker-hanson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/sep/06/lorry-driver-shortage-strike-threat-two-firms-supply-chain-fears-tesco-owned-booker-hanson","fields":{"headline":"Lorry driver shortage: strike threat at two firms increases supply chain fears","bodyText":"The threat of strike action by lorry drivers at two firms supplying the construction industry and convenience stores has raised the prospect of further disruption this autumn amid Britain’s worst supply chain meltdown since the 1970s. A group of drivers at the Booker distribution network, which is part of Tesco, and more than 200 drivers and engineers at Hanson, the cement producer, have moved closer to industrial action in disputes over pay and conditions. Union leaders warned the pay disputes risked deepening the supply shortage crisis hitting many parts of the British economy because of a lack of HGV drivers, coming after years of firms underpaying staff and offering poor working conditions. About 40 drivers employed by Booker at its Thamesmead site in south-east London have voted unanimously for strike action in a dispute over pay – a move that risks severe disruption to deliveries at more than 1,500 small shops operating under the Londis and Budgens brands across the capital and the south-east. Meanwhile, more than 200 lorry drivers and engineers employed by Hanson, on the Castle Cement contract, will hold a ballot for strike action after rejecting a pay offer, raising the threat of further disruption in the construction sector. The drivers supply several key construction projects across the UK, including the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, the HS2 rail line, the Sellafield nuclear decommissioning plant and the Thames Tideway super sewer project. The threat of strike action comes as severe shortages of workers and raw materials trigger widespread disruption across the British economy, in a crisis caused by the fallout from Covid, Brexit and years of underinvestment. Unite, the trade union representing both sets of workers, said the disputes reflected issues with working conditions and pay. At Booker, the union is poised to issue the employer with notice for strike action but wants to allow time for crunch talks with company bosses later this month that could still avert industrial action. The dispute centres on the firm paying a temporary £5 an hour uplift for about 40 drivers at its Hemel Hempstead depot in response to staff shortages – a move not replicated less than 50 miles away at Thamesmead. Paul Travers, a Unite regional officer, said the dispute had been “pockmarked by very poor employment relations” with the company. “This is really ‘smell the coffee’ time for the bosses at Booker.” A Booker spokesman said: “We are naturally disappointed with last week’s ballot result from our Thamesmead drivers but look forward to sitting down with their Unite representatives on 21 September and working together to find a resolution.” Drivers and engineers at Hanson have rejected a pay offer of 2.5% for this year, which union leaders said amounted to a “hefty pay cut”, with the retail price index measure of inflation running at 3.9%. In addition to pay, the workforce is unhappy about the high-handed management style and a marked lack of dignity at work. If strikes do occur, then large and small construction projects will swiftly run short of cement as many only have limited storage facilities, Unite said. Adrian Jones, a Unite national officer, said the solution was in the company’s hands. “The company needs to return to the negotiating table and demonstrate genuine changes to the way our members are managed and make an offer on pay that reflects the current challenges in the industry and the commitment our members give to the company,” he said. “With the ongoing driver shortage, our members are seeking a pay increase which recognises their hard work and dedication.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ten-million-people-have-left-ukraine-since-russian-invasion-un-says-as-first-grain-exports-arrive-in-turkey","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T17:57:20Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Scholz insists turbine at centre of Russian gas row works; 10m Ukraine border crossings since invasion – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ten-million-people-have-left-ukraine-since-russian-invasion-un-says-as-first-grain-exports-arrive-in-turkey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ten-million-people-have-left-ukraine-since-russian-invasion-un-says-as-first-grain-exports-arrive-in-turkey","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Scholz insists turbine at centre of Russian gas row works; 10m Ukraine border crossings since invasion – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of the key developments from today: The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship, Razoni, set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the United Nations. The ship has been inspected by members of the Joint Coordination Centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosporus Strait “shortly”. The Ukrainian president has dismissed the importance of the first grain export shipment from his country since Russia invaded, saying it was carrying a fraction of the crop Kyiv must sell to help salvage its shattered economy. In downbeat comments, Volodymr Zelenskiy’s, via video to students in Australia on Wednesday said more time was needed to see whether other grain shipments would follow. The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its latest invasion of the country on 24 February. Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across Europe. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees. In its latest operation briefing, Russia’s ministry of defence has claimed that its strike on Radekhov in the Lviv region “destroyed a storage base with foreign-made weapons and ammunition delivered to the Kyiv regime from Poland”. Earlier today, Lviv’s governor acknowledged the strike, and said “one building was damaged. Fortunately, no one was hurt.” The UK’s ministry of defence says there is likely to be an increase in civilians attempting to flee Kherson and the surrounding area as hostilities continue and food shortages worsen, putting pressure on transport routes. They have also said that a Ukrainian strike against a Russian ammunition train in Kherson oblast, southern Ukraine, means it is “highly unlikely” the rail link between Kherson and Crimea is operational. Mykola Tochytskyi, deputy minister of foreign affairs, has repeated Ukraine’s request for the skies over nuclear installations to be closed to prevent a potential accident and their misuse. He said “For the first time in history, civil nuclear facilities have been turned into military targets and springboards for the Russian army in breach of the non-proliferation provisions on peaceful use of nuclear energy. The world witnesses how nuclear terrorism, sponsored by the nuclear-weapon state, is arising in reality. The robust joint actions are needed to prevent nuclear disaster at global scale. We ask to close the sky over the nuclear power plants in Ukraine.” The US embassy in Kyiv has criticised what it says is a decision by Roskomnadzor, the Russian government’s media agency, to block a US government website – share.america.gov. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said the US has not offered Russia to resume talks on the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty. The Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, has spoken to the Australian National University, thanking Australia for its support against the Russian invasion. The former German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder has come under fire for a private meeting held with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, after he travelled on holiday to Moscow to meet him. Schröder told German media in a lengthy interview he had nothing to apologise for over his friendship with Putin, whom he met last week during a visit to the Russian capital. German chancellor Olaf Scholz has insisted that Russia had no reason to hold up the return of a gas turbine for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. The turbine is stranded in Germany, following servicing in Canada, in an escalating standoff that has seen has flows to Europe fall to a trickle, just 20% of capacity. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been accused of glorifying war after she retweeted a Ukrainian tweet listing Russia’s war dead – described in an embedded graphic as “eliminated personnel”, before she quickly deleted it. The original tweet from the Ukrainian defence ministry quoted a Robert Burns poem saying “tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty’s in every blow! Let us do or die!” Ukrainian refugees are likely to become victims of rising tensions and disinformation campaigns in their host countries, a report has warned. False reports exaggerating how much aid refugees receive compared with local people, as well as linking refugees with violent crime and political extremism, could cause a breakdown in relations with local communities, the charity World Vision said. UK lawmaker, the Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who is chair of the Commons defence committee in the British parliament in London, has repeated his appeals that Ukraine needs more weapons. Ellwood told viewers of the GB News channel in the UK that the country was “getting better supporting Ukraine, but it’s coming very, very late in the day.” Russia has started creating a military strike force aimed at Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih and warned that Moscow could be preparing new offensive operations in southern Ukraine, Ukraine said on Wednesday. Russia holds swathes of Ukraine’s south that it captured in the early phases of its invasion, but Kyiv has said it will mount a counter-offensive. It said on Tuesday it had already recaptured 53 villages in occupied Kherson region, Reuters reports. We are closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for joining us. Russian energy giant Gazprom has said that delivery of a turbine needed to keep gas flowing to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was “impossible” due to sanctions on Moscow. Gazprom said in a statement: Sanctions regimes in Canada, in the European Union and in Britain, as well as the inconsistencies in the current situation concerning the contractual obligations of (turbine maker) Siemens make the delivery impossible. The statement risks further increasing concern in European countries who suspect Moscow is looking for an excuse to delay the turbine’s return to Russia and further reduce its gas deliveries, AFP reports. Earlier on Wednesday, German chancellor Olaf Scholz accused Russia of blocking the delivery of the key turbine to throttle gas supplies to Europe, as he raised the possibility of keeping nuclear plants going. The continent’s biggest economy has been scrambling for energy sources to fill a gap left by a reduction in gas supplies from Moscow. The delayed return of the turbine from Canada, where the unit was being serviced, was behind an initial reduction in gas deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline in June, according to Gazprom. Supplies via the energy link were further reduced to around 20 percent of capacity in late July, after Gazprom halted the operation of one of the last two operating turbines due to the “technical condition of the engine”. The Ukrainian prisoners of war killed last week in an explosion at their barracks were the victims of a Kremlin special operation plotted in advance and approved at the highest levels, senior government officials in Kyiv have claimed. Citing intelligence, satellite data and phone intercepts, the officials said the inmates were killed in a callous and premeditated war crime. They suggested it was carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group, working closely with Vladimir Putin’s FSB spy agency. The dead Ukrainians were members of the Azov battalion, who defended the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol until their capture in May. They were being held at a prison in Olenivka, close to the frontline and about 10 miles south of occupied Donetsk. An adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said multiple clues pointed to Moscow’s guilt. They said graves were dug next to the barracks shortly before the attack, and a Russian information campaign was launched describing the fighters as terrorists. The prisoners were moved to the building the day before Friday’s explosion. The Russians rebased their artillery near the prison complex in an unsuccessful attempt to draw return Ukrainian fire. “This was a provocation and mass killing by the Russian side. It was organised by Putin’s regime,” claimed the official, who declined to be named. Putin may have personally authorised the attack, they speculated, adding: “Russia is not a democratic state. The dictator is personally responsible for everything, whether it’s the shooting down of MH17, Bucha or Olenivka. For some time we have not seen Mr Putin. When is he going to recognise the atrocities he has committed?” Russia’s defence ministry says Ukrainians destroyed the building using a Himars long-range missile made and supplied by the US. Footage broadcast on Russian television on Friday showed charred bodies, dismembered limbs and tangled metal from bunkbeds, as well as a hole in the prison’s roof. The Biden administration says there are no indications that Ukraine attacked the site. Satellite photos released by Maxar Technologies reveal that surrounding buildings were wholly undamaged. Russian guards escaped without injury. Read the full story here: The former German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder has come under fire for a private meeting held with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, after he travelled on holiday to Moscow to meet him. Schröder told German media in a lengthy interview he had nothing to apologise for over his friendship with Putin, whom he met last week during a visit to the Russian capital. Schröder has come under fierce criticism for his business links to the Russian state-run gas company Gazprom. He was one of the driving forces behind the construction of two Baltic Sea pipelines to carry gas to Europe, one of which was mothballed following the invasion of Ukraine, the other, Nord Stream 1, is only currently delivering 20% of the level of gas expected. Schröder is facing an investigation by the Social Democrats of which he has been a member since 1963, over his Kremlin links and his refusal to distance himself from Putin, and could yet be ejected from the party. In a five-hour long interview with the magazine Stern and the broadcaster RTL he gave no direct insight into the mindset of the Russian leader, but said following his discussions with him he thought the conflict with Russia was “resolvable” but required more negotiations – which Germany and France should lead – and a greater display of sensitivity by the west towards Russia’s “real fears of being hemmed in” by hostile countries, which “feed off historical events” and were “unfortunately also valid”. Looking to the future, Schröder recommended an Austria-style neutrality status for Ukraine, and a Swiss-style arrangement of cantons for what he referred to as the “more complicated” Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He said that both sides needed to show a willingness to compromise. But he would apparently not be drawn into talking about the atrocities which have been carried out by Russian troops since the start of the most recent stage in the conflict, including the massacre in Bucha, the deaths of thousands of civilians across the country, the occupation of eastern and southern regions, the forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainians and allegations the Kremlin is trying to eradicate the population. Regarding the row over why only a fifth – or 30m cubic metres a day – of the expected amount of gas is currently flowing through the Nord Stream pipeline, Schröder said the blame lay at the door of the German company Siemens, which he blamed for failing to deliver a recently serviced turbine to Russia. But according to the German government and to Siemens, it is Moscow that is to blame for its refusal to take delivery of the turbine, which was recently transported from Canada to Germany after a special dispensation was given allowing sanctions against Russia to be temporarily suspended. Read more here: Ukraine’s forecast for its wartime 2022 harvest has increased to 65-67 million tonnes of grain from 60 million tonnes, Denys Shmygal said on Wednesday. In a Telegram message, the prime minister praised farmers for pressing ahead with the harvest despite the war, even in areas where shelling continues. Ukraine has said any negotiated peace settlement with Moscow would be contingent on a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, brushing off comments by ex-German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Schroeder, who is a friend of Vladimir Putin, said he met the Kremlin leader in Moscow last week, that Russia wanted a “negotiated solution” to the war and that there was even the possibility of slowly reaching a cease-fire. In response on Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described Schroeder derisively as a “voice of the Russian royal court”. Russia has started creating a military strike force aimed at Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih and warned that Moscow could be preparing new offensive operations in southern Ukraine, Ukraine said on Wednesday. Russia holds swathes of Ukraine’s south that it captured in the early phases of its invasion, but Kyiv has said it will mount a counter-offensive. It said on Tuesday it had already recaptured 53 villages in occupied Kherson region, Reuters reports. In its regular update on the war in the south, Ukraine’s southern military command described the situation as tense and said Russia attacked along the frontline on Aug. 2. The steel-producing city of Kryvyi Rih where the Ukrainian president grew up lies around 50 km (30 miles) from the southern frontline. The southern military command said: (Russia) has begun creating a strike group in the Kryvyi Rih direction. It’s also quite likely that the enemy is preparing a hostile counter-offensive with the subsequent plan of getting to the administrative boundary of Kherson region. Ukraine has been trying to ratchet up pressure on Russia’s positions in the strategically important Black Sea region of Kherson and has used Western-supplied long-range weapons to conduct strikes on Russian supply lines and ammunition dumps. Ukraine’s military said in a statement that Russian forces were scoping out basements in the region to turn them into bomb shelters to store military hardware. UK lawmaker, the Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who is chair of the Commons defence committee in the British parliament in London, has repeated his appeals that Ukraine needs more weapons. Ellwood told viewers of the GB News channel in the UK that the country was “getting better supporting Ukraine, but it’s coming very, very late in the day.” “Let’s recognise we still see Nato sitting on its hands,” he said. “There’s a fire in Ukraine, and we won’t put it out. My concern is that fire will spread beyond Ukraine and we really will have to wake up.” Ellwood raise concerns about possible further Russian expansion westwards, saying “There’s always a risk when you take on an adversary. There’s also risk in doing nothing allowing Russia to expand not just in Ukraine. I was recently in Moldova next door, which is not part of Nato, a very small country, very limited armed forces. They feel very, very vulnerable indeed.” Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, has posted to Telegram to say that an older man has been injured in a Russian attack this afternoon. He told his followers: In the afternoon, the enemy twice covered Kryvorizky district with fire. Hit the Zelenodolsk community with cluster shells from the “Hurricanes”. A 73-year-old man was injured. He is in the hospital. Several dozen private houses were damaged. Specialists are working on the spot. The claims have not been independently verified. German chancellor Olaf Scholz has insisted that Russia had no reason to hold up the return of a gas turbine for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. The turbine is stranded in Germany, following servicing in Canada, in an escalating standoff that has seen has flows to Europe fall to a trickle, just 20% of capacity. Standing next to the turbine on a factory visit to Siemens Energy in Muelheim an der Ruhr, Scholz said it was fully operational and could be shipped back to Russia at any time – provided Moscow was willing to take it back. “The turbine works,” Scholz said, telling reporters: It’s quite clear and simple: the turbine is there and can be delivered, but someone needs to say ‘I want to have it’. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed a lack of documentation for holding up the turbine’s return to Russia. The first shipment of over 26,000 tons of Ukrainian food under a Black Sea export deal was cleared to proceed on Wednesday, towards its final destination in Lebanon, according to the United Nations. A team carried out a three-hour inspection and confirmed the crew and cargo are authorized and were consistent with the information received by the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) before the vessel left Odesa, said a statement from the United Nations Information Service Vienna. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Vladimir Putin’s purported lover has been hit with sanctions from the US government’s treasury department over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Alina Kabaeva, 39, landed on the latest update to the federal Office of Foreign Assets Control’s specially designated nationals list, freezing any of her assets in the US and generally prohibiting Americans from dealing with her. The move came a little more than three months after the White House said Kabaeva, a famed former rhythmic gymnast, nor anyone else was safe from sanctions, even after her last-minute removal from a round of such penalties in April. UK officials had similarly sanctioned Kabaeva – who now is chairperson of Russia’s New Media Group, the country’s largest private media company – in May. Western countries have levied economic penalties at associates and loved ones of Putin to punish the Russian president, 69, for his decision to invade Ukraine in February. The US has avoided a direct confrontation with Russia over the invasion, though it has provided billions of dollars in weapons and other resources to help Ukraine. The Kremlin has long denied that Putin, who is divorced, is romantically involved with Kabaeva, but various published reports suggest that she is the mother of at least some of his children. A Moscow newspaper which, in 2008, reported that Putin and Kabaeva were involved despite his still being married at the time was shut down soon after for unclear reasons. Ukrainian refugees are likely to become victims of rising tensions and disinformation campaigns in their host countries, a report has warned. False reports exaggerating how much aid refugees receive compared with local people, as well as linking refugees with violent crime and political extremism, could cause a breakdown in relations with local communities, the charity World Vision said. In its report, Warm Welcomes, Lurking Tensions, the humanitarian organisation said anti-refugee messaging was already spreading on social media and “niche media outlets” in neighbouring countries. About 8.8 million people, mainly women, children and elderly people, have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, with many making their way to border countries such as Romania, Moldova and Poland. The report said: Messaging that could stoke anti-refugee tensions is already being spread in Romania, Moldova, Poland and across central and eastern Europe Whilst not a major issue yet, tensions are beginning to develop in some host countries. Children may face risks such as verbal and physical abuse between refugee and host communities, human trafficking and more as early as February 2023. The international community needs to act now in order to prevent the situation deteriorating to dangerous levels like in Lebanon and Bangladesh. Read the full story here: The level of tension provoked by US house speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan “should not be underestimated,” the Kremlin said on Wednesday. Responding to a question about whether the world was closer to war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that he was not in favour of using that word but reiterated that the visit was a “provocation”. He added that no additional contacts between Russia’s president Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping were planned in light of the visit. Pelosi’s arrival on Tuesday in Taiwan prompted a furious response from Beijing at a time when international tensions were already elevated by the conflict in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president has dismissed the importance of the first grain export shipment from his country since Russia invaded, saying it was carrying a fraction of the crop Kyiv must sell to help salvage its shattered economy. Volodymr Zelenskiy’s downbeat comments, via video to students in Australia on Wednesday, came as an inspection of the ship was completed in Turkey before it continues to its final destination in Lebanon under a deal aimed at easing a global food crisis. The ship, Razoni, departed from Ukraine’s Odesa port on the Black Sea early on Monday carrying 26,527 tonnes of corn to Lebanon’s Tripoli. It followed a U.N.-brokered grain and fertiliser export agreement between Moscow and Kyiv last month - a rare diplomatic breakthrough in a drawn-out war of attrition, Reuters reports. But Zelenskiy, speaking via an interpreter, said more time was needed to see whether other grain shipments would follow. He told the students: Just recently, thanks to the UN in partnership with Turkey, we had a first ship with the delivery of grain, but it’s still nothing. But we hope it’s a tendency that will continue. He said Ukraine had to export a minimum 10 million tonnes of grain to urgently help bring down its budget deficit which was running at $5bn (£4.1bn) a month. The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship, Razoni, set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the United Nations. The ship has been inspected by members of the Joint Coordination Centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosporus Strait “shortly” The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its latest invasion of the country on 24 February. Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across Europe. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees. In its latest operation briefing, Russia’s ministry of defence has claimed that its strike on Radekhov in the Lviv region “destroyed a storage base with foreign-made weapons and ammunition delivered to the Kyiv regime from Poland”. Earlier today, Lviv’s governor acknowledged the strike, and said “one building was damaged. Fortunately, no one was hurt.” The UK’s ministry of defence says there is likely to be an increase in civilians attempting to flee Kherson and the surrounding area as hostilities continue and food shortages worsen, putting pressure on transport routes. They have also said that a Ukrainian strike against a Russian ammunition train in Kherson oblast, southern Ukraine, means it is “highly unlikely” the rail link between Kherson and Crimea is operational. Mykola Tochytskyi, deputy minister of foreign affairs, has repeated Ukraine’s request for the skies over nuclear installations to be closed to prevent a potential accident and their misuse. He said “For the first time in history, civil nuclear facilities have been turned into military targets and springboards for the Russian army in breach of the non-proliferation provisions on peaceful use of nuclear energy. The world witnesses how nuclear terrorism, sponsored by the nuclear-weapon state, is arising in reality. The robust joint actions are needed to prevent nuclear disaster at global scale. We ask to close the sky over the nuclear power plants in Ukraine.” The US embassy in Kyiv has criticised what it says is a decision by Roskomnadzor, the Russian government’s media agency, to block a US government website – share.america.gov. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said the US has not offered Russia to resume talks on the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty. The Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, has spoken to the Australian National University, thanking Australia for its support against the Russian invasion. Gerhard Schroeder, a former German chancellor and friend of Vladimir Putin, said the Russian president wanted a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine and last month’s agreement on grain shipments might offer a way forward. “The good news is that the Kremlin wants a negotiated solution,” Schroeder told Stern weekly and broadcasters RTL/ntv, adding he had met Putin in Moscow last week. “A first success is the grain deal, perhaps that can be slowly expanded to a ceasefire.” Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been accused of glorifying war after she retweeted a Ukrainian tweet listing Russia’s war dead – described in an embedded graphic as “eliminated personnel”, before she quickly deleted it. The original tweet from the Ukrainian defence ministry quoted a Robert Burns poem saying “tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty’s in every blow! Let us do or die!” Ukrainian refugees are likely to become victims of rising tensions and disinformation campaigns in their host countries, a report has warned. False reports exaggerating how much aid refugees receive compared with local people, as well as linking refugees with violent crime and political extremism, could cause a breakdown in relations with local communities, the charity World Vision said. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Nicola Slawson will be here to take you through the next few hours coverage. Reuters has a quick snap to say that the inspection of the ship Razoni, the first to leave Ukraine under the Turkey-brokered grain export deal, has been completed. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires In its latest operation briefing, Russia’s Ministry of Defence has claimed that its strike on Radekhov in the Lviv region “destroyed a storage base with foreign-made weapons and ammunition delivered to the Kyiv regime from Poland.” Earlier today, Lviv’s governor acknowledged the strike, and said “one building was damaged. Fortunately, no one was hurt.” Russia also claims to have shot down five unmanned drones overnight. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been accused of glorifying war after she retweeted a Ukrainian tweet listing Russia’s war dead – described in an embedded graphic as “eliminated personnel”, before she quickly deleted it. The original tweet from the Ukrainian defence ministry quoted a Robert Burns poem saying “tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty’s in every blow! Let us do or die!”, and then listed what the Ukrainian government calculates as Russia’s total combat losses so far. Sturgeon, who presumably wanted to celebrate the Burns quote in the tweet, added a strong arm and Ukrainian flag emoji to her retweet along with the hashtags #RobertBurns and #solidarity. At least one of her Scottish National party allies retweeted it too, with a strong arm emoji. The first minister was quickly accused by her political opponents, and also some pro-independence supporters, of a significant misjudgement. Mercedes Villalba, a left-wing Labour MSP, said: “The first minister of Scotland should not be glorifying war. It is possible to oppose Putin’s invasion of Ukraine without celebrating the deaths of 41,000 people. Take down the post and apologise for this lapse in judgement. This is not what solidarity means.” Here are some of the images that have been sent to us of the inspection delegation boarding the Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship Razoni off the coast of north-west Istanbul.

Read more of Tom Ambrose’s report: Ukrainians at risk from anti-refugee tensions in host countries, report warns Mykola Tochytskyi, deputy minister of foreign affairs, has repeated Ukraine’s request for the skies over nuclear installations to be closed to prevent a potential accident and their misuse. He posted to Twitter saying: The Russian leadership openly threatens the world with its ability to use nuclear weapons, backed by the clear calls to do so by the Russian state media. For the first time in history, civil nuclear facilities have been turned into military targets and springboards for the Russian army in breach of the non-proliferation provisions on peaceful use of nuclear energy. The world witnesses how nuclear terrorism, sponsored by the nuclear-weapon state, is arising in reality. The robust joint actions are needed to prevent nuclear disaster at global scale. We ask to close the sky over the nuclear power plants in Ukraine. To provide air defence systems. Global community need to prove by deeds that aggressor cannot remain utterly safe and unpunished because it possesses nuclear arms. The Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, has spoken to the Australian National University, thanking Australia for its support against the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy decried “hundreds thousands of military crimes” and Russian atrocities in what is the 161st day of the illegal invasion of Ukraine. These included “mass execution of a peaceful population, handcuffing people, put them on their knees, kill them with a shot on their back; and [raping] them in front of the eyes of their own children”. Zelenskiy said: “We are shocked by messages of new Russian atrocities. It shouldn’t be a common thing for the world, that would mean the world had put up with it.” Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure. Zelenskiy thanked Australia, saying: “I’m very thankful to Anthony Albanese for the significant support, the full-scale humanitarian assistance, sanctions against Russian entities; cancelling of [taxes on] Ukrainian goods, [provision of] coal for Ukrainian energy. [Australia has given] the biggest military support from non-Nato members. “We will be thankful for the continuation of this support. We today need your help, the help of all the civilised countries. We must conquer evil. Thank you for attention – glory to Ukraine.” Ukraine’s president rejected the idea the world needed to allow Russia or Vladimir Putin to save face to bring an end to the war. He said: “One who wants to save face, doesn’t launch rockets from from multi-rocket systems, hit households, doesn’t hit living quarters … doesn’t drop bombs on maternity hospitals, kindergartens, museums, theatres, and temples.” Zelenskiy called again on the US to declare Russia a state-sponsor of terrorism. The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its latest invasion of the country on 24 February. Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across Europe. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees. The UNHCR states that Russia has taken in 1.85 million people from Ukraine, but notes: “The figure for individual refugees recorded in the country is an estimate as potential further movements of returns cannot be factored in for the time being.” Slovakia, Moldova and Romania have taken in excess of 80,000 each. Among countries not bordering Ukraine, Germany (670,000), Czech Republic (400,402) and Italy (146,451) have the most Ukrainians “registered for temporary protection or similar schemes”. An earlier headline on this live blog erroneously said 10 million people had left Ukraine, rather than there having been 10m border crossings. The US embassy in Kyiv has criticised what it says is a decision by Roskomnadzor, the Russian government’s media agency, to block a US government website – share.america.gov. It quotes Ned Price, US state department spokesperson, accusing Roskomnadzor of being an agency that “monitors, controls and censors” the media, and describing the website as one that “spreads stories about American ingenuity and values and reports the truth about the war in Ukraine”. “The Kremlin is afraid of this,” it adds. Russia made the move to block the website this week. Earlier in the war, Russia cut access to several foreign news organisations’ websites, including the BBC and Deutsche Welle, for spreading what it alleged was false information about its war in Ukraine. Another Ukrainian governor, Vitaly Kim of Mykolaiv, has posted his operational status update for the day. Among a detailed list of areas and buildings struck in his region, he says that in all cases there were either no casualties, or information about casualties is still being gathered. He says that in the early hours of today four cruise missiles were intercepted and destroyed over the region. He claims that in an attack at 5am this morning a supermarket was destroyed in Mykolaiv, and “multi-storey buildings, a pharmacy, shops, and the road surface were damaged”. He also says that “the territory of the equestrian sports school was hit”. The claims have not been independently verified. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has posted to Telegram to give a status update. He said: Yesterday, during an air alert, the enemy launched a missile attack on a military infrastructure object near Radekhov (Chervonograd district). As a result of the impact, one building was damaged. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The Russian occupiers fired eight rockets from the Caspian Sea into the territory of Ukraine. Six of them were shot down by anti-aircraft missile troops, another one was shot down by an Air Force fighter jet. We thank our fighters for protection and efficient work. Radekhov is in the Lviv oblast and about 75km to the north-east of the city of Lviv. Kozytskyi also said that 285 people arrived in Lviv on evacuation trains from the east of the country yesterday, and that 795 people departed to Przemyśl in Poland. In the last few minutes Interfax has reported that Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said the US has not offered Russia to resume talks on the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty. This is Martin Belam taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons. I will be here for the next few hours. The latest intelligence update from the UK Ministry of Defence is out. The ministry says there is likely to be an increase in civilians attempting to flee Kherson and the surrounding area as hostilities continue and food shortages worsen, putting pressure on transport routes. They have also said that a Ukrainian strike against a Russian ammunition train in Kherson oblast, southern Ukraine, means it is “highly unlikely” the rail link between Kherson and Crimea is operational. That full update is here: Gerhard Schroeder, a former German chancellor and friend of Vladimir Putin, said the Russian president wanted a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine and last month’s agreement on grain shipments might offer a way forward. “The good news is that the Kremlin wants a negotiated solution,” Schroeder told Stern weekly and broadcasters RTL/ntv, adding he had met Putin in Moscow last week. “A first success is the grain deal, perhaps that can be slowly expanded to a ceasefire.” Russia and Ukraine struck a deal last month to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports and the first ship carrying Ukrainian grain to world markets since Moscow’s invasion five months ago arrived in Turkey overnight. Schroeder said solutions to crucial problems such as Crimea could be found over time, “maybe not over 99 years, like Hong Kong, but in the next generation”. He said an alternative to Nato membership for Ukraine might be armed neutrality, such as with Austria. The future of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, the scene of fierce fighting, however, was more complicated. “A solution based on the Swiss cantonal model will have to be found,” he said, adding it would have to be seen if Putin would go back to a pre-war “contact line” in a ceasefire. Schroeder, German chancellor from 1998 to 2005, has criticised the war in Ukraine but refused to condemn Putin, whom he still calls a close personal friend. Increasingly derided in Germany for his pro-Russia stance, Schroeder has been stripped of his right to a publicly funded office. The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship, Razoni, set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the United Nations that it is hoped will get millions of tonnes of trapped Ukrainian produce to world markets and curb a global food crisis. A senior official said Ankara expected roughly one grain ship to leave Ukraine every day as long as the export agreement holds. The UN Refugee Agency has reported that the number of border crossings from Ukraine has passed 10m for the first time since Russia invaded the country. If you’re just waking up or tuning in, here’s some more for you to catch up on: A group of Russian soldiers have accused their commanders of jailing them in eastern Ukraine for refusing to take part in the war. About 140 soldiers were detained and four have filed complaints with an investigative committee, said Maxim Grebenyuk, head of Moscow-based group Military Ombudsman. Russia has accused the US of being “directly involved” in the war by supplying targeting information for Ukraine’s long-range missile strikes. Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s acting deputy head of military intelligence, denied US officials were providing direct targeting information but acknowledged there was consultation. The US has imposed sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s supposed girlfriend. Alina Kabaeva, 39, was mentioned in the latest update to the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s specially designated nationals list – freezing any of her assets in the US and generally prohibiting Americans from dealing with her. Russia’s supreme court has designated the Azov regiment – a former volunteer battalion that was incorporated into Ukraine’s army – a “terrorist” organisation, allowing for lengthy jail terms for its members. The G7 is threatening to further deprive Russia of revenue by blocking services that enable the transportation of its oil globally if it doesn’t heed the proposed oil price cap. Russia has already stated it will not obey the cap and will ship to nations that don’t support the price ceiling. Russia has carried out deadly strikes against Ukrainians in the eastern Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions, according to Reuters, which said it was yet to verify the battle reports.

You can follow all the latest at our new blog here: Reuters: The United States will work with allies to transfer Soviet-made tanks to Ukraine to bolster its defences in the Donbas region, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing a US official. The transfers, requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, would begin soon, the unnamed official said, according to the Times. The official declined to say how many tanks would be sent or from which countries they would come, the paper said. The Pentagon declined to comment to Reuters. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The tanks would allow Ukraine to conduct long-range artillery strikes on Russian targets in the Donbas region of southeastern Ukraine bordering Russia, the official said, according to the Times. It marks the first time in the war that the United States has helped transfer tanks, the newspaper said. A senior Chinese diplomat says the government is not deliberately circumventing sanctions on Russia. Speaking on Saturday, a day after a virtual summit between China and the European Union, Wang Lutong told reporters that China is contributing the global economy by conducting normal trade with Russia. Wang is the director-general of European affairs at China’s foreign ministry. According to the Reuters report, Wang also said Ukraine, Iran, and others were “points of cooperation” rather than points of friction. Associated Press reports on the annual Russian conscription campaign which began this week. A few hours ago Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy urged Russian families to keep their sons at home, warning it was “guaranteed death for many young guys”. As Moscow’s forces bog down in Ukraine, many young Russians of draft age are increasingly jittery about the prospect of being sent into combat. Making those fears particularly acute is an annual spring conscription that began Friday and aims to round up 134,500 men for a one-year tour of military duty. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu pledged at a meeting of the military brass this week that the new recruits won’t be sent to front lines or “hot spots.” But the statement was met with skepticism by many in Russia who remember the separatist wars in the southern republic of Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s, when thousands of poorly trained young men were killed. “I don’t trust them when they say they won’t send conscripts into combat. They lie all the time,” said Vladislav, a 22-year-old who is completing his studies and fears he could face the draft immediately after graduation. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing reprisals. All Russian men ages 18 to 27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoid the draft for health reasons or get deferments granted to university students. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities. Even as President Vladimir Putin and his officials say that conscripts aren’t involved in what Russian authorities call “the special military operation in Ukraine,” many appeared to have been taken prisoner during its initial days. Videos emerged from Ukraine of captured Russians, some being shown calling their parents, and were put on social media. The mother of one of the prisoners said she recognised her 20-year-old draftee son in a video even though he was shown blindfolded. “I recognised him by his lips, by his chin. You know, I would have recognised him by his fingers,” said the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Lyubov, for security reasons. “I breastfed him. I raised him.” The Defense Ministry was forced to walk back its statements and acknowledge that some conscripts were sent to Ukraine “by mistake” and were taken prisoner while serving with a supply unit away from the front. There have been allegations that before the invasion, some conscripts were forced to sign military contracts that allowed them to be sent into combat — duty that is normally reserved only for volunteers in the army. Some of the captured soldiers said they were told by their commanding officers that they were going to a military exercise but suddenly found themselves fighting in Ukraine. Olexiy Danylov, Ukraine’s secretary of the national security and defence council appeared on TV earlier, according to Victor Kovalenko, a former Ukrainian journalist and soldier. Danylov said it was too early to celebrate Russia’s apparent retreat, according to Kovalenko’s translation. “I would like everybody to realise that Putin doesn’t abandon an idea to destroy Ukraine. Now he is rebuilding his forces to continue strikes. Do not enjoy that someone voluntarily leaves our cities - this is the work of our army. Behind the liberation of every city are the lost lives of our your men and women. That is why saying that “they run”... I would not say that. There is a high price for us for their retreat. They want to reformat very much. They need a victory. They have the sacred date - 9 May. To this date they have a goal to end everything with a victory parade. We have many battles ahead of us, so I don’t recommend anyone relax. The situation is not that joyful, as we all would want.” The UK Ministry of Defence says the destruction of oil tanks at a depot in the Russian city of Belgorod means probable loss of fuel and ammunition supplies to invading forces. It will likely add more strain to Russia’s already stretched logistic chains. Supplies to Russian forces encircling Kharkhiv may be particularly affected. Reuters: The US department of defense will provide an additional $300 million in security assistance to Ukraine, to include laser-guided rocket systems, drones, and commercial satellite imagery services. “This announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide new capabilities to Ukraine*s Armed Forces,” department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. Earlier on Friday, the US department of commerce added 120 Russian and Belarusian entities, mostly companies linked to the military, to the list of those under restrictions from receiving supplies and goods from the US. More from Zelenskiy’s address: He said 6,266 people had been rescued through humanitarian corridors in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia, including 3,071 from Mariupol. They were also negotiating on the removal of the dead from the city. At least 5,000 people have been killed in the besieged city, according to local authorities. An estimated 170,000 are still there, facing shortages of food, water and electricity. The international Red Cross said a team heading to the city to conduct a separate evacuation effort was forced to turn back Friday after “arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed”. The Red Cross said its team will try again Saturday. Europe has no right to react in silence to what is happening in Mariupol, Zelenskiy said. He said he also Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, in Kyiv, and discussed “how to accelerate Ukraine’s ascension to the EU”, as well as arms supplies and deepening sanctions policy. “If there is an embargo it is an embargo. If there is SWIFT it is for all banks. And if it is business with Russia then it is not just suspension of activities but a complete withdrawal of European companies.” He also said he had spoken to French president Emmanuel Macron, and was talking to Turkey to act as a mediator, saying there would be more details soon. Hello, this is Helen Davidson to take you through the next few hours of updates on the Ukraine conflict. In the last hour Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has released a video statement. Speaking from what looks like a conference room, with a screen bearing the Ukrainian flag behind him, he has levelled further accusations of war crimes at Russia, claiming it was trying to conscript people from Crimea into the armed forces to fight. In the video, Zelenskiy said Russian forces were withdrawing from the north of Ukraine, in a “slow but noticeable” way, sometimes expelled by Ukrainian forces but other times leaving of their own accord. “After them a complete disaster and many dangers are left, it’s true,” he said, adding that bombs may continue and the Russians were leaving mines in the area as they left, including in houses, equipment, and the bodies of people left behind. “Anyone who returns to this area must be very careful,” he said. It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was... Wait for our land to be cleared, wait until you can be assured that new shelling is impossible.” Zelenskiy said Russian forces were massing in Donbas, towards Kharkiv and were “preparing for even more powerful blows”. He noted the beginning of Russia’s conscription season, saying this year it was “guaranteed death for many young guys”. He sent the men and their families a warning: “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains. Don’t send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. Keep them at home.” He accused Russia of trying to take people into the army from Crimea, which he said was a violation of humanitarian law, and called for further sanctions in response. He urged people in Crimea to refuse but if they couldn’t, to surrender to Ukrainian military “at the first opportunity”. “We will understand everything. You will live,” he said. Separately, he said Russia had installed “temporary leaders” in some southern Ukraine areas, who were threatening employees of businesses and authorities into cooperating. Zelenskiy warned of problems” for anyone who became one of these leaders, who he termed “collaborators. Here are some of the key developments of the day: The state department said the US will continue to provide support to Ukraine, and won’t push the country to make concessions in negotiations with Russia following a report that said Britain was concerned the US, France and Germany will push Ukraine to “settle” in a peace deal. The US military has cancelled plans to test an intercontinental ballistic missile in an effort to reduce tensions with Russia. European governments have more time to figure out how they are going to act on Russia’s demand to pay for Russia gas in rubles after the Kremlin said today that it would not immediately halt gas supplies The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke with Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kulebo today and discussed “ways the US allies and partners are helping Ukraine defend against Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war”, Blinken said. Around 200 Ukrainian national guard members have likely been taken prisoner by the Russian troops as they withdrew from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the mayor of Slavutych, Yuri Fomichev, said. Ukraine exchanged 86 members of their armed forces with Russia today, according to senior Ukrainian officials. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was unable to reach the besieged city of Mariupol and will try again to evacuate civilians on Saturday. Sergei Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, told CNN: “The city is totally destroyed, is like ruins.” A convoy of 42 buses organized by the Ukrainian government and escorted by the Red Cross has helped a group of 2,000 people make it to safety from the besieged city of Mariupol. The buses brought the group to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday afternoon after Russian forces allowed the vehicles to pass. Several previous evacuation attempts had failed. The state department said in a statement Friday that the US will continue to provide support to Ukraine, and won’t push the country to make concessions in negotiations with Russia. The statement comes after the Times reported that a senior UK government source said Britain was concerned that the US, France and Germany were “over-eager” and will push Ukraine to “settle” in a peace deal. US officials denied that claim. The state department’s full statement: We are focused on putting Ukraine in the strongest possible negotiating position by continuing to provide security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself and by increasing pressure on Putin by imposing severe costs on Russia. We will not push Ukraine to make concessions, and we have consistently stated that sovereign states have the right to choose their own alliances and make their own decisions about their security. While we will defer to Ukraine to discuss the specifics of the negotiations, we are committed to a Ukraine that is sovereign, independent, and secure. We are in constant conversation with the Ukrainian government and our Allies and partners, but, as always, we will keep those discussions private. The US military has cancelled plans to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, Reuters reports, in an effort to reduce tensions with Russia. After Russia put its nuclear forces on high alert in February, the Pentagon announced that it would delay the test of the LGM-30G Minuteman III missile, saying both countries should “bear in mind the risk of miscalculation and take steps to reduce those risks”. US officials confirmed to Reuters today that it had cancelled the test entirely. Ann Stefanek, an air force spokesperson, said the decision was made for the same reasons the test was delayed. More from Reuters: Altering the test schedule for America’s ICBM force can be controversial. US senator Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate armed services committee, expressed disappointment in March at the delay of a test he said was critical to ensure America’s nuclear deterrent remains effective. Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), played down the impact of the cancelation. “There’s a value to doing the tests but I don’t think missing one test in the grand scheme of things is a really big deal,” he said, adding that the Minuteman III was extremely reliable. The nuclear-capable Minuteman III is key part of the US military’s strategic arsenal and has a range of 6,000-plus miles (9,660-plus km) and can travel at a speed of approximately 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph).

The fighting has upended animals’ lives, delaying deliveries of meat and making it impossible to supply food in some areas at all. Without income from visitors, some parks are running out of money to purchase food. Russian forces have shelled animal enclosures and destroyed fences, Animal International Survival said. Feldman Ecopark zoo in Kharkiv has had to evacuate its animals amid heavy fighting in the area that killed several staff members as they tried to feed animals. Here’s video from a zoo in Mariupol: Harrowing video of an apartment that has been pretty much obliterated in Kharkiv. The city, Ukraine’s second largest, has been bombarded by Russian troops but has managed to hold out. As the video shows, much of the city has been turned to rubble. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken spoke with Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kulebo today. Blinken in a Tweet said that they discussed “ways the US allies and partners are helping Ukraine defend against Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war.” In his own Tweet, Kuleba said that they discussed “steps to strengthen Ukraine economically and militarily so that we can continue to effectively fight back further Russian support,” he said. “More hits on Russia’s economy, financial system and trader are coming.” Sergei Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, just spoke to CNN about what is happening in the city. “The city is totally destroyed, is like ruins,” he said. “We’re upset, not because of the infrastructure but because of the people. We do now know how to help our citizens who are suffering inside the city.” Orlov said that Russia is not allowing any humanitarian assistance into the city. The International Red Cross said that it tried and failed to enter the city again, and will try again tomorrow. Orlov said that because of the lack food and supplies, it is common for people to have three meals a week, instead of three meals a day. European governments have more time to figure out how they are going to act on Russia’s demand to pay for Russia gas in rubles after the Kremlin said today that it would not immediately halt gas supplies as payments for deliveries are due last in the month and in May. Here’s more from Reuters: European governments and companies worked on a common approach on Friday to Russia’s demand that they pay for its gas in roubles as the threat of an imminent supply halt eased. European capitals have been on alert for a disruption to gas imports as Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks retaliation over Western sanctions for the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. A crunch point appeared to be in the offing when Moscow issued a decree on Thursday requiring foreign buyers of Russian gas to open rouble accounts in state-run Gazprombank from Friday or else risk being cut off. But the Kremlin said on Friday it would not immediately turn off the taps to Europe as payments on deliveries due after April 1 come in the second half of this month and May. That message, and signs Europe would take a pragmatic approach, were a relief for markets. Gas prices, which had risen on fears of disruption, fell. “If things remained like this, all in all not a lot would change,” Italy’s Ecology Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani told state broadcaster RAI. Russia has ordered its universities to move all their Youtube content onto Russian social media platform VK Video and RuTube, the Russian video platform. Google is still operating in Russia, though the company shut down its advertising business in the company. Youtube banned Russia’s ministry of defense from its platform, Bloomberg reported last month, signaling tension between the platform and the Russian government. This is Lauren Aratani in New York. The Associated Press has a helpful report on the helicopter strike on an oil storage facility in Belgorod, Russia, about 16 miles from the border that is parallel to Kharkiv in Ukraine. Russia says that Ukraine is behind the strike and the huge fire that it caused, but Ukrainian officials have been denying involvement. Regional Gov Vyacheslav Gladkov said two Ukrainian helicopter gunships had flown at low altitude and struck the facility in the city of Belgorod north of the border, triggering the blast and fire. Two workers at the depot were injured, he said. But Russian media cited a statement from state oil company Rosneft that denied anyone was hurt. More than 300 firefighters battled the blaze, using a helicopter and a special firefighting train, the Belgorod mayor’s office said. Gladkov said he met with residents who were moved from their homes to a nearby sports facility. He also posted photos of craters and metal fragments in a rural area where he said explosions had damaged a power line and broken a window. It would not be the first attack reported inside Russia since the war began on 24 Feb, although there has been nothing as spectacular. According to the report, Russian social media users have been expressing surprise that the Ukrainians were able to get past Russian air defenses, given that Russia’s daily briefings have been emphasizing the number of Ukrainian planes and helicopters shot down. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Around 200 Ukrainian national guard members have likely been taken prisoner by the Russian troops as they withdrew from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the mayor of Slavutych, Yuri Fomichev, said. He told the BBC that the guards have been out of contact since Thursday and are being considered prisoners of war. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was unable to reach the besieged city of Mariupol and will try again to evacuate civilians on Saturday. An aide to the mayor of Mariupol said the city remains closed for anyone trying to enter and is “very dangerous” for anyone trying to leave. Ukraine exchanged 86 members of their armed forces with Russia today, according to senior Ukrainian officials, AFP reports. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the servicemen are “already being taken home.” Russia has accused Ukraine of sending attack helicopters across the border to strike an oil storage facility in what would be the first raid on Russian soil since the outbreak of the war if confirmed. A Russian governor in the border region of Belgorod said that early on Friday two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters crossed the border at low altitude before firing rockets at an oil facility 25 miles from the border. A top Ukrainian security official said the accusation “does not correspond to reality”. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klitschko, said “huge” battles are being fought to the north and east of Ukraine’s capital. Klitschko issued a warning to residents who have fled the city: “The risk of dying (in Kyiv) is pretty high, and that’s why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: Please, take a little bit more time.” The mayor of Chernihiv, Vladyslav Atroshenko, accused Russia of shelling an oncology ward of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian city, days after Russia promised it would “drastically reduce” its military assault on Kyiv and Chernihiv. He said there is no water or electricity, and the city could run out of food and medicine within a week. European Union leaders called on China to help end the war in Ukraine, after having what they called “frank” exchanges with their Chinese counterparts. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned Chinese leaders, prime minister Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, not to help Russia evade western sanctions. The mayor of Mykolaiv Oblast, Vitaliy Kim, said 28 people have been confirmed killed as a result of a Russian strike on the regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian city. The attack took place at 8.45am (5.45am GMT) on Tuesday when a rocket tore a hole through the nine-storey government building. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has afforded Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, the honour of a meeting. Lavrov, who is visiting the country, praised India’s refusal to condemn the Ukraine invasion and predicted Moscow and Delhi would find ways to circumvent “illegal” western sanctions and continue to trade. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my US colleagues. Thank you for reading. The mayor of Slavutych, the town where most of Chernobyl’s workers live, said around 200 Ukrainian national guard members have likely been taken prisoner by the Russian troops as they withdrew from the nuclear power plant. Yuri Fomichev told the BBC: We consider them prisoners of war. He said the guards have been out of contact since Thursday, adding: We are working on a prisoner swap. Fomichev said it was not yet clear if Russian troops had left the entire Chernobyl exclusion zone, or just the immediate area around the power plant. The whole Chernobyl zone is very big. We can’t monitor it all - we only know what is happening directly around the power station where our workers are. Indian IT services company Infosys, in which the UK chancellor Rishi Sunak’s wife owns an estimated £690m stake and collects about £11.5m in annual dividends, is “urgently” closing its office in Russia. Infosys’s decision to shut its Moscow office comes as pressure mounts on Sunak to answer accusations that his family is collecting “blood money” dividends from the company’s continued operation in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine. A source at Infosys told the Guardian that the company was “in the process of urgently closing down its Russian operation” and “relocating staff to other countries”. An Infosys spokesperson declined to comment, and would not be drawn on whether the decision to close the Russian office was linked to political pressure mounting on Sunak. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, earlier on Friday called on the chancellor to reveal whether his family had been “benefiting from money made in Russia when the government has put in place sanctions” on firms and individuals following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Sunak, who has repeatedly called on British companies to pull out of Russia in order to “inflict maximum economic pain” on Putin’s regime, had refused to comment on his wife Akshata Murthy’s 0.91% stake in Infosys. Speaking to the BBC’s Newscast after a challenging week in which his spring statement met heavy criticism, he said it was “very upsetting and … wrong for people to try and come at my wife”. Sunak drew parallels with Will Smith, who hit the comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars on Sunday after a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, as well as the beleaguered England cricket captain, Joe Root. The chancellor quipped: Someone said, ‘Joe Root, Will Smith, and me – not the best of weekends for any of us’. But I feel, on reflection, both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked – at least I didn’t get up and slap anybody, which is good. Video posted on social media on Friday appeared to show a helicopter strike and then a major fire at an oil storage facility said to be in Belgorod, Russia. Reports showed that the facility continued to burn until midday on Friday. Dozens of firefighters were dispatched to battle the inferno, and flames reached dozens of metres into the air. Other videos showed the helicopters, which are used by both Ukraine and Russia, flying in the region. More than 50 Ukrainian historical sites, religious buildings and museums have been damaged since Russia’s invasion last month, the UN said. Unesco, the UN’s cultural agency, published a list of damaged 53 sites in the north and east of the country, including more than a dozen in the eastern Kharkiv region, five in the capital Kyiv and another five in the Chernihiv region of northern Ukraine. Overall, 29 religious sites, 16 historic buildings, four museums and four monuments are confirmed to have been damaged in Ukraine, Unesco said. The list does not include information from the besieged city of Mariupol or the city of Kherson which was captured by Russia. A Unesco spokesperson told AFP: This is the latest list but it is not exhaustive as our experts are continuing to verify a number of reports. The agency used satellite images and witness reports from the scene to verify the information provided by the Ukrainian authorities, the spokesperson said. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was unable to reach the besieged city of Mariupol and will try again to evacuate civilians on Saturday. A statement said: An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) team that had been on its way to Mariupol on Friday to facilitate the safe passage of civilians had to return to Zaporizhzhia after arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed. The ICRC team, which consists of three vehicles and nine personnel, did not reach Mariupol or facilitate the safe passage of civilians today. They will try again on Saturday to facilitate the safe passage of civilians from Mariupol. For the operation to succeed, it is critical that the parties respect the agreements and provide the necessary conditions and security guarantees. If and when the safe passage operation does happen, the ICRC’s role as a neutral intermediary would be to accompany the convoy out from Mariupol to another city in Ukraine.” The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, accused Russia of breaking its promises in terms of allowing humanitarian aid to reach Mariupol. Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a televised address: Humanitarian deliveries, despite all the agreements and promises of the Russian side, are not being carried out. The humanitarian corridor ... is essentially not operational. Ukraine exchanged 86 members of their armed forces with Russia today, according to senior Ukrainian officials, AFP reports. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the Ukrainian president’s deputy chief of staff, said in a video message on Telegram: The exchange has just taken place, 86 of Ukraine’s servicemen, including 15 women, are already safe. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the servicemen are “already being taken home.” I would like to address all our (people) who are still being held prisoner: We will fight for each of you! And will bring you home. Stay strong. A top Ukrainian security official has denied accusations by Russia that Ukraine was behind an attack on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, Reuters reports. Speaking on national television, Ukraine’s Security Council secretary, Oleksiy Danilov, said: For some reason they say that we did it, but according to our information this does not correspond to reality. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has warned those who fled Ukraine’s capital at the start of the war with Russia not to return as “the risk of dying is pretty high”, even as he offered a glint of normality by partially lifting an alcohol ban. The former world heavyweight boxing champion said he expected “huge battles” in the coming days in satellite towns and the outskirts of the city, which Russian forces have repeatedly tried but failed to encircle. Klitschko said: The risk of dying is pretty high, and that’s why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: please, take a little bit more time. Oleksiy Arestovych, a political adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, echoed the mayor’s concerns. He said Russian attacks were continuing around Kyiv and the encircled city of Chernihiv, 100 miles to the north, despite claims from the Kremlin that they were withdrawing out of respect for the ongoing peace talks. Arestovych said: Our troops are chasing them both to the north-west and north-east [of Kyiv], pushing the enemy away from Kyiv. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed Russian forces were planning to use a church north-west of Kyiv as a launchpad for a new assault. The official said: We believe the Russian military is using this staging point as part of its assault on Kyiv. At least 2 million people – half of the city’s population – fled Kyiv in the first few weeks of the conflict as Russian troops made their way to its north-eastern edge with the intention of storming the capital and likely decapitating the government. That plan failed, and the relaxation on Friday of the prohibition on the sale of alcohol in shops and the hospitality industry that has been imposed since 1 March had offered residents in Kyiv some glint of normality. Under the regulations, alcohol can be bought between 11am and 4pm. The initial ban had initially been imposed due to fears of public disorder. It’s 7.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Russia has accused Ukraine of sending attack helicopters across the border to strike an oil storage facility in what would be the first raid on Russian soil since the outbreak of the war if confirmed. A Russian governor in the border region of Belgorod said that early on Friday two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters crossed the border at low altitude before firing rockets at an oil facility 25 miles from the border. Ukraine has not confirmed that it launched the attack. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klitschko, said “huge” battles are being fought to the north and east of Ukraine’s capital. Klitschko issued a warning to residents who have fled the city: “The risk of dying (in Kyiv) is pretty high, and that’s why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: Please, take a little bit more time.” Around 2,000 evacuated civilians from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol besieged by Russian forces appear to be on their way to safety, according to reports from the city’s city council. Several private cars joined 42 buses escorted by the Red Cross and Ukrainian emergency services vehicles from nearby Berdyansk to the safer Ukranian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, it said. However, an aide to the mayor of Mariupol said the besieged southern city remains closed for anyone trying to enter and is “very dangerous” for anyone trying to leave. Petro Andryushchenko said Russian forces had since Thursday been preventing humanitarian supplies reaching trapped residents, making clear a planned “humanitarian corridor” had not been opened. The mayor of Chernihiv, Vladyslav Atroshenko, accused Russia of shelling an oncology ward of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian city, days after Russia promised it would “drastically reduce” its military assault on Kyiv and Chernihiv. He said there is no water or electricity, and the city could run out of food and medicine within a week. European Union leaders have called on China to help end the war in Ukraine, after having what they called “frank” exchanges with their Chinese counterparts. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned Chinese leaders, prime minister Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, not to help Russia evade western sanctions. The head of the UN atomic watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said he aims to lead a mission to Chernobyl as soon as possible. The announcement came after Ukrainian officials said the Russian soldiers who had occupied the highly contaminated plant since 24 February – the first day of the invasion – had left taking several Ukrainian service personnel with them. The mayor of Mykolaiv, Vitaliy Kim, said 28 people have been confirmed killed as a result of a Russian strike on the regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian city. The attack took place at 8.45am (5.45am GMT) on Tuesday when a rocket tore a hole through the nine-storey government building. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has afforded Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, the honour of a meeting. Lavrov, who is visiting the country, praised India’s refusal to condemn the Ukraine invasion and predicted Moscow and Delhi would find ways to circumvent “illegal” western sanctions and continue to trade. Germany has indicted a former officer in its reserve force on charges of spying for Russia, the Federal Public Prosecutor (GBA) said. Ralph G, whose family name cannot be fully disclosed under privacy laws, provided Russian agents with “numerous documents and information” about the German army from October 2014 until March 2020, the German prosecutor said. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I will continue to bring you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Germany has indicted a former officer in its reserve force on charges of spying for Russia, the Federal Public Prosecutor (GBA) said today, Reuters reports. Ralph G, whose family name cannot be fully disclosed under privacy laws, provided Russian agents with “numerous documents and information” about the German army from October 2014 until March 2020, German prosecutor Ines Peterson said in a statement. The GBA also accuses the suspect, who was a deputy commander of a squad as well as a member of a number of economic committees, of supplying Russian agents with information about the impact on German companies of EU sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. He also provided information about Nord Stream 2, the pipeline owned by the Russian gas company Gazprom and which Germany halted in February after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prosecutor said. The prosecutor said Ralph G had given Russian agents information about Germany’s reserve force and civil defence. Through him, Russia’s secret service also obtained personal and contact details of high-ranking officers in the military and prominent corporate managers, the prosecutor said. The suspect is also accused of helping his Russian handlers understand US defence policies with its partners in the Nato military alliance, the prosecutor said. The prosecutor did not say if or how the suspect had pleaded. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has afforded Russia’s foreign minister the honour of a meeting as Sergei Lavrov praised India’s refusal to condemn the Ukraine invasion. Lavrov, who is visiting the country, predicted Moscow and Delhi would find ways to circumvent “illegal” western sanctions and continue to trade. Modi had not met the string of other foreign ministers to arrive in Delhi in recent days, including the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, so Lavrov looks to have been singled out for attention by the Indian leader. India has abstained from successive United Nations resolutions censuring Moscow, calling only for an end to violence, and has increased its oil purchases from Russia, its biggest supplier of arms. Truss, in India on Thursday, had tried to cast the battle as one between democracies and autocracies, but India, the world’s most populous democracy, does not seem willing to accept this, especially if it requires India to break with Russia on issues such as arms sales and a future realignment of the global security architecture in which the US has a less prominent role. Lavrov said: These days our western colleagues would like to reduce any meaningful international issue to the crisis in Ukraine … [We] appreciate that India is taking this situation in the entirety of facts, not just in a one-sided way. I can only say that the balanced position of India which is not influenced by blackmail or diktat methods inspires our respect. Lavrov also claimed Ukraine was showing increasing understanding that joining Nato was not an option. Friendship is the key word to describe the history of our relations, and our relations were very sustainable during many difficult times in the past. His Indian counterpart, Dr S Jaishankar, reiterated “the importance of cessation of violence and ending hostilities” and said: Disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy. Here’s more on talks between EU and Chinese leaders, who met for their first summit in two years. The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, said China pushes for peace talks on Ukraine in “its own way”, state broadcaster CCTV reported. China advocates for the safeguard of international law and international norms, including the territorial integrity of all countries, Li is quoted as saying. Li spoke with the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, for almost two hours by video link. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who took part in a separate virtual meeting with the two EU leaders today, said he hopes European countries can form its view of China “independently”, CCTV said. Xi said both sides should communicate more on major issues concerning their bilateral relations and world peace, and that China and Europe should provide stability in a volatile world, CCTV reported. Wang Lutong, head of European affairs at China’s foreign ministry, said the two sides had “agreed to work together to maintain peace, stability and prosperity in the world”. Russian forces are using a church north-west of Kyiv as a “staging point” as part of their assault on the Ukrainian capital, a senior US official said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity and without citing evidence, said the information was based on declassified intelligence. Military personnel are situated both on the grounds of the church and the surrounding residential area. The official said: We believe the Russian military is using this staging point as part of its assault on Kyiv. European Union leaders have called on China to help end the war in Ukraine, after having what they called “frank” exchanges with their Chinese counterparts. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the online meetings with the Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, and President Xi Jinping had taken place in a very sober atmosphere. “Today’s summit was certainly not business as usual,” she said, saying that as a permanent member of the security council China had “a very special responsibility”. Speaking at a press conference alongside her, European Council president Charles Michel said: We call on China to help end the war in Ukraine. China cannot turn a blind eye to Russia’s violation of international law Von der Leyen said they had warned Chinese leaders not to help Russia evade western sanctions. We also made very clear that China should, if not support, at least not interfere with our sanctions. It would lead to major reputational damage to China here in Europe. Every day, she said, China and the European Union traded almost €2bn of goods and services, while Chinese-Russian trade was only €330m a day. Michel added that the EU had raised concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as Beijing’s “discriminatory” trade dispute with EU member state Lithuania. The pair sidestepped questions about whether they had received assurance from China not to help Russia. “We hope that our arguments have been heard by the Chinese,” Michel said. The meeting with Xi appeared to last less than one hour, according to an EU official’s social media posts. • The caption on the top image in this post was amended on 1 April 2022. An earlier agency version mistakenly identified Xi Jinping as the Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has requested that its specialists be authorised to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Interfax news agency quoted the head of Russia’s atomic agency Rosatom as saying on Friday, according to a report from Reuters. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has been speaking about the situation with Chernobyl in Ukraine. Reuters reports these key lines: He said everybody has agreed that the physical integrity of Ukraine’s nuclear sites must be protected. There is an agreed framework – but it has been agreed separately with Ukraine and Russia. Grossi said Russia did not discuss with him why they left the Chernobyl site, but it was undoubtedly a step in the right direction. He said the general radiation situation around the plant at Chernobyl is quite normal. There may have been a rise in radiation due to dust kicked up by military vehicles as Russian forces left Chernobyl. Grossi said the IAEA will decide where a small number of staff will be deployed in Ukraine with Ukrainian authorities, starting next week. IAEA staff need clear “de-conflicted” routes in order to do their work. There’s been a strong diplomatic signal of Indian support for Russia today, with the news that as well as meeting foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, the trip of Russia’s foreign minister Sergie Lavrov to India has included a meeting with prime minister Narendra Modi. Modi has pointedly not met with any of the varying other foreign ministers who have visited India in the last couple of weeks while the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been progressing. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has tweeted that part of his discussions with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, included discussion of the humanitarian corridor for evacuating Mariupol. This is Martin Belam in London again back for an hour or so. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukraine’s defence ministry has declined to comment directly on Russian allegations that its forces struck a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, Reuters reports. It said Ukraine was conducting a defensive operation and could not be held responsible for “every catastrophe on Russia’s territory”. Defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, told a briefing: Ukraine is currently conducting a defensive operation against Russian aggression on the territory of Ukraine, and this does not mean that Ukraine is responsible for every catastrophe on Russia’s territory … I will not confirm or deny these allegations. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klitschko, said “huge” battles are being fought to the north and east of Ukraine’s capital, Reuters reports. Klitschko issued a warning to residents who have fled the city: The risk of dying (in Kyiv) is pretty high, and that’s why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: Please, take a little bit more time. Kyiv’s regional governor said earlier today that Russian forces were pulling back in some areas around the capital but strengthening its positions in others. It comes after an adviser to President Zelenskiy, Oleksiy Arestovych, said Ukrainian forces are pushing back Russian troops north-east and north-west of Kyiv. Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor and professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, writes for us today: It appears that Vladimir Putin’s aides have misinformed him about the war, fearful of his reaction, Reich writes. On Wednesday, American officials revealed that, according to American intelligence, Putin’s strict isolation during the pandemic and willingness to publicly castigate advisers have contributed to him getting incomplete or overly optimistic reports about the progress of Russian forces. “We believe he’s being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions,” Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, told reporters. “Because … the senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth.” As a result, the attack has been a catastrophe for Putin. He badly overestimated the Russian military and underestimated Ukraine’s capacity to resist. Instead of weakening Nato, his attack has strengthened it. And now that the world’s democracies have cut off Russia’s access to the world banking system, Russia’s economy is in freefall. Dictators like Putin are particularly vulnerable to inaccurate feedback. Instead of independent truth-tellers, they are often surrounded by truth-deniers. Rather than experts and investigative journalists, their world is filled with pseudo-scientists and propaganda. In place of a free press, they have agitprop and disinformation. The higher you rise in any hierarchy, the harder it is to get accurate feedback about your decisions because people are afraid to tell you the truth. I’ve worked with several presidents. All have made big blunders. I’ve also known and written about CEOs of big corporations who have made terrible mistakes. In every case, they had flawed systems for getting useful, accurate and reliable feedback. Read Robert Reich’s full opinion piece here. The mayor of Chernihiv, Vladyslav Atroshenko, has accused Russia of shelling an oncology ward of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian city, days after Russia promised it would “drastically reduce” its military assault on Kyiv and Chernihiv. Speaking to CNN, he said: Some shells hit the regional hospital direct, and one of the buildings of the hospital, in fact the oncological unit, was completely destroyed. Three people sustained heavy injuries. Atroshenko also said there is no water or electricity, and the city could run out of food and medicine within a week. At the moment, we are going through full humanitarian catastrophe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he will tell Vladimir Putin that he and Volodymyr Zelenskiy need to take a step to address issues over Ukraine’s Donbas region and Crimea, Reuters reports. Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, Erdoğan said he will hold a phone call with Putin at 1pm GMT and renew an offer to host the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for peace talks. From Nikkei Asia’s Ken Moriyasu: Around 2,000 evacuated civilians from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol besieged by Russian forces appear to be on their way to safety, according to reports from the city’s city council. Several private cars joined 42 buses escorted by the Red Cross and Ukrainian emergency services vehicles from nearby Berdyansk to the safer Ukranian-held city of Zaporizhia, Mariupol city council’s Telegram channel posted on Friday, along with a photo and video of the convoy. The Red Cross said earlier in the day that top-level authorities from Ukraine and Russia have confirmed approval for a humanitarian corridor out of the port city, which has faced four weeks of bombardment and dwindling resources. The aid organisation did not receive permission to bring in humanitarian aid, however, and so travelled without medical supplies for the estimated 150,000 people believed to still be trapped there. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he could not confirm or deny Ukraine’s alleged involvement in a strike on a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, Reuters reports. Responding to a question about the attack at a briefing in Poland, Kuleba said: I can neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this simply because I do not possess all the military information. Talks between Ukraine and Russia have resumed in an online format, the Ukrainian presidential office said, Reuters reports. Speaking to reporters today, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the alleged Ukrainian strike on a Russian fuel depot in Belgorod does not create comfortable conditions to continue peace talks. He added that authorities were doing everything to reorganise the fuel supply chain and avoid disruption of the city’s energy supplies. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said he will lead a mission to Chernobyl “as soon as possible”. It comes after Ukrainian officials said Russian troops had largely withdrawn from the decommissioned nuclear power station this morning, although some remained in the area. The Ukrainian state power company Energoatom said the pullout came after soldiers received “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches in the forest in the exclusion zone, a claim the UN’s nuclear watchdog has said it is investigating. The mayor of Mykolaiv, Vitaliy Kim, said 28 people have been confirmed killed as a result of a Russian strike on the regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian city. The attack took place at 8.45am (5.45am GMT) on Tuesday when a rocket tore a hole through the nine-storey government building, destroying governor Kim’s office. Authorities spent days searching for survivors in the rubble. Kim accused Russian forces of waiting until people arrived for work in the morning before targeting the site. I had overslept. But – I got lucky. The majority escaped miraculously, I don’t know how. In a video address to the Danish parliament following the strike, Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy condemned the attack: There were no military targets in Mykolaiv. The people of Mykolaiv posed no threat to Russia. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The International Committee for the Red Cross has said top-level authorities from Ukraine and Russia have approved an evacuation plan for the besieged southern port city of Mariupol. The operation involves 54 buses, but the ICRC says it did not get permission to bring in humanitarian aid and so is travelling without medical supplies. An aide to the mayor of Mariupol said the city remained “very dangerous” for anyone trying to leave. Russia has accused Ukraine of sending attack helicopters across the border to strike an oil storage facility in what would be the first raid on Russian soil since the outbreak of the war if confirmed. Ukraine has not confirmed that it launched the attack. Russian forces are withdrawing from the Chernihiv region of northern Ukraine but have not yet left entirely, the local governor said in a video address. Some Russian troops were still in the “exclusion zone” around the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power station on Friday morning, the head of the Ukrainian agency in charge of the zone said. The governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region says that five humanitarian corridors have been agreed in his region for today. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are due to restart this morning by video, focusing on the peace framework the Ukrainian side presented during a face-to-face meeting in Istanbul earlier this week. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov – visiting India – has said that peace talks need to continue, and that there has been “much more understanding” on the Ukrainian side of what he described as the situation in Crimea and Donbas. EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has said Australia will send armoured Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy specifically asked for them during a video appeal to Australian lawmakers. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will back later on. I am handing the blog over to Léonie Chao-Fong. Andrew Roth our Moscow correspondent has this on the reports of a Ukrainian attack inside Russian territory: Russia has accused Ukraine of sending attack helicopters across the border to strike an oil storage facility in what would be the first raid on Russian soil since the outbreak of the war if confirmed. Ukraine has not confirmed that it launched the attack, raising questions about whether Russian negligence may be to blame. A Russian governor in the border region of Belgorod said that early on Friday two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters crossed the border at low altitude before firing rockets at an oil facility 25 miles from the border. Video posted to social media on Friday appeared to show a helicopter strike using air-to-ground missiles and then a major fire at the facility said to be in Belgorod, with flames reaching dozens of metres into the air. Reports showed that the facility continued to burn until midday on Friday, with dozens of firefighters dispatched to battle the inferno. Other videos showed the helicopters, which are used by both Ukraine and Russia, flying in the region. “The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an airstrike from two helicopters of the armed forces of Ukraine, which entered the territory of Russia at low altitude,” said governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. “There are no victims.” Read more of Andrew Roth’s report here: Ukraine accused of helicopter attack on oil depot inside Russia There are a couple of quotes about the situation with Ukraine emerging after Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov met with his Indian counterpart this morning. Reuters reports he has said that peace talks need to continue, and that there has been “much more understanding” on the Ukrainian side of what he described as the situation in Crimea and Donbas. Lavrov has also said Russia will intensify the amount of trading it does directly in roubles. That will not go down well with Kyrylo Shevchenko, the governor of the Bank of Ukraine, who has just issued a statement saying that the US, Japan, European Union and UK should ban transactions in roubles. Reuters quotes him saying: “The ban on payments in Russian roubles will make it possible to thwart the plans of the aggressor-state to switch to payments in its national currency.” On the day of the World Cup draw, with Ukraine still potentially to qualify, Daniel Boffey in Kyiv has interviewed Ukraine’s national football manager, Oleksandr Petrakov: When the war broke out in the early hours of 24 February, Oleksandr Petrakov, the manager of Ukraine’s men’s national football team, chose not to leave his home in the capital, Kyiv, as the Russians advanced and shells dropped, but to try to join the fight. “My family told me to go to western Ukraine but I refused. I said: ‘I am from Kyiv, I can’t leave,’” says Petrakov. “I didn’t think it would be correct as people have to defend and I can’t run. I thought, if they come to Kyiv I will pick up a weapon and defend my city.” He adds: “I am 64 but I felt it was normal to do this. I think I could take two or three enemies out.” A Russian speaker from childhood, Petrakov now sticks to Ukrainian in public and while some are sad about Vladimir Putin’s war and others are angry, he admits to a more visceral emotion. “It’s just hate. It is not anger, but people hate those who invaded their land. We need time to calm down but for now it is just hate. They have broken our countries for years.” Petrakov tried to sign up to Ukraine’s territorial defence, the reservists being deployed across the country to fight the Russians. He spoke to a member of Ukraine’s government but was advised that his lack of military experience was an issue and that he might be better served elsewhere. Read more of Daniel Boffey’s report from Kyiv: ‘We could play at Wembley’: Ukraine manager on war, the World Cup and his hatred of Russia There are further developments with the attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol. Reuters reports a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross has said: Top-level authorities from Ukraine and Russia have approved an evacuation plan. The operation involves 54 buses. Its teams did not get permission to bring in humanitarian aid so have left without supplies. No destination has yet been decided for the evacuees, but it will be in Ukraine. There are thought to be more than 100,000 civilians remaining in the besieged southern port city. Earlier, Ukraine deputy minister Oleksii Iaremenko said it was 36 days since Mariupol had received any medical or humanitarian supplies. Here is a selection of some of the photos we’ve been sent from Ukraine recently over the newswires. Some Russian troops were still in the “exclusion zone” around the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power station on Friday morning, the head of the Ukrainian agency in charge of the zone said. Yevhen Kramarenko confirmed on national television that the Russian forces that occupied the power station after invading Ukraine on 24 February had left the plant itself but said some troops had been seen in the exclusion zone outside the territory of the decommissioned power station. The exclusion zone was established around the plant soon after a reactor there exploded in the world’s worst nuclear accident in 1986. Yesterday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that it “has not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chornobyl exclusion zone.” Russian forces are withdrawing from the Chernihiv region of northern Ukraine but have not yet left entirely, the local governor said in a video address on Friday. “Air and missile strikes are possible in the region, nobody is ruling this out,” governor Viacheslav Chaus said, adding that Ukrainian forces were entering and securing settlements previously held by Russian troops. Reuters reports Chaus said it was still too early for Ukrainian forces in the Chernihiv region to let their guard down as Russian troops “are still on our land.” Russia said on Tuesday it would scale down operations in the Chernihiv and Kyiv regions. Chernihiv is the region directly to the north-east of Kyiv. Ukraine’s parliament has tweeted this morning to say that the ministry of internal affairs states the death toll from the missile strike on the Mykolaiv government building has reached 24. 23 people were found dead in the rubble, and one person subsequently died in hospital after the attack. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is visiting India, and ahead of meetings he has said: “We appreciate that India taking this situation in the entirety of facts and not just in a one-sided way.” He is talking to his counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and Reuters reports that Lavrov said of Russia-India relations: “We continue to implement projects in the areas of energy, science and technology, outer space, pharmaceutical industry.” Chinese exports to Russia are slowing as the rouble swings in value, clear evidence of a ripple effect that western sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are having in China, even as it sticks by its neighbour diplomatically. Chinese multinationals have stayed in Russia while their western rivals flee but it is smaller Chinese companies that are more vulnerable to exchange rate losses, with several telling Reuters that much of their Russian business is on hold as both sides wait out the volatility. One trader told the news agency that their volume of shipments had dropped by a third. China is Russia’s biggest source of imports and sold $12.6bn of goods to Russia in January and February – mostly computers, cars, shoes and toys. An aide to the mayor of Mariupol said on Friday the besieged southern Ukrainian city remained closed for anyone trying to enter and was “very dangerous” for anyone trying to leave. Petro Andryushchenko said Russian forces had since Thursday been preventing even the smallest amount of humanitarian supplies reaching trapped residents, making clear a planned “humanitarian corridor” had not been opened. Reuters notes that tens of thousands of civilians have been trapped for weeks with scant food, water and other supplies in the city that was once home to 400,000 people but has been devastated by Russian bombardment. “The city remains closed to entry and very dangerous to exit with personal transport,” he said on the Telegram messaging app. “In addition, since yesterday the occupiers have categorically not allowed any humanitarian aid – even in small quantities – into the city.” A convoy of buses that set out for Mariupol on Thursday did not reach the city, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday evening. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk wrote in an online post late on Thursday that fresh efforts would be made “to push through a humanitarian corridor to Mariupol so as not to leave our people on their own”. We are expecting today to potentially be a crunch day for gas supplies, after Russian president Vladimir Putin yesterday signed a decree that from 1 April all gas going to European customers must be purchased in roubles. Germany and France have rejected this as a breach of existing contracts. Reuters has a short statement from Gazprom saying that the state-owned energy giant was continuing to supply natural gas to Europe via Ukraine in line with requests from European consumers. Shaun Walker is in Kyiv for us, and brings us this dispatch about the group of independent Russian reporters in Ukraine attempting to break the Kremlin’s stranglehold on information: Mediazona, like many Russian-language news outlets, was blocked by the Russian internet watchdog in the early days of the war for not adhering to wartime censorship rules that ban any information that could “discredit” Russia’s army. “Despite the block, during the last month our readership numbers went up almost twice, to about 3.5 million unique visitors this month,” said Peter Verzilov, an activist and journalist who is the publisher of the site. Nevertheless, Verzilov said it was clear that Russian state messaging was working on a large number of Russians, pointing to the numerous stories of Ukrainians contacting friends or relatives in Russia and being told they were imagining the things they could see with their own eyes. “When your own son is telling you, ‘Dad, do not believe the fucking television, it’s not true,’ and you say ‘No, no, Nazis are just brainwashing you,’ it does show that Russian propaganda is amazingly effective for certain portions of the population. It really does work, when you’re switching between channels and all of them have the same content,” said Verzilov. Other journalists agreed that cutting through the state-sponsored noise was getting ever harder. Last weekend, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an interview to several independent Russian outlets, and Russian authorities immediately announced any site that published it could face criminal responsibility. “The people who say, there’s plenty of information on the internet, they just don’t understand what they’re talking about. My twin sister asked me how to watch Zelenskiy, she just had no idea how to find it,” said Yevgenia Albats, a veteran Russian journalist who edits the New Times website. Read more of Shaun Walker’s report here: Russian reporters in Ukraine: ‘Every day I see dead and injured’ Oleksii Iaremenko, a deputy minister in Ukraine’s government, has appeared on Sky News in the UK, talking about the humanitarian situation on the ground in Mariupol. He said there were still more than 100,000 civilians trapped in the city, and that they had not been able to deliver any medical supplies for 36 days now. As you see from the newest Russian aggression, targeting every day residential areas, social infrastructure, hospitals … in some regions the humanitarian corridors doesn’t work. We appreciate all international support from countries and organisations that are bringing in humanitarian aid. But we need more because of the number of attacks. Asked whether he was optimistic about the outcome of peace talks, he declined to comment, saying that was a matter for the president and the foreign ministry. I have two quick snaps from Reuters here with some mixed messages on humanitarian efforts in eastern Ukraine today. The governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region says that five humanitarian corridors have been agreed in his region for today. However, in contrast, an aide to the mayor of Mariupol is being quoted as saying that Russian forces are not allowing humanitarian aid in, and that the city is “very dangerous” for anyone trying to leave. Petro Andryushchenko said Russian forces had since Thursday been preventing even the smallest amount of humanitarian supplies reaching trapped residents, making clear a planned “humanitarian corridor” had not been opened. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president in Russia from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia’s security council, has issued a warning about Russian agricultural exports, saying in the future they will go only to friends. Reuters quotes him saying he would like to outline “some simple but important points about food security in Russia”, given the sanctions imposed. “We will only be supplying food and agriculture products to our friends,” Medvedev said on social media. “Fortunately we have plenty of them, and they are not in Europe or North America at all.” Agriculture supplies to “friends” will be both in roubles and their national currency in agreed proportion, Medvedev said. Russia already banned most western food imports in 2014 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine. This is Martin Belam here in London now, taking over from my colleague Samantha Lock. You can get in touch with me via email at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia will respond to European Union sanctions and says the 27-nation bloc might realise that a confrontation with Moscow is not in its interests, Russian state media agency RIA Novosti reported, citing a senior foreign ministry official as saying on Friday. Nikolai Kobrinets said in an interview with the news agency: The actions of the EU will not remain unanswered … the irresponsible sanctions by Brussels are already negatively affecting the daily lives of ordinary Europeans. Are they ready from their own pocket to pay for further killings of civilians in Ukraine, the transformation of Europe from a region of cooperation and stability into a zone of conflict? I don’t think so.” Some more images of the destruction across Ukraine have arrived today. EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. EU officials close to the preparations of the summit said any help given to Russia would damage China’s international reputation and jeopardise relations with its biggest trade partners – Europe and the US. The presidents of the European Commission and European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, will hold virtual talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and later President Xi Jinping. An EU official said China’s stance towards Russia would be the “million-dollar question” on Friday, as reported by Reuters. Another pointed out that over a quarter of China’s global trade was with the bloc and the US last year, against 2.4% with Russia. “Do we prolong this war or do we work together to end this war? That is the essential question for the summit,” the official said. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi reiterated China’s call for peace talks this week, adding the legitimate concerns of all sides should be accommodated. We have a little more information on the reported blast at an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod this morning. Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov has said the situation is “currently stable”. “There are no victims,” he added in a post to his official Telegram channel. Russian state news agency RIA reported that eight fuel tanks are on fire, claiming there is a threat of the fire spreading. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said Australia will send armoured Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy specifically asked for them during a video appeal to Australian lawmakers. Zelenskiy addressed the Australian Parliament on Thursday and asked for the Australian-made, four-wheel-drive vehicles. Morrison told reporters the vehicles will be flown over on Boeing C-17 Globemaster transport planes. He didn’t specify how many would be sent or when. “We’re not just sending our prayers, we are sending our guns, we’re sending our munitions, we’re sending our humanitarian aid, we’re sending all of this, our body armor, all of these things and we’re going to be sending our armoured vehicles, our Bushmasters, as well,” Morrison said. Zelenskiy specifically asked for Bushmaster vehicles during his address to Australian Parliament. “You have very good armed personnel vehicles, Bushmasters, that could help Ukraine substantially, and other pieces of equipment,” Zelenskiy said. A Russian lawyer has taken up the task of defending a group of national guardsmen who refused to join the war in Ukraine. “A lot of people don’t want to go and fight,” Mikhail Benyash told the Financial Times, adding that about 1,000 people had been in touch with his team, as he pursues the first court case to officially reveal dissent inside the ranks of Russia’s security forces over the invasion. The 12 national guardsmen who were fired after refusing to go to Ukraine were members of Rosgvardia, a militarised force separate from the army that was established in 2016 to maintain public order and fight crime, according to the FT. The guardsmen had been deployed before the invasion to occupied Crimea for military exercises, according to Pavel Chikov, the head of Agora, the Russian human rights group. The day after the war began on 24 February, they received orders to cross into Ukraine but refused, Chikov wrote on his channel in the Telegram messaging app. The men argued that the order was unlawful as they were not soldiers, but members of a domestic force whose duties did not extend beyond Russia. None were informed they were being sent into the “territory of Ukraine to participate in a special military operation, about the tasks and conditions of this operation and, as a consequence, did not consent to it”, he added. Benyash said Rosgvardia employees were not trained for full combat operations. “Have [they] been taught to dig trenches? To build defensive structures?” he asked. “In their line of work they handle small guns. Maximum they have automated weapons, but they basically never use them,” he added. Ahead of the next session in the case on Friday, Benyash said nine of the 12 guardsmen who filed the wrongful dismissal case had withdrawn the claims under huge pressure. There had been threats of criminal cases unless they backed down, he said. “Some are seeing their relatives turn away from them.” The UN atomic watchdog is investigating Ukrainian claims that Russian soldiers occupying Chernobyl nuclear power station left after receiving “significant doses” of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it could not confirm the claims by Ukrainian state power company Energoatom and was seeking an independent assessment. Ukraine’s state agency in charge of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Energoatom, published an update late on Thursday confirming Russian troops had left the site. Energoatom added that the Russians dug trenches in the forest inside the exclusion zone at the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, and that the troops “panicked at the first sign of illness” that “showed up very quickly” and began preparing to leave. So it is not surprising that the occupiers received significant doses of radiation and panicked at the first sign of illness. And it manifested itself very quickly.” The IAEA said it had not been able to confirm reports of Russian troops receiving high doses and was seeking more information in a statement on Thursday. The IAEA has not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and is seeking further information in order to provide an independent assessment of the situation.” Deserted military uniforms, tanks and soldiers’ personal items now litter battlefields across Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence has said Ukrainian forces have retaken villages south of Chernihiv. The report, published shortly after 6am GMT, reads: Ukrainian forces have retaken the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka to the south of Chernihiv and located along one of the main supply routes between the city and Kyiv. Ukraine has also continued to make successful but limited counterattacks to the east and north east of Kyiv. Both Chernihiv and Kyiv have been subjected to continued air and missile strikes despite Russian claims of reducing activity in these areas.” Ukraine hopes to launch a fresh attempt to rescue civilians from Mariupol this morning after warnings from the Red Cross that thousands of lives depend on the successful evacuation of people trapped in the besieged city by Russian forces. A total of 45 buses are en route to the nearby southern coastal town of Berdyansk, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said, along with a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delivering humanitarian aid and assisting evacuations. The convoy was expected to enter the city this morning after Russian promises of a limited ceasefire along the route from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Repeated efforts to set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of up to 170,000 people who remain in Mariupol, which has suffered four weeks of bombardment and dwindling supplies, have failed. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of shelling supposedly safe routes outside of several fighting hotspots; claims that Moscow denies. “Time is running out to help these people. This evacuation is hugely important,” said Alyona Synenko, a spokesperson for the ICRC. “It is essential we get concrete and precise agreements from both sides on times and routes tomorrow. These instructions need to be conveyed to military units on the ground and they must be respected. “We distributed the last of the supplies we had there two weeks ago. People have nothing now. We are ready to help and we are hoping tomorrow safe passage materialises.” Control of Mariupol, a strategic port once home to 400,000 people and still in the Ukrainian government’s hands, would ensure Russian dominance in the inland Sea of Azov. An oil depot is reportedly on fire in the Russian city of Belgorod as the regional governor blames Ukrainian military helicopters for the attack, a claim that could not be immediately verified. Vyacheslav Gladkov alleged the fire was caused by airstrikes from two Ukrainian helicopters that had crossed the border at low altitude, in a statement on his Telegram channel on Friday morning. He added that the blaze injured two workers. Belgorod sits just north of the border with Ukraine. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for any of the blasts. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you to deliver all the latest breaking news from Ukraine. Attempts at peace talks will once again kick off this morning as negotiators from Russia and Ukraine prepare to meet again via video link. A humanitarian corridor promised by Russia out of Mariupol is also hoped to take affect. Here’s the latest: Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are due to restart this morning by video, focusing on the peace framework the Ukrainian side presented during a face-to-face meeting in Istanbul earlier this week. A humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol is set to be opened from 10am today to allow civilians out of the besieged port city, which is in the Donbas in south-eastern Ukraine. It follows “a personal request from the French president and German chancellor to Russian president Vladimir Putin”, the Russian defence ministry said. A convoy of Ukrainian buses has set out for Mariupol to try to deliver humanitarian supplies and bring out trapped civilians, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said. Russian forces have reportedly left the Chernobyl power plant, the Ukrainian Atomic Energy Ministry said, citing personnel at the site. Russian troops began leaving after soldiers got “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company said. Energoatom said the Russians had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant and “panicked at the first sign of illness,” which “showed up very quickly,” and began preparing to leave, Energoatom said. Russian troops reportedly took an unspecified number of captive Ukrainian servicemen hostage after leaving the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Energoatom claimed in a statement on Telegram. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy repeated his warning that Russia is preparing for “powerful strikes” in the Donbas region after appearing to withdraw from an assault on Kyiv. The Pentagon also said that Russia may be repositioning some of its forces to send them to the Donbas. Nato’s chief Jens Stoltenberg said Russian forces are not withdrawing, but regrouping. He also said the alliance had yet to be convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith in peace talks in Istanbul because Moscow’s military objective since launching its invasion of Ukraine had not changed. Russia is redeploying elements of its forces from Georgia to reinforce its invasion, British military intelligence said on Thursday. “It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion,” the ministry added. The White House said the US has evidence that the war against Ukraine has been “a strategic disaster” for Russia. “We have seen incontrovertible evidence that this has been a strategic disaster for Russia,” director of communications Kate Bedingfield said, adding that Russia is “working to redefine the initial aims of their invasion”. US president Joe Biden said that Russian president Vladimir Putin “seems to be self-isolated” and noted “there’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,” without citing evidence. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace seemingly concurred with this assessment, saying Putin is “not the force he used to be” as he becomes increasingly more isolated. Speaking with Sky News, Wallace said: “President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. He’s isolated. His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed.” Russia has threatened to halt contracts supplying Europe with a third of its gas unless they are paid in Russian currency. Putin signed a decree on Thursday saying foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday. He said contracts would be halted if these payments were not made. Germany and France rejected the demands and said they amounted to “blackmail”. EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday, with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions. EU officials close to the preparations of the summit said any help given to Russia would damage China’s international reputation and jeopardise relations with its biggest trade partners – Europe and the United States. Britain and its allies have agreed to send more lethal military aid to Ukraine to help defend it against Russia’s invasion, the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said. As part of the agreement, armoured vehicles and long-range artillery will be sent. Australia will send armoured Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine after Zelenskiy specifically asked for them during a video appeal to Australian lawmakers. Russia said it will respond to the EU’s “irresponsible” sanctions. Senior foreign ministry official, Nikolai Kobrinets, told Russian state media agency RIA in an interview: “The actions of the EU will not remain unanswered ... the irresponsible sanctions by Brussels are already negatively affecting the daily lives of ordinary Europeans.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/may/14/lights-stay-on-despite-cyber-attack-on-uks-electricity-system","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-14T19:35:21Z","webTitle":"Lights stay on despite cyber-attack on UK's electricity system","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/lights-stay-on-despite-cyber-attack-on-uks-electricity-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/may/14/lights-stay-on-despite-cyber-attack-on-uks-electricity-system","fields":{"headline":"Lights stay on despite cyber-attack on UK's electricity system","bodyText":"Britain’s energy system has fallen victim to a cyber-attack targeting the IT infrastructure used to run the electricity market. The electricity system’s administrator, Elexon, confirmed that it was affected by a cyber-attack on Thursday afternoon but that the key systems used to govern the electricity market were not affected. National Grid is investigating whether the attack could affect the part of its business tasked with keeping the lights on. A spokesman for the energy system operator said electricity supplies had not been affected, and there were “robust cybersecurity measures in place” to make sure the UK continues to receive reliable electricity. “We’re aware of a cyber intrusion on Elexon’s internal IT systems. We’re investigating the matter and any potential impact on our own IT networks,” he said. Elexon is a vital part of the UK electricity market because it carefully monitors the electricity generated by energy companies to match this with what National Grid expects to receive, and to make sure that generators are paid the correct amount for the energy they generate. Elexon said it had “identified the root cause of a cyber-attack” and was “working to resolve the issue”. None of its employees were able to access email on Thursday, the company added. The attack emerged days after the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) identified an increasing number of “malicious cyber actors” which are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic for their own objectives. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, condemned the attacks targeting global health experts, hospitals and healthcare systems and vowed to work with the UK’s allies to “hold the perpetrators to account and deter further malicious cyber activity around the world”. Earlier this week, two companies involved in building emergency coronavirus hospitals confirmed that they were hit by cyber-attacks this month. Interserve, which helped build Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital, and BAM Construct, which delivered hospitals in Yorkshire and the Humber, have both reported cyber-attacks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jul/22/british-gas-profits-double-home-workers-cold-regulator-price-cap","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-22T10:51:11Z","webTitle":"British Gas profits more than double after home workers feel the cold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/22/british-gas-profits-double-home-workers-cold-regulator-price-cap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jul/22/british-gas-profits-double-home-workers-cold-regulator-price-cap","fields":{"headline":"British Gas profits more than double after home workers feel the cold","bodyText":"British Gas has more than doubled its profits for the first half of the year after cold weather prompted customers working from home to turn their heating up, and small companies began to reopen for business after Covid-19 lockdowns last year. Profits at the UK’s biggest energy supplier rose to £172m for the first six months of the year, from £78m in the same period last year, even after losing 114,000 home energy customers since the end of last year. Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of the British Gas owner, Centrica, said the unusually cold start to the year, compared with an unusually mild spring in 2020, helped to boost its first-half profits by about £50m. British Gas also benefited from a hike in the energy regulator’s price cap, which rose by an average of £96 a year for 11m homes using a standard dual-fuel energy tariff. Almost a quarter of this increase, which hit bill payers in April, was put in place to help energy companies cover the cost of households that could not afford to pay their bills during the pandemic. O’Shea said British Gas had not seen any “material impact” from unpaid bills since the outbreak of the pandemic due to the government’s job retention scheme and because “when customers can pay, they do pay”. The profit rise at British Gas helped Centrica to offset losses at its services business due to long-running strike action after a standoff with trade unions over its plans to “fire and rehire” thousands of staff on tougher contract terms. Profits at British Gas Services, which employs engineers to fit and maintain home boilers and heating systems, fell to £60m in the first half of the year from £94m the year before. The controversial scheme was part of a major turnaround programme at Centrica, which has floundered in recent years due to its high costs, and rising competition in the energy supply market. O’Shea was able to reduce Centrica’s net debt from almost £3bn to £93m after the sale of its US energy business, Direct Energy. But the company has struggled to sell off its stake in the UK’s nuclear power plants and its North Sea business, Spirit Energy. Centrica may consider a new sales structure for Spirit Energy and would consider keeping its share of EDF Energy’s nuclear plants to help play a role in generating low-carbon electricity to help meet the UK’s net zero targets, O’Shea said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/06/jean-luc-melenchon-hologram-french-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T09:16:10Z","webTitle":"Mélenchon appears as hologram in last push for French election ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/jean-luc-melenchon-hologram-french-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/06/jean-luc-melenchon-hologram-french-election","fields":{"headline":"Mélenchon appears as hologram in final push for French election ","bodyText":"Speaking via hologram to multiple locations across France, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the radical leftwing politician who aims to throw the presidential election off course, told supporters victory was within their grasp at his last campaign rally on Tuesday evening. The veteran candidate, who has been edging his way up the polls and is in third place, described himself as a political tortoise: slow but with the potential to beat the hares to the finishing line. “We have a few days and we can feel our destiny at our fingertips. We know we can push for the most incredible political change of direction imaginable,” he said in a 90-minute speech that touched on philosophy, literature and a 15th-century feminist treatise. “We have to break with presidential monarchy and install the sovereignty of the people. Everyone has an individual, personal responsibility for the result on Sunday,” he told them. Mélenchon, 70, used special technology to “appear” in 12 places at the same time on Tuesday; the real Mélenchon was in the northern town of Lille, a traditional heartland for the French left while hologram incarnations appeared in 11 other cities spanning the length and breadth of France. It is a hi-tech gimmick the leader of the radical La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), standing for the third time in a presidential election, first used in his 2017 campaign. The campaign team had boasted the aim was that Mélenchon – the real and the ephemeral – would be less than 250km from every French citizen in mainland France. With the first round of the 2022 presidential election looming this Sunday, Mélenchon is now the left’s only hope of reaching second round runoff. Support for the mainstream left Parti Socialiste has collapsed, leaving its candidate, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, facing an historically low score. The Ecology-Green candidate, Yannick Jadot, is languishing in sixth place. Emmanuel Macron is at 27%, Marine Le Pen at 23% and Mélenchon at 16.5%, according to the latest Ifop opinion poll. Mélenchon entered the arena to techno music and a roar from the audience, before running through the highlights of his programme. He promised to make France non aligned (by withdrawing from Nato) while condemning Russian killings in Ukraine, to end France’s dependence on nuclear power; freeze the price of fuel and essential goods; lower the retirement age from 62 to 60; introduce a minimum wage of €1,400 a month and address noise, air and other pollution. He also promised feminist-friendly measures including an end to the rampant femicide – one woman is killed by a partner or ex-partner in France every three days. Power, Mélenchon insisted, had to be with the people and he would govern with the use of citizens’ referendums, one of the demands of the gilets jaunes movement. Mélenchon said he would also end the spread of “malbouffe” (junk food) and bring about what he called “deglobalisation” or reindustrialising the country. “Don’t tell me we cannot make shoes or hats or jeans here that haven’t travelled halfway around the world. We can,” he said. The crowd roared. “It’s not the unemployed who are responsible for unemployment, not the sick responsible for the health crisis, not the poor responsible for poverty,” he said. “If we get to the second round we are determined to change the world. That is what we will do if we win this election.” There were digs at Macron and the far right’s Le Pen – both expected to be in the second round runoff. “We see Ms Le Pen with her cats, it bores me, I only have a cactus, which is not as good for Instagram,” Mélenchon said. The thousands of people who queued outside the Grand Palais in Lille were a mixed crowd of all ages and backgrounds, some committed Mélenchon supporters, others seeking to be convinced, or not. Marine Dhap, 32, a freelance marketing agent from Lille, said she had voted Mélenchon before but it was the first time she had seen him. “He’s in third place and this week will be decisive. It’s positive that he’s not very far behind in the polls so he has every chance of being in the second round. His vision is the best on the left and I like his programme that is for a more human system including a greater sharing of wealth. He also has some very good social and green ideas.” Oliver Genty, 62, a former SNCF train driver from the outskirts of Lille, said he had supported Mélenchon in several elections. “I think he’s the only one who is for the workers and is more for ordinary people than Macron who comes from the world of finance,” he said. “I think he could end up in the second round.” Genty said he regretted there were “too many leftwing parties” splitting the vote. “I would have preferred him to have made an alliance with the Socialists and the Communist party.” Genty said in the event of a Le Pen v Macron second round runoff he would vote for Macron. “I will feel obliged to vote against the extreme right.” Fabienne Courmont, 60, a cleaner, said she would have a problem voting for Macron. “I won’t vote for Marine Le Pen but the idea that she could win makes me afraid. If I do vote it won’t be for Macron, it will be against her.” Antonio Messana, 51, an archivist, Christelle Goffard, 49, a sociologist and Julie Vanhoye, 44, unemployed, had travelled from Dunkirk, an hour’s drive away to see the charismatic radical left leader, known for his fiery oratory skills. “I am already convinced by his ideas. He’s the only one who gives us hope; he is intelligent and positive, not like the other candidates. I am hopeful he will get into the second round. Optimistic,” Messana said. “I am attracted to his social and ecological ideas particularly that there should be a more equal sharing of wealth,” Goffard added. “I would like him to talk about women’s equality.” Vanhoye said she had yet to be convinced and was hesitating between the Communist candidate, Fabien Roussel, or Mélenchon. “I have come to listen,” she said. Jean-Marc, 65, a teacher, said he had previously been a Socialist party voter but did not see the point of voting for a candidate with no chance. “I will vote for him in the first round in the hope that he gets through and we have a real left-right debate in the second. But if Mélenchon gets into the second round he will have to soften his (radical) stance to appeal to others on the Left.” Marthe Bouganim, 27, who works for a human rights association in Lille, had turned up with three girl friends. “I voted for Mélenchon in 2017 and I have the impression there’s more of a team behind him this time. He is not such a one-man show; he is surrounded by interesting people.” Mélenchon has been campaigning since the autumn of 2020, longer than any other presidential candidate, so it was perhaps tiredness that meant his speech was less inflammatory and incendiary than supporters have come to expect. The meeting ended with a rendition of the Marseillaise. Manon Aubry, a Mélenchon campaigner and co-chair of the Left in the European Parliament parliamentary group, said Mélenchon was now within the opinion polls “margin of error” meaning he stood a real chance of getting into the second round. She said the challenge was to mobilise voters in working-class areas where Mélenchon support was strong. “Our objective is to show that going out to vote can make a difference,” she said. Mona Rose, 24, a student at Sciences Po in Lille, added: “The majority of young people I know will either vote for Mélenchon or they won’t vote at all.” She said the idea of another Le Pen v Macron second round made her “very angry”. “The more I hear of Mélenchon’s programme, the more strongly I feel about it. If everyone here convinces a few people around them he might get through. I’ll be trying to do that until Sunday.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/aug/28/labor-anthony-albanese-tax-cuts-scott-morrison-ministries-coalition-liberals-jobs-new-south-wales-victoria-covid-","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T07:30:30Z","webTitle":"Pocock urges Labor to scrap tax cuts – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/28/labor-anthony-albanese-tax-cuts-scott-morrison-ministries-coalition-liberals-jobs-new-south-wales-victoria-covid-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/28/labor-anthony-albanese-tax-cuts-scott-morrison-ministries-coalition-liberals-jobs-new-south-wales-victoria-covid-","fields":{"headline":"Pocock urges Labor to scrap tax cuts – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to wrap things up for the day.

Crossbench senators, including the ACT senator David Pocock, are urging the government to scrap the stage three tax cuts.

Free pads and tampons will be offered to Western Australian public school students in years 7 to 12 to ensure girls are not skipping class because they cannot afford sanitary products, reports the ABC. WA is the last state in Australia to offer free period products in schools, with the program set to roll out in the first term of next year. “It’s about bloody time we’ve done this in schools,” women’s interests minister Simone McGurk said. “For too long, girls and young women have felt embarrassed [and] they often haven’t had access to the products they’ve needed.” Tomorrow: Mystery surrounds a cluster of bowerbird deaths in the Gold Coast hinterland Bird experts and wildlife carers have been documenting healthy birds that have fallen ill and died around Tamborine Mountain in recent weeks.

Eligibility has been tightened until the new shipment arrives and websites for two of the five clinics that administer the vaccine in Melbourne say they have run out of doses. Health minister Mary-Anne Thomas said the vaccine is in scarce supply around the world and Victoria initially had a “limited number” available. “We are awaiting supply from the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth is working hard to bring in vaccines. This is a global challenge,” she told reporters on Sunday. “We’re certainly looking to the vaccine manufacturers to increase the supply and make sure that we can get it as available to as many people as possible.” Nick Kyrgios to face his friend Thanasi Kokkinakis in US Open first round Nick Kyrgios says it is “win win” drawing Thanasi Kokkinakis in the US Open first round as he grapples with home sickness, fatigue and the new-found pressures of being an in-form grand slam finalist. After four months on the road, Kyrgios says he cannot return home to Canberra quickly enough to see his family and sick mother. But first the Wimbledon runner-up has another slam to attend to, starting with an uncomfortable centre-court meeting with his friend and Australian Open-winning doubles partner on Monday night (11am Tuesday AEST). “Obviously you never want to play a good mate first round,” Kyrgios said before an early evening practice session at Flushing Meadows. “I’ve played a lot of mates this swing – Alex de Minaur in Montreal, [Frances] Tiafoe in Washington, [Jack] Sock in doubles.

The peculiars of pecuniary interests in Canberra By almost any measure the 47th parliament is the most diverse ever and the same seems true judging by the weird and wonderful collection of interests parliamentarians have declared. The register of interests is designed to provide transparency around interests that may conflict, or may be seen to conflict, with MPs’ and senators’ public duty.

More on Melbourne shooting: hospital locked down as police searched area A hospital was locked down for two hours after a shooting near a fast-food restaurant in Melbourne’s north-west, as a police hunt continues. Three people got into a verbal dispute near the St Albans shop on Sunday morning before a shot was fired into the back windscreen of a blue Holden Commodore. A man and woman inside the car fled towards Sunshine Hospital on Furlong Road and crashed into a responding marked police vehicle. They ran away on foot in different directions, with the woman arrested inside the hospital and the man a block away. The woman suffered an injury to her foot but police are unsure whether it occurred in the shooting or in her efforts to evade officers. Acting Senior Sergeant Ben McGibbon said the hospital was locked down while police searched a nearby construction site and surrounding areas. It resumed normal operations after about two hours. The pair have been taken to a police station as detectives look to uncover what triggered the initial altercation. “Not many things like this occur at this time of the morning on Sunday,” McGibbon told reporters. “But for this to have occurred something has sparked it, and there’s either been an altercation or disagreement or something has happened.” The third person remains on the run and police believe they may be carrying a small handgun. “The investigation is in its infancy,” McGibbon said. “We’re still hoping for some other witnesses to come forward to tell us an independent version of what’s actually occurred.” – via AAP A gun has been fired and two people arrested after a fight near a fast-food restaurant in Melbourne’s north-west, AAP reports. A blue Holden Commodore was hit by a gunshot during an incident between three people at St Albans on Sunday morning, police say. A man and woman fled in the car towards a hospital along Furlong Road and collided with a responding marked police vehicle. They tried to run away on foot in different directions but the woman was arrested inside the hospital and the man about a block away, before being taken into custody. The third person remains on the run. The foreign minister Penny Wong has blasted Russia for “deliberately obstructing” a nuclear treaty conference at the United Nations amid a dispute about control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine. Wong said that the government was “deeply disappointed” that the review conference of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT) did not reach a consensus outcome after four weeks of negotiation between 151 countries at the UN in New York. Russia had refused to agree to a statement of support for the NPT which aimed to reaffirm and bolster the treaty’s aims of disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The statement included a paragraph that emphasised “the paramount importance of ensuring control by Ukraine’s competent authorities of nuclear facilities … such as the Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant”. The plant is currently occupied by Russian forces. “Russia has deliberately obstructed progress. Its actions directly challenge core tenets of the NPT,” Wong said in a statement on Sunday. “We condemn Russia’s ongoing unprovoked and unjustifiable war of aggression and call on Russia to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territory.” Wong said Australia remained “deeply committed” to the NPT goal of a world without nuclear weapons: Australia is steadfast in our support of the NPT as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime. Irrespective of this outcome, the treaty continues to deliver tangible security benefits to us all. Australia’s tech industry has called for cyber skills to be given priority at Australia’s upcoming national skills summit to help address cybersecurity risks, AAP reports. Global software company Elastic, which serves half the Fortune 500, says calls by Andy Penn for greater government investment in education is the bottom line for strengthening Australia’s cyber protections. The outgoing Telstra CEO and top federal government industry cyber advisor recently warned a National Press Club audience that the online lives of Australians are increasingly vulnerable and their skills lacking. Elastic’s regional vice-president Anna Mascarello says the technology sector can do more at the grassroots level to feed the talent pool too. “We’re in conversation with Australian universities to understand how we can help support the curriculum and nurture the next generation of critical thinkers,” she said. The Productivity Commission says industry certifications and short courses could help build knowledge at a time when a skills shortage is holding Australia back on adopting digital technologies and cyber safeguards. The two-day Jobs and Skills Summit begins on Thursday. No one with Covid-19 has died in South Australia overnight, with the state recording 439 new cases on Sunday morning, 153 people in hospital, and 7 in ICU. A little more on the green jobs roundtable discussions the environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, will host on Monday to lead into the jobs and skills summit. Plibersek says environmental jobs are an “exciting growth space for Australia’s economy” with enormous potential if the government gets the settings right. She says: This is particularly exciting for regional Australia, where many of these jobs will end up being based. As an example, on Friday I visited a farm in Griffith and heard about the types of professions being utilised on the land, in agribusiness, to enhance regenerative farming practices – agronomists to improve soil health, environmental consultants to advise on native bush regeneration, small businesses turning cotton waste and food waste into compost and fertiliser. These are the types of jobs that will drive a future green economy in Australia and I want to set our country up to be a world leader in this space. The first of the two roundtables will focus on how to create more opportunities and better career pathways in a green economy. The second will look at nature and productivity, how to value the environment and build new industries. Plibersek says green jobs will be central to the government’s environmental policies and will feed into the summit. We would welcome input from the Greens political party – or indeed any other political party – into the jobs white paper process. The summit is just the beginning. There is plenty of time and opportunity for those willing to get involved. Dog rescued from flood waters in WA Western Australian police have rescued an 80-year-old man’s bull mastiff named Max from a vehicle trapped by rising flood waters. At 7.30am police responded to a call from a member of the public about a car stuck in flood waters on Katrine Road in Katrine, about 94km north-east of Perth. The car was stranded about 20 metres into the flood waters and while the man was able to escape to dry land he was unable to rescue Max – who weighed 30kgs. As the waters began to pick up speed, two officers who waded out to the car and carried Max to safety. Max, reportedly, was very happy to be reunited with his owner. As the recent electric vehicle summit got under way Dr Jake Whitehead was sitting in a plane somewhere over the Indian Ocean. The conference was intended as a reset to overcome nearly a decade of Australia’s policy inertia on electric vehicles and road transport under the former Coalition government – but Whitehead, head of policy at the Electric Vehicle Council, was on holiday. It had been a dream trip for a longtime EV researcher: three separate stints across thousands of kilometres in three different countries with his partner – all in electric or hybrid vehicles. As his colleagues were shaking hands and listening to keynote speeches, Whitehead was getting a first-hand education in what the rest of the world had been up to on the electric vehicle front during the two years Australia closed its borders to the world. “You can read as much as you want online but it’s not until you’re actually over there and able to do the comparison that you can see what’s actually happening here in Australia,” he says. “It’s amazing to see how much further these countries have come.” For more on how the return of travel is showing Australians how the world has moved on EVs, read the full weekend feature. Independent MP Dr Sophie Scamps has responded to claims made by Deputy Liberal MP Sussan Ley on Saturday that “no one in the world is making electric utes” by pointing to several EV utes that are currently on the market. No one with Covid-19 has died in the Northern Territory overnight, with the territory recording 63 new cases on Sunday morning, 14 people in hospital, and no one in ICU. Another NSW government MP is pulling up stumps and will retire from politics at the next state election, AAP reports. The Nationals MP for the mid-north coast electorate of Oxley, Melinda Pavey, announced her decision in a Sydney newspaper on Sunday. Her Nationals leader, Paul Toole, said she had been a passionate advocate for regional communities for 20 years. “She has served across both chambers of the NSW Parliament, entering the Legislative Council just weeks after giving birth to her daughter, Emily,” he said in a statement. Mel can be proud that her time in the parliament and as a long-time member of the NSW Nationals team has helped deliver a stronger regional NSW for the next generation. Pavey joins a stream of Liberal and Nationals MPs throwing in the towel ahead of the NSW state election in March next year. The Liberal departure list so far includes Corrections Minister and Parramatta MP Geoff Lee, Customer Service Minister and Ryde MP Victor Dominello, Riverstone MP Kevin Conolly and Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton. Departing Nationals MPs include the member for the seat of Clarence Chris Gulaptis and Myall Lakes MP Stephen Bromhead, and now Pavey. Infrastructure, Cities, and Active Transport Minister Rob Stokes, who holds the Liberal seat of Pittwater, earlier this month said he was still weighing up whether or not to run again. There’s also speculation another Liberal, Health Minister Brad Hazzard, is also considering his political future. Victoria’s opposition will match the state government’s announcement to cover the cost of nursing and midwifery degrees if elected in November. Speaking at the Liberal party state conference on Sunday, the opposition health spokeswoman, Georgie Crozier, says the $270m plan to cover the cost of more than 10,000 nursing and midwifery degrees, as well as offer scholarships for nurses to undertake postgraduate specialities, has come too late: Daniel Andrews has had eight years to do this and has failed to do anything ... This government is bereft of ideas and are coming at this late time to make an announcement. Greens urge Tanya Plibersek to focus on jobs that protect the environment The Greens are calling on the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to use the jobs and skills summit to promote jobs that protect and restore the environment. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, the Greens’ environment spokesperson, has written to Plibersek to say a focus on green jobs could help many plants and animals “before they are lost forever”. The letter says: A strong plan to invest in green jobs would provide a high return on investment while also ensuring the restoration and recovery of critical ecosystems and wildlife. As the State of the Environment report showed, Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinction in the world. There are almost 2000 species listed as threatened under the EPBC (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation) Act, with many still waiting on recovery plans well past their due date. The party is calling for intensive environmental restoration and water management, a target to plant 2 billion trees by 2030 and a taskforce to restore forests and revegetate bushland and degraded habitat . Hanson-Young writes this would provide jobs across the country and help reduce carbon pollution. The government has two roundtables scheduled on green jobs to feed into the summit. No one with Covid-19 has died in Australian Capital Territory overnight, with the territory recording 175 new cases on Sunday morning, 104 people in hospital, three in ICU and one on ventilation. The Victorian government is set to cover the cost of more than 10,000 nursing and midwifery degrees, in an effort to boost the state’s health workforce. The premier, Daniel Andrews, and the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, announced the $270m initiative at the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Victorian branch on Sunday. Under the plan, all new domestic students enrolling in a professional-entry nursing or midwifery course in 2023 and 2024 will receive a scholarship of up to $16,500 to cover course costs. Students will receive $9,000 while they study and the remaining $7,500 if they work in Victorian public health services for two years. A postgraduate midwifery incentive program will also be expanded to cover course costs and salary support for 150 existing nurses to complete their specialist studies in midwifery. Scholarships worth an average of $10,000 will also be available for nurses who complete postgraduate studies in areas of need including intensive care, cancer care, paediatrics and nurse practitioner specialities. In a statement, Andrews said: If you’re in Year 12 and you’ve been thinking about studying nursing or midwifery – go for it. We’ve got your Hecs fees covered. Every health system in the country is under enormous pressure due to the pandemic. The best thing we can do to support our hardworking staff is give them more support on the ground – that’s why this package will train and hire more nurses than ever before. Queensland recorded 1,125 new Covid-19 cases overnight, with the state recording 288 people in hospital on Sunday morning and ten in ICU. The state does not report deaths on Sunday or Monday and instead publishes them as part of their Tuesday totals. Tony Abbott: ‘If you want to keep the Andrews government, vote teal’ The former prime minister Tony Abbott is rallying the Liberal faithful to stick fast with the Victorian Liberal party leader, Matthew Guy, after a fresh bout of poor polling. Abbott flew into Melbourne for a Liberal party fundraiser at Preston on Saturday night, just under three months until the November election. The Victorian Coalition continues to trail Labor in the polls, with the latest Newspoll from Saturday suggesting the Andrews government is on track for a third term. Labor holds a 56-44% two-party-preferred lead, compared with 58-42% in the previous Newspoll and 57-42% result at the 2018 election. Dissatisfaction with Guy’s performance has risen seven points since November, two months after toppling Michael O’Brien in a leadership challenge. But Abbott believes the Victorian Liberal-Nationals can turn the tables, citing the 2010 federal election when he led the Coalition to 72 lower house seats and forced Labor into minority government. “No one thought we had a chance in 2010 and we did extremely well against a first term government because we had a strong sense of what we stood for,” he told Sky News. A Liberal party that stands for things, that fights for things, always has the hope of victory, the scent of victory in its nostrils. Integrity is seen by voters as a key issue for the November 26 state election, as both major parties head to the polls with questions over their heads. Abbott described the Andrews government as ethically challenged but would not be drawn on the state Liberals’ donor scandal involving Guy’s former chief of staff Mitch Catlin. Victorian Liberal MPs are facing more independent challenges in traditional heartland seats such as Kew, Sandringham and Hawthorn after several of their federal colleagues were ousted by the “teal” wave at May’s federal election. Needing 18 seats to reclaim government outright, Abbott said voters should understand that casting their ballot for teals will keep Labor in power. “The Andrews government is probably one of the worst governments Australia has ever had,” he said. If you want to keep the Andrews government, vote teal. If you want to change the Andrews government vote Liberal. Simple as that. Guy is due to give a speech at the Victorian Liberals state council meeting on Sunday. -from AAP Richard Marles to tour Europe as defence minister The defence minister, Richard Marles, will tour key British shipyards as the government moves ahead with its decision to purchase nuclear-powered submarines, AAP reports. The 18-month consultation period under which the government will decide whether to purchase US or UK made submarines is coming up in March 2023. Marles previously visited Washington and will now tour yards “which build some of the world’s most capable ships and submarines”. “Our relationship with the United Kingdom is both historic and mutually beneficial, and is reflected through our continued commitment to Aukus,” he said in a statement. “I look forward to meeting my counterpart, [the] secretary of state for defence, Ben Wallace, and collaborating on a new era of opportunities and challenges.” The defence minister, who is also deputy prime minister, will visit France and Germany over a four-day stint as Europe looks to expand its presence in the Indo-Pacific. Germany recently joined Exercise Pitch Black, which brought around 100 aircraft to Australia’s Top End, for the first time, and mobilised fighter jets to Singapore within 24 hours to highlight its rapid response capabilities. Marles will meet with his German and French counterparts to discuss defence cooperation as well as participate in industry roundtables. This visit reflects the importance we attach to our European partnerships and reaffirms the government’s commitment to working together towards shared strategic goals that transcend geography. No one with Covid-19 has died in Tasmania overnight, with the state recording 178 new cases on Sunday morning, 30 people in hospital, and one in ICU. Greens urge Plibersek to take leading role in pushing for UN marine environment treaty The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has called on the Australian government to convene an emergency meeting with the UN, after the latest attempt to pass a global agreement to protect the world’s oceans and marine life failed. An effort to reach an agreement on a proposed UN treaty to protect sea life fell through on Saturday night when negotiations in New York were suspended, following a two-week effort. The treaty sought to protect portions of the world’s oceans not currently protected by domestic laws by setting aside 30% of ocean area as a form of marine sanctuary. The focus on was on shared benefits from marine life, the establishment of protected areas, assistance to developing countries to provide skills and means for ocean exploration and efforts to prevent harm from human activity. Russia was among countries said to be holding up the process by refusing to engage with the treaty process or refusing to find compromise with EU member countries. The talks will resume next year, unless a special emergency sessions is called before the end of 2022. Whish-Wilson said the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, should live up to promises to take a global leadership role in ocean protection by leading efforts to declare a special emergency session. “Sadly talks to pass the UN High Seas Treaty have failed, but it’s not too late for Tanya Plibersek to convene an emergency meeting with UN member states and take a true leadership role in protecting the world’s oceans and marine life,” Whish-Wilson said in a statement. A failure to make progress on a UN High Seas Treaty now threatens the livelihoods and food security of billions of people around the world. It’s been 40 years since the last international agreement on ocean protection was signed and we can’t wait any longer. This is Quite Good. The independent senator David Pocock has called for the federal government to abandon its stage three tax cuts, saying that he understands the government “doesn’t want to be accused of breaking an election promise, but [not cutting the] stage three tax cuts are not his”. “Reconsidering them is the right thing to do,” Pocock said. Unions and employees detail plans to invest in skills Westacott says rebuilding the Tafe system after a period of “underinvested” was important to addressing this. Companies are very happy to step up here … but you do need higher wages, particularly for smaller business. The other thing we’ve calling for is that we have got to get a system where people can do life-long learning, micro credentials, stack stuff up, get skills more quickly. Not having to go back and do a 3-year Tafe course or 3-year[s of] university, they can get things more quickly, keep their skills current. The final question is for McManus, who is asked about calls for the government to raise the unemployment rate from $46 a day – a figure well below the poverty line – and why apprentice wages should be a priority. … Apprentices are paid appallingly and we are not attracting people to do those jobs because they can’t live on those wages. That is something that is needed if we are going to be able to move … to renewable energy, for example. We absolutely need to address that particular issue, and investing in Tafe and Vet [Vocational Education and Training] is part of productivity, it is part of how you become a more productive country is by investing in people so that they can use skills. Business council looking to lift migration cap by 220,000 places ABC’s Insiders is asking the heads of the ACTU and BCA if they both want to revive an agreement from a years ago regarding the better off overall test. Westacott clarifies that she wants to “progress the key principles of it”. On the migration cap, Westacott is asked how high the BCA would like to see the cap lifted. She says she wants it lifted by 220,000 places. We have to do two things: Deal with the short-term issues you have been talking about this morning. We just don’t have enough people to do things but the real purpose of migration is not to focus on a number, but to focus on what do we want the role of migration to be, which is bringing in the skills that will allow us to go to what I call the frontier economy. Westacott says she wants Australia to bring in the “best and brightest” people “from around the world to come in, transfer their knowledge and drive innovation”. McManus is asked for her view: We’ve said a bit less than that, but around the same figure, but for us the issues are needing a plan to address wages and needing a plan to address skills. McManus says she wants to see more Australians trained to do these jobs and more permanent migration, not just temporary migration to fill a job. ACTU: we support ‘simple and fair’ bargaining McManus is asked on whether, like Westacott, she would like to see the principles of enterprise bargaining as proposed under the Hawke-Keating governments introduced as “originally designed”. McManus: Yes, the idea of bargaining being simple and fair is something we both support. Those are the principles absolutely. Just where Jennifer left off on the Hawke and Keating enterprise bargaining system, I think we can get close to that and make it better. Simple for workers and simple for employers. The thing that is different is the better off overall test. We moved away from what was called the no-disadvantage test because some employers were rorting it, using it to cut wages and then had unfair competition with other employers. We have to change that to make sure it is about bargaining going forward. Asked about a previous agreement where the ACTU and BCA nearly came to an agreement about enterprise bargaining, the idea was that agreements could be fast-tracked through the Fair Work Commission, waiving the “better off overall” test. Westacott is asked whether she would like to see this. She says both organisations are on a “unity ticket that we want people to be paid more and those wage increases sustained”. Enterprise bargaining, when done well, when you look at the data and averages on wages, people on enterprise agreements get substantially more money. That’s the starting point. The principles that Sally and I negotiated a couple of years ago are basically the ones we should take forward. Don’t get rid of the better off overall test, make it better off overall. Get rid of this idea of hypothetical workers. This is the crucial thing: When the parties agree, when they have negotiated in good faith, when they have followed the processes, [then] the Fair Work Commission doesn’t try to re-write and micro manage that agreement. Make sure the … people who haven’t been party to the agreement can’t come in later and blow everything up. ACTU: Individual bargaining is ‘not practical and not happening’ McManus and Westacott are being led in a dialogue that is meant to echo what is to come at the Skills Summit going on. McManus is asked to respond to the concerns raised by the BCA: It is very simple. If you [are working] in a child care centre, the idea that you can bargain with individual management … and improve wages for yourself, let alone all child care workers is obviously not practical and not happening. They deserve … the same rights as everyone else. Business council says one-size-fits-all approach to wages will be a disservice to employers Jennifer Westacott, the head of the Business Council of Australia, is asked to respond to these points and says her concern is that “we try to fix one problem and end up with a lot more”. She says innovation and productivity grows wages and it would be unfair for a business in Bendigo to have its wages and conditions set by a manufacturer in Tasmania or Adelaide. “How will that work to drive inflation?” Westacott asks. She also says her concern is about driving competition and prioritising innovation in areas like aged care to “give better patient care, to give better services” as “many of them are stuck in very old-fashioned demarcation areas”: My next concern is industry-wide strike action. Don’t forget before the 1983 summit, we lost 1.3m days in strike action, and I know that’s not Sally’s intent. On sector-wide bargaining, Westacott says a one-size-fits-all approach will be a disservice to employers: My final concern is this idea of pattern bargaining, where somewhere in the supply chain you start negotiation and then as it moves through the supply chain, it ends up with an employer who simply doesn’t have the capacity to pay that – irrespective of their workers, their markets, their customers, the amount of money they’ve got to pay. So they are our concerns. McManus: normal part of bargaining to have industrial action as a last resort McManus is asked if she wants workers in specific business to regain the right to strike in support of workers in other business (otherwise known as sympathy strikes or solidarity action). McManus: Not in support of workers in another business – together. It is a normal part of bargaining to have … as a last resort, to take industrial action, and that is what happens in countries that have multi-employer bargaining, and there [are] not more strikes, there is more pay rises. Essentially when workers have an option to do that, obviously it means the option to have a better outcome, and a better outcome more quickly. ACTU: workers’ bargaining system must suit the economy of today First question this morning on ABC’s Insiders is for Sally McManus, the head of the ACTU, about sector-wide bargaining and whether she wants this across-the-board or only for specific sectors. McManus said the experience of workers over the last 30 years has seen their bargaining power lost. McManus: Basically, workers’ bargaining power has been smashed over that period of time That’s why we have a problem, a huge problem, with wages growth and unless we address that issue, that is not going to change. We think [sector-wide bargaining] should be open to all, but obviously a lot of places … they are getting pay rises at the moment. They can access the bargaining system. […] But the system was never designed for people in small workplaces, people in funded services, people like those cleaners and it just needs to be upgraded and suit the economy of today, not the economy of 30 years ago. Five people with Covid-19 have died in New South Wales overnight, with the state recording 4,160 new cases on Sunday morning, 1,821 people in hospital, and 45 in ICU. ABC Insiders this morning is talking about the upcoming skills summit, with guests including the ACTU’s secretary, Sally McManus, and the Business Council of Australia’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott. Skilled migration isn’t a substitute for training, treasurer says The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has appeared on Sky News this morning where he warned any lift to the migration cap cannot be made at the expense of training the domestic workforce. The Business Council of Australia is urging the government to boost the permanent migration cap to 220,000 temporarily to make up for the shortfall in migration during the pandemic. Chalmers says the government will look at sensible migration policy and reform at the upcoming skills and jobs summit, but Australians shouldn’t be stripped of opportunities in the labour market. We can’t fall in the trap of saying migration is a substitute for training, we need to move on both fronts in sensible ways. We can do something sensible [with immigration], we can have more appropriate settings for our economy at the same time as we train more of our people for more of these opportunities, as well as make it easier for people to participate in the labour market. The treasurer also defended not having bank heads attend the government’s signature jobs summit at the start of September. “The bank CEOs will be represented very capably by [Australian Banking Association head] Anna Bligh,” Dr Chalmers said. I speak to the bank CEOs all the time in my job. I’ve had meetings with all of them in the last month or so. And they’re obviously providing key input into our economic policies. More broadly, you know, it’s not possible to fit everyone that you would like to fit in a job summit. In a number of instances, we’ve got peak groups there representing a broader constituency. The nationals leader, David Littleproud, is attending the summit despite it being snubbed by the opposition leader, Peter Dutton. Appearing on Sky News this morning, Littleproud acknowledged Dutton’s suggestion the invitation could be a stunt but said it was rare for rural and regional Australia to be given such a platform. The National party solely looks after regional rural Australia. We have a purity of purpose. We very rarely get a voice. We feel as the Nationals it was important we use whatever platform, no matter how hollow it may be. That we are there advocating for policies that are unique, that will address the challenges that regional [and] rural Australians are facing. - with AAP Nine people with Covid-19 have died in Victoria overnight, with the state recording 2,099 new cases on Sunday morning, 372 people in hospital, 23 in ICU and 6 on ventilation. Two arrested after late-night Adelaide brawl Two men have been charged after allegedly arming themselves with an axe and a knife in a late-night brawl at an Adelaide park, AAP reports. A 23-year-old Rosewater man suffered minor injuries to his arms after he was allegedly hit with a small axe during the fight at Ferryden Park before midnight on Saturday. The fight is believed to have been between groups known to each other and the victim was taken to Queen Elizabeth hospital for treatment. Police searched the area and located the two suspects nearby, including one allegedly in possession of a knife. A 22-year-old Port Adelaide man and a 19-year-old Rosewater man were charged with aggravated assault and affray before being bailed to appear in court at a later date. Labor: balance needed between skilled migrants and local training Gallagher would not be drawn, however, on questions about whether she would support sector-wide collective bargaining or what her position would be on lifting the cap on skilled migration to address labour shortages. Gallagher: I think what we need to do is get a balance between the skilled migration program, access to permanent residency and – don’t take the eye off the ball of training local … young people or training everybody for the jobs and opportunities of the future. And I think that’s where it’s got a little bit out of whack over the last few years … people have seen the migration program as a way of importing skills without having the focus on training local … Australians for those jobs and those opportunities. Finance minister: sector-wide bargaining not a flashback to the 70s The finance minister and minister for women, Katy Gallagher, has appeared on the ABC this morning talking about equal pay and participation of women in the workplace. Gallagher said the issue of low wages was critical to correct the gender-pay gap which sees women “working for less than men across the board”. She said that wages in “a highly feminised industry” like childcare is “plagued by low wages” which meant addressing low pay was critical. “That’s not fair, we want to change that,” she said. “The care economy presents a huge opportunity for us not to just deal with women’s workforce participation, but also to build a workforce for the future because it’s a massive area of growth and is going to continue to be so. That will get a real focus at the job summit as well.” Gallagher was asked about comments by the Australian Industry Group that described a plan by the ACTU to return to sector-wide bargaining on wages as a “throwback to the 70s”. “I think there is universal agreement that the enterprise bargaining system isn’t working as it was intended,” Gallagher said: But this discussion we are having at the jobs summit is a discussion about today’s economy, and today’s challenges. So I don’t support the idea it’s a flashback to the 1970s. This is really about how do we set up the employment framework for a modern economy with new challenges, and to make sure it protects the rights of working people but also allows business to flourish as well. And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. The former Howard government minister MP Fran Bailey has spoken about her clash with Scott Morrison when he was managing director at Tourism Australia. In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Bailey was critical of Morrison, saying he had a “supreme belief that only he can do a job”. Bailey was scathing of Morrison’s prime ministership and says he must now leave parliament over the secret ministries affair. Pressure is growing on the federal government to delay or scrap the planned stage 3 tax cuts after half of the 18 cross-benchers in federal parliament said they would support such a move. In the senate, the Greens and senators David Pocock, Jacqui Lambie and Tammy Tyrrell are against the tax cuts. When the Sun-Herald and Sunday Age contacted all 18 cross-bench MPs and senators, nine said they wanted the tax cuts scrapped or delayed, two wanted to keep them, three were on the fence and four did not respond to requests for comment.

As Moscow, defying global condemnation and overwhelming political and economic isolation, claimed on Wednesday to have seized the first large city of its campaign and the Ukrainian president accused it of aiming to “erase” his country, the World Health Organization said some health supplies were already starting to run out. “We are moving closer to a humanitarian crisis,” Jarno Hubicht, the WHO representative in Ukraine, said. “This is moving very fast. Health service provisions are being moved to shelters and basements. We are concerned about electricity provision, oxygen and medicines.” WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the group was also working to verify multiple reports of “attacks on health facilities and health workers”, adding that attacks on healthcare would be “a violation of international humanitarian law”. In New York, the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s attack “in the strongest possible terms” and demand the immediate withdrawal of its forces, after Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, compared the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to Hitler. Kyslytsya said the invasion was intended “to deprive Ukraine of the very right to exist”, adding: “They have come to resolve the Ukrainian issue. More than 80 years ago, another dictator tried to finally resolve the issue of another people. He failed.” A second round of talks between the two sides is due to get under way on Thursday, Russian negotiators reportedly said, adding that a ceasefire was “on the agenda”. However, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing cities if any progress is to be made. More than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded since the invasion began, Ukraine’s emergency service said, adding that hundreds of buildings – transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens, homes – had been destroyed. “Children, women and defence forces are losing their lives every hour,” it said. The UN refugee agency said 836,000 people had now fled Ukraine, mostly women and children but including many foreign students and migrant workers, and the number was rising rapidly. At least 450,000 have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland, the government in Warsaw said, with 113,000 arriving in Romania. The UK and 37 other countries formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the international criminal court (ICC). Under ICC rules, such a referral from member states means that the prosecutor does not have to get the approval of ICC judges before opening an investigation, speeding up the process. “With 37 countries joining the UK, it is the largest referral in the history of the ICC,” said Britain’s Foreign Office. Later the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, said he had actively begun an investigation into the war in Ukraine. The European Commission on Wednesday proposed granting temporary protection to refugees from the Ukraine conflict, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare in all member states. After seven days of fighting, the Russian defence ministry in Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea. Reports said contact had been established between Russian troops and the city council. After repeated missile strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, that have hit non-military buildings including a hospital and university and killed at least 25 civilians, Russian airborne troops landed in the city at about 3am on Wednesday, officials said, and were engaged in heavy fighting. Kharkiv’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said every fourth person in the city had relatives in Russia, but the city’s attitude to the country today was “completely different. We never expected this could happen: total destruction, annihilation, genocide against the Ukrainian people – this is unforgivable.” Oleksiy Demchenko, a 27-year-old computer programmer in the city, said: “To tell the truth, it’s hell. They are hitting people’s houses, health facilities, parks. I think their goal is to break us psychologically because they want us to evacuate. But our army will protect us. People won’t surrender.” The south-eastern city of Mariupol had also been under increasingly intense shelling since late on Tuesday night and was unable even to evacuate the wounded, according to its mayor, Vadym Boichenko. “Russian forces have been flattening us non-stop for 12 hours now,” he said. Massed Russian forces also appeared to be preparing for a decisive advance on the capital, Kyiv. “The enemy is drawing up forces closer to the capital,” the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. “Kyiv is holding and will hold. We are going to fight.” In its first statement on casualties on Wednesday, the Russian defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine since the beginning of its invasion, and 1,597 wounded. A Ukrainian military adviser said more than 7,000 Russians have been killed and hundreds taken prisoner, including senior officers. The Ukrainian president said Russia aimed to erase Ukraine, its history and its people. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a short video statement that the west must do more to help his country. He said a Russian missile attack on Kyiv that struck close to the Babyn Yar memorial, where occupying Nazi troops in the second world war massacred almost the entire Jewish population of the capital, showed how little many in Russia knew about Ukraine. “They don’t know a thing about Kyiv, about our history,” Zelenskiy said. “But they all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all.” He urged EU governments to support Ukraine’s request for urgent accession to the bloc. The Russian advance has been met by fiercer resistance than Moscow seems to have expected. US observers have said a long Russian armoured convoy north of Kyiv seems to have stalled, hampered by logistics issues including food and fuel shortages. Some units are reported to have low morale. But military experts have said they are concerned Russia is shifting tactics, relying on the kind of heavy artillery and air bombardments it deployed in Chechnya and Syria to pulverise urban centres and crush defending forces’ resolve. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Russia’s actions qualified as war crimes. With its air force heavily outnumbered, Ukraine has called on Nato to establish a no-fly zone over the country, a request western governments are reluctant to consider because of the risk that it would bring the alliance into direct armed conflict with the world’s largest nuclear power. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Wednesday ruled out a no-fly zone, saying it would “lead to a war against Russia across the whole of Europe” but also prevent Ukrainian pilots being able to target Russian forces from the air, giving an advantage to Moscow’s stronger ground troops and tanks. The Russian president has drawndrew global condemnation for ordering the invasion of Ukraine last Thursday, but the west has responded with sanctions aimed at shutting Russia’s economy off from the global financial system and forcing international companies to cut their ties with the aggressor. The measures have sent the rouble plunging to historic lows and raised the prospect of severe recession in Russia. China, however, said on Wednesday it would not be joining western financial sanctions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2021/nov/22/johnson-losing-the-confidence-of-tory-party-after-rambling-cbi-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-22T21:05:13Z","webTitle":"Johnson ‘losing the confidence’ of Tory party after rambling CBI speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/22/johnson-losing-the-confidence-of-tory-party-after-rambling-cbi-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/nov/22/johnson-losing-the-confidence-of-tory-party-after-rambling-cbi-speech","fields":{"headline":"Johnson ‘losing the confidence’ of Tory party after rambling CBI speech","bodyText":"Conservative MPs are increasingly worried about Boris Johnson’s competence and drive after he gave a rambling speech to business leaders and was accused of losing his grip over a series of key policies from social care to rail. Senior members of his own party said they needed Johnson to get the government back on track after a disastrous two weeks amid dismay about his performance at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference, where he lost his place in his speech for about 20 seconds and diverted into a lengthy tangent about Peppa Pig. The prime minister was also facing a substantial rebellion over his social care proposals, anger at the decision to scale back rail improvements for the north and frustration over the government’s failure to keep its promises on small boats crossing the Channel. It caps a difficult fortnight for the prime minister after he admitted he “crashed the car into a ditch” in his handling of the Owen Paterson lobbying scandal. Nervousness among Tory MPs about No 10 intensified after one Downing Street source told the BBC there was “a lot of concern inside the building about the PM … it’s just not working”, adding that the “cabinet needs to wake up and demand serious changes otherwise it’ll keep getting worse”. A former cabinet minister also told the Guardian that there was “an accumulation of things building up, really relating to his competence and that is beginning to look very shaky” after a “pretty bad bloody fortnight”. He said it was unlikely to result in a leadership challenge while the polls were still fairly even between the Tories and Labour, but it could be “problematic for him” if that changes when an election is looming. Another senior backbencher said Johnson’s CBI speech had been a “mess” while a third Tory MP said: “I thought today’s performance was the most embarrassing by a Conservative prime minister since last week’s PMQs. Someone needs to get a grip. He is losing the confidence of the party.” Another Tory MP referenced the process by which MPs can submit letters of no confidence to the chair of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, saying: “It might not only be Father Christmas’ postbag filling up towards the end of the year – Sir Graham Brady could find he needs a bigger one too.” The prime minister’s speech on Monday met a frosty reception among business leaders over its lack of substantial policy. In a sprawling address, Johnson lost his place and spent 20 seconds uttering “forgive me” three times as he shuffled the printed pages on his podium. He then revealed he had spent Sunday on a trip to Hampshire’s Peppa Pig World – an amusement park dedicated to a children’s cartoon character – using it for a series of digs at the BBC and civil servants. He said the TV show, worth £6bn, “was rejected by the BBC and has now been exported to 180 countries”. He added: “I think that is pure genius, don’t you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant, would conceivably have come up with Peppa.” Johnson also imitated the sound of an accelerating car with grunts that the official Downing Street release transcribed as “arum arum aaaaaaaaag”. At another point, he compared himself to Moses over his plan to help business invest in tackling climate change. The prime minister said: “I said to my officials the new Ten Commandments were that ‘thou shalt develop industries like offshore wind, hydrogen, nuclear power and carbon capture’.” After the speech, business leaders questioned the prime minister’s focus. Mike Cherry, national chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “Last week’s HS2 announcement has left a lot of small business owners wondering if the government is already losing its way, not just in speeches but with regards to levelling-up in the round.” After the speech, Johnson was asked if he was OK by a journalist. The prime minister defended his performance, saying: “I think that people got the vast majority of the points I wanted to make, and I thought it went over well.” On Monday evening around a dozen Tory MPs from the 2019 intake glumly gathered in one of their parliamentary offices to share a bottle of whisky. They were said to be disappointed and disillusioned, and shared discontent that Johnson wasn’t listening to feedback. Like business leaders, the main concern of Conservative politicians was Johnson’s failure to live up to expectations on policies such as levelling up, rail and social care. Up to 20 Tory MPs were expected to rebel on changes to the social care cap on Monday night. Shortly after Johnson’s speech, Keir Starmer set out to business leaders what he called Labour’s pro-business agenda, including closer trade and regulatory ties with the EU. “I think that sometimes, if I may say so, our party has come across as thinking that business is to be tolerated in some way but not to be celebrated as a good in itself,” the Labour leader told another gathering of the CBI’s multi-venue conference, this one in Birmingham. “That mindset has changed under my leadership.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/may/26/davos-day-4-vitali-klitschko-olaf-scholz-jobs-risks-economics-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T13:44:30Z","webTitle":"Davos day 4: Olaf Scholz condemns invasion of Ukraine and urges global cooperation on threats – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/may/26/davos-day-4-vitali-klitschko-olaf-scholz-jobs-risks-economics-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/may/26/davos-day-4-vitali-klitschko-olaf-scholz-jobs-risks-economics-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Davos day 4: Olaf Scholz condemns invasion of Ukraine and urges global cooperation on threats – as it happened","bodyText":"Finally, here’s Olaf Scholz A major nuclear power is behaving as if it had the right to redraw borders. “Putin wants a return to a world order in which strength dictates what is right; in which freedom, sovereignty and self-determination are simply not for everyone. That is imperialism. That is an attempt to blast us back to a time when war was a common instrument of politics, when our continent and the world were without a stable peaceful order. Putin underestimated the unity and vigour with which the G7, NATO and the EU would respond to his aggression,” “Working together, we have imposed sanctions that are tougher and further-reaching than any previously imposed on a country of Russia’s size.” And in the need to accelerate the energy transition. “ Now we have even more cause to move away from fossil fuels than before. Ultimately, our goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 has been given an additional boost by Putin’s war.” That’s all from Davos from us until next January, at least, when the Annual Meeting plans to return to its winter slot. GW The clearest sign of change at Davos this year is that a building previously used for Russian parties has hosted evidence of atrocities in Ukraine. The Russian War Crimes House, on the promenade outside the WEF congress centre, displays a map showing civilian deaths in the conflict, along with photos including ruined buildings and cemetries. A video plays thousands of photos from photographers from the conflict, which can also be seen by WEF attendees as they pass by. It’s backed by Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk’s foundation, who said this week: “If we tell the story of this tragedy as wide as possible, maybe it will save some lives.” Although the Ukraine war and the risk of global recession have dominated WEF this week, sustainability has also been on the Davos agenda. South American politicians and financiers urged new forms of sustainable forestry in the Amazon rainforest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying it was the only way to halt over-exploitation. Gustavo Montezano, president of the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). “It’s all about regulation, legislation and putting the ground for the people from the forest to become entrepreneurs. And they really want that.” Some 60 percent of Brazil’s territory is in the Amazon basin, and the bank is now financing efforts to reforest parts of it after decades of people believing that “destroying the forest was creating economic value,” Montezano said. Water was another concern, with the launch of a two-year commission into the economics of water. And Indian tech conglomerate HCL announced $15m of funding to support entrepeneurs (or ‘aquapreneurs’) to develop better access to freshwater. Roshni Nadar Malhotra, chairperson of HCL Technologies, explained: “Today, freshwater resources globally are extremely burdened and every firth child on this planet faces water scarcity.” Tether, the multibillion dollar “stablecoin” that functions as the largest bank in the cryptocurrency economy, is 100% safe, its chief technical officer has said. Speaking in Davos, Paolo Ardoino said that after the collapse of the rival stablecoin Terra speculators had turned their fire on Tether. “They attacked us believing we didn’t have the money to pay out. We showed them we had the money.” Ardoino said that despite withdrawals of $10bn in the past two months - almost half of it serviced from the company’s cash reserves - said new accounts were “being opened by the day”. Like all stablecoins, Tetheris supposed to always be worth a fixed amount – in its case, one US dollar. It achieves that, the company says, by maintaining a large reserve of stable assets - a mixture of cash, US treasury bills and commercial paper. Ardoino said the amount held in commercial paper had been reduced from $40bn to $15bn since March. Asked whether investors could be sure their money was safe he replied: “100%”. As Davos closes today, the need for radical change does not, says Jenny Ricks, Global Convenor of Fight Inequality Alliance. The usual warm words contrast with the cold, hard reality outside the elite bubble. Protests continued this morning from South Africa to India, where people experiencing the sharp end of inequality are demanding wealth taxes and more. “The world has changed rapidly and leaders must meet these serious challenges. Inequality is a real threat to our lives and livelihoods that requires action from governments now not broken neoliberal economic policies well past their sell by date.” A group of climate activists are holding a demonstration outside the World Economic Forum, as the Annual Meeting wraps up. The Fridays for Future group are holding a climate strike, to urge WEF delegates to take more action on the climate emergency as they leave the Congress Centre. Greta Thunberg held a climate strike here in 2019, on her first visit to WEF, and in 2020, so it’s turning into a regular event. (Had they waited until Friday, there’s be no delegates here) Several of the activists have spoken on WEF panels this week, including Climate activist Vanessa Nakate, the founder of the Rise Up movement (who was cropped out of a photo with four other activists in 2020). Nakate told a panel session earlier this week: “We know who caused the climate crisis and we know who has to pay for it. We need a compensation fund for loss and damage. It’s happening right now, it’s pushing people to places where they cannot recover. People cannot adapt to the loss of their cultures, the loss of their islands, the loss of their histories. I’m looking at the West to pay this bill.” “When we talk about climate change we are also talking about food security. Look at the East Africa drought that has left more than 26 million people with no access to food. It’s really important to understand the intersections of this crisis. “The African continent is responsible for less than 4% of emissions, but the East Africa drought has left 28 million people with no access to food.” Scholz also said Germany’s plan to become carbon-neutral by 2045 has become “even more important” due to the Ukraine war, which increases the pressure to act to hit the Paris climate targets. And in a sign of his push for multilateral cooperation, Scholz is inviting South Africa, Senegal, India, Indonesia and Argentina to the G7 summit, which he’s hosting in Bavaria, next month. Scholz says: “they represent countries and regions whose cooperation the world needs to move forward on global challenges in the future. The author of the ground-breaking report on the economics of climate change - Nick Stern - says one effect of the war in Ukraine has been to emphasise the need for energy security. That could help the fight against global heating, Stern tells us: “If we have rediscovered the importance of energy security it points the same way as climate change - away from fossil fuels.” Stern, a former Treasury chief economist, says he is worried about stagflation - a combination of weak growth and high inflation - which he says “looks a bit like the 1970s.” Stern says central banks are right to be raising interest rates but warns finance ministers - such as the UK’s Rishi Sunak - of the risks of “premature austerity” which could harm the prospects for growth. Higher investment to speed up the transition to a cleaner, greener economy would not add to inflationary pressure, Stern says. “Rishi says the government is committed to growth and a large part of that is going to be clean investment for a new economy. We need to go faster.” Stern says the benefits of driving electric cars and better-insulated homes are obvious but people need help. “You have got to work out a way of making it easier for people to make changes in their lives. You can’t just say it’s all too difficult.” Here’s Associated Press’s take on Olaf Scholz’s speech: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has sharply condemned Russia’s war on Ukraine and called for global cooperation to overcome life-threatening challenges such as climate change, hunger and dependency on fossil fuels. Speaking on Thursday at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Scholz said the: “invasion of Ukraine does not mark the outbreak of any conflict anywhere in Europe. Here, a nuclear-armed superpower claims to redraw borders.” Scholz said Russian President Vladimir “Putin wants to return to a world order in which the strongest dictate what is right, in which freedom, sovereignty and self-determination are not.” The German chancellor described Putin’s war politics as “imperialism,” which is “trying to bomb us back to a time when war was a common means of politics, when our continent and the world lacked a stable peace order.” He says the world is no longer bipolar like during the Cold War between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Instead of using the power politics of past centuries, the chancellor said it’s important all powers work together to solve threats like hunger, climate change or dependence on fossil fuels. Scholz said: “If some want to take us back to the past of nationalism, imperialism and war, our answer is not with us.’ We stand for the future.” Dr John Chipman, director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), has tweeted some key points too: Returning to Ukraine, Scholz says a return to the imperialism of the past, as Russia wants, cannot be tolerated, and must be stood up to with solidarity. Germany’s chancellor concludes by saying it would be wrong to ‘switch off’ - we must think about Ukraine every day, and do everything we can to end the war, he says. Countries must maintain international cooperation as we move to a multipolar world, says Scholz. On the pandemic, he says some countries are not making enough headway on vaccinating populations, and that leaves them at risk. Scholz also defended globalisation during his speech, saying it has lifted global life expectancy and reduced poverty. But that doesn’t mean everyone has been a winner, so it must be made more stable and resilient. If someone wants to lead us back to a world of imperialism and war, then count us out, declares Olaf Scholz. On Covid, Scholz warns that the pandemic not over it, much as we wish it were. And it will not end until we stop the cycle of mutations, he says -- as Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla also warned this week in Davos). Delegates here in Davos had to be triple-vaccinated, pass a Covid test before arriving, and were also tested here. And while the staff working here are wearing masks -- the delegates are generally not. Olaf Scholz says the strong international response to Russia’s blatant violation of international law was important, as it shows that a multipolar world is not a world without rules. He warns against the decoupling of the world economy, saying that companies and customers will bear the burden of customs duties and trade barriers. Scholz says we cannot look away when we see human rights abuses, such as repression in Xinjiang (where China operates re-education camps for the Uighur people). Scholz pledges that Germany will end its dependence on Russian oil and gas. We’ll end our use of Russian oil by the end of year, are and working hard to ending our reliance on Russian gas, he says. [That’s not as fast as Ukraine are calling for -- in the opening speech on Monday, president Zelenskiy called for an immediate ban on Russian oil]. Finland and Sweden are now looking to join NATO, and we would welcome them with open arms, Germany’s chancellor declares. [Turkey, though, is threatening to stall the process] Scholz says Germany is providing heavy weapons to Ukraine - the first time in its post-war history that it has delivered arms to a war zone. [reminder, Ukraine’s mayor Vitali Klitschko wants them to move faster]. And Scholz believes that Putin will only seriously negotiate peace when he believes he cannot break Ukraine’s defences. Russia must not be allowed to dictate the peace terms, Scholz adds. We cannot allow Putin to win this war, and I firmly believe he will not win it, Olaf Scholz says. The prospect of Russia capturing all of Ukraine seems less likely than at the start of the war, Germany’s chancellor says, thanks to the Ukrainian forces and support from Europeans. Olaf Scholz tells the World Economic Forum that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February was a thunderbolt. A nuclear power is acting as if it has the right to redraw borders, he says. This is imperialism, threatening to to take us back to a time when war was a common instrument of politics. Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany, is addressing the World Economic Forum now. Klaus Schwab, founder of WEF, introduces him, saying it is a critical moment for Europe and the international community. The world has changed abruptly since the invasion of Ukraine. We need global responsibiltiy and cooperation, and a strong Europe is crucial, Schwab adds. The metaverse has also been under discussion here: Vitali Klitschko ended his session by talking about the suffering of Ukraine’s children, including a boy who arrived in Kyiv alone from Bucha, because his parents had died. He’s alone now. Q: What do you want to hear from German chancellor Olaf Scholz when he speaks later? Klitschko says we should remember that Germany have been the biggest supporter of Ukraine in the past, which he thanks them for. But now, Ukraine needs defence weapons - quickly. Klitschko says : “We need fast decision with the weapons.” [Some background: Four weeks ago, Germany agreed to send dozens of anti-aircraft tanks to help defend Ukraine from Russia’s invasion, but the first tanks aren’t expected until July. According to Reuters, a lack of ammunition is holding things up]. Asked about the cost of reconstructing Kyiv, mayor Klitschko replies that the satellite cities have suffered the worst, with devastating damage in places such as Bucha. But hundreds of buildings, such as apartments, have been destroyed in Kyiv, so the priority is to reconstruct those buildings so the residents who are currently homeless can move back. That will cost around 80m euros, and the reconstruction work is starting now. The reason of this war, Klitschko continues, is that the Ukrainian people wanted to build a modern democratic society and become part of the European Union. And he warns that Ukraine is not simply fighting to defend itself. We are defending you, Klitschko declares, because we have the same values. We don’t know how far the Russians plan to go, he adds, Ukrains needs defensive weapons, because we are a peaceful country, Klitschko explains. This war is a danger to everyone. Everyone in Europe, and everyone in the world. It is the 92nd day of the war, but it feels like one long day, non-stop, says Vitali Klitschko. He then plays a recording of a siren warning residents to go to the bunkers, explaining how he hates that sound. What’s happening now is a big tragedy, Klitschko continues - not just for Ukraine, but also for Europe. And also for Russians, he says, who are slowly coming to understand that the invasion is not a special military operation as President Putin has claimed. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, begins his briefing by saying that Russia still hopes to take control of the Ukrainian capital. It is clear that it is not a special operation, as Russia claims, but war, one of the biggest since the second world war, he says. Thousands of people have died, including a lot of children, Klitschko says, with a huge battle raging in the East of Ukraine. It is no secret that Russia’s priority is to occupy the whole country, and their main target is still the capital of Ukraine, the heart of the country, the former heavyweight champion says. He says the whole world has seen the evidence from satellite cities such as Bucha. Everyone understands, it’s not a special operation.. it is the genocide of the Ukranian people, Klitschko says, with children, women, and old people killed. And he explains the human suffering, saying it is difficult to understand how people can lose their home in a moment - or suddenly lose friends, relatives, or parents. A leading Ukrainian climate scientist has called for the cities attacked in the Russian war to be rebuilt in a climate-neutral way. Dr Svitlana Krakovska, head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), believes the reconstruction of cities bombed in the invasion can be an example to the rest of Europe. Speaking yesterday at a panel session here in Davos organised by the Arctic Basecamp group of climate scientists, Dr Krakovska said: We have a big disaster in our country, we have so many people killed, our cities destroyed. But these destroyed cities are our opportunity, to rebuild them in a climate-resilient way. To do this we will need the support of all the international community, financial support and technology support as well. So we are looking forward to having Ukraine as a role model for Europe. Dr Krakovska received a medal from president Zelenskiy last year for her work on rising global temperatures, including visiting the Antarctic to monitor the impact of climate change there. She says Zelenskiy supported the work her team were doing -- which has been disrupted by the war. Earlier this week, Zelenskiy called for leaders at Davos to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, which could cost more than $500bn. Citing cities such as Bucha and Mariopol which have suffered devastating damage, Dr Krakovska says: We dream about rebuilding them in this way, and to be a model for climate neutrality. Dr Krakovska tells me that before the war, Ukraine had energy cooperatives, which used solar panels to diversify from other sources. We started to diversify our sources of energy once we started being blackmailed by Russia. One notable example is Slavutych, the city created for people evacuated after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, where solar panals were deployed on administrative buildings to reduce their dependence on other sources of energy. Good morning from Davos, where it’s the final day of the World Economic Forum. A notably downbeat Davos will wrap up today, hearing from Vitaliy Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, on how to rebuild the Ukrainian capital after the war, and what aid will be needed. Last night, Ukraine’s Minister for the Economy, Yulia Svyrydenko, called for more international support: “The military may win battles, but the economy plays the key role in winning the war. That is why it is so important to have support from economic partners.” WEF delegates (who haven’t already decamped from the ski resort, anyway) will finally hear from a G7 leader, when Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany, gives the final keynote address, to an edgy and uncertain WEF. Recession risks, the unwinding of globalisation, geopolitical tensions and the Ukraine war have all led to the deeply sombre mood here. As the historian Adam Tooze said: “The war dominates everything. The nuclear escalation risk is not being priced in. This doesn’t feel like cold war. It’s hard to think of a time during the cold war when the US openly announced its policy was to eliminate the capacity of Russia to take independent military action.” Similar sentiments were expressed by a senior policymaker who pointed out that a global pandemic had been unthinkable in early 2020, a near-coup in Washington incited by Donald Trump had been unthinkable in January 2021 and a war between Russia and Ukraine had been unthinkable at the start of 2022. This policymaker warned: “Why should we think the unthinkable ended with the start of the war?” We’ll also be tracking panel sessions on important issues such as how to help refugees find jobs, the risks facing the global economy, and also the metaverse.

Russia is western Europe’s largest single supplier of gas, a commodity that is in tight supply globally and has reached record market price highs in recent weeks, threatening to tip the UK into a national energy crisis. Meanwhile, Europe may need to use even more gas to keep the lights on this winter after the French nuclear firm EDF warned that technical trouble at a string of its reactors would cut its electricity generation, meaning gas plants across Europe may need to run more than expected. Gas plants were already in high demand over the past year after slow wind speeds reduced Europe’s renewable energy output in 2021. This played a role in draining Europe’s gas storage facilities to record lows after a long, cold winter last year. Ministers have reportedly been warned that the UK could face further record-breaking prices for gas and at the petrol pumps. So, could Europe’s energy crisis become a catastrophe? How vulnerable are the UK’s gas supplies? The good news is that the UK imports barely any gas from Russia. It meets about half of its gas requirements from the North Sea, while another third is sourced from Norway. The rest is imported by pipelines connecting the UK to Europe, or in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is transported by tankers typically from Qatar or the US. The bad news? The UK’s gas sources could all becoming eye-wateringly expensive if markets in Europe soar. The UK’s market is closely connected to markets in Europe, so a price rise in Germany or the Netherlands would lead to higher prices in Britain. There is no end in sight to Europe’s gas market woes. The US investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Monday: “The high energy prices seen in recent months are not necessarily a one-off.” Gas prices are likely to stay twice as high as normal until 2025, it said, and if Europe faces colder than average temperatures in March and February, blackouts could be likely. How vulnerable are Europe’s gas supplies? Very. Russia typically supplies about a third of Europe’s gas via a complex network of pipelines that run through Ukraine, Belarus and Poland to Germany. From Germany, pipelines carry gas to the rest of western Europe and through to the UK. A major gas supply disruption to Ukraine, last seen in 2008, could cause severe market volatility and a shutdown of factories to help conserve gas. Market experts at S&amp;P Global warned that “any conflict impacting gas supplies into Europe could have knock-on impacts on power, carbon and coal prices”. At the same time, Europe may become more dependent on gas to run its gas power plants after EDF warned that it would reduce the electricity it generates from nuclear power by 10% this year because of technical problems at a handful of its reactors. In the UK, lower imports of electricity from France – supplied via two interconnector cables beneath the Channel – could mean more gas power generation, according to Tom Edwards, a senior analyst at Cornwall Insight. This could lead to a rise in prices across the gas and electricity markets. In the meantime, the French government has asked EDF to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill increases to 4% this year. Barbara Pompili, France’s environment minister, said the government planned to help EDF withstand the blow but it has raised questions over how EDF plans to finance new nuclear projects, including the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C projects in the UK. Does the UK government have a contingency plan? It appears not. If the government is concerned about the impact on UK energy supplies, it hasn’t admitted it. A government spokesperson did not respond directly to the Guardian’s questions over whether there was a contingency plan in place to secure the UK’s energy supplies, or protect against further record market prices as tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border intensify. The spokesperson said that unlike other countries in Europe, “the UK is in no way dependent on Russian gas supply” and relied on less than 3% of Russian gas in 2020. “Thanks to our diverse mix of nuclear, natural gas and renewable technologies, the UK has one of the most reliable energy systems in the world,” the spokesperson added. The UK government is under pressure to take action to safeguard households from a cost of living crisis that is expected to deepen in the coming weeks as the energy regulator prepares to raise its cap on bills to close to an average of £2,000 a year on 7 February. The government was reportedly in talks late last year with Qatar over a deal that could result in the gas-rich nation supplying extra cargoes of gas in the event of an energy emergency, according to the Financial Times. But the government denied requesting that Qatar act as a “supplier of last resort”. How high could gas prices climb? The weekend tensions caused the price of short-term gas to climb to 205.1p per therm in the UK on Monday morning, up from 188.75p/th on Friday. The price is more than threefold higher than this time last year, and six times higher than typical pre-pandemic levels, according to Tom Marzec-Manser, a senior gas expert at ICIS. The UK’s gas market price climbed to more than 450p/th in the run-up to Christmas as Russian gas supplies slumped in line with temperatures that drove demand for gas heating higher. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to believe that gas markets could return to the highs we saw late last year if things were to escalate to the point that gas supplies were affected,” Marzec-Manser said. For now, there are a few lucky breaks that have helped to keep soaring gas markets in check, he added. Gas demand in Asia is lower, which has allowed Europe to receive a record number of LNG deliveries from the US this month, and it is on track to reach an all-time monthly LNG import high. However, a major gas supply disruption could be enough to cause gas prices to soar back to record levels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/25/ukraine-russia-inflation-economy-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-25T17:20:26Z","webTitle":"How the war in Ukraine will fuel a sharp hike in inflation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/ukraine-russia-inflation-economy-oil-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/25/ukraine-russia-inflation-economy-oil-gas","fields":{"headline":"How the war in Ukraine will fuel a sharp hike in inflation","bodyText":"Economists are warning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will fuel a sharper rise in inflation, despite the rising cost of living having already hit the highest levels for three decades. With Russia the world’s biggest natural gas exporter and second-largest for oil, the stakes are high in a global economy still hooked on fossil fuels – drawing parallels with the Yom Kippur war and oil price shocks of the 1970s which led to galloping inflation and economic crises worldwide. Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, said the shock waves emanating from the Russian invasion amounted to the “dawn of a new world order” for the international economy, in which higher inflation and financial market volatility could be taken as given. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine marks nothing less than a shift away from the largely US/western-dominated world order that has prevailed since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. There are several channels through which an inflationary shock will ripple around the world: Energy European natural gas prices surged by almost 70% after the invasion of Ukraine, while the global oil price touched $105 for the first time since 2014. Although prices fell back on Friday, they remain historically high – fuelling the prospect for a further rise in living costs. Some countries are worse affected than others. Across the EU, Russian gas accounts for 40% of the energy supply, although in some nations such as the Czech Republic and Latvia it rises to 100%. Germany has become more dependent on external sources of energy in the past two decades, rising to 67% – among the highest rates in the EU – as it scales back nuclear energy production. In terms of gas supplied from Russia, the country accounts for 65% of total natural gas imports in Germany, worth £52bn in 2020, according to Eurostat. France, which has a higher share of nuclear power, relies on imports for less than half of its energy by comparison. Russian gas accounts for little of the UK’s energy mix, at just 5% of total imports last year. However, the surge in global prices will still damage living standards in the UK at a time when consumers are already preparing for household gas and electricity bills to rise by 54% from April. UK inflation was expected to rise from the current 30-year high of 5.5% to a peak of more than 7% in April. Assuming a drop in wholesale energy costs and the government’s £200 repayable loan for households, inflation was expected to drop later this year. However, should the recent surge in prices be sustained, experts believe inflation would not peak at a higher rate in the short term, although would be likely to remain persistently higher for longer than first thought. City economists still believe gas exports will continue flowing, echoing the history of east-west tensions during the cold war when the Soviet Union continued pumping oil and gas to Europe. With Russia raking in $700m (£523m) each day selling oil and other commodities to the west, Putin has a strong interest in maintaining the flow, while the west has a strong interest in buying to avoid exacerbating the worst inflation shock for decades. Food Wheat prices have jumped to the highest level since 2008, threatening to push up food prices. Decades earlier the Soviet Union was the world’s biggest importer of wheat, with a record 55m tonnes bought in the mid-1980s. However, Russia overtook the US and Canada to become the world’s biggest exporter in the middle of the last decade. Ukraine – nicknamed the bread basket of Europe for its vast, fertile fields – is the fifth largest. Together, the two countries account for more than a quarter of the world’s supply, with Ukraine exporting 95% of its wheat through its Black Sea ports where Russian warships are pushing for control. Developing nations in north Africa and the Middle East are among the biggest buyers, meaning that a trade shock would devastate poor countries. Figures from the Observatory for Economic Complexity show in 2019 Egypt, Turkey and Bangladesh bought more than half of Russia’s wheat. Almost 85% of Egypt’s wheat imports last year were from Russia and Ukraine. Transport Although soaring energy prices will provide the biggest source of inflationary pressure, fresh disruption to trade routes will add to costs and delivery times for companies – factors which have also contributed to higher consumer prices. Motorists, who have already had to pay record high petrol and diesel prices at UK pumps this year, are likely to see the direct, immediate pain. The RAC said a litre of unleaded touched an average 149.7p this week, with diesel at £1.53, but more increases were on the way with oil hitting $106 a barrel, as well as the pound weakening. Airlines have traditionally sunk or swum on the jet fuel price, with the highs of a decade ago tormenting an industry which had pared other costs back in offering low-cost fares. This specific conflict could have a particular impact on the shipping industry, which has already been buffeted by the container shortages, Covid and the blockage of the Suez canal. According to the International Chamber of Shipping, almost 15% of the world’s seafarers are Russian or Ukrainian, and supply chains and costs could be affected if the free movement of such a significant part of the labour force is restricted. Financial markets Global financial markets have been thrown into turmoil by the invasion, wiping billions from the value of the FTSE 100 and triggering a flight to safe-haven assets such as the dollar and US government bonds. Economists expect the conflict will complicate decisions for global central banks to raise interest rates, with some analysts expecting they may push back planned hikes despite the situation adding to inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, there is still hope in the City of London that the crisis can be contained, reflected in a stock market rally on Friday after selling off sharply earlier in the week. Economists at UBS argue that financial conditions remain supportive for growth, despite expectations for an increase in borrowing costs. “Market expectations are for [Federal Reserve] policy rates to peak only at about 2% – this is hardly a ‘Volcker shock’, when the Fed hiked rates to 20% to subdue inflation,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management. Economic growth The consequences of a further squeeze on real incomes from an energy-fuelled inflation shock will mean higher rates of unemployment and lower global economic growth, at a time when the world economy is still grappling with the fallout from Covid-19. Even before the invasion the Bank of England forecast that higher rates of inflation and rising interest rates would bog down the recovery from Covid, with forecasts for a rise in unemployment and weaker rates of GDP growth next year. Goldman Sachs said financial markets were now pricing in the likelihood of global growth being 0.5 percentage points weaker this year than first expected due to the conflict, as rising energy prices depress production and squeeze consumption. Analysts said the Bank faced a dilemma over how to react. The central bank was widely expected to raise interest rates at regular intervals this year to curb soaring inflation. However, it may need to either go further or hold steady. While the conflict is expected to add to inflation by driving up global energy prices, the additional squeeze on household incomes is likely to slow the UK economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/feb/23/europe-vladimir-putin-boris-johnson-ukraine-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-23T17:43:04Z","webTitle":"Fighting the threat from Putin will take teamwork.

But who trusts Johnson’s Britain?","bodyText":"The default view at Westminster and in most of the media is that Vladimir Putin has saved Boris Johnson’s skin, for the present. The reflex on the Conservative backbenches is that the prospect of a European war means this is no time for a leadership change. In reality, of course, the reverse is true. Russia’s seizure of parts of Ukraine this week makes the case for replacing Johnson far stronger. That does not mean it will happen – the police investigating “partygate” and the voters have not yet spoken – but it should. Putin’s annexation of the Donbas provinces is an epochal event. It is an assault on a sovereign European state and a western ally. From the Gulf of Finland in the north to the Danube delta in the south, it ratchets up the military threat to a string of other vulnerable European nations. It redefines at a stroke the security and energy assumptions of our entire continent for a decade and more. It also represents a deliberate and culminating self-inflicted rupture by Russia’s autocracy with the western democracies. This has not come out of nowhere. There have been serious pre-eruptive signals since at least 2008 in Georgia, Crimea and elsewhere, including Salisbury. The Ukraine seizure is nevertheless a wake-up call about the absolute and systemic nature of the break. Relations could now descend into a 21st-century cyber cold war, but one in which a catastrophically divided United States – Donald Trump praised Putin’s action this week as “genius” – can no longer be guaranteed to provide the western pillar. All this poses immense difficulties for every western European nation. The west has drifted into this without much thought – and with nothing approaching the degree of strategic hostile planning of Putin’s Russia. But existential challenges have to be faced all the same. They require a serious and sustained strategic response. Yet the current British government – perhaps even British politics in general – is peculiarly unsuited to this at present, and Johnson is alarmingly ill-qualified to grapple with it effectively as prime minister. Johnson’s approach to government has proved to be the same as his approach to journalism and party politics: performative opportunism. He is not, in any traditional sense, a national leader. Just when this country needs a prime minister with a command of national statecraft, it is saddled with a prime minister who knows only stagecraft. In the Commons, he offers a pastiche of public school parliamentarism. In the world beyond, he dresses up as a builder, a doctor, a police officer or a soldier. On Tuesday, as Putin’s tanks rolled west, he went to the Ministry of Defence and dressed up again, this time as a prime minister in a war room surrounded by chaps in uniform. Johnson’s response to Ukraine may appear engaged. But this is deceptive, and is designed to be. His priority is his own survival, not Ukraine’s. Putin has provided him with a heaven-sent distraction, and Johnson will milk it. The crisis plays to Johnson’s innate desire to act the part of Churchill, though in reality, as his feeble early sanctions show, he is aping Churchill’s language while following the policies of Neville Chamberlain. At every turn, he idiotically hypes the narcissism of small differences to assert that Britain is playing a bigger and more distinct role than it really is. Britain was “out in front” he said twice in the Commons on Wednesday. This is precisely the opposite of what this situation calls for. As aspect after aspect of the Ukraine crisis shows, the reality is that Britain is not the autonomous master of its own fate, let alone of Ukraine’s. Britain is in truth what it has always been, before and after Brexit. It is one of a number of European states, though an important one, that must work together, with serious US backing, to limit the Ukraine conflict, to protect the rest of eastern Europe, to contain Russia, and to defend democracy and the rule of law. In other words, British interests are effectively synonymous and coterminous with those of the European Union and just about every sovereign state in our continent. Part of Johnson’s brain seems to understand this. Unity with allies was absolutely vital, he repeated at prime minister’s questions. But even a stopped clock is right twice a day. The problem is caused by what happens the rest of the time. In the wake of Putin’s actions, two needs stand out for Europe as a whole, Britain included. Each is simultaneously immediate and long term. The first is military: to strengthen and deploy sufficient deterrence to limit further assaults on Ukraine’s sovereignty and to uphold the security of countries bordering Russia, from Norway to Romania. That’s where the threat is greatest. The second is continuity of affordable energy supplies without overdependence on Russian gas or any compromising of green energy goals. These have been in-your-face issues for frontline states for years. Now they are top of everyone’s agenda. They cry out for a unified European tough realism to match that of Russia. The EU has been hopeless about this for many years. Germany dashed for Russian gas when the electorate revolted against nuclear power. France and Italy have bad histories of trying to be Russia’s western interlocutor and favoured trading partner. But Britain has its own big glass house too – the City’s Russian money launderers and the other enablers, including the Tory party – and should not throw stones. All of these things demand an allied cooperative response as well as a certain degree of trust. But who trusts Johnson’s Britain? A country that spends its time poking fun at the EU, playing silly buggers in the Channel over migrants, doing a bit of freelance troublemaking in Poland and threatening to trigger a trade war over Northern Ireland is a country that needs to get real, and fast. Be absolutely clear. Johnson’s Britain is acting as Putin’s useful idiot and playing his game of divide and rule. Nothing in this requires any backtrack on Brexit. But we are Europeans all the same. There is no logic in this country pretending we are an independent, freewheeling, great global power at such a time (nor ever was, come to that). No sense, either, in acting as if our greatest alliance is with reactionary Australia, that we are reborn as an Asia-Pacific player or that we are uniquely equipped to bind the US into Europe. These are the deluded and embarrassing fantasies of a post-imperial nation whose leader can only overplay or underplay. This is a time for seriousness and for action to promote collective self-interest. Putin has reminded western Europeans that war has not disappeared, nor ever will. Security cannot be shirked, and should not be merely dabbled with. There’s a generational task ahead now. We need a government, and a prime minister, who are up to the job, because these ones simply are not.

Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, vowed that sanctions were “hitting the Putin system … at its core of power”. Liz Truss, her counterpart in the UK at the time, forecast that Vladimir Putin’s oligarchs would have nowhere to hide. EU sanctions, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said, “are working to cripple Putin’s ability to finance his war machine”. The language before the invasion had been no less assertive. At a briefing in January 2022, US state department officials said Washington was prepared to implement sanctions “with massive consequences that were not considered in 2014 [when Russia annexed Crimea]. That means the gradualism of the past is out, and this time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there.” The Institute for International Finance (IIF) predicted a 15% fall in Russian GDP in 2022. JP Morgan envisaged a 12% contraction. Russia’s own technocrats privately warned Putin of a possible 30% fall. The reality was somewhat different, reflecting what analysts say was a hubristic over-confidence in the west about the speed with which sanctions that were agreed with unprecedented coordination by the G7 could damage Russia. The Russian economy contracted by only 2.2% last year. Unemployment, according to admittedly dubious official figures, now stands at 3.7 %. The construction sector has been able to grow significantly even if the car and electronics industries have suffered. A bumper harvest has driven growth in the agricultural sector. Russia is now forecast by the International Monetary Fund to grow faster in 2023 and 2024 than the UK. It is hardly financial apocalypse now. As the war approaches its one-year anniversary on 24 February, the debate about whether sanctions are effective has intensified. Defenders of sanctions say the ruble and headline gross domestic product are dreadful indicators, partly because Russian statistics are either classified or manipulated as part of the war effort. “Please do not ask me about GDP figures. They do not matter,” said Elina Ribakova, the deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a global industry body. Vladimir Milov, a former Russian deputy energy minister and author of a Martens Centre report on sanctions, said it may be more instructive to track a dozen or so “soft indicators” such as alcohol sales, divorce rates, shoplifting, spending on food, opinion polls, bank customer sentiment or tax revenues. “Don’t look at the watch every five minutes to see if sanctions are working. Exercise strategic patience,” said Milov, who is also an ally of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny Agathe Demarais, the author of Backfire, a study of US sanctions, said: “This is a marathon rather than a sprint, but financing the war is getting more difficult.” Economists at the Kyiv School of Economics go further, arguing that a decisive turning point may already have been reached as a growing Russian fiscal deficit – spurred by extra defence spending and collapsing hydrocarbon revenues – forces Russia’s central bank to eat up its reserves. Initial financial blitzkrieg “It is understandable that the west got carried away at the beginning, leading to false expectations of a palace coup,” said Charles Lichfield, a deputy director of the Atlantic Council, a US thinktank. After all, Russians started to rush for the cash machines, fearing a run on the banks. The rouble tanked, falling from from about 70-75 against the dollar to nearly 140. The gates to the oligarchs’ European playgrounds were padlocked, their ostentatious toys put into dry dock. The loss of mobility and respectability was a heavy blow, particularly in London where the Conservative government suddenly turned on the Russian rich after decades of laxity and reputation laundering. Within about four months, Russian assets worth about €13.8bn (£12.3bn) had been frozen. Even the smallest transactions were at risk of getting stuck in correspondent bank accounts for weeks if not months, as international banks became wary of facilitating transfers by Russian clients. In total the EU put sanctions on 1,386 individuals and 171 entities. Hundreds of the larger western firms from McDonalds to BP to IT multinationals “self-sanctioned” themselves by suspending or winding down their Russian operations, even if some did not actually leave. The German chemical firm BASF suffered a $7.9bn (£6.5bn) writedown in the process, even if it hopes to pass it on to the taxpayer. But in the key opening exchange of the sanctions battle, the Russian central bank, ironically largely staffed by liberal pragmatists opposed to the invasion of Ukraine, got the better of the west. On 28 February, the west tried to ambush Russia by simply freezing what was reported by the country’s central bank to be roughly $300bn or (40%) of its total foreign exchange reserves held overseas. The remainder was not held in western currencies. “The aim was to make it harder to defend the currency, increase the cost of financing the war and fuel inflation,” said Demarais. But the Russian central bank’s governor, Elvira Nabiullina, responded decisively, raising the key interest rate to 20% on 28 February, effectively shutting down mortgages and corporate lending but making deposits extremely attractive. It deterred citizens from panicking and withdrawing all their money from their accounts. On 7 March, for the first time in the modern Russian history, the central bank completely banned the sale and withdrawal of dollars and euros deposited before 24 February. Russia also negotiated for some its banks – notably Gazprombank – to remain in the global financial messaging system Swift because they handled payments related to oil and gas exports on which the EU were heavily reliant. After a short period of stress in March 2022, structural liquidity returned more or less to pre-sanctions levels. By June the rouble had stabilised. Sanctions war footing – but not all are in step Once its initial financial blitzkrieg – prepared in secret in the US Treasury in the months before war – had been repelled, the west had to revise its strategy, accepting implicitly it had not quite started at the top of the sanctions ladder and there were further rungs to climb. The second phase was going to be more a war of attrition, constant adjustment and consensus-building across the EU. The European Commission went on to a sanctions war footing, according to a study by the Danish Institute for International Studies. “Formal processes that would traditionally take several weeks were concluded within a day,” it found. But flaws in the process appeared. Since EU sanction packages require unanimity, ideological outliers like Hungary held massive leverage. Viktor Orbán’s personal connection with specific Russian oligarchs became apparent. For instance, in September last year the Hungarian prime minister asked, probably in return for favours by Putin, for three Russian oligarchs to be removed from the EU sanctions list. Before the 15 March renewal deadline, Orbán has lobbied to remove the same trio plus an other six. At successive European Council meetings, his ministers have threatened use of the veto, delaying key sanctions decisions. Most recently, Orbán breezily insulted Ukraine as “a no man’s land akin to Afghanistan”. Some EU states found they did not have the laws, compliance departments or procedures to implement the sanctions agreed in Brussels. Only now is the European Commission working with member states for instance to establish a single contact point for enforcement and implementation issues with cross-border dimensions. Differences in the vigour with which sanctions were enforced became striking. EU figures show Greece had frozen only €222,000 in Russian assets and Malta only €200,000. The same two countries in April had tried to block a ban on Russian flagged ships entering EU ports. Austrian companies have hardly rushed to leave Russia. One estimate says 43 Austrian firms have stayed and only two left completely. Belgium has lobbied to keep the 500-year-old diamond industry in Antwerp open to Russia’s Alrosa mining company. Among Nato members, Turkey’s refusal to join the sanctions coalition has become a major problem. By the third quarter of 2022, Russian imports from Turkey had surged to over $1bn a month, roughly double the figure for the same period the previous year. Turkey became a route for Russia to import vital western-produced goods such as manufacturing parts. Some economists for instance have noticed a mini boomlet in trade between Italy and Turkey, suggesting enterprising Italian traders regard Istanbul as a useful access point into forbidden Russian markets. US Treasury sources say they have now elevated Turkey’s approach to trade with Russia to an issue of prime importance in the bilateral relationship. The US is also looking askance at another ally, the United Arab Emirates. Research by a team of Berlin-based data analysts examining more than 500,000 bank transactions after the war started found that, in terms of value, 66% of withdrawals by non-resident customers of Russian banks went to beneficiaries located in the UAE. This represents a 40% rise on the previous year. Putin’s throw’s energy poker game lead with dud card The surprising resilience of the Russian economy is not primarily due to the technical professionalism of central bank officials or murky sanctions busting, but instead a blindingly obvious structural flaw in the sanctions: Europe’s reliance on Russian oil and gas exports, the source of 40% of Russian budget revenue. “Not imposing a Russian export embargo early on led to record high trade and fiscal surpluses that gave Putin’s regime a huge financial cushion, enough to sustain many months of the war,” said Oleg Itskhoki, a Russian-American economist. “Only Putin’s imports were boycotted, while his exports continued. As a result the Russian car and electrical industry collapsed, but not the export of oil and gas.” Various groups of western economists, including Rüdiger Bachmann, Moritz Schularick, Ben Moll and Christian Bayer, tried through March and April to persuade German politicians that cutting off the supply of Russian energy would not lead the German economy to crash. Moll recalled: “Soon after the war started, statements were being made by German politicians that an energy embargo would have dramatic economic consequences. For instance, the economics minister said there would be mass unemployment and poverty. “We just thought it was important to look at the data and think this through systematically so we put together a team of energy economists as well as micro- and macroeconomists and concluded it might lead to a recession between 0.5 and 3 % but not economic Armageddon. Not all of us agreed with an energy embargo. But the unions and industry lobby denounced our analysis and the chancellor called us ‘irresponsible’ on national TV, a reflection of the large influence of corporate Germany.” Moll believes in retrospect his analysis of the system’s flexibility and adaptability has been proven right. But the EU could decouple itself from Russian energy only at the speed Germany, the major economy most vulnerable to Putin’s energy blackmail, was prepared to tolerate. It took until June, after private lobbying by the US and evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, for the EU in its sixth sanctions package to agree to an EU-wide ban on Russian oil exports. But the ban was only to come into force in two delayed phases. The ban on the purchase, import or transfer of Russian seaborne crude oil was not to apply until 5 December and the ban on other refined oil products such as diesel came in on 5 February. The price of Europe’s caution is well known. With the exception of 2020 and 2018, oil and gas had provided 60% of Russian goods exports in every year since 2002. But the early summer of 2022 was a total bonanza for the Russian treasury, as it benefited from the record surge in energy prices. In March, Russia was making €1bn a day from energy exports. Oil and gas increased to 60% of Russian fiscal revenues, up from 40%. Germany alone has bought €24bn of Russian fossil fuels since the invasion. Europe funded the Russian war machine that it denounced. The surplus on Russia’s current account for the year was $227.4bn – a 86% increase on the previous year and more than double the previous record. That helped strengthen the rouble, making imports cheaper. This in turn helped to gradually bring down inflation, taking some pressure off the real incomes of the ordinary Russian population. By the summer Russian treasury coffers were so bloated that Putin felt confident enough to launch a counterattack by slowing gas supplies to Europe. With 40 % of Europe’s gas coming from Russia, he demanded in April that any country refusing to pay for its gas in roubles would be cut off. Europe huffed but complied. By June he started tampering with the gas flow through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia into Germany. He first cut deliveries through the pipeline by 75%, from 170m cubic metres a day to roughly 40m. In July, the pipeline was shut for 10 days, citing the need for essential maintenance work. On reopening, the flow was reduced to 20m cubic metres a day. Then on 26 September an as yet unidentified intelligence service blew up the pipeline and the neighbouring Nord Stream 2 pipeline – which had yet to go into service - leaving a mangled wreck and an unsolved crime scene at the bottom of the Baltic. “Putin shot himself in the foot because by turning off the gas tap, he completely changed the calculus in the European Union and gave the impetus to Europe to diversify away from Russian gas,” Demarais said. “He made the decision for Europe a lot easier.” Through a mixture of planning and good fortune, Europe has, in the space of six months, largely weaned itself off Russian gas. Renewables have been boosted, the lives of nuclear power stations extended and liquid natural gas terminals built at lightening speed. The European Commission sent out search parties for alternative sources of energy ranging from Morocco, Qatar, Angola, Venezuela, Norway and Nigeria. It was a form of Putin-inspired “shock therapy”. In another blow to Putin, “General Winter”, once assumed to be Russia’s greatest ally, failed to report for duty. Temperatures averaged well above the norm with record highs for winter broken in the Netherlands, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Latvia, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark and Belarus. That lowered demand for energy, as did the self-restraint of European consumers rocked by record bills. Gas storage levels in Germany in January were at 90%, the highest level ever for the month. Russian gas exports to Europe tumbled by more than 75% compared with the prewar period. The daily price of natural gas on the stock exchange Amsterdam Euronext which had peaked at more than €300 a megawatt hour after the invasion, has now fallen well below 100 again, to under €60, still high by the standards of 2020 . Inflation is slowly descending across Europe, and Germany looks to have avoided the widely predicted recession. Putin had played his best economic warfare card – cutting gas exports to Europe – and it was a dud, and will remain so next winter if the EU controls demand. In the space of a year, Putin destroyed Russia’s gas bridge to Europe, the centrepiece of Russian postwar economy. Where do we go from here? The question now is how quickly he can construct a different bridge to the east, and so keep the Russian finances afloat. Russia exports natural gas from eastern fields to China through the 2,500-mile Power of Siberia 1 pipeline, but the western fields, which had served the European markets, are not connected to this export route and cannot be easily redirected to China. Eventually a Power of Siberia 2 pipeline will connect the two fields, but the estimated completion date is 2030. China is also not such a profitable market. Russia was estimated to be charging $3 a metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu) for deliveries to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, while the estimated charge for deliveries to Europe had been sold at $10-$25/MMBtu. Putin is also in danger of being screwed to the floor over oil, his crown jewel. After persistent US Treasury lobbying, the west supplemented the EU ban on Russian crude oil exports by introducing an unprecedented market intervention that seeks to set a world wide price cap of $60 a barrel for Russian seaborne oil. From 5 December, the same date as the EU import ban, any firm providing payments, insurance, financial services, or brokering, bunkering, piloting services to a ship carrying Russian oil could not receive insurance cover if the oil was being purchased for more than $60 a barrel. If the US or EU catches any company misrepresenting the price or submitting a fraudulent attestation, the G7 can impose sanctions on that company. The UK proposes fines of $1.2m. Putin blustered, saying he would not supply oil to any country for five months that complied with this price regime from 1 February. But this may be a bluff. For China and India do not need to endorse the cap explicitly, but they can take advantage of its existence and their purchasing power to negotiate heavy price discounts in comparison with Brent crude. The price cap is in its infancy, and since the price of seaborne Urals crude averaged $49.48 in January, below the $60 cap, EU tankers – mainly Greek – can legitimately carry on transporting oil to China and India. Reports suggest crude oil loading from Russian ports have reached a multi-month high. At best the cap has had the effect of institutionalising price discounts. At worst it is proving toothless. Ukraine and its expert team advisers on sanctions led by the former US envoy Michael McFaul say the cap needs to be halved especially if its purpose is to blow a hole in Russia’s budget. But the US Treasury, in setting the cap, was balancing different objectives: reducing Russia’s income and keeping enough supplies on the seas to avoid another spike in oil prices. That requires a perilous assessment of the price at which Putin decides it is not profitable to extract or export oil. The US is trying to postpone a review of the cap level until March to allow more evidence to be collated. The Kyiv School of Economics insists the numbers on the Russian dashboard are flashing red. Russia’s monthly fiscal deficit reached a record 3.9tn roubles (£43.3bn) in December and its total budget deficit for 2022 was 3.3tn roubles – or 2.3% of GDP – set against a projected an annual surplus of 1.3tn. Overall spending in 2022 was 7.3tn roubles higher than forecast, presumably due to vast defence spending. Putin plans to spend 6.3 % of GDP on defence and national security in the 2023 federal budget alone, doubling defence spending to more than 10tn roubles. The question then becomes how long this level of spending can be sustained if energy revenues are falling so fast. Demarais said the first signs of serious strain would be unplanned debt issuance and the sale of some of its 310bn yuan (£37.5bn), the only currency in Russia’s reserves that can be used for interventions in the foreign exchange market. Various estimates exist, but some say Russia’s planned spending is probably sustainable on an assumed Urals crude oil pice of $70 a barrel. Russia won’t burn through its stock of yuan assets this year unless the Urals price halves and averages $25 a barrel, according to Bloomberg Economics. The US bank Citigroup estimates it would only take an average price of $35 to deplete the available yuan resources already in 2023. But as the past year has shown, Russia is not sitting idle in the face of a price cap. Learning from its growing ally, Iran, it has assembled an ageing dark fleet of smaller, older ships carrying crude oil mainly to China and India. Evasion will be attempted through multiple means: flags of convenience; the blending of crude; Russian insurance schemes; or the simple manipulation of documents. New crude oil transfer hubs are already emerging. It will depend on whether this covert market grows into a viable alternative to the G7 cap, and the price at which the oil is bought by China. In the end an international sanctions war is a game of cat and mouse in which both sides look for clues amid the disinformation to try to pre-empt the other’s moves. Ultimately it is not as decisive as the battlefield, but if the west can stay the course, Putin may yet find his options narrowing. If he survives it will be a huge blow to the power of the dollar, and one that will not go unnoticed in Beijing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2021/sep/15/alliance-with-australia-and-us-a-downpayment-on-global-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-15T21:00:05Z","webTitle":"Alliance with Australia and US a ‘downpayment on global Britain’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/15/alliance-with-australia-and-us-a-downpayment-on-global-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/sep/15/alliance-with-australia-and-us-a-downpayment-on-global-britain","fields":{"headline":"Alliance with Australia and US a ‘downpayment on global Britain’","bodyText":"Britain’s post-Brexit foreign policy is taking shape, and the early moves are hardly very surprising: a tripartite defence alliance with the US and Australia – handily compressed to Aukus – clearly designed to send a message to Beijing. The three start work by sharing with Canberra what is ultimately an American technology: supplying nuclear reactors to power submarines with the likely assistance of Britain’s Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, a relationship that may also allow the Australians to ditch a troubled but lucrative A$90bn (£48bn) diesel engine agreement with a French contractor. Australia’s new nuclear-powered submarines will not be nuclear-armed, and the country has no desire to be a nuclear power. But there are questions as to how precisely the enriched uranium required will be supplied and how the reactors will be decommissioned – or to put it another way, what will be done in Australia, the UK or the US. The three will spend the next 18 months trying to work it out. In theory, it would have been perfectly possible for the US to work directly with their Australian counterparts on the sensitive technology transfer (a development so rare that it has only happened once before in history, when the US helped Britain start its own nuclear submarine programme in late 1958). But as a senior White House official revealed, it was the UK that wanted this the most. “Great Britain has been a very strong strategic leader in this effort,” said one, speaking ahead of the announcement, helping “mediate and engage on all the critical issues” as the partnership was being thrashed out. It is a vital endorsement after a tricky summer in which Anglo-American relations have been far from smooth during the Afghanistan crisis. British generals and ministers made little secret that they disagreed with Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw troops from the country, effectively handing it over to the Taliban. There was a lack of understanding of the tactical intentions of the White House. British sources complained it was unclear when the US would pull out of Kabul airport, and Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, a survivor of Wednesday’s reshuffle, even appeared to question if the US had the will to be a superpower any longer. Now at least, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, can head over the US for the UN general assembly, and his first White House meeting with Joe Biden, with something else to talk about. But for the UK there will be a price. What the US president wants is for the UK to be more present in the Indo-Pacific, even though it is thousands of miles away from home. The submarine deal is, the White House official observed, “a downpayment” on the “concept of global Britain”. In June, Biden came to Europe for his first overseas tour as president, wanting western allies to sign up to a stronger posture against Beijing. Nato, traditionally focused on Russia, obliged and agreed to declare that China also poses a security risk at its annual summit. Yet the White House wants to go further. The Pentagon has hardly been shy in pointing out that China, which has its own nuclear-powered submarines, now possesses the world’s largest navy. The US has repeatedly wanted allies to help: over the summer Britain’s new Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier participated in muscle-flexing military exercises in the Philippine Sea. A serious confrontation with China remains unlikely, but this is not the point. With access to European markets not as friction-free as before, the UK is choosing to build a political and industrial strategy based in part on defence and helping longstanding but far-flung allies, starting with supplying nuclear-powered submarines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-number-of-civilians-killed-considerably-higher-than-6884-known-says-un","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-28T18:57:13Z","webTitle":"Kherson residents told to evacuate as bombardment intensifies; Bakhmut ‘covered with blood’, says Zelenskiy – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-number-of-civilians-killed-considerably-higher-than-6884-known-says-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-number-of-civilians-killed-considerably-higher-than-6884-known-says-un","fields":{"headline":"Kherson residents told to evacuate as bombardment intensifies; Bakhmut ‘covered with blood’, says Zelenskiy – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has secured the release of 1,456 prisoners of war since Russia invaded in February, according to Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s president was speaking in an annual address to the Ukrainian parliament, where Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats, military personnel and family members of fallen soldiers were reportedly present. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. A Crimean human rights activist has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Moscow-installed court in the Russian-annexed peninsula found her guilty of carrying an explosive device, in a trial rights activists have described as “trumped-up” and “illegal”. Iryna Danilovich was sentenced to seven years in a general regime colony by a court in Russian-controlled Feodosia, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the Kyiv-based organisation Institute of Mass Information (IMI) said. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher”, it added. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war live blog today. Thank you for reading. The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, Kyrylo Budanov, made a visit to Bakhmut on Tuesday and Wednesday to meet special forces detachments working at the front and to distribute medals, according to a statement released by the service. Russian strikes have continued in the recently liberated city of Kherson, launching attacks against the city on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to Ukrainian military, 33 strikes were launched in the past 24 hours. One of the targets included a maternity ward in a hospital in the city. Footage shows the aftermath of the strike where windows were shattered and staff and patients were forced to take cover in the basement. One staff member told reporters: I don’t even want to think about [what could have happened]’ after surgeons were in theatre just 30 minutes earlier. The secret to Igor Pedin’s survival had been his invisibility, the 61-year-old had said. With his dog, Zhu-Zhu, the former ship’s cook banked on being ignored by the trigger-happy Russian soldiers and their killing machines when he took the first step of a 140-mile journey from his home in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on 23 April, before stealing out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories towards the relative safety in the city of Zaporizhzhia. Such were the risks that soldiers at one checkpoint had beseeched Pedin to turn back but then stuffed cigarettes in his pockets for good luck. He did survive, against the odds, but the remarkable story has made Pedin more visible than he could ever have imagined. Read the full story here: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Kherson city council member, Dmytro Poddubniy, told CNN: I’m telling these people that Kherson is one of the most dangerous cities right now. So I ask them to imagine that they are going on vacation for a couple of weeks. It may be easier for them to decide to move this way. But still, a lot of people are staying in the city. One Kherson resident, Inna Balyoha, told the news channel she was afraid her elderly and sick mother would not be able to endure the journey. She said: She is very weak. She will not reach another city. Many remain in Kherson under shelling because of their parents. Authorities have urged Kherson residents to evacuate to safer regions as Russian shelling has become “more and more frequent and large-scale”. A Crimean human rights activist has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Moscow-installed court in the Russian-annexed peninsula found her guilty of carrying an explosive device, in a trial rights activists have described as “trumped-up” and “illegal”. Iryna Danilovich was sentenced to seven years in a general regime colony by a court in Russian-controlled Feodosia, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the Kyiv-based organisation Institute of Mass Information (IMI) said. The Crimean human rights activist, nurse and citizen journalist was detained by Russian authorities in late April while on her way from work. Her family told CNN at the time balaclava-clad officials from the Russian special police unit searched her house in the village of Vladislavovka, near Feodosiya, and took the family’s laptops and phones. Her case was part of a string of disappearances of activists, journalists and ordinary citizens reported over the last decade in Russian-occupied Crimea. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CJP) called on Russian authorities in Crimea to disclose any information concerning Danilovich’s whereabouts when she first went missing. In a statement, Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator, said: Iryna Danilovich’s alarming disappearance prompts fears of yet another clampdown on independent reporting in Russian-occupied Crimea, which is already an extremely restrictive environment for the press. Russia’s security service (FSB) accused Danilovich of making an explosive device and keeping it on her person, IMI said. She was also fined 50,000 rubles (£570) on the charges of illegal storage and manufacture of explosives under Part 1 of Art. 222.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, it said. Volodymyr Chekryhin, deputy head of the Crimean Human Rights Group, said that the case against Danylovich was grossly falsified, starting with Russian FSB officers effectively kidnapping her. He said: The entire so-called ‘investigation’ against her was comprised of illegal methods: having been kidnapped, Iryna was kept in the basement of the FSB office and faced with various forms of pressure and intimidation, even torture – she was beaten and strangled. The “so-called trial completely deprived Iryna Danilovich of her right to a fair trial and was a cynical pageant”, he added. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the frontline city of Bakhmut in southern Ukraine. Ukraine has secured the release of 1,456 prisoners of war since Russia invaded in February, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Speaking in an annual address to the Ukrainian parliament, Zelenskiy also told lawmakers he had participated in 850 international events since the war began. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP, wrote on his Telegram: Today, the parliament gathered for its last meeting of the year. The president’s address to the Verkhovna Rada about Ukraine’s internal and external situation was heard at the meeting. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats, military personnel and family members of fallen soldiers were also present at the closed-door parliamentary session, he added. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces have stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on Kherson city in southern Ukraine. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. No one was hurt and the staff and patients had been moved to a shelter, he added. Ukraine’s healthcare minister, Viktor Liashko, said Russian forces bombed the hospital just moments after a baby was born. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. One of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head of Russia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to a Russian-installed “official”. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. The mother of an Australian man from Victoria killed fighting in Ukraine has remembered her son as a defender of freedom who was driven by empathy. The Australian department of foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher”, it added. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree that bans the supply of oil and oil products to nations participating in an imposed cap from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil effective from 5 December. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The defence ministers of Russia, Turkey and Syria held talks in Moscow today, Russian state media reported. State-owned news agency Ria cited Russia’s defence ministry as saying: Ways of resolving the Syrian crisis and the problem of refugees as well as joint efforts to combat extremist groups in Syria have been discussed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a post on Telegram, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Zelenskiy said: Last year, 70,000 people lived there. Now only a few civilians are left there. There is no place that is not covered with blood. There is no hour when the terrible roar of artillery does not sound. Still, Bakhmut stands. Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of 70,000-80,000, is a ghost town now largely in ruins. The deterioration of diplomatic relations between Russia and Lithuania has continued, with the expulsion today of a Lithuanian from their embassy in Moscow. A statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: On 28 December, Chargé d’Affaires of Lithuania in Russia, Jurgita Cibulskiene was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Lithuanian side was strongly protested in connection with the unjustified expulsion on 1 December this year [of an] employee of the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. As a response, one of the diplomats of the Lithuanian embassy was declared “persona non grata”, and must leave the territory of the Russian Federation within five days. Reuters reported that ship insurers have said they are cancelling war risk cover across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, after an exit from the region by reinsurers in the face of steep losses. Reinsurers, which insure the insurers, typically renew their 12-month contracts with insurance clients on 1 January, giving them the first opportunity to scale back exposure since the war in Ukraine started. The moves by the insurers will make it harder for ship-owners or charterers to find insurance, increase prices and may mean some ships sail uninsured, industry sources said. Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Emine Dzheppar, has tweeted images of a maternity hospital in Kherson city that was shelled by Russian forces yesterday. According to Ukraine’s healthcare minister, Viktor Liashko, Russian forces bombed the hospital just moments after a baby was born. Two babies were born at the hospital the day of the attack, Liashko wrote on his Facebook, adding that one arrived just “minutes” before the shelling. He added: Fortunately, no babies ... no hospital staff were hurt this time. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. The European Commission says it is donating €14m (£12.3m) to buy and transport school buses for Ukraine, as well as an additional 120 buses “to bring Ukrainian children safely to school”. About 5.7 million school-age children in Ukraine have been affected by Russia’s war, which has also led to thousands of schools and educational facilities damaged or destroyed, the Commission said. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. The monument was first erected in 1900 but was dismantled in 1920 after the Bolshevik takeover. It was restored and reopened in 2007. After the 2014 Maidan revolution, Ukraine’s parliament passed a “decommunisation” law that meant statues to Lenin and other Soviet political figures had to be removed (or, in the case of Odesa’s Lenin statue, reworked and reimagined as a statue to Darth Vader). Since Russia’s February invasion, however, many in Ukraine have sought a more overarching reevaluation of anything Russian, and the monument to Catherine had been daubed with red paint several times. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Authorities plan to store the monuments in a museum in the city. France’s armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has tweeted a photo of him visiting a memorial to the war dead in Kyiv as part of his visit to Ukraine. Lecornu, who is on his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May, is expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, and army officials. Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, has struck a cautious tone on whether his country would supply Ukraine with air defence systems. Speaking in an interview with Il Messaggero newspaper, Crosetto said the air defence systems, which Ukraine’s president has requested, would be provided to Kyiv “if possible”. He added: If we give air defence missiles to Ukraine, we must take them from our stocks and we have to do that without depleting them, and being sure about the quality. Crosetto’s comments came after Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke with Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Tuesday. In a tweet posted after the call, Ukraine’s leader said Meloni informed him that “the issue of providing air defence systems to protect Ukrainian skies is being considered”. A Swiss court has granted a six-month “stay of bankruptcy” to the company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was built to bring Russian gas to Germany but never opened after Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 AG, a Swiss-based company owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom, built the gas pipeline but the project was halted in early February after Moscow formally recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. The company’s stay has now been extended to 10 July by a Swiss regional, Reuters cited a notice published in the Swiss official gazette of commerce as saying. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. The Russian Union of Lawyers head, Igor Trunov, told the state-owned news agency Tass the health ministry had agreed to his appeal to offer free cryobank services to the 300,000 soldiers conscripted in September. According to the lawyer, his organisation has already been contacted by several couples whose husbands will soon depart for Ukraine. The health ministry has not yet commented on Trunov’s remarks. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. Russia’s population has been in near-constant decline for decades. The coronavirus pandemic led to the country’s largest natural population decline since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The war in Ukraine, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of young Russian men while also sparking an unprecedented exodus of educated professionals, is expected to hasten the demographic crash for Russia. The independent demographer Alexei Raksha has described the current demographic situation as “the perfect storm”. Earlier we reported air raid alerts blared across Ukraine, including in Kyiv and Mykolaiv. Officials have sounded the all-clear almost two hours later. There were no immediate reports of any new Russian missile strikes. Ukrainian social media suggested the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off. Russian forces have stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on Kherson city in southern Ukraine, forcing hundreds of civilians to flee the recently liberated city amid relentless shelling by Moscow’s troops. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said this morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in the city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. No one was hurt and the staff and patients had been moved to a shelter, he added. At least 10 people were killed and 58 were wounded by a Russian strike in Kherson on Saturday, authorities said. Russian forces were forced to withdraw from Kherson city last month, but its residents have faced relentless Russian shelling from the east bank of the Dnieper River. About 400 people have fled Kherson since Christmas Day, the BBC reported, after a sharp increase in the intensity of the Russian bombardment of the city. The Kremlin has dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, and insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There can be no peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account today’s realities regarding Russian territory, with the entry of four regions into Russia. Plans that do not take these realities into account cannot be peaceful. Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk – in September after holding Kremlin-orchestrated fake referendums. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions. Kyiv and its western allies have said they would never recognise Russia’s claims on Ukraine’s territory. President Zelenskiy has been promoting his 10-point peace plan, first announced in November, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskiy’s foreign minister, Dmtryo Kuleba, said on Monday that Ukraine was aiming to hold a peace summit by the end of February – preferably at the UN with its secretary general, António Guterres, as a possible mediator. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The Kyiv Post has reported that the French armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has arrived in Kyiv. It is his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May 2022. France24 reporter Andrew Hilliar has said Lecornu is expected to visit a memorial to the war dead today, and that the trip comes on the back of the promise by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to increase his nation’s military support for Ukraine. Hilliar reports that Lecornu is under pressure to announce further assistance, with some in Ukraine still angry at Macron’s comments during the course of the war, where he has seemed more vocal than most European leaders to suggest that Ukraine should be prepared to make concessions in return for peace. Reuters reports that one of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head ofRussia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed “official” in the occupied region. In a picture published by Rogov on Telegram, Kiriyenko was seen outside the plant. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has tweeted to reiterate the support the US is providing to keep energy systems running in Ukraine, following Russia’s sustained attacks on the energy infrastructure that civilians rely on. The ambassador said the embassy in Kyiv is “proud to carry out the secretary of state’s mission to work day and night with Ukrainian partners to help keep the energy grid up and running through the winter. We stand with Ukraine.” Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. Associated Press reports that in an interview with the minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian official said: The next stage, now that we are more or less equipped with reconnaissance drones, is strike drones. These are both exploding drones and drones that fly up to 3 to 10km and hit targets. I can say already that the situation regarding drones will change drastically in February or March. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. In the last few moments, authorities in Kyiv and Mykolaiv have declared air raid alerts, according to posts on Telegram. The state-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting that Russian authorities claim to have thwarted a Ukrainian-sponsored terrorist attack in Chegem in the Kabardino-Balkarian republic, which is near Russia’s border with Georgia. It reports: The federal security service stopped the activities of two previously convicted Russian citizens who, on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services, were preparing a terrorist act in the city of Chegem. After committing the crime, they planned to leave for Ukraine to take part in hostilities against the Russian armed forces. At the scene of the clash, they found an improvised explosive device with a capacity of about 2kg in TNT equivalent, an AK-74 assault rifle, a pistol and ammunition. The report states that the two suspects were killed. No evidence was offered for the claims of the Russian security services. Adeshola Ore and Amy Remeikis report for the Guardian: The mother of an Australian man from Victoria killed fighting in Ukraine has remembered her son as a defender of freedom who was driven by empathy. The Australian department of foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died. His mother, in a statement released via Dfat, said her son had fallen in love with Ukraine and was “humbled by the kindness and hospitality within his new community”. “Sage died in action defending the freedom of the Ukrainian people,” she said. “Sage has always believed in defending country, people and the right for freedom.” She said her son upheld his values as he served in Australia and abroad in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and described her son as driven by “empathy for the Ukrainian people” at the “injustice that has taken place”. Sage’s mother was not named in the statement, but said her family was devastated by their loss and would remember Sage’s “humour, kind heart and laughter”. Read more here: Australian man who died fighting in Ukraine remembered as ‘defender of freedom’ Oleh Synyehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region that borders two of the areas in the east of Ukraine – Luhansk and Donetsk – which Russia has claimed to annex, has posted to Telegram to say one person has been wounded due to enemy action. He said: A 48-year-old man received a shrapnel wound as a result of the morning attacks of the occupiers on Kharkiv. He is in the hospital in a moderate condition. The claim has not been independently verified. An “official” channel of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) – one of the areas of Ukraine that Russia claimed to have annexed in September – has posted on Telegram to say in the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have fired at seven of the settlements the DPR claims as its territory. It says one civilian was injured, and two houses and three civilian infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia, Syria and North Korea were the only UN member states to recognise the DPR as any kind of legitimate authority before the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, declared it was territory of the Russian Federation. The European Union delegation to Ukraine has announced that it will support “more than 700,000 Ukrainians in the winter” during the war. In a press statement released on Wednesday, the office of the international organisation for migration (IOM) in Ukraine says it is “stepping up efforts to help internally displaced and war-affected people survive the cold weather”. The statement claims that: IOM’s winter preparedness support, made possible by EU funding, includes repairs to collective centres for displaced people, improvements to water, drainage and heating systems, repairs to damaged houses, and the provision of warm blankets, bedding, mattresses and hygiene items. The programme also provides solid fuel and cash assistance to help people have flexible winter livelihoods. This funding will also enable IOM to ensure the availability of critical assets to ensure that aid continues to reach war-affected populations, and to support partner organisations responding to urgent needs on the ground. Claudia Amaral, head of the European Commission’s directorate-general for civil protection and humanitarian aid in Ukraine, is quoted as saying: Vulnerable sections of the population of Ukraine are going through the hardest winter. As the attacks continue, leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating and water, our humanitarian partners, including IOM, continue to work to meet the most urgent needs. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv region in Ukraine’s west, has posted to Telegram to say that it was quiet overnight in the region. He said there was one air alert yesterday, a warning of cruise missiles being fired from Belarus in the north, but that the danger “did not materialise”. The official Telegram channel of the Kyiv city state administration has posted to say that there are air raid warnings in effect in Ukraine’s capital. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog from my colleague Helen Sullivan. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Russian forces have fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in the Ukrainian city of Kherson in the 24 hours to early Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said on Telegram. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov says that fighting has intensified, according to Reuters, with Russia deploying more tanks and armoured vehicles on front lines. Russian troops who have been part of a mobilisation drive for military operations in Ukraine will have the right to get their sperm frozen for free in cryobanks, the state TASS agency reported on Wednesday. Citing Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his appeal for budgetary assistance with the plan. The ministry “determined the possibility of financial support from the federal budget for free conservation and storage of germ cells (spermatozoa) for citizens mobilised to participate in the special military operation for 2022-2024”, Trunov was quoted as saying. Families can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance indicates they can do so. More on Russia’s response to the oil price cap, via Reuters: Under the cap, oil traders who want to retain access to Western financing for such crucial aspects of global shipping as insurance must promise not to pay above $60 per barrel for Russian seaborne oil. That is close to the current price for Russian oil, but far below the prices at which Russia was able to sell it for much of the past year, when windfall energy profits helped Moscow offset the impact of financial sanctions. The decree from Putin, published on a government portal and the Kremlin website, was presented as a direct response to “actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them”. The Kremlin ban would halt crude oil sales to countries participating in the price cap from 1 February to 1 July 2023. A separate ban on refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel would take effect on a date to be set by the government. Putin would have authority to overrule the measures in special cases. Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and any actual disruption to its sales would have far-reaching consequences for global energy supplies. Russia retaliated on Tuesday against a price cap on its oil imposed by Western countries, while its forces were involved in heavy fighting around the bombed-out ghost town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Despite an intensification in the fighting the frontline in eastern Ukraine remains little changed, with neither side making any major advances, said Britain’s Ministry of Defence and Ukraine military analysts. Moscow will ban oil sales to countries that abide by the price cap that was imposed on 5 December, President Vladimir Putin decreed. The price cap, unseen even in the times of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, is aimed at crippling Moscow’s military efforts in Ukraine - without upsetting markets by actually blocking Russian supply. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The agency says the actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. The UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) says that since the start of the war, at least 6,884 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, including 429 children. However, the agency believes that the actual figures are “considerably higher”. We’ll have more on this story shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree that bans the supply of oil and oil products to nations participating in an imposed cap from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil effective from 5 December. Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. Heavy fighting continues in the east and south of the country amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, Britain’s defence ministry said in its daily military briefing on Tuesday. Russia’s military has moved many of its warplanes from Engels airbase to other locations after strikes on the crucial airbase, according to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force. Three Russian servicemen were killed on Monday after a Ukrainian drone attack on the airbase, which lies deep inside Russian territory, according to Russia’s defence ministry. Putin’s comments that he was “ready to negotiate with all parties” involved in the conflict in Ukraine are part of a deliberate information campaign aimed at misleading the west into making concessions, according to analysts. The US thinktank Institute for the Study of War said the Russian president did not offer to negotiate with Ukraine on Saturday, contrary to some reporting. The bodies of 42 Ukrainian servicemen who died while fighting have been returned to Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. Work on bringing back the bodies of Ukraine’s fighters “does not stop for a day”, Oleh Kotenko, the commissioner for missing persons, said. Vladimir Putin met his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, twice in the past 24 hours to “finalise many issues”, Belarusian state-owned Belta news agency reported. The meetings took place in St Petersburg, over breakfast on Tuesday at the Russian Museum, as well as at an informal summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) yesterday evening, it reported. A Russian sausage tycoon who reportedly criticised the war in Ukraine has died after falling from the third-floor window of a luxury hotel in India. The body of Pavel Antov, 65, was discovered just two days after his friend and another local Russian politician, Vladimir Bidenov, was found dead in the same hotel after an apparent heart attack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2023/mar/07/uk-house-prices-rise-february-halifax-greggs-cost-inflation-squeeze-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-07T16:49:03Z","webTitle":"Markets rocked as Jerome Powell warns Fed could switch back to bigger interest rate rises –as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/mar/07/uk-house-prices-rise-february-halifax-greggs-cost-inflation-squeeze-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/mar/07/uk-house-prices-rise-february-halifax-greggs-cost-inflation-squeeze-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Markets rocked as Jerome Powell warns Fed could switch back to bigger interest rate rises –as it happened","bodyText":"Time to recap America’s top central banker has warned that the Federal Reserve is prepared to switch back to bigger interest rate rises to fight inflation, if necessary. Fed chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that the central bank has “more work to do”, even though the full effects of its tightening have not been felt yet. Powell told senators that interest rates are likely to peak higher than previously thought, given the strength of the US economy. Powell says: The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. The markets now estimate there is over a 50% chance that the Fed lifts interest rates by half a percentage point later month, having slowed to quarter-point rises in its last two meetings. These comments hit US bond prices, driving up the yield on two-year Treasury bills to almost 5%, the highest level since 2007. The pound is sliding against the US dollar, hitting a two-month low around $1.186 tonight, down over a cent and a half.

Business leaders have warned that frayed relations with the EU are costing the British economy, as suppliers in the bloc grow more cautious about doing business with post-Brexit Britain. Bakery chain Greggs has said higher wage and energy bills are weighing on profits, but it’s still pushing ahead with 150 new store openings this year. Women in Britain are being priced out of work and suffering from a growing gender pay gap as the result of a lack of affordable child care, a new report from PwC has found. National Grid has asked power plants in Great Britain to generate extra electricity on Tuesday night before the coldest night of the year. A publicly owned electricity generation firm could save Britons nearly £21bn a year, according to new analysis. And…the owner of the Daily Mirror and the Express has published its first articles written using artificial intelligence – but its boss says journalists should not fear it means being replaced by machines. Phew. Shares have fallen in New York too, as traders respond to Jerome Powell’s hawkish comments about the need to keep raising interest rates to tackle inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 292 points, or 0.9%, to 33,138 points. Almost all the 30 companies on the index are in the red, led by Walgreens Boots Alliance (-2.1%) and JPMorgan Chase (-2%). The broader S&amp;P 500 index has lost 1%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is down 0.75%. US government bond prices have dropped after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell hinted strongly that US interest rates will be hiked higher. This has driven up the yield, or interest rate, on two-year Treasury bills to 4.95%, the highest since 2007 – just before the credit crunch. That’s a clear sign that investors are anticipating a large increase in US interest rates this month, of perhaps half a percentage point, given Powell’s concerns about inflation and his warning that there is “more work to do”. The gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, which is seen as an indicator of economic expectations, was at a negative 98.7 basis points, Reuters points out. Such an inversion is seen as a reliable recession indicator. In his testimony today, Fed chair Powell has confirmed that rates will peak higher than expected, says Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist at Capital Economics. Hunter says: Fed Chair Jerome Powell appears to have confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise a higher than we previously anticipated. But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and lower inflation this year, we still suspect the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than the markets are now expecting. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, cautions that the markets got carried away by predictingthat the Fed would ‘pivot’ away from higher rates soon. “As the economic data continues to paint a US economy in rude health, it has become clear that markets got somewhat ahead of themselves on talks of interest rate pauses and potential pivots to rate cuts. Jerome Powell has poured cold water on the idea that Fed is ready to change tack and reiterated the need for bigger interest rate rises if they are required. “Indeed, data has shown that while inflation peaked at the end of last year, its downward trajectory has not been quite as swift as market participants would have liked. This sticky inflation means interest rate rises will remain on the table for as long as employment remains robust. The market is hearing the ‘higher for longer’ message loud and clear and doesn’t see the Fed being dissuaded, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com So, Fed will go higher and for longer – but also might get to what it thinks the peak might be at a swifter pace. Think we see 50bps very much back on the table for the next couple of meetings – the potential to increase the pace of tightening again is noteworthy and probably the chief cause of the market reaction - bonds had kinda already accepted higher and longer. Samuel Fuller, Director of Financial Markets Online, agrees that chair Powell has given a clear signal that US interest rates will rise higher: “Central bankers often have a habit of talking in code. Not today. Jerome Powell couldn’t have been clearer - the Federal Reserve isn’t just willing to pump up US interest rates further, it’s planning to do so. “With US inflation falling but only slowly, the Fed’s Chair warned Congress of the dangers of easing monetary tightening too soon, and pledged to ‘stay the course until the job is done’. Powell admits that the Fed’s tools are powerful but blunt, as he outlines the challenge of bringing down core inflation in the services sector. He says we have not seen the full effects of the Fed’s recent rate hikes – which raised borrowing costs by 4.5 percentage points over the past year, so policymakers are watching carefully for ‘lags in monetary policy’. We are very focused on core inflation, the Fed chair explains. The dollar continues to rally as traders reprice their expectations for how fast, and how high, US interest rates could be hiked. This has pushed sterling down by a cent and a half today, to $1.187, the lowest since January 6th. Powell also had advice for Congress – it must raise the debt ceiling, or risk longstanding harm. Last month the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned the US Treasury department will exhaust its ability to pay all its bills sometime between July and September, unless the current $31.4tn cap on borrowing is raised or suspended. Jerome Powell insists to Congress that the Fed can, and will, bring inflation down to the 2% target. Powell says the Fed is watching the crypto space closely, due to the turmoil in the sector recently. Jerome Powell is now explaining to the Senate banking committee that there is still a mismatch between supply and demand. This is visible in the goods sector, and also in the jobs market (where there were 11m vacancies at the end of last year). The financial markets now believe there is a greater than 50% chance that the Fed increases the size of its interest rate rises this month, and votes for a half-point hike: Jerome Powell rounds off his prepared testimony to Congress by warning of the risks of relaxing monetary policy too quickly. He says that bringing down inflation is essential to achieving the Fed’s two goals, of price stability and maximum employment: Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. America’s top central banker is warning Congress that more needs to be done to tame US inflation, sending the dollar rallying against the pound. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, is testifying to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. And he begins by warning that the Fed has “more work to do” – a hint that interest rates will continue to rise. Powell says: We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Our policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all. Powell explains to the committee that inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year but [at 6.4% in January] remains well above the Fed’s longer-run objective of 2%. On the economic picture, he says the US economy slowed significantly last year, and points to signs that consumer spending and production are subdued. But with inflation still three times the Fed’s target, Powell warns that the Fed continues to anticipate that ongoing interest rate increases will be appropriate, to return inflation to 2 percent over time. For the last two meetings, the Fed has slowed the pace of its interest rate increases to 25 basis points, or a quarter of one percent. Today, though, Powell wans that larger hikes could be introduced if necessary. He points out that recent latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. Powell says: If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. This has sent the dollar rising, knocking the pound down by over one cent today to $1.189. The UK’s National Grid has decided against triggering its Demand Flexibility Service tomorrow, which would have paid some households with smart meters to use less energy at peak times to avoid blackouts due to the cold weather. Demonstrators have marched across France today in a new round of protests and strikes against the government’s plan to raise the retirement age to 64. Unions have been hoping to make their biggest show of force against the proposed pensions reform, disrupting fuel deliveries and public transport and bringing the country to a standstill. The proposed changes would raise the minimum retirement age to 64 from 62 and increase the number of years people have to make contributions for a full pension. Associated Press reports: Garbage collectors, utility workers, train drivers and others have walked off the job on Tuesday across France to show their anger at the reform. More than 250 protests were expected in Paris and around the country against President Emmanuel Macron’s showcase legislation. The bill is under debate in the French Senate this week. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Paris, Marseille, Nice and other cities, including Nantes and Lyon where some minor clashes with police broke out. Laurent Berger, the secretary-general of the CFDT union, said that based on initial figures, the numbers of demonstrators nationwide are expected to be the biggest since the beginning of the movement in January. The board of the International Monetary Funs is close to approving a $2.9bn bailout for Sri Lanka. The rescue package could be agreed on 20 March, 10 months after Sri Lanka defaulted on its debts for the first time. Reuters has the details: The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said Sri Lanka has secured financing assurances from all major bilateral creditors, paving the way for the IMF board to consider approval of a long-awaited $2.9 billion four-year bailout agreed last year. The IMF said its board will meet on March 20 to review a preliminary staff-level agreement first signed in September, offering a lifeline to the South Asian country which faces its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Approval is expected since the board generally will not add items to its agenda unless its members are ready to act. Sri Lanka has now received financing assurances from all major bilateral creditors,” Krishna Srinivasan, director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department (APD) said in a statement. “This paves the way for consideration by the IMF’s Board on March 20 the approval of the Staff Level Agreement reached on September 1, 2022 for financing under an Extended Fund Facility,” Srinivasan added. Speaking of the energy industry… new analysis has found that a publicly owned electricity generation firm could save Britons nearly £21bn a year. The work. by Thinktank Common Wealth, bolsters Labour’s case to launch a national energy company if the party gains power. My colleague Alex Lawson explains: The Common Wealth report, which analysed scenarios for reforming the electricity market, said that a huge saving on electricity costs could be made by buying out assets such as wind, solar and biomass generators on older contracts and running them on a non-profit basis. Funding the measure could require a government bond issuance, or some form of compulsory purchase process. Last year the government attempted to get companies operating low carbon generators, including nuclear power plants, on older contracts to switch to contracts for difference (CfD), allowing any outsized profits to flow back to taxpayers. However, the government later decided to tax eligible firms through the electricity generator levy instead. The Common Wealth study concluded that a publicly owned low carbon energy generator would best deliver on Britain’s climate and economic goals, would eliminate windfall profits made by generators and would cut household bills. Here are more details: The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded action against fossil fuel companies who engage in greenwashing to improve their reputation. Volker Türk told the 52nd session of the Human Rights Council that “Fake climate solutions” must be called out. He say the next UN climate change conference, which begins at the end of November, must tackle the issue. Türk says: I deplore the attempts by the fossil fuel industry at global climate talks and elsewhere to greenwash their reputation and derail our goal of decarbonization. This must be averted at the upcoming COP28 in Dubai, and we need inclusive, safe and meaningful participation of civil society. A study last month found that accusations of greenwashing against major oil companies that claim to be in transition to clean energy are well-founded. While mentions of “climate”, “low-carbon” and “transition” have risen sharply in annual reports in recent years, there has been fewer concrete actions towards moving away from fossil fuels, it found. Türk also called for protection of those who raise concerns over environmental crimes, or policies that result in harm, saying: Bashing climate protests; designing laws that unfairly restrict activities that call the public’s attention to climate harms; and allowing attacks on activists to go unpunished: these are tactics that harm all States and all human beings. And they need to be addressed, urgently. The political and financial turmoil last autumn may have deterred some foreign companies from acquiring UK companies. The total value of inward M&amp;A dropped to £5.3bn in the final quarter of 2023, new data from the Office from National Statistics shows. That is almost £16bn lower than in July-September when inward M&amp;A was worth £21.2bn. A year ago, inward M&amp;A into the UK totalled £16.3bn. The number of inward M&amp;A transactions was broadly unchanged between October (68) and November (64), before dropping to 38 transactions during December 2022. The turmoil of the mini-budget at the end of September, followed by the change of prime minister and chancellor, won’t have made Britain look a particularly attractive investment opportunity: Andrew Gillen, Head of Corporate M&amp;A and Capital Markets at corporate law firm Travers Smith, says: “The sharp drop off in value and volume of inbound M&amp;A during Q4, alongside an increase in outbound M&amp;A indicates that political turmoil and economic uncertainty in the UK during autumn 2022 had a profound impact on the attractiveness of the UK as an investment destination at that time. However it is always dangerous to read too much into a single quarter’s statistics: we feel the improving economic indicators that have been seen in early ‘23, and relative political stability, boosted by closer co-operation with the EU following the Windsor Agreement, will start to reverse this impact and allow the UK market to benefit from any increase in M&amp;A activity.” Domestic M&amp;A activity, in which UK companies acquire other UK companies, almost doubled to £3.6bn in the last quarter of 2022. Elsewhere in the global economy, South Africa is on the brink of recession after the country’s power cut crisis hit growth in the last quarter of 2022. South Africa’s economy contracted by 1.3% in the final three months of last year, more than expected, as the escalation in rolling power cuts caused most sectors to shrink, including mining and agriculture. South Africa’s energy crisis has led to daily power cuts of between eight and 11 hours across the country. Offices, hospitals, factories and tens of thousands of small businesses were forced to close, with outages also causing increased crime, traffic disruption and massive wastage as food supply chains collapse. Catherine Mann also predicted that some of the older workers who took early retirement in the last couple of years may try to return to the jobs market, because they struggle to live as they’d like on their pensions. She told Bloomberg TV that it is “a challenge” to retire at 55, and make sure your retirement savings match your longevity. BoE policymaker Mann predicts that some of these early retirees will end up looking for work, saying: I worry that a couple years down the line, we’re going to see people trying to come back into the labour force, and that’s going to be much more difficult. There has been some indication that people are looking for part time positions, Mann says, adding: It’s early on that and as I say, I worry that people are going to find that their pensions are not sufficient for their preferred lifestyle and are going to want to come back. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has urged early retirees to return to work, and attracted criticism for suggesting that over-50s should get off the golf course to help tackle the UK’s labour shortages. Mann also expressed concern about the supply side of the UK economy, saying: It really is striking how slow growth is in the UK — much slower than what we observed for the US or for the euro area. Brexit is a factor on the supply side and on pricing power.” Catherine Mann says companies are in a strong position to raise prices and this might force the Bank of England to maintain high rates or even increase them further, my colleague Phillip Inman writes: Mann appears to have been blindsided by how corporate monopolies hand consumer goods companies the power to exploit a crisis by uniformly jacking up prices. In the US this trend has been dubbed greedflation. The ECB has discussed it. But seemingly not the Bank of England. On the services side of things, Brexit has limited skilled labour. You might ask how can services firms increase prices if there is intense competition. Well, the savings or inheritances of better-off people allows them to pay higher prices for everything from new kitchens and plumber callouts to higher solicitors or accounting fees. Other, less well off consumers are forced to follow suit. Bunzl’s recent results illustrate the point. It has become one of the most successful FTSE 100 companies by smuggling huge cost increases into its delivery and logistics business, pushing up the prices of all kinds of goods and services that consumers pay. Incredibly, last year it preserved profits and increased margins. This situation is most likely going to be a one-off, given inflation’s likely precipitous fall this year. But it has preserved corporate margins for the last two years and left 90% of people worse off. And BoE rate hikes have helped impoverish people further by raising the cost of borrowing. Mann has shown in speeches that she is very concerned about the labour shortages and their impact on rising wages and, in turn, prices. But it is only now dawning on policymakers that big corporates have capitalised on the crisis to increase prices even more than they needed to, boosting profits and dividends for shareholders. Mann’s answer is to raise interest rates further, even though this only punishes mortgage holders, most of them young and middle aged families, and not the rich, who now get higher rates for their savings. Catherine Mann doesn’t name and shame any companies who have been exhibiting ‘strong pricing power’, but there are plenty of examples of firms who haven’t been shy to whack up their prices. Unilever, which owns Marmite, Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream, Dove soap and Domestos bleach, lifted its prices by 11.2% last summer, and predicted further rises last month. Coca-Cola’s average selling price rose 11% during 2022, and it plans to raise prices further this year. Nestlé lifted its prices by 8.2% last year, which it says did not fully offset its rising costs, and is also planning further price increases this year. Supermarkets have been lifting their prices too, pushing grocery inflation to a record high of 17.1% last month – leaving one in four families struggling. Many broadband and mobile companies are preparing to hit customers with inflation-busting price rises of up to 17% this spring. Recent falls in UK house prices need to be put in context, Catherine Mann argued today. She pointed out to Bloomberg TV that prices have “appreciated dramatically” over the last couple of years. That has created a wealth effect which has only been slightly eroded by falls in prices since last summer. Mann says: A lot of prices have appreciated dramatically in the last couple of years. So there is some price depreciation, but it’s really not that much compared to how much prices on average appreciated over the last couple of years. So we have to take into account what the starting point was, as well as the dynamics of the current pricing. Q: So do prices have further to fall? Mann suggests that the market could be in a “revival” rather than continuing to fall. She points to the reduction in mortgage rates from the high point last autumn, and the increased competion with various lenders launching new mortgage products. As we covered this morning, Halifax reported today that prices rose by 1.1% in February, but average prices were still down around 2.9% or £8,500 on the August 2022 peak. Bank of England rate-setter Catherine Mann also warned that sterling could face downward pressure if investors have not yet fully priced in hawkish messages from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. She told Bloomberg TV: “The important question for me with regard to the pound is how much of that existing hawkish tone is already priced into the pound. If it’s already priced in, then what we see is what we get. But if it’s not completely priced in, then there could be depreciation pressure.” This has nudged the pound a little lower today, it’s down 0.1% at $1.2010. Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann has warned that UK firms are continuing to raise prices, driving up UK inflation. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Mann says she is concerned by the strong pricing power exhibited by firms, which many consumers have been willing to pay. She explains that the price of gas and goods imported from abroad are “on the downturn”, and not rising as fast as they did last year. But on the other hand, Mann is concerned by the extent to which firms have strong pricing powers, and the acceptance of those higher prices by many consumers. Mann says: Of course, not all but even in the face of the cost of living crisis there are still a lot of people out there who are willing to pay higher prices, and firms are willing to set their prices high. This is a growing concern among central bankers. Last week, the European Central Bank signalled it was closely monitoring potential price gouging of consumers. [The Bank of England’s mandate is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium term, but inflation has soared over that target since the summer of 2021. In January this year, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 10.1%.] Mann, a hawkish member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, says she feels vindicated after calling for interest rates to be raised faster in 2022, arguing that a ‘front-loaded’ policy would have been more effective in dampening inflation expectations. She argues that more monetary policy tightening needs to be done, so that inflation expectations fall. The weak pound, she says, is a “very important ingredient” pushing up inflation, as it raises the cost of imports of goods, and energy. The UK, Mann points out, is a “small open economy” which imports a lot of products. The publisher of the Daily Mirror and Express newspapers has revealed that annual profits tumbled by more than a quarter as it saw costs surge by 40% and a drop in advertising demand. Reach, which also owns the Daily Star and a raft of regional titles across the UK, posted underlying pre-tax profits down by 28% to £103.3m, PA Media reports. Underlying operating profits dropped 27% to £106.1m. It said soaring inflation – largely due to rising newsprint costs as energy bills rocketed – pushed up its operating costs by around £40m over the year and hit demand from advertisers. Reach saw ad revenues plunge 15.9% in the year to December 25, while circulation fell 1.7% with falls limited by cover price increases in the second half of 2022. Digital advertising, which has been a strong growth area for media firms, fell 2.7% in the second half of the year as the economic outlook worsened. Premier Foods has lifted its forecast for profits this year, after its grocery business saw strong demand. The maker of Mr Kipling cakes and OXO cubes said it now expected adjusted profit before tax to be around £135m for the year to April 1, 10% higher than the prior-year figure. Premier Foods also saw improving demand for its sweet treats segment improves in the fourth quarter. Shares have jumped 10% this morning. In January, the company said it would raise prices and cut spending as a way to offset high input cost inflation. UK house prices appear to be “somewhat stabilising” despite the ongoing pressure of the cost-of-living crisis on the housing market, says Charlotte Nixon, mortgage expert at Quilter: The fall in mortgage rates compared to the peak seen towards the end of last year has probably boosted buyer confidence, but this could be short-lived, Nixon warns. She predicts that interest rates will continue to rise this year, weighing on prices: Although we have hopefully passed the peak of inflation, it’s still likely that interest rates will still rise further, and the current unpredictability of the market will be concerning for homeowners who may be looking to sell their properties. “While this morning’s figures are slightly more positive than some may have expected, the high cost of energy and increased mortgage rates could see a return to falling prices over the next few months. Many homeowners are struggling to keep up with the increasing energy bills, which is causing them to cut back on their spending elsewhere. This, in turn, has decreased demand from buyers as people are hesitant to make such a significant investment in a time of financial uncertainty. In the City, shares in UK energy services company John Wood have jumped 15% after it received a fouth takeover approach from private equity firm Apollo. Wood, which had rejected three unsolicited proposals from Apollo already, received a fourth proposal for a cash offer of 237 pence per share – around 20% above last night’s close. However, the board of Wood say they believe this latest proposal still undervalues the compay, so they are “minded to reject” it. They add: The Board will continue to engage with its shareholders and intends to engage further, on a limited basis, with Apollo. There can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any offer might be made. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. Shares have jumped to around 222p this morning, still below Apollo’s offer – but up around two-thirds so far this year. Greggs has reported that its move to open some bakeries later into the evening is paying off. Greggs extended the opening hours of 500 shops until 8pm or beyond last year, as it competed for “food-on-the-go” sales in the evening. Products such as chicken goujons and pizza slices have proved popular in the evenings, Greggs reports, including sharing boxes via its delivery service. The bakery is also excited to have gone viral on TikTok, telling shareholders: We also introduced warm versions of some of our core products, with Hot Yum Yums and salted caramel dipping sauce going viral on TikTok! Greggs also expanded its range of vegan products, saying: Whether our customers follow a vegan diet or not, we know many more people are choosing to eat less meat for ethical, environmental or health reasons, and we are meeting that need. This morning’s Halifax house price report suggets the housing market is resilient, the EY ITEM Club of economic forecasters say. The “strong gain” of 1.1% in prices last month could be a reflection of mortgage rates falling back from their post-mini-Budget peaks and a healthy labour market, argues Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. It could also be another sign that the economy is demonstrating unexpected resilience, despite the headwinds it is facing, Beck adds. But… February’s rise left annual growth in prices at a modest 2.1%, and Beck says it is hard to see “momentum in prices being maintained”. He adds: Mortgage rates have come down in the last few months but are still much higher than a year ago. Meanwhile, households’ ability to take on and service debt is being squeezed by falling real incomes, and widespread predictions of a decline in property values will likely encourage some potential buyers to delay purchasing, weighing on demand. On the other hand, changes in the structure of the housing and mortgage markets, and a resilient labour market, will likely reduce the risk of forced selling. An improving economic outlook as this year progresses may also limit how far house prices fall. National Grid has asked power plants in Great Britain to generate extra electricity tonight ahead of the coldest night of the year, my colleague Alex Lawson reports. The Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has issued an “electricity margin notice”, telling the owners of power plants to bring on extra power supplies between 4.30pm and 8.30pm on Tuesday. National Grid stressed this did not mean supplies were “at risk”. The Met Office has issued weather warnings for rain and snow across the UK with temperatures of -4C expected in London and -6C in Birmingham. The freezing temperatures across the country are expected to trigger a surge in demand for power and heating. On Monday, National Grid asked EDF to warm up its West Burton A coal unit for potential use today. The unit is covered by one of the “winter contingency” contracts negotiated by government to keep coal fired power plants on standby for emergency use. Strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants in France, which supplies Britain with electricity via subsea cables, have also raised concerns in recent days. The Grid has been on heightened alert over risks of potential power cuts this winter, due to concerns Russia would cut gas supplies into Europe, with a knock on effect on Britain. However, a relatively mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe have eased these fears, and caused gas prices to fall sharply. Late on Monday night, a spokesperson for the ESO said: “An electricity margin notice (EMN) has been issued to the market. This is a routine tool that we use most winters, and means we are asking generators to make available any additional generation capacity they may have. The EMN does not mean electricity supply is at risk.” In December, National Grid paid record amounts to encourage gas-fired power plants to crank up supply at short notice. The coal-fired plants, which also include units at Drax in Yorkshire and Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, have been warmed for potential use several times this winter but stood down each time. Estate agents Foxtons has predicted that the property market will turn around later this year, as the recent fall in mortgage rates lifts the market. Foxtons told the City this morning that: Mortgage rates have started to reduce in recent weeks and buyer activity is picking up, which may result in a more favourable sales market in the latter part of the year. The average rate on fixed-rate mortgages surged over 6.5% last October, following the turmoil in the government bond market after the mini-budget. But rates have fallen since, with HSBC launching a fiveve-year fixed-rate mortgage priced at below 4% last month. Foxtons reported an 11% rise in revenues last year, while pre-tax profits more than doubled to £11.9m. Guy Gittins, who was appointed Foxtons chief executive last year, says “core operational failings have throttled historical performance” at the company. Those failings includes: Poor data accessibility and utilisation impeded business decision making and the ability to unlock revenue growth opportunities. Outdated estate agency processes and diluted culture restricted organic growth. Insufficient headcount capacity and experience constrained productivity. No clear customer proposition and brand invisible in core markets limited ability to successfully compete. Estate agents are reporting that activity has picked up this year. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, says it appears the market is stronger than expected: “The UK housing market appears near the end of a long hangover from the mini-Budget rather than on the verge of a price plunge. Activity stopped well before Christmas due to the mortgage market turmoil but has picked up this year as people come to terms with where rates are settling. That said, asking prices are likely to come under more pressure as we enter the traditionally busier spring market due to tighter affordability. We expect around half of the 20% increase seen during the pandemic to unwind but most evidence that is not backwards-looking points to a stronger market than expected.” Matthew Thompson, head of sales at London-based agency Chestertons, reports a rise in properties coming onto the market. “As the UK economy has shown signs of recovery, we are beginning to see more sellers wanting to capitalise on the positive market sentiment. In February, our branches registered a 2% increase in the number of properties being put up for sale compared to the same month last year.” “Still, the capital continues to experience a chronic undersupply of suitable housing; particularly as demand has remained strong since the start of 2023 with more buyers booking in viewings. Simultaneously, the number of offers being withdrawn has decreased by 11% which indicates that there are fewer window shoppers and more serious buyers entering the market.” North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf says Halifax’s data confirms the picture at the ‘sharp end’ of the market: ‘The reduction in housing market activity has been quite modest considering recent rises in mortgage rates and the cost-of-living shock, while a fresh crop of properties has buoyed viewings considerably and is outstripping sales agreed. ‘As a result buyers are waiting to see if prices may soften further and mortgage repayments stabilise before committing.’ But Jonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders, reports that uncertainty is slowing the market: “For both rattled sellers and anxious buyers, this is a tentative step in the right direction. “Prices are now settling rather than sliding, and the market remains firmly in a period of transition. The trouble is no-one yet knows what it’s transitioning to. “The Halifax’s data shows the average price of a home has now risen on a monthy basis for two months in a row, but it’s far too soon to call the end of the price correction that’s underway nearly everywhere. “The fact remains that while many buyers have both the financial ability and the opportunity to buy, they lack the confidence to do so – and as a consequence the market is still slowing. The UK property market is not ‘out of the woods’ yet, despite its pick-up in February, says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor: Scholar explains that improvements in the underlying economic climate are lifting house prices: While annual house price growth remained steady, the monthly reading has been picking up in recent months, reflecting some improvements in the underlying drivers. Although mortgage rates are historically at high levels, they have been coming down, helping to support demand for properties. Plus the latest GfK consumer confidence reading hit the highest since April 2022, with sentiment recovering from the lows last September. The housing market however is not yet out of the woods with pressures from a weak economy, double-digit inflation, the cost-of-living crisis and the potential for further rate hikes this year from the Bank of England. This morning’s Halifax reading is markedly different to the recent report from Nationwide which saw year-on-year house prices drop by 1.1% in February, the first annual drop since the height of the pandemic in June 2020. Nationwide and Halifax use different data sources and methos when constructing the index, based on their own mortgage approvals, which could explain the discrepancy.” UK bakery chain Greggs has warned this morning that it is being pressured by rising costs. Greggs told the City that “cost inflation will continue to be a challenge in the year ahead”, driven particularly by pay awards and energy costs. Greggs has also reported a “strong performance” for 2022. Like-for-like sales at its shops jumped by 17.8% last year, while pre-tax profit rose by 1.9% to £148.3m. Earnings were held back by the rising costs of ingredients, energy, and labour. Greggs opener 186 new stores last year – a record – and closed 39, leading to net openings of 147 shops. That grew Greggs’ estate to 2,328 shops on 31 December 2022. The company is aiming for 150 net openings in 2023, and says there is a “clear opportunity for significantly more than 3,000 UK shops in time”. Halifax has also broken down the housing market by property type – which shows that prices of new houses rose over the last year, while flat prices fell. They say: By property type, prices of flats are now into negative territory over the past 12 months (-0.3% annual growth), while prices for terraced properties have broadly stagnated (+0.3%). For detached properties, these have increased by just +1.5% on the year, the lowest rise since the end of 2019. Annual price inflation remains stronger for new houses (+6.6%, a four-month high) than for existing properties (+1.1%, unchanged at the lowest in nearly a decade). Annual house price growth dropped “most significantly” in the North East, at 1.1% in February vs a rise of 3.6% in January, with homes in the region now costing an average £163,953, Halifax reports. Average house prices in London dropped by 0.9% to £526,842, from January’s £530,416. Halifax explains: London may be affected by its large proportion of flats – prices for which have broadly stagnated. Despite this slowdown, homes in London still cost over £240,000 more than the UK national average. During February, house prices rose by 2.2% over the last year in Scotland, lifting the average price to £198,779. In Wales, annual growth slowed to 1.2%, meaning average homes cost £210,917. Those purchasing a home in Northern Ireland will now pay £185,009, on average, an annual growth rate of 5.7% (vs 7.0% in January.) Good morning. UK house prices picked up last month, data just released shows, as calm returned to the property market after the turmoil of last autumn. Halifax has reported that the average house price rose by 1.1% in February, following a 0.2% increase in January and a 1.3% drop in December. This left the annual rate of house price growth unchanged, at +2.1% for third month running. But on a quarter-on-quarter basis, prices were down 2.5%. Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, points out that the average house price has been stable over the last three months. The fall in mortgage costs, following the surge after the disastrous mini-budget last September, has also helped prices to stabilise, Kinnaird says: Recent reductions in mortgage rates, improving consumer confidence, and a continuing resilience in the labour market are arguably helping to stabilise prices following the falls seen in November and December. Still, with the cost of a home down on a quarterly basis, the underlying activity continues to indicate a general downward trend. In cash terms, house prices are down around £8,500 (or 2.9%) on the August 2022 peak but remain almost £9,000 above the average prices seen at the start of 2022. As the average prices are still above pre Covid-19 levels, most sellers will retain at least some of the price gains made during the pandemic. Kinnaird points out that house price affordability remains a problem for new buyers: With average house prices remaining high housing affordability will continue to feel challenging for many buyers. Halifax’s data shows a stronger market than rival lender Nationwide. They reported last week that annual house price growth in the UK turned negative in February for the first time in almost three years. Also coming up today The cost of living squeeze hit consumer spending last month, as shoppers cut back. Total retail sales rose by 5.2% in February compared with a year earlier, up slightly from January’s annual growth rate of 4.2%. But that masks a sharp fall in volumes, as high inflation means goods prices had risen by more. But there was strong sales of jewellery and fragrances for Valentine’s Day, according to the British Retail Consortium. The leader of Britain’s manufacturing bosses is expected to criticise the UK government “mismanagement” of the economy, and the post-Brexit relationship with the European Union, at the annual conference of Make UK today. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, will criticise the government’s failure to embrace a coherent industrial strategy, The Times reports. Phipson is expected to call for an end to “the rancour and political chaos of the last few years”, and express hopes that the new Windsor framework will lead to a new era of pragmatism and collaboration with the EU “rather than thumping the table or issuing threats”. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will also address the conference, and announce a review on the UK’s business tax regime. Reeves is expected to say that a lack of business investment, fuelled by uncertainty and political instability under the Conservatives, has weighed on economic growth. European stock markets are expected to open a little higher, as investors wait to hear from America’s top central banker, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who is set to appear before Congress. Powell will be quizzed about the Fed’s interest rate rises over the last year, and the apparent strength of the US economy. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The fact that the US jobs market, or economic activity don’t react to higher Fed rates is a problem for Fed, because it makes the Fed’s arms less efficient for fighting against inflation. Many would argue that changes in rates take time to filter into the economy but the Fed’s tightening campaign began in November 2021 - 17 months ago, the rate hikes began roughly a year ago. It’s about time we start seeing the impact of higher rates through data.

Coronavirus demands the same","bodyText":"Deja vu. In recent days I’ve had that sense more than once. Every time I come home, remove my mask and wash my hands, I start thinking whether it is safe to keep on wearing the clothes that I had on outside. What if they are contaminated by the virus? Well, I can change clothes, but what if the particles have already jumped somewhere else, and are now in my home? Some would call it paranoia. I call it deja vu. I recognise those thoughts and remember the feelings. That is because I first experienced them more than 30 years ago, in May 1986, on a trip to Kyiv, then the capital of Soviet Ukraine. It was a few weeks after the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, and I was in the city – about 100km from the disaster area – on a business trip. We already knew that there was radiation in the air. Water trucks were spraying the streets, foreign students were leaving the city, and overseas broadcasters like the BBC were telling us to stay inside. But our own government was sending confusing and distressing messages: there is absolutely no danger, but make sure you keep children inside, and pregnant women too. Oh, and close your windows when you are at home. Then, as now, we were dealing with an invisible enemy, trying to figure out where particles that we could not see might go. Then, as now, the world had to deal with a man-made disaster; the inability of the government that had facilitated the disaster through neglect, not design, to undo it; and the world’s confused and inconsistent reaction to a catastrophe not of its making. Today, as in 1986, people are frightened and disoriented, trying to fight something that they can’t see, hear, touch or smell, even though it has already changed our lives. What was true then still seems true today: disasters know no borders, no matter how many walls we try to build between us and the rest of the world. In the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident, observers noted that it had made the iron curtain obsolete. Indeed, in the days after the explosion, the radioactive cloud moved not just beyond the USSR but even beyond the outer Soviet empire, passing across the eastern bloc into western Europe. It reached Scandinavia on 28 April 1986, two days after the explosion, and triggered alarms at a nuclear power plant near Uppsala, Sweden. The world learned about rising radiation levels from Stockholm before Moscow said anything. From Chernobyl, radioactive rain carried unruly isotopes of strontium-90 and caesium-137, to name only two, not only to neighbouring Belarus and western Russia, or to Scandinavia, but also to the Balkans, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, and to parts of Wales, England and large areas of Scotland. The mighty Soviet Union could not control the clouds and ultimately lost control of the narrative as well. Does that sound familiar? As it struggled to deal with a homegrown disaster that was becoming international, Beijing in 2019 closely resembled Moscow in 1986. Like Moscow’s terse initial report about the Chernobyl disaster, Beijing’s announcement about the outbreak of Covid-19 came late, was incomplete, and had all the hallmarks of a coverup. Like the Soviet Union responding to the Chernobyl explosion, China mobilised huge domestic resources and introduced draconian measures to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan. But neither of the two governments, which happened to be communist and authoritarian in different degrees, managed to stop the spread of the disaster and information about it beyond their borders. And the misleading reports and mismanagement then produced a backlash among foreign governments and the general public throughout the world. China, which pretended to the status of world leader in matters of globalisation and climate change only a few months before the Wuhan disaster, has had its reputation damaged. It also faces trillion-dollar class-action lawsuits originating in the United States and calls for a billion dollars in reparations from Germany. However effective they are at mobilising resources to deal with disasters, authoritarian regimes turn out to be too effective for their own good in controlling information. Lack of freedom of speech helps to turn potential disasters into real ones and national tragedies into international cataclysms. But as we try to contain the “fallout” of coronavirus, many are already asking what steps we might take to better prepare ourselves next time, and avoid the next tragedy taking the same trajectory. So far, the response has been almost exclusively nation-based. Borders have been closed and fingers pointed, not just at China but at international institutions as well. President Trump has suspended funding for the World Health Organization, blaming it, at least in part, for the failure to contain the virus. While temporary border closures have their practical purposes, national self-isolation accompanied by a blame game that undermines multilateral organisations is neither a way out of the current pandemic nor a template for dealing with future disasters. Instead, the way forward, as demonstrated by lessons learned from Chernobyl, is through coordinated action. While some take aim at WHO for its cosy relationship with the Chinese government, it’s worth remembering that the the International Atomic Energy Agency, rightly criticised at the time for facilitating the Soviet coverup of Chernobyl, eventually became the instrument by which Moscow came clean about what happened. It led the international effort to open the Soviet nuclear industry to the world and helped to introduce safety standards behind the iron curtain. A number of international legal instruments to ensure that there is early warning of nuclear accidents were adopted in the aftermath of Chernobyl, as were various measures to heighten the safety of the nuclear industry. It is my personal conviction that without those measures we would have had further Chernobyl-type accidents in the former Soviet space. Legal experts suggest that the lawsuits being prepared in the US will go nowhere, given the nature of international law and foreign governments’ liabilities under it. And one need not be an expert to realise that cutting funds to international institutions such as the WHO in today’s interconnected world is extremely damaging. On the contrary, we need to strengthen international institutions in their capacity to fight pandemics and provide the WHO with a stronger mandate to act in closed societies such as China. The only effective responses to international disasters, no matter which state they occur in, are international. As the world’s reaction to Chernobyl showed, coordinated efforts can bring real change, making us all safer – whether we live in Beijing, Moscow, London or New York. That’s the kind of deja vu I’d like to be experiencing right now. • Serhii Plokhy is professor of history at Harvard University and the author of Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2021/oct/20/why-are-boris-johnson-and-rishi-sunak-at-odds-over-net-zero-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-20T16:59:29Z","webTitle":"Why are Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak at odds over net zero plans?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/20/why-are-boris-johnson-and-rishi-sunak-at-odds-over-net-zero-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/oct/20/why-are-boris-johnson-and-rishi-sunak-at-odds-over-net-zero-plans","fields":{"headline":"Why are Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak at odds over net zero plans?","bodyText":"Publication of the government’s blueprint to hit net zero by 2050 has opened up a rift between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak over spending. The chancellor is concerned on many levels about the prime minister’s tendency to believe that “everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds”, a phrase Voltaire used in his novel Candide to lampoon the optimists of mid-18th-century France. According to Treasury insiders, Johnson is far too sanguine about Britain’s ability to emerge from the pandemic and tackle the climate emergency without meticulous planning and careful management of the public finances. Sunak used his Conservative party conference speech – which made no mention of the environment or net zero – to warn that excessive government borrowing and “stacking up bills for future generations to pay” was immoral. What is Johnson asking for? There is a long list of spending on transition arrangements to reach net zero that Johnson wants to push ahead with and is willing to put on the UK’s credit card if necessary. They range from grants to install low-carbon heat pumps to new nuclear power stations. This is not as reckless as it sounds when interest rates are at rock bottom, and economic theory says there is a huge potential return on investments in a modern infrastructure, especially when they also happen to be green. What are those investment benefits? It varies from one industry to the next, but commonly government can expect to get back £1.20 to £1.80 for every £1 spent when it invests in infrastructure. Of course, this multiplier effect only works if the money is invested wisely. The aim is not just to replace out-of-date equipment, buildings and technology, but do it in such a way that the people who use it are more productive without warming the planet. How does Johnson want to invest in net zero? Subsidies can create a market for green projects where none existed before, mainly because the upfront costs deter private companies in search of a profit. Once the market is thriving, prices tend to come down and the subsidies can be withdrawn. Later the funds can be deployed elsewhere. Sunak and Johnson agree on the need to provide subsidies and attract private investment but disagree on the amount of government cash that should be on offer and for how long. Why is Sunak so reticent? The Treasury is an anxious beast. It may appear arrogant, especially when resisting attempts to devolve financial decision-making away from Westminster. But it is distrustful of other Whitehall departments, which are viewed as spendthrifts lacking the financial discipline to manage complex projects. Green public transport should be the goal of any net zero strategy, but Treasury officials are known to despair of their counterparts in the transport ministry after significant cost overruns on London’s Elizabeth line, also known as Crossrail, and HS2. Has the Treasury’s culture proved a barrier? Treasury officials also like to avoid taking risks. Investing in the north of England, the Midlands and the south-west as part of Johnson’s levelling up plans are deemed perilously uncertain when compared with the guaranteed returns to be made in London and the south-east. The same thinking is prevalent when net zero initiatives are considered. Johnson’s record of splashing cash on friends and Conservative business contacts when the pandemic hit, much of which was wasted, has only underscored concerns about the prospect of wasteful spending if No 10 moves too quickly. Why does Sunak say borrowing is a tax on young people? Sunak objects to further increases in borrowing, arguing that the extra debt will need to be paid by future generations. It is a common thread running through the speeches of most free-market Conservative MPs and ignores the benefits for future generations of a less polluted, more biodiverse environment supported by green jobs. Young people will not thank today’s policymakers if a refusal to borrow limits the speed of transition. Does that mean tax rises to fund the transition to net zero? In a paper on Tuesday to accompany Johnson’s spending plans, Sunak said a rebalancing of the tax system would be necessary once fossil fuels begin to be phased out. Just as it would dent the exchequer if people stopped smoking or drinking alcohol, a reduction in petrol and diesel use will hit fuel duty receipts, currently worth £37bn to the Treasury. Sunak did not say where he was looking to get an alternative source of revenue, but there is no sign he will increase income tax. The road user lobby expect the chancellor to back pay-as-you-drive charges once electric cars dominate the roads."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-uk-politics-news-live-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T16:26:13Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss energy plan ‘needlessly inefficient and expensive’, says thinktank – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-uk-politics-news-live-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-uk-politics-news-live-latest","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss energy plan ‘needlessly inefficient and expensive’, says thinktank – as it happened","bodyText":"Liz Truss will freeze energy bills at an average of £2,500 a year for two years from 1 October, and has pledged to tackle the root causes of the problems in the UK energy market through plans to increase supply, including the resumption of fracking. My colleagues Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker have the story here. And Rupert Jones has a summary of what the plans involve. Liz Truss raised more than £420,000 in donations for her successful Conservative leadership bid, with the biggest single contribution made by the wife of a former BP executive. The prayers of the nation are with the Queen, the archbishop of Canterbury has said, as Britain’s leaders sent messages of support to the monarch, who was put under medical supervision after doctors became worried about her health. There is ongoing coverage of this story on our separate live blog. From ITV’s Robert Peston The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, another thinktank, has published its assessment of the energy price plan. It is a bit more critical than the IFS (see 2.56pm) and the Resolution Foundation (see 3.59pm). NIESR argued for a sliding price cap, where the cost of energy per unit would go up the more energy a person uses, and it says the government’s plan is “needlessly inefficient and expensive”. Max Mosley, an NIESR economist, said: The prime minister’s energy plan is appropriate in terms of scale and ambition, but is needlessly inefficient and expensive. Its untargeted nature makes the currently unfunded proposal wasteful, which will put pressure on public finances, and for an unknown amount of time. There are better options, including a variable price cap that would gone further in lowering the bills for the poorest and could have even paid for itself. My colleague Peter Walker has written a good analysis of the energy bills announcement. Here’s an extract. There are two main things to note about Liz Truss’s energy costs package. First, there is much detail to come. Also, it is an undeniable paradox that the first move of a prime minister surrounded by former Taxpayers’ Alliance staff is a £150bn state effort to fix commercial prices … An early Truss campaign interview with the Financial Times even airily dismissed the idea of “handouts”. Future campaign messaging was less clear, but still resistant to what was disparagingly referred to as “Gordon Brown economics”. As it has turned out, Truss has ended up doing more or less what Brown argued for in early August, a call for a freeze on prices that pre-empted not just the government but even Brown’s own Labour party. What changed was the sheer weight of political and, what you might even term moral, pressure. Truss was told by an array of experts that failure to take bold action would create a humanitarian disaster, with millions of households cold or hungry or both, businesses collapsing en masse, with the impact on the economy, and especially on public health inequalities, felt for a generation. And here is the full article. The Department for Businesss, Energy and Industrial Strategy has published a factsheet giving a tiny bit more detail of the energy plans announced by Liz Truss earlier. The section on support for business illustrates how vague the plans are at this stage. Full details of how the plan will work for households are not available, but the scheme for businesses is even more sketchy; it seems to be more of a wishlist than a plan, and, with a small typeface, you could literally print it on the back of the metaphorical fag packet. But the factsheet does include this chart, showing the notional savings for households, by housing type. Martin Lewis, the consumer champion, has a good video guide to the energy announcement that you can watch here. He thinks the chances are 50-50 that the government will also cut VAT on fuel bills in its emergency budget later this month. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has published its own assessment of the energy price guarantee. Like the Institute for Fiscal Studies (see 2.56pm), it welcomes this as a substantial intervention that will avert catastrophe for many people this winter, but one that will not stop them facing a very tough winter anyway. Both thinktanks stress that this does not offer a permanent solution. Torsten Bell, the chief executive at the Resolution Foundation, said: Households should be reassured that the winter ahead will not be as bad as feared, but policymakers need to recognise it will still be very tough indeed. The energy price guarantee does a good job of targeting those households facing the highest energy bills but, because it is not well targeted at those on low and middle incomes, comes with a large price tag. Liz Truss is asking future taxpayers to pick up a large and very uncertain bill on behalf of today’s energy bill payers, but declined to set out the cost of this huge package. It could end up surpassing the bank bailouts at the height of the financial crisis, with new support for households alone on course to total around £120bn. It goes without saying this can’t be the permanent answer to higher energy bills. The Resolution Foundation is also critical of the proposal to negotiate new, long-term contracts with low-carbon energy suppliers. Echoing the argument made by Ed Miliband (see 10.09am), it says this “risks delaying but locking in those windfalls, rather than removing them”. Union leaders have criticised the energy announcement from Liz Truss, saying that it should have included a windfall tax and that ministers should have acted earlier. Here is a roundup of some of their reaction. Frances O’Grady, the outgoing TUC general secretary, said: The prime minister is making the wrong people pay. She should have imposed a much larger windfall tax on profiteering oil and gas giants, and she should have required all firms getting help with energy bills to commit to no lay-offs for the lifetime of the help, to protect livelihoods. Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said: It is quite frankly remarkable that the prime minister is asking workers to pay for massive energy company profits. The economy is broken and workers will see through this plan to boost profiteering yet again. I don’t think the irony escapes many. The reason we are held to ransom now by an over-reliance on non-domestic energy is that a Conservative government privatised our energy. Andy Prendergast, national officer at the GMB, said: The Tories have been in office for 12 years. Their failures to build new nuclear power stations, to protect and utilise our gas storage capacity and willingness to engage in political groupthink on domestic on and offshore resources, means we are playing catch-up in the race to defend ourselves against the global energy crisis. And Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary, said: At long last, the government has acted. A bill freeze should have happened months ago. Instead, millions have endured sleepless nights terrified of the winter ahead. The companies raking in billions from soaring energy costs should pay their share. Another windfall tax would be fairer than handing huge debts to future generations. The Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders, has welcomed the government’s energy plan. But Jonathan Geldart, the IoD’s director general, said it was important to get an assurance that the plan would not weaken the public finances. He said: What we need now is an external reassurance that the scale of the intervention does not jeopardise the public finances. That’s why it’s crucially important that the Office for Budget Responsibility can swiftly produce its independent assessment of the impact on government debt and the wider macroeconomy. During first minister’s questions in the Scottish parliament Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the UK government’s “very belated action on energy bills” but said people would still have to pay more. She said: It does not represent a halt to the rise in energy bills. Average energy bills right now are just under £2,000, a cap of £2,500 will still see people pay more for their energy. People are still seeing soaring energy costs because of a broken energy market and the utter incompetence of this UK government. Conor Murphy, the Sinn Féin finance minister in Northern Ireland, said the UK government needed to provide “urgent clarity” as to how it will meet its promise to ensure that households in Northern Ireland get the same help as households in Britain. In a statement on the energy package he said: While the British government has said the energy policy changes will apply here, they have failed to outline what exactly that means. This will bring little comfort to individuals who are having to decide between heating and eating. Likewise, businesses trying to plan ahead for the winter months have no certainty as to when support will be forthcoming. The absence of a functioning executive will require a workaround. At a time of crisis for citizens, businesses and public services, this is completely unacceptable. I am calling for urgent clarity on how energy support will be delivered locally. The power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland is not functioning because the DUP says it will not participate until the government abandons the Northern Ireland protocol in its current form. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published its assessment of the energy plan announced by Liz Truss today. It says that capping the average household energy bill at £2,500 a year would cost £60bn over the next year and that just over half of that would go to households in the top half for income distribution. But while poorer households will gain less in cash terms, they will gain significant more as a proportion of what they spend, the IFS says. “The energy price guarantee will save a household with typical energy use in the lowest-income tenth an amount equivalent to 14% of their household spending, compared to 5% for the highest income tenth,” it says. The IFS also says that, if other European countries subsidise bills in the same way, this could increase the risks of a bidding war. It explains. Prices are high because Europe faces severe gas shortages in the coming months. To correct the (large) mismatch between supply and demand, some users of energy – whether households, businesses or governments – will have to reduce their energy use. The less UK households reduce their energy demand, the greater demands placed on others. If other European countries also attempt to subsidise household or business use of energy, the result could be a bidding war that raises the cost of providing support in all countries. It also risks a situation where there is simply not enough energy to go round, which would require rationing or increase the risk of blackouts. Charities say Liz Truss’s energy support package will not do enough to protect the poorest families. Here is a roundup of reaction from some of the leading voices in the sector. Imran Hussain, the director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children, said this was a “big intervention with a big hole in it”. He explained: We desperately need more targeted help through benefits for the low-paid and those who have lost their jobs or cannot work because of disability, illness or caring responsibilities. Even with a freeze, energy bills will still be double what they were a year ago, the price of other essentials continues to soar and the true value of benefits has been cut. Becca Lyon, the head of child poverty at Save the Children, said the plan would not stop many families reaching crisis point this winter. She said: How can it be right that multimillionaires will get the same support as the most vulnerable families? If there is enough money to pay the energy bills of the rich and not ask energy giants to pay a penny more, surely there should be enough money to make sure no family has to choose between heating and eating this winter. James Taylor, the director of strategy for the disability charity Scope, said the plan was just a “sticking plaster” for disabled people. He explained: Life costs more if you are disabled. This universal approach brings some relief, but disabled people often rely on higher energy use. It’s important to remember that this cap does not limit what you pay. For many disabled households their bills are still skyrocketing. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition also said the plan would be an “expensive sticking plaster” without further investment in improving energy efficiency of homes worst affected by fuel poverty. The coalition coordinator, Simon Francis, said: While many households will breathe a sigh of relief, the prime minister offered no detail of additional support for the millions of households who will be left behind in fuel poverty this winter. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Radio 4’s World at One that he expected the government’s “energy price guarantee” to cost at least £100bn. He said: The cost will be very, very uncertain. It will depend on what happens to gas prices over the next two years, it will depend on whether this scheme is extended. I would be surprised if over the next 12 months it didn’t cost more than £100bn. The uncertainty gets much greater the further out you go. This expires in two years’ time. On current expectations, that will make it a very painful winter in 2024-25. I think that does open the question about whether this scheme will get extended or not, just as the [Covid] furlough scheme got extended and extended again and again. Bloomberg’s Alex Wickham said this morning that, on the basis of a government document he had seen, he expected the figure to be much higher than £100bn. Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, says that, by not imposing a new windfall tax, the government has ensured that “our public services and communities to pay for this through lower investment”. She explains why in a Twitter thread starting here. In his speech in the energy debate Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said Liz Truss was in effect imposing a “Truss tax” on people who would have to pay more for energy. He explained: Freezing prices wasn’t really a choice. It’s the only political option. And when the current price cap stands at 2,000 with a 54% increase since spring, and many people are already unable to pay, setting the cap at 2,500 isn’t an actual freeze. After all the waiting, it couldn’t be any clearer, [the prime minister] set it out very brazenly. The prime Mminister’s plan means that the public pays. She has made the political choice to tax families instead of companies, to put profit over people. Instead of a windfall tax, she has chosen a new Tory tax, the Truss tax. The Truss tax that means that in the months and years ahead households and businesses will be punished with higher bills, higher interest rates and higher mortgage costs. A Truss tax means that cuts to the vital public services rely on and which are used to support the most vulnerable. A Truss tax means a threat to the Scottish budget, which the Scottish government is using to protect our population and shield workers and public services as best they can. Sam Coates from Sky News has a good analysis of the “energy price guarantee”. He says there are five big unknowns: 1) no costings; 2) no detail about how average bills will be capped; 3) no clarity about what might happen after the two-year guantee expires; 4) no clarity about how people will get help in Northern Ireland, where the energy regime is different; and 5) uncertainty about what support business will actually get. And Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, is also surprised by the decision not to give any costings for the policy. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, says he is staggered that Liz Truss announced her “energy price guarantee” without saying how much it would cost. (See 11.47am.) Politicians have been issuing statements expressing their concerns about the Queen’s health, and their best wishes for her recovery. My colleague Miranda Bryant is covering all the developments on that story on a separate live blog. It’s here. The government has now sent out a press release about the “energy price guarantee” announced by Liz Truss earlier. It does not seem to be available online yet, and so here are some excerpts. Help for households Under new plans, a typical UK household will pay no more than £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years from 1st October, through a new ‘energy price guarantee’ which limits the price suppliers can charge customers for units of gas. This takes account of temporarily removing green levies, worth around £150, from household bills. The guarantee will supersede the existing energy price cap. This will save the average household £1,000 a year based on current energy prices from October. It comes in addition to the announced £400 energy bills discount for all households and together they will bring costs close to where the energy price cap stands today. The new guarantee will apply to households in Great Britain, with the same level of support made available to households in Northern Ireland. Those households who do not pay direct for mains gas and electricity – such as those living in park homes or on heat networks – will be no worse off and receive support through a new fund. Today’s action will deliver substantial benefits to the economy - boosting growth and curbing inflation by 4-5 points, reducing the cost of servicing the national debt. Help for business As businesses have not benefited from an energy price cap and are not always able to fix their energy price through fixed deals, many are reporting projected increases in energy costs of more than 500%. A new six-month scheme for businesses and other non-domestic energy users (including charities and public sector organisations like schools) will offer equivalent support as is being provided for consumers. This will protect them from soaring energy costs and provide them with the certainty they need to plan their business. After this initial six-month scheme, the Government will provide ongoing, focused support for vulnerable industries. There will be a review in 3 months’ time to consider where this should be targeted to make sure those most in need get support. Reforms to energy market The government will provide energy suppliers with the difference between this new lower price, and what energy retailers would charge their customers were this not in place. Schemes previously funded by green levies will also continue to be funded by the government during this two year period to ensure the UK’s investment in home-grown, secure renewable technologies continues. Whilst the intervention will be funded by the government, action is being taken to significantly reduce the cost over time, including: A new energy supply taskforce – led by Madelaine McTernan who headed up the UK’s successful vaccine taskforce – has begun negotiations with domestic and international suppliers to agree long-term contracts that reduce the price they charge for energy and increase the security of its supply. The taskforce and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy will negotiate with renewable producers to reduce the prices they charge as well. HM Treasury are announcing a joint scheme, working with the Bank of England, to address the extraordinary liquidity requirements faced by energy firms operating in UK wholesale gas and electricity markets. [The Treasury has published details of that here.] Measures to increase energy supply Learning from the mistakes of the past, the government is taking action to accelerate domestic energy supply, increase our energy resilience and achieve our ambition to make the UK an energy exporter by 2040: Launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, expected to lead to over 100 new licences. Lift the moratorium on UK shale gas production. This will enable developers to seek planning permission where there is local support, which could get gas flowing in as soon as six months. Drive forward the acceleration of new sources of energy supply from North Sea oil and gas to clean energy like nuclear, wind and solar. Continue progressing up to 24GW of nuclear by 2050, with Great British Nuclear helping to set direction of getting new nuclear projects online in the UK. In the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, has just interrupted Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, who is delivering a speech in the debate, to comment on an announcement from Buckingham Palace. Hoyle is referring to this. Hoyle says: I know I speak on behalf of the entire house when I say that we send our best wishes to Her Majesty the Queen, and that she and her family are in our thoughts and prayers at this moment. He says he is not going to say any more at this point. My colleague Caroline Davies’s story about the Queen is here. Starmer says fracking and a dash for gas in the North Sea will not cut bills or strengthen energy security. And he says Truss should remember what Kwasi Kwarteng said about fracking in an article for the Mail on Sunday earlier this year. Kwarteng wrote: Even if we lifted the fracking moratorium tomorrow, it would take up to a decade to extract sufficient volumes – and it would come at a high cost for communities and our precious countryside. Second, no amount of shale gas from hundreds of wells dotted across rural England would be enough to lower the European price any time soon. And with the best will in the world, private companies are not going to sell the shale gas they produce to UK consumers below the market price. They are not charities, after all. He also says Kwarteng’s own department produced a Q&amp;A saying future extraction from the North Sea would not “materially impact on the global price of gas”. He ends by saying the UK needs a fresh start, not the fourth Tory leader in six years. Theresa May, the former Conservative PM, intervenes, and asks Starmer why no new nuclear power stations were build under Labour. Starmer says he remembers Tony Blair declaring his support for nuclear, and mocking David Cameron for being able to say what his policy was. Doubtless Starmer “remembers” this because the clip has been widely circulated on social media recently. Starmer says Labour did approve new nuclear power stations in 2009. But they were never build after the Tories too power, he says. Starmer says the government banned onshore wind in 2015. That cost the UK the equivalent of the energy it imported from Russia. That was a “policy disaster”, he says. And he says Truss has consistently opposed solar energy. When she was environment secretary she cut subsidies for solar, and the market crashed, he says. Keir Starmer is speaking now. He says Labour called for a price freeze earlier in the summer, and was criticised for doing so. He says he is pleased there is action being taken today. But the key question is will pay for this. The energy companies are making £170bn in windfall profits over the next two years, he says. He says Labour wants to tax this, but Li Truss is opposed. He goes on: Every pound the government refuses to raise in windfall taxes … is a pound of extra borrowing. It’s that simple. This is what Liz Truss has announced. A typical household will save on average £1,000 a year from her two-year energy price guarantee, she claims. An average energy bill for a typical household will be no more than £2,500 a year for the next two years from 1 October under the plan. This figure takes account of the removal of green levies (worth around £150 per household) and it will supersede the existing energy price cap. The policy applies to households in Britain, but in Northern Ireland (where the energy regime is different) households will get the same amount of support. Households who do not pay direct for gas or electricity from the mains will receive support from a fund, and will be no worse off, Truss says. Businesses will get equivalent support, under a scheme lasting six months. After this there will be ongoing support, particularly for vulnerable industries. The package is expected to reduce inflation by up to 5 percentage points from where it otherwise would have been. Truss says that for too long the government has ignored the need for energy security. She says she will address this. She wants to make the UK a net energy exporter by 2040, she says. That’s it. She has finished. Truss says that, to improve long-term energy security, she is announcing two reviews. First, there will be a review of energy regulation. And, second, there will be a review of how the government can reach net zero “in a way that is pro-business and pro-growth”. She says this will be led by Chris Skidmore. Skidmore, a former energy minister, is one of the Tory MPs most committed to net zero. In response to a question from Sammy Wilson (DUP), Truss says she can assure him that this policy will benefit people in Northern Ireland. Truss announces another plan that she says will curb prices. I’m announcing today that, with the Bank of England, we will set up a new scheme worth up to £40bn to ensure that firms operating in the wholesale energy market have the liquidity they need to manage price volatility. This will stabilise the market and decrease the likelihood that energy retailers need our support like they did last winter. By increasing supply, boosting the economy and increasing liquidity in the market, we will significantly reduce the cost to government of this intervention. In the Commons Truss says today’s intervention will curb inflation by up to five percentage points. This will cut the cost of servicing government debt, she says. The written ministerial statement is now available online. It is from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business secretary, and it is here. This is what it says: HM Government is acting to protect British households from the spiralling costs of energy. The Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) which will give people certainty with their bills. The EPG will apply from 1 October and will discount the unit cost for gas and electricity use. This guarantee, which includes the temporary suspension of green levies, means that from the 1st October a typical household will pay no more than £2500 per year for each of the next two years. This will save the typical household £1000 a year. It comes in addition to the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme. The scheme will start on the 1st October 2022, when Ofgem’s new price cap is due to come into effect. Cost projections for the delivery of the EPG are uncertain as they depend upon usage levels (which are highly dependent on weather patterns) and, for future three-month periods, the wholesale price of energy. The new guarantee will apply to households in Great Britain, with the same level of support made available to households in Northern Ireland. HM Government will also support all business, charities and public sector organisations with their energy costs this winter, offering an equivalent guarantee for six months. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will set out the expected costs as part of the fiscal statement later this month. Truss is now talking about how they might “defray” the costs of this. First of all, the government will do this by ramping up supply. A new energy supply taskforce has been set up. They are negotiating new contracts with electricity and gas suppliers. The government will also launch a new licensing round for North Sea extraction, which could lead to more than 100 new licences being awarded. She says providers will move to contracts for difference, so that they price they get is not pegged to gas. This will further bring down costs, she says. (See 10.09am.) Richard Burgon (Lab) says the government can do better than this. Why is Truss putting profits ahead of people? Truss says she is doing the important work to help people get through this winter and the next winter, while fixing the energy supply problems. She goes on: This is the moment to be bold. We are facing a global energy crisis and there are no cost-free options. John Redwood (Con) says we are too short of energy, but have too many taxes. If we have too many taxes, we will have less supply of the things we are taxing, he says. Truss says Redwood has made a good point. She goes on: The reality is that we can’t tax our way to growth. Truss says she recognises that people are worried. That is why she has brought forward this debate. Emergency legislation will be brought forward to deliver the policy. Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, will give details of the costs when he makes a fiscal statement later this month. But Truss says she will not accept Labour’s call for a windfall tax. The written ministerial statement setting out this plan should be available here, but it isn’t. Some MPs are angry about not being able to read the details. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says copies are being printed out by the vote office now. He seems furious. Truss says her plan means a typical household will pay no more than £2,500 a year for energy for the next two years from October. A typical household will save on average £1,000 a year from her two-year energy price guarantee, she claims. An average energy bill for a typical household will be no more than £2,500 a year for the next two years from 1 October under the plan. This figure takes account of the removal of green levies (worth around £150 per household) and it will supersede the existing energy price cap. Liz Truss is about to open the debate. But Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts by complaining that the written ministerial statement setting out the plan was not published earlier. It is only just available, he says. This is discourteous to the house, he says. The new version of the register of members’ interests also clarifies who paid for Boris Johnson’s recent party to celebrate his wedding last year. It was held at the mansion owned by the JCB chair and Tory donor Anthony Bamford, and Bamford donated the equivalent of almost £24,000, it says. The declaration reads: Name of donor: Lord Anthony and Lady Carole Bamford For my wedding celebration, hire of Marquee; portaloos; catering; waiting staff; flowers; ice cream van; smoke and braai; total value £23,853. According to George Grylls from the Times, the biggest single donation to Liz Truss’s leadership campaign came from the wife of a BP executive. In the Commons Penny Mordaunt, the new leader of the Commons is still taking business questions. But she is expected to wrap up soon, within the next few minutes. When she finishes, Liz Truss will deliver her statement on her energy bills package, which will take the form of a speech opening a general debate on energy costs. Swing voters have reacted warmly to Liz Truss, according to the results of a focus group conducted by James Johnson, a pollster who used to work in Downing Street for Theresa May. The House of Commons has published its latest updated version of the register of members’ interests, and it includes details of who donated to Liz Truss’s campaign for the Tory leadership. Until now she had not released those names. The full details are here. I’ll post more on it soon. This is from the Labour MP Chris Bryant, replying to what Simon Clarke said on the Today programme this morning. Although Liz Truss is sticking to her opposition to a further windfall tax on energy companies, in most respects her announcement today marks a huge shift from the ideological stance she was taking on energy bills earlier this summer. A small state libertarian, she insisted that the best way to help people with rising prices was through tax cuts, rather than Rishi Sunak-style government intervention. “The way I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts,” she told the Financial Times in early August. From what we know of the announcement coming later, she will not be offering cash handouts to households. But she will be putting a limit on the amount bills can rise through handouts to energy companies, which will have a similar effect. This has alarmed some of her libertarian allies. On Sunday Mark Littlewood, who runs the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) thinktank and who has been a friend of Truss’s since they were fellow Liberal Democrats at Oxford, wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph saying she was the last person who would want to fix a price for energy. He said: As a convinced market liberal, [Truss] will recoil at the idea that more state involvement is the best strategy to deal with any given problem. Her approach to date on the energy crisis is a classic example of this. Whilst politicians of all stripes seem to want the government to take even more action to fix the price of energy, Truss’s starting position would be to allow the price mechanism to operate freely and then consider how one might mitigate the effects. She would rather offset the soaring price of utility bills through meaningful tax cuts, than appoint a central committee to pronounce on the exact price we should all be paying per kilowatt hour. That didn’t age well, and last night the IEA issued a press release criticsing the plan being announced today. Andy Mayer, energy analyst at the thinktank, said: Targeted welfare and tax cuts are better than price freezes. The expected energy price freeze, which will limit typical bills to between £2-2,500, is estimated to cost between £90-£170bn. It would be better and cheaper to focus on targeted welfare and tax cuts. Price controls don’t work. By suppressing the price signal and subsidising energy use, more energy will be used, inefficiently, prolonging the crisis, and limiting investment in energy saving. According to the BBC, the government is considering a plan to change the way energy companies are paid for electricity generated from sources other than gas. At the moment prices are pegged to the price of gas, which has led to producers generating energy from nuclear, or renewables, making soaring profits on the back of rising international gas prices. The idea is backed by the industry body Energy UK, which explains it in a briefing here. My colleague Alex Lawson explains what is proposed in a story here. In his interview on the Today programme, Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, claimed this would be “terrible” for consumers. He explained: This is a proposal from Energy UK, and let’s be clear about this proposal: This would lock in massive windfall profits for these electricity generators. Let me explain why: what Energy UK have said is we’ll accept slightly lower prices now, so we can have much higher prices over the following 15 years. This would be a terrible deal for the British people, a terrible deal for billpayers. It is much better - if there are these unexpected windfalls, and there are - the right thing to do, the fair thing to do, is not to do some dodgy deal with these companies, but to do a windfall tax. In an interview with Times Radio Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, also criticised the appointment of Jacob Rees-Mogg as business secretary because of his approach to the climate crisis and net zero. He said: Jacob Rees-Mogg has a record, which deeply disturbs me … He has questioned the science of climate change. Now, that’s not just bad in relation to climate change or the climate emergency; it is but if we’re going to lower energy bills, there is one overriding thing we’ve got to do - which is get off fossil fuels. All this nonsense about lifting the ban on fracking. That’s not a solution to this problem. Because fracking, the fracked gas, even if it isn’t dangerous, will cost exactly the same as the gas we’re currently importing. There’s only one way out of this, which is renewables, nuclear, offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, which Jacob Rees Mogg, I fear has set his face against. And here are some more lines from what Simon Clarke, the new levelling up secretary, said on his morning broadcast round. Clarke defended the government’s decision to act on the grounds that the economy would suffer “enormous damage” if it did nothing. Liz Truss is instinctively a small state Tory, and during the Tory leadership campaign she criticised what she described as Gordon Brown-style government interventions. But Clarke, one of her closest allies, said on this occasion a big intervention was essential. He said: If we fail to act, if we don’t protect the economy against the shock of the size and scale we are talking about, then there is going to be enormous damage. In these circumstances I think the country will say and I think markets will respect that this is the most sensible thing to do. The government is clear that a fiscally responsible approach sits at the heart of our plans but we cannot fail to respond to the magnitude of the moment. He said the plan announced today would provide certainty “in the medium term”, and would not just be a “sticking plaster” solution. He said: We are not looking here at sticking plaster solutions. We want a lasting settlement that provides both comfort and clarity for both households and businesses. This is a major attempt to draw a line and provide energy certainty for everybody in this country about energy usage in the medium term. He rejected suggestions that the increase in borrowing being announced today would be excessive, or that it would alarm the financial markets. He said: If you look at the UK’s most recent round of debt issuance, that was well-covered. There was much more demand for our debt than was needed to cover the latest auction. We are paying around three per cent for our debt. That is a perfectly sustainable level. The UK is obviously a very stable, very strong economy, subject to a very clear regulatory system and the rule of law. We are a safe bet and a safe haven as we always are, frankly, in these kind of situations. He came close to confirming that Truss will announce an end to the ban on fracking today – but he stressed that this was not a “miracle solution” to the energy supply crisis. Simon Clarke, the new levelling up secretary, was on the morning interview round on behalf of the government this morning. Echoing what his boss said at PMQs yesterday, he said imposing a new windfall tax on energy companies would be a mistake. He told LBC: These firms are the people we are going to be absolutely relying on to deliver that next generation of oil and gas extraction on the route to energy self-sufficiency. We need to go much, much further in getting new fields on line. That is why we need these companies to be ploughing that investment into the North Sea. We cannot do what Labour would do, which is just tax, tax, tax. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, was also on the Today programme this morning where he restated Labour’s call for a windfall tax to be used to part fund a rescue pacakge for energy bills. He said the government’s argument that this would deter investment was “bogus”. And he said Truss’s decision to rule out the idea showed the government had shifted to the right. He said: This investment argument is completely bogus; that it would have a damaging effect on business. Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, says it wouldn’t have a damaging effect. This is a dogma, and I’m afraid we see a pattern here. This is a shift to the right by the Conservative party under Liz Truss. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak actually eventually ended up agreeing with our idea of a windfall tax. Now we have a government that is setting its face against it purely on the basis of dogma. Good morning. Liz Truss has been prime minister for less than 48 hours, but she is about to make an announcement that could define her premiership. If her plan to prevent energy bills soaring backfires or crashes, then it is hard to see how she recovers. But if it gets a positive reception, then Truss, whose ratings with the public at large are very poor, and her party, which is trailing badly behind Labour in the polls, could be on a path to recovery. Here is our overnight splash setting out what we are expecting. And here is an analysis from my colleague Archie Bland, who has examined the plan in his First Edition briefing. This morning Labour has renewed its attack on Truss for failing to considing using a windfall tax to part fund the energy rescue package. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, told the BBC: We know from the Treasury that there are £170bn of excess profits being made by the energy companies. We believe a windfall tax must be part of the solution to that, that is the fair thing to do, that is the right thing to do. I am afraid that Liz Truss is making a terrible mistake by setting her face against that, because in the end, higher borrowing will have to be paid for somehow and it will end up falling back on the British people, and she’s leaving money on the table that these companies are making. But there was a much more encouraging response for Truss from Martin Lewis, the consumer champion and founder of the MoneySavingExpert website. Lewis is the go-to expert on consumer issues – the equivalent of John Curtice on elections, or Paul Johnson on the IFS on budgets – and he has been described as one of the most trusted men in Britain. An endorsement from him really counts, and on the Today programme this morning he gave a qualified welcome to what Truss is doing. He said: I have said we have a catastophe coming in winter. By January we expect to see the [energy] price cap to be 120% higher than it is right now, more than double. And my great call has always been that we need to have political will to do something. Well, I think we do now have the political will. And I very much welcome the plans that are being rumoured to come out today. They are not perfect. Then again, I’ve not seen any solution that’s perfect. They are not the panacea. But they will meet millions, if not tens of millions of people, will breathe a sigh of relief that will be they will be able to afford their energy bills this winter. But clearly there will need to be some further work done looking at the very poorest in society to make sure that they can get through this. We need clarification on whether the remaining payments on benefits, the payments for those disabilities that were planned and announced in May, are still going to come through. But I think we have to be fair here. And as someone who has has been begging and pleading that more help comes out, well, this is more help. The great benefits of this policy is that it helps everyone. The great problem with this policy is that it helps everyone. It means wealthy people like me also get our bills cut. But, absolutely big picture, I think we need to welcome that something is being done, and that the political will has changed. I will be focusing almost exclusively on the Truss announcement today. It will come after 11.15am, when Truss will unveil the plan in a speeech in the Commons opening a general debate on energy costs. Unusually, she has chosen to make the announcement in this format rather than through a normal ministerial statement – which would have required her to answer questions about her plans for more than an hour. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow.

The prime minister’s sprawling address to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) was accused of lacking seriousness and professionalism. Johnson lost his place during the speech and spent 20 seconds repeating “forgive me” as he shuffled the printed pages on his podium. Some hoped the speech would be a chance for Johnson to announce proper policy in the pursuit of his “levelling up” agenda. However, the speech at the Port of Tyne near South Shields only contained an announcement about changing building regulations to ensure all new homes and buildings in England have electric vehicle charging points installed from next year. One of Johnson’s lengthier tangents was about his recent trip to Hampshire’s Peppa Pig World – an amusement park dedicated to a children’s cartoon character, which he opined on in an apparent dig at civil servants and the BBC. He said that “the true driver of growth is not the government”, but the private sector, whose energy and originality the prime minister praised. To illustrate this, he explained: “Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World. Hands up if you’ve been to Peppa Pig World! “I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass transit systems. Even if they’re a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.” Johnson explained that the “real lesson” he learned on the visit was that the popularity of the main character – who he said resembled a “Picasso-like hairdryer” – was evidence of “the power of UK creativity”. Johnson said the TV show “was rejected by the BBC and has now been exported to 180 countries” and now worth £6bn. “I think that is pure genius, don’t you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant, would conceivably have come up with Peppa.” Johnson also imitated the sound of an accelerating car with grunts that the official Downing Street release transcribed as “arum arum aaaaaaaaag”. He also compared himself to Moses over his plan to help business invest in tackling climate change. The prime minister said: “I said to my officials the new 10 commandments were that ‘Thou shalt develop industries like offshore wind, hydrogen, nuclear power and carbon capture.’” However, senior business figures and some Tory MPs were deeply unimpressed. One senior backbencher said it was a “mess”, while another told the Guardian: “I thought today’s performance was the most embarrassing by a Conservative prime minister since last week’s PMQs. Someone needs to get a grip. He is losing the confidence of the party.” Juergen Maier, vice-chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership and a former chief executive of Siemens, told the Guardian it was a “failed speech”. He said the speech was a “massive opportunity” after an absence of detail about levelling up in recent months. But he said: “It was a flop. It was a ramble. There was lots of disjointed initiatives, some that obviously had no relevance at all … As a businessperson passionate about reindustrialising the north, it was just a huge disappointment.” Kitty Ussher, of business leaders’ group the Institute of Directors, said Johnson’s speech offered little to inspire confidence and was “inappropriate” in places. “What business leaders want more than anything is a calm and reassuring macroeconomic environment that gives them the confidence to invest for the future. We haven’t seen much of that in the reporting of the prime minister’s speech.” Two other business figures who were in the audience for the speech said they were surprised by Johnson’s promotion of Peppa Pig World, which is located more than 300 miles from the Port of Tyne where the speech was held. “It was interesting that he asked a group of business leaders in the north-east if they have travelled six hours down the road to Peppa Pig World and then talk about levelling up,” said Michael Stirrup, chief executive of IT consultancy Waterstons. “It shows a bit of a lack of understanding, I think.” “I wasn’t expecting a Peppa Pig reference,” said Neil Whittaker, director of marketing and communications at national training firm Learning Curve Group. “He seemed to lose his way quite a bit.” The GMB union described the speech as “hogwash”. Labour called it “shambolic” and proof of how unseriously Johnson takes business. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, commented: “No one was laughing, because the joke’s not funny any more.” Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said businesses needed clarity, but all they got was “rambling” from Johnson. He added: “The prime minister famously said he was going to ‘F’ business – the least he could do is to deliver a decent F-ing speech.” The prime minister was reported in 2018 to have said “fuck business” when questioned about the sector’s concerns over a no-deal Brexit. After the speech, Johnson was asked if he was OK by a journalist. The prime minister defended his performance, saying: “I think that people got the vast majority of the points I wanted to make, and I thought it went over well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
